<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search to make sure this had not really been covered... and I know there are those that will search long and hard to make sure... and those that will criticize..so flame away..But.. The thread asking about our innocence in gaming, got me to thinking about my first forays into the lands of Everquest.<br />
<br />
Growing up in Everfrost, and making it out to the South Wall the first time, only to be killed, time...and time again, by the Orc Shaman...(got my revenge over and over later on)<br />
<br />
Finding my way blindly thru the tunnel to Blackburrow...the first few times, getting so turned around in there, I ended up back in EF, only to start all over again.<br />
<br />
The LONG LONG run across West Karana to NK...that one made me feel like I had actually accomplished something.<br />
<br />
Completing the first quest for Totemic Armor.... I had made it out into Lake Rathe, and was lev'd over the water , just exploring.  I forgot, that on my pointer, was my Mythril Breast plate.  I forget now, why it was there.  Well, needless to say, my mouse decided to act up, and by the time it was working again, my BP was on the bottom of Lake Rathe, and after searching and searching, I finally gave up.  I think most of my guild had pee'd their pants several times over while laughing at me as I explained what happened.<br />
<br />
My very first foray into Fear.  Barely into 48....my heart was pounding as I zoned in invis, trying to find where everyone else ran to.<br />
<br />
Winning my first piece of armor from Hate.  The only thing I never got from Hate, was the BP.<br />
<br />
The Hell levels.  Before I really hit them, I can remember out in EF, at the South Wall, dying 17 times in level 16...Then level 36 hit.  I dang near gave up ever getting out of that level.  In the space of 24 hours, I died 12 times.  Nothing I did was right.  When I dinged 37, after some help from some good friends, I think I went out and got drunk in real life to celebrate.  <br />
<br />
I have to admit, that when it came to dungeons, I was the biggest sissy of them all.  Scared to death of dying, getting lost, falling... and needless to say, my sense of direction was lousy, even with SH.  And dont' even get me started on /loc<br />
<br />
This is my 3rd computer since I started playing EQ.  I won't be upgrading for a while as this one is a 2.5 P4... as a matter of fact, I have 2 now.  I started EQ on a 256 P1 with 64mg of memory, and cheapy video card. <br />
<br />
<br />
Man oh man, how far have we come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember running my level 2 Gnome wizzy from akanon to qeynos to meet up with some friends that wanted to start there with a human and half-elf.  This was in the first days of release, so there was no one high enough level to bind me, so I had to make sure not to die.  He's still around - level 36 I think.<br />
<br />
I remember getting lost in GFay back before there were path textures with my wood elf bard.<br />
<br />
I remember everyone screaming about trains in blackburrow, because everyone was a n00b, and those trains were monstrous.<br />
<br />
I remember the pottery sketch goof by Verant that made a lot of plat for a lot of people overnight.<br />
<br />
I remember at about level 9 meeting up with a friend who had absolutely no sense of direction in the world of Norrath, but insisted on playing a ranger.  We called him &quot;wrong way&quot; and followed his tracking anyway, because it led to some really fun, scary, deadly encounters.<br />
<br />
I remember playing over dial-up, trying out multi-link to boost my bandwidth so I could surf AND play EQ.  I've gone from a P2 133MHz, 32Mb RAM to a P4 3GHz, 1Gb RAM and use DSL now.<br />

What's scary is my trader in the bazaar is getting close to 1 full year online.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">(laughs) I think, after maybe more than a dozen attempts in the tunnel to Blackburrow, I found out about the lantern's totally by accident.  I smacked my head against the wall there a few times when I saw that.<br />
<br />
The first time I wandered thru Eastern Wastes.  The graphics then just totally amazed me.  THEN!...<br />
<br />
The first time I hunted in Eastern Wastes not long after Velious came out, I was with a group near the Fort.  Well, someone spawned all the giants, and we took off in all different directions.  Back then, I was so directionally challenged, even with my SH bar showing me East.. someone shouted out to watch out for the ravine leading to Kael.  I shouted back, &quot;Where is it?&quot;  And I had no sooner shouted that, when I started falling.  Dammed if I didnt' try to scramble back up that wall.  Before I hit, I managed to shout back, &quot;NM, I seem to have found it!&quot; before I got the message that I'd been hit for 10k pts and was dead.<br />
<br />
The first time I tried a boat ride, I got on the wrong one, heading in the wrong direction.  And was talking to my group, bemoaning the fact that I'd meet them there, etc., etc.  TOTALLY forgetting that I had bound there on the docks, and that I could have jumped off the boat, memmed gate, and gone back to meet my group.  <br />
<br />
I earned the nickname, The Blonde Shaman....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The LONG LONG run across West Karana to NK...that one made me feel like I had actually accomplished something.<br />
<br />
Basically one of my earliest memories, and at least most exhilirating (yes, I know, how pathetic).  I was always scared of the werewolf or the bandits and basically everything else out there that I didn't know about, especially at night.  Of course, now I know that it was nothing, but when I was a true newbie, it was definitely intimidating.<br />
<br />
I remember my first trip into West Karana and it was like a whole new world.  A guy I hunted with took me there and basically was showing me around, and I remember running towards a treant that was wandering by, and I had seen nothing even close to as big as that.  I also remember his response when he saw me doing that: &quot;You don't want none of that treant!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then I get lost somewhere in the hills and ended up zoning back and forth between NK and WK and finally gating because I got scared of being lost even worse than I was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was roughly lvl 15 or so, and had just joined my first guild (which had mainly good races).  My first big guild raid, can't remember exactly where, but it was before PoK so druid porting was how you got around.  We ported into Surefall Glade.  The druid who ported me wasn't used to escorting around evil characters and didn't invis me and I assumed (foolishly) that the druid portal would be safe.  Needless to say, I had about half a dozen druids chasing me saying &quot;Time to die, Ougabouga&quot;<br />
<br />
For months I had a map printed of Surefall Glade pinned on the wall next to my computer, with red marker saying &quot;Stay out!! Druids kill Ogres!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

   <br />
  Zoning into Nk because he was going to log on his wizard alt to port me to gfay. Watching Him  kill lions that were chasing me. Than meeting my first Griffon and becoming lunch. <br />

Hehe was an interesting beginning to my First warrior. <br />
<br />
I should of learned but i went back to him at lvl 20 long time later. My connection at the time was really bad and my char would be in game a bit before i was. I took boat ride into TD and fell off the boat and went LD after swimming helplessly for awhile. Logged back in and by the time i was actually in game i had drown. I was bound in NK at the gypsy camp and popped right up into Swarm Mother when the Karna's where Green and plagued. Found out what my first death loop was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember lots of long runs across WK.  My first one was with a dorf cleric, my first toon.  A kind wizard ported me from Gfay to WK so I could play with my friends who mostly started in Qeynos.  I had no SoW but he threw an invis on me, and I ran it... I was terrified looking at the big red-con spiders (I was level 2 or 3 or I think)... my Sense Heading didn't work well so he had to point me the way to Qeynos.<br />
<br />
I remember when my bard was little... at level 9 he was a Qeynos baby.  The level 8 lull song was only available in Kelethin.  At that level with a store-bought drum, Selo's is really no faster than a SoW.  I had to run the whole thing without a bind (there were no soulbinders, no Luclin spires, no PoK books), having to wait for that stupid buggy boat to cross the Ocean of Tears (mad Fishing skillups)... then ran back to Qeynos again.  The whole trip took me 2 full nights of play.  A far cry from clicking on a PoK book and running to the library, lol.  The world was a lot bigger back then, in spite of having half the number of zones it does now.<br />
<br />
I remember questing Totemic because it was damn good at the time. :p<br />
<br />
I remember getting so lost in Everfrost as a newb shaman trying to get to Blackburrow that I ended up at the ice giants.  That was an interesting CR, since I had no idea where the hell my body was. :)<br />
<br />
Good times. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Selling my first 10 dose sow potion in EC tunnel and running all the way back to Halas to make another because I only had enough money to make the 1 10 shot. Then running back to EC tunnel to try to sell the 2 I just made.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got into EQ this past summer after one of my best friends had urged, propped, threatened, blackmailed, teased, bribed and wore me down into playing it.  He (monk) and another friend (Beastie) had started characters on Stromm to enjoy the n00biness of it all so I started my Shaman Froglock there.  Gukta was huge. Innothule was even bigger and scarier. I still kill rogue froggies in there just on principle.<br />
<br />
I remember my first venture into Upper Guk and the undead Frogs, getting lost, and being completely nerve frazzled by the time I got out of there with the ground spawn I needed.<br />
<br />
My first venture into SRo for another ground spawn on the same quest.  Lots of big critters over there.<br />
<br />
Unrest. Lived there for many levels. Made many firends. Finally killed the Ghost!<br />
<br />
Seeing giants for the first time.<br />
<br />
Getting SOW and being 'da man' for my monk and beastie friends.<br />
<br />
My first group buff. woot!<br />
<br />
My monk friend soon returned to his Pally on TT and invited me to play one of his alts, an Ogre Shammy about 6 levels higher than my froggie.  I still go back to Stromm every once in a while just to get that feeling again. Grymauch was never PL'ed or twinked and I get more satisfaction out of playing him as a straight caster than I do out of playing Zugarbok who can tank, has a drog, and is several levels higher with nice spells.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I wasn't PL'ed when I first started as many have been.  There's something to be said about all those n00b quests and your first set of armor and shield. Zug's fun and has gone places Grym might never see but Grym is ultimately satisfying and I'm more proud of him than of any character I've ever played since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">With my first character, a Euridite Enchanter, drowning while waiting for the boat, dying from multiply shark bites while waiting for the boat, logging off in frustration while waiting for the boat so my friend could retrieve my corpse (which was lost under the world and for some reasons GMs could summon or didn't want to bother with a level 1 character).<br />
<br />
Fighting Fippy (Flippy, whatever that little gnolls name was in Qeynos) with my monk and beating him (he was either yellow or even con at the time and EVERYONE would try and jump him when he did his run)<br />
<br />
Leaving Grobb with my level 1 warrior and killing a yellow con Kobald (I was thinking the corpse run wouldn't be far but I whupped him).<br />
<br />
Running through Kithicor at night when my friend who had been in the game a long time said I would end up dead.  I usually sent him a tell AFTER I had made it through.  I don't think I ever died in Kith until my fifth or sixth run through at night.<br />
<br />
Casting a spell on a wolf after zoning into Qeynos Hills and wondering who the hell Holly was and why she had killed me. (I scrolled back and just caught my friend telling me NOT to attack before my LOADING PLEASE WAIT message).<br />
<br />
Finding the trap in Blackburrow, the one in the tree.<br />
<br />
In Blackburrow, finding out that disease rat was MUCH stronger than my lowly Paladin.  And so was that bear.<br />
<br />
Finding out the Vengeful Soloist WASN'T a normal decayed skeleton and he could run pretty stinking fast.  Then, a few levels later beating all the 'Vengefuls' (I make it a habit of killing them if I see them now).<br />
<br />
So many more and this was from years ago when the game was still young.</div></div><hr />

Stories of my brother when he first started EQ:<br />
*His first 5 minutes of play*<br />
He thought that say was for talking to someone near you and /shout was for if they were a bit farther away, didnt know it went zone wide :)<br />
Theris shouts &quot;Hey Ryan do I want to join this guys guild?&quot;<br />
You tell Theris &quot;Yeah that's Eric he's inviting you to our guild&quot;<br />
Theris shouts &quot;Hey did mom call you? She said she needed to talk to you..&quot;<br />
You tell Theris &quot;Okay it was funny for a bit... use /tell&quot;<br />
Theris tells you &quot;OH is that how you are talking directly to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
*He's level 9*<br />
Theris tells you &quot;HEY I just made 100pp!!!!!!&quot;<br />
You tell Theris &quot;Wow what did you sell?&quot;<br />
Theris tells you &quot;I was tearing stuff up in Befallen and some dude dropped a crappy Platinum Ring or something so I sold it to some schmuk that wanted it!&quot;<br />
You tell Theris &quot;It goes for over 5k&quot;<br />
Theris tells you &quot;Fcuk&quot;<br />
<br />
*He's level 50*<br />
Running through EJ to CoM<br />
Theris tells you &quot;Man I dont like this place... these Gorillas are kinda scary lookin.  GAH I&quot;M GETTING HIT!!!!!&quot;<br />
You tell Theris &quot;Dude you are a lvl 50 Necro with Sow... run away and FD / Fear / Snare or just ignore it and keep running, they are green to you&quot;<br />
Theris tells you &quot;Damn I died, I was so confused I didnt know what to do&quot;<br />
<br />
*He's lvl 65*<br />
Running through EJ <br />
Theris tells you &quot;I think I'm the only lvl 65 necro in this game that is afraid of EJ to this day.... damn do I hate this zone.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
To this day I tell everyone about him selling the Paw's Plat Ring for 100pp and how he's still scared of EJ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">~chuckles~ I almost forgot the creature in Lake Rathe.<br />
<br />
I remember hearing the stories of the creature (long after he was removed from EQ) and the group I was in having to cross the lake.  We actually spent about an hour trying to get all six of us into the two rowboats and getting the steering figured out to get all of us from the dock to SK to the dock to RM.<br />
<br />
That was an adventure all in itself, and a blast to do at the time.<br />

<br />
That's not too unusual for bazaar mules. Lots of people probably have inflated played times from leaving their characters up overnight in the bazaar. I think my warrior (about 1 year old character) has twice as much played time as my ranger (almost 4 year old character), because I used to use the warrior as my bazaar trader. Neither of them are anywhere close to my shaman though, and he has never been a trader.<br />

Had about 200 days played when I hit level 60 (just prior to Luclin release - yeah, I'm a slow leveler). Only 60 days played since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Few that havent been posted that stick out in my mind.  My very first char was a mage.  I was completly amazed when i found out i could gate, and make my self invisible.<br />
<br />
On my second character, first one past 20, was my monk.  Fondest memory was getting FD.  I remember zigzagging through kith at night, shouting, nothing can kill me! Wouldnt ya know i got HTed and i lived with like 10hp's left.  I was so excited to be a monk haha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The first time I killed Bunk Odon, Tal Godin, Fandl Arathin, Gwynn Marthank and Hogas Durmas, the nasty Froglok assisting paladins/nobles/whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">- frantically swimming in lake rathe sure that there was a lake monster.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh yes. I was convinced there was one and was terrified everytime I got near the water back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zarlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Heh this thread brings back some good memories of EQ.  I remember the dangerous trek of an Iksar Shaman running from Cabilis to Qeynos just to meet up with some friends from work,  these new Iksar have it way to easy, PoK pfffffff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I remember Twoflower, my main, at level 4, running from EF through BB to get to Qeynos to meet up with Auleishan, my RL wife's human warrior.  Fortunately I knew BB pretty well from my experience with my lvl 12 ranger, but with only a candle for light and virtually no gear it was a pretty scary run.<br />
<br />
Lucky for me that at the time BB was heavily camped and there wasn't much up in the gnoll caves on the EF side.<br />
<br />
I also remember trying to complete the bard mail quest to HHK with three of us at level 13 (!).  I figured the previous mail quest, to Surefall, was pretty easy, so this one must be ok for a level 13.  Well, we died deep in NK and the corpse run took forever.  Then like idiots we kept going.  Zoned into HHP, took about three steps, and had a red-con gnoll shaman on us.  Took the help of a level 23 druid (uber!) to drag our corpses out.  We had never heard of a rez at that point.<br />
<br />
Running through the spiders in FV at level 17 and zoning into LOIO, heart pounding and sweaty palms, then discovering that LOIO was basically paradise for that level.  Had to create an Iksar mule to go buy food, though, didn't make the run back to FV until level 25.<br />
<br />
Realizing in Karnor's Castle that some of the friends I'd made growing up in EQ just... weren't all that good at playing their characters.  Outdoor levelling is one thing, dealing with trains, adds, runners, unexpected situations in KC was completely different.  For me, the 40's were the defining levels for figuring out who could REALLY play their characters.  BTW I firmly believe that a solid dose of soloing gave me a good solid foundation for dungeon grinding.  One add when soloing is like a whole train when in a group.  You learn when you can deal with it, when you have to cut and run, and when to just die in a good place :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Being born in beta as a human ranger in Surefall Glade, seeing the incredible river, druid and ranger buildings, and the cave structure behind the breathtaking waterfalls, and falling in love with EQ.<br />
<br />
Running my monk to Oasis, finding a pickup group to go to Upper Guk so we could hunt for mesh armor.  I met a good monk friend, Smidge, that way.  He's long gone, but a good memory.<br />
<br />
With that same monk, nearly getting killed by someone else's mummy in North Ro, barely killing him off and getting the dreaded rabies in the process, and finding out later that the sword he dropped was BRONZE, and was worth over 2PP.  That was an enourmous amount of money for me.<br />
<br />
Losing my level 6 human (and therefore blind as a bat) ranger's corpse in beta IV, and running around W Karana in desperation trying to find it.  Finally found it with a huge sigh of relief and happily looted all my cloth armor :)<br />
<br />
Hearing about my buddy's half-elf druid who wondered what was in that hollow tree in Blackburrow.<br />
<br />
Sitting in a pickup group in Runnyeye, having our group kill the mob that dropped a very uber-at-the-time black bastardsword, and having the cleric take it and then leave, even though we had a warrior in the group :(<br />
<br />
Filling up my monk with red headbands and bronze weapons from the bandits in the Karanas to completely overburdened and making an agonizingly slow run back to Qeynos, selling it all, finishing the red headband quest over and over again for the few pp reward, over and over again, so I could buy a +3int +5str earring for my monk.  <br />
<br />
Getting our entire group pimped by a high-elf WIZARD named Pumple who used us all in Crushbone to help him get the shiny brass shield.   <br />
<br />
When the bracer of battle and screaming mace were uber beyond description.<br />
<br />
Dinging 25 with my human monk (only humans could be monks then) in E Karana on crag spiders, and being so excited that I got my new combat move (flying kick or something like that).  Being constantly poisoned from hunting those miserable things, and not knowing about bind wound, so regenning 2hp per tick sitting :)<br />
<br />
Seeing a halfing druid kill a hill giant all by himself, and being completely amazed at their power.<br />
<br />
Hunting wisps in W Commonlands LATE into the nights on weekends for the precious and oh-so-rare greater lightstone drop, and then dreaming about that buzzing whisp noise in my sleep.<br />
<br />
Falling through that stupid trap door in Najena into the jail and getting whacked by the guards.  I still don't remember how I ever got my corpse out of there (didn't know I could squeeze through the bars).<br />
<br />
Waffling back and forth over whether to make the enormous time commitment to join the Najena j-boots camp, which had a line to get into the camp, and then the 6-person rotation to wait through for the boots.  No one rolled on them - it was by rotation.  I decided to go to the motocross races instead.  A friend of mine bit the bullet and got his after about a 24-hour straight camp.  I was SOOOOOO jealous.  Stupid motocross race . . . <br />
<br />
Waiting for boats.  and waiting.   and waiting some more.<br />
<br />
Making the terrifying run to Unrest through Dagnor's Cauldron, where everything was RED to me.  Getting to Unrest and finding 60-odd people there.  Back in the day, that was THE place to be in your 20s and early 30s for the precious bronze armor and fine steel weapons, and the unheard-of dwarven work boots, which were worth more than probably half the total gear on all the players in the zone at any one time.<br />
<br />
Getting lucky buying a black pearl for the ridiculously low price of 40pp and finding a jeweler who agreed to try the combine for 200pp (all my money in the world) and getting a brand-spanking-new black pearl platinum necklace (+6 dex +6 agi).  It was considered the uber monk item of its day, due to the tremendous benefits of dexterity and agility.<br />
<br />
Trying to run my level 6 human monk from Qeynos to Freeport, and dying repeatedly in E Karana to lions, and finally giving up on ever getting to Freeport.  We didn't know then that zone-lines were safer, and followed the guide that said to take the road.<br />
<br />
Seeing barbarians running around with lanterns so they could see better, and dreaming of scraping enough money to pay for one for my poor-as-a-church-mouse human ranger.<br />
<br />
Seeing the first character (probably a wood elf ranger, as it was in Butcherblock) with METAL armor, and wondering how in the world he could afford to buy it so quickly from stores.  I had no idea it actually DROPPED from monsters.<br />
<br />
Fighting over bats and rats in Misty Thicket with 100+ other newbies.<br />
<br />
Paying 10pp (my life savings) for a single piece of mesh armor for my monk, which probably had one more raw AC than what I had been wearing before.  But it was TOTALLY worth it :)<br />
<br />
Seeing Lockjaw killed for the first time (not by my group) and being SOOOO jealous of the Lockjaw Tunic winner.<br />
<br />
Being paid a princely sum in beta (a few GOLD) to deliver some food to some hardy adventurers in W Karana, who had ventured out from the safety of Qeynos Hills, and seeing my first giant spider.  I think it ended up killing all of us.  I was truly terrified.<br />
<br />
Running over that bridge in Sol A right at the entrance, visibly shaking at the fear of falling into the lava and being lost forever.<br />
<br />
Being absolutley stunned at the lambent breastplate that my bard friend was given by his guildmaster.  It was an absolutely stunning gesture of generosity at that time - almost unheard of.  <br />
<br />
Realizing that neither of my first two characters, a monk and a druid, had any totemic-armor type quests or temple of Sol Ro quests, and wondering what Verant had against leather wearers.<br />
<br />
Getting whacked by my Qeynos monk guildmasters for hitting 'A' when trying to ask about whAt   . . .<br />
<br />
Hearing about the unbelievably fearsome and dangerous planes of Hate and Fear, when they first opened.  Multiple group wipes, tremendously difficult, almost impossible corpse recoveries, the very toughest game challenge at that time.  To this day, to my disappointment, I've never visited either zone.<br />
<br />
Seeing the first warrior epic, and being so incredibly impressed by those cool glowing blue and red swords.<br />
<br />
Camping Cazic-Thule with pickup groups for a chance at a rubicite drop (never saw a single piece).  CZ would have 100+ people in those days, and the rubi breastplate was rumored to have a regen quality and was therefore valuable beyond measure.<br />
<br />
Getting disease or rabies from miserable mummies in Befallen, and actually sitting and waiting for it to wear off for probably 45 minutes.  I hated asking for things from other players, even something like a disease cure was a major inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Seeing a troll warrior in full rubicite and dual jade maces, and being absolutely STUNNED.<br />
<br />
Seeing Aradune in that funky green armor and flaming sword in Greater Faydark.  Yes, I actually saw him once.  <br />
<br />
Realizing how much mobs hated bards, when my poor bard friend kept getting whacked in our Unrest groups.  He died so much it was almost funny.  <br />
<br />
NO ONE got rezzes, because no one was level 49 and the lower-level partial rezzes wouldn't be introduced for a year or more.  Death sucked, big time.  No ports, no SOW, and no rezzes.  You die, you start running back to your corpse.<br />
<br />
Getting clarity as a monk and thinking it was something I needed.<br />
<br />
Losing my corpse in Greater Faydark and shouting for help finding it, having absolutely no idea where it was.  A kindly bard finally helped me locate it, to my tremendous gratitude and relief.<br />
<br />
When my bard friend got a minotaur axe, and was just kicking the crap out of things with it.<br />
<br />
After Kunark coming out, running (without SOW) my monk to Dalnir's Crypt for that no-drop monk armor (can't remember its name) and maybe a Sarnak Earring of Station.  Getting my friend killed by the Kly when we tried to get back out.  He dropped an ice-comet on us, the first time I'd ever seen that spell cast.<br />
<br />
Being an over-powered, dual-wielding 8/20 fighting baton monk.<br />
<br />
Reading about the seemingly-unfairly-difficult ice comet quest, where wizards had to find runes spread out all over Norath, including one under the ice in Everfrost Peaks, which only spawned on server-ups.<br />
<br />
Seeing my first Fiery Avenger on a high-elven paladin and being extremely impressed.<br />
<br />
Being THRILLED when my beta-ranger's sense heading or *even better yet* forage skill would go up.<br />
<br />
Spending hours fishing for rusty daggers and sandals in beta so I could buy a SHORT SWORD for my beta ranger, which was like one delay better than the RUSTY SHORT SWORD I had been using.  It wiped out my bank completely - probably 4 or 5 pp in Qeynos.  I had to run all the way from Surefall Glade - my home - through Qeynos Hills and into Qeynos to buy it - the first time I'd ever been there.<br />
<br />
Being charmed by that undead skeleton in Qeynos Hills and killing my druid friend and then dying myself after the charm wore off.<br />
<br />
Wondering why the heck people were fighting over Hadden.<br />
<br />
Writing down the text from each NPC I spoke to in Qeynos, and then running all over the Karanas, trying to doing all the <br />
quests they handed out, thinking the rewards would be vast.<br />
<br />
Getting pureed by griffons, griffennes, and griffawns in the Commonlands and Karanas, and HATING Verant for putting such high-level mobs in a newbie zone.<br />
<br />
Doing my monk sash and headband quests, and hoping Verant would soon fix the next quest in line (black, I think - to my knowledge, it was never fixed).<br />
<br />
Camping Aviaks in S Karana for the infinitesimal chance to loot a precious black pearl, and falling out of that stupid birdhouse and dying, even as a monk.  Safefall - who needs that?<br />
<br />
Roaming through these now-empty zones and feeling sadness for days long gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In case you can't tell, my memories of the early days of this game are very fond.  This was, and still can be, a magical game, friends.  Some of us, myself included, lose sight of that from time to time.  Take a step back and look at the world of Norrath.  It's still quite remarkable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>LorriLou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I thought I was so awesome because I found this secret tunnel in EF, and it went on and on and on forever.  Apparently I found the IG's, and tried to run back, but I died.  I had a friend try to come and get me, and the only way I knew to find the way was through that little secret tunnel.<br />
<br />
I remember when Strom was a vendor in EF, and he was SCARY to get to cuz he was so far out in EF.  <br />
<br />
I remember finding the entrance to BB the first time, but having a hard time after that.  EF is so confusing!!<br />
<br />
I remember also finding the trap in the tree in BB.  That was fun...I was the first one of the people I knew who ever found that.<br />
<br />
I remember getting my swimming skill up in the pond between Halas and EF.  <br />
<br />
Ahhh good times.  There is definately something to be said about growing up in this game without a power-level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My favorite was just after I got levitate. I had been waiting what seemed like weeks to get the cash to buy it and level 19 or whatever it was so I could cast it and when I finally did I had it on while running out of the cliffs in EK. Of course I was about a mile up when I reached the plain and my icon started to blink. I think I fizzled twice before I 10k'd that time. Best part was I died to levitate twice more that day and lost half my level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Incredible Eye Candy the first time I saw em:<br />
The wooden bridge from WK to NK is impressive and BIG.  Unusual scenery like this is fun to find and look at.  It would be even better if it were easy to find out more about it (in game) - who built the bridge, why, etc.<br />
<br />
The Ice Giant halls outside permafrost looked good, but didn't belong.  As soon as you zone in, it shrinks down to a gobby cave.  Can you imagine one of the giants crawling in?<br />
<br />
Froon/Choon, Vox/Naggy, Hill/Sand Giants, Giant Spiders, Spectres<br />
<br />
There's actually a lot of Kunark that is really well done visually.  The boats, the dungeons, the statues and crumbling buildings.  Really brought that ancient civilization thing right to you.<br />
<br />
The 'interactive' globe in skyfire - don't stare too long or you'll be eaten :)<br />
<br />
The rise of Norrath over Luclin.  Norrath needs a resolution update now, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Loredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">for some reason, one my first character, i could never find the orc lift at kelethin, no matter how hard i tried, i swear they kept moving it :) <br />
<br />
seeing a sand giant in oasis when i was level 12 or somthing and had wandered over from north ro, ill admit that i screamed like a frightend school girl.<br />
<br />
creeping around in lesser faydark looking for the steamfront mountain zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">One thing i thought of after first posting in this thread. With all the maps i just finally got them all. I been running around and looking at all the old zones and cant believe how off i was in some places trying to get around way back than. <br />
<br />
  Like in everfrost how easy it is to actually get out of halas through the hills into the open area in everfrost. I used to make it so difficult on myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>marlus65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Oh yes those were the days.....<br />
My first char was a High Elf Pali and I thought I was the bomb cus I was gonna be able to fight and cast spells .......how lil did I know.<br />
<br />
The long waits for the boats, and falling off the docks the first time in BB while trying to get on the boat then having to wait for the return trip cus I couldn't make it back up intime to get back on it.<br />
<br />
The long and scary runs from freeport to Blackburrow to see what all the fuss with fighting Gnolls was all about, dieing several times along the way.<br />
<br />
Getting killed by Lockjaw the first time in about 3 hits and thinking why they would put such a huge monster in that zone.<br />
<br />
I still enjoy playing the lil toons, i roll one up now and then and play them till about lvl 15 or so then delete and start over just because its fun to see how we did things back then and how we do things diff now since we have more experience playing......over 4yrs for myself... back in the day when it was still just the original game.<br />
