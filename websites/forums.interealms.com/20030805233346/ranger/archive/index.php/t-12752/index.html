<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SKs won't want to fight him because killing him loses faction with their guildmaster in Echo caverns.<br />
<br />
SKs might be able to help with the pull though and then zone to SH before he dies.<br />
<br />
My primary concern would be that you might not have the tanks to handle him since only the Paladin can really be expected to work that role. You'd be better off finding a 55+ warrior willing to tank, I think.<br />
<br />
As for the pull, use multiple pullers and keep at it til you get him separated from all the adds. Find a spot against a zone wall to pull to and pull him there once he has been separated. Have the MA keep his back to the wall since he procs a nice knockback. If the rest of the raid avoids getting aggro then you can kill him if he stays on the MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cyantune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild needed 2 55+ warriors and 3 clerics in addition to all the other classes as he cannot be slowed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Non-slowable. Took him out 7 times. Has 31,786 HP's exact every spawn.<br />
<br />
Tactics: first you CANT single pull him.<br />
To pull just ahve a monk pull and run halfway FD and let others go all Guildmasters and General will always stay.<br />
When you fight ahve a 60 warrior tank him if possible Good armor key to this is CH. and MEZZES.<br />
First pull and have Chanters mez everything need like 2 or one really good chanter. Once all mezzed keep it mezzed. have the Tank go in with Defensive and get LOTS o AGGRO. once ALMOST gone not when it is when you have liek 109 seconds  bring in all DMG dealers. what for knockback whole zone will help him except greeenies. and just fight it and keep tnak healed. and dmg dealers fighting have ALL casters except chnaters NUKE and ncros lifetap and DoT. Pets are ok completely but not until he is INC. wait til he is down to 90% then send pets nad dont let any taunt nobody taunt except MT. when he is dead EVERYONE ZONE. come back and give away your new sword. have mainly Druids, Shamans, Clerics and Chanters If you cna have any melee you want gt Monks Rogues dont do really good with BS because he has a huge knockback rate and chnage directions alot if the MT moves a inch so does General. Mains i keeep MT up ahve lotsa of DP's and mainly mez this could be a 2 group thing if oen group had like 4 chnaters and the rest monks/rogues/rangers and the other MT a exyra warrior MA and all clerics/druids/shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SirTamalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HMM.. Icye u crazy man!  Your tatics suck! Enchanter mez everybody is sucide plan. I did general with 2warriors (59,60), 2ranger60,2pally50,enchanter60 and 60cleric. The first pull is a fate pull to remove the HT away from the general.  Next u must kill one of his bodyguard by zoning pulling. Than u keep on pulling until general and his body guard alone than u beat the crap out of it.  good luck</div></div><hr />
