<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Disgustipate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While toying around with EQEMU, I found a few new of those diety based necklaces...<br />
<br />
The best ones were 16ac, 10 str  8wis 80mana and some other stat, and an effect.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek Ogres had Rage<br />
<br />
Tribunal had Phantom Plate<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule(I dont think I found the highest one, it was only 65 mana) had Dread of the Night<br />
<br />
Innoruuk had Siphon Life</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">oooh! where where where? I want the rallos zek one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This would be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its kinda hard to get a nice Necklace...just bought an Amulet of Insight for the Focus Effect! But something with 10+ AC Wis and i HOPE some HP (or more HP) would be really cool!</div></div><hr />

Tribunal had Phantom Plate<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL, figures. Whats the current tribunal one do, summon some hammers or something a true newb wouldn't even equip? Seriously I would like to see them expand some quest for all the old races. Being an iksar or kitty cat is great, you always have cool little quest to do, some with even good results. I think the only quests in everfrost past level 6 are the langseax things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tofino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And that, my friend, is why you GET OUT THE HOUSE!!<br />
<br />
Who wants to hang around a bunch of stinking mammoths anyways?  You know why they have that moat between Halas and EF?  IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET MOST OF THE BARBS TO BATHE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rage would realy suck as an effect. All shamans can cast it.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What's phantom plate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mage AC buff Glori.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Level 44 Mage Spell<br />
<br />
18 AC<br />
+3 Regen<br />
<br />
Pretty darn nice effect honestly.  I Like it.  Stacks with our regen spells but doesn't stack with Cleric AC buffs.  I'm unsure about it stacking with Harnessing/Focus.  If not then it wouldn't be as great as I thought, but if so, very handy.<br />
<br />
As for the Rage necklace, it'd be kind of nice to have it on a clicky as it is a pain in the butt to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Gloriana <br />
What's phantom plate? <br />
<br />
Hmm I take back my lol remark. There is phantom plate, a self buff thats adds 16 or so ac and some health regen that last around an hour, and there is summon phantom plate that summons plate armor with bronze like stats that you can give to pets. I had assumed is was summon an item since thats what the earlier necklace done. If its the self buff its actually pretty nice for a clicky item. My stats may be a bit off, this is from memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can't wait...  these are gonna rock.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well lets see:<br />
<br />
Phantom Plate- ac plus minor regen. If it stacks with shaman regen then it's more health to canni for mana.<br />
<br />
Dread of night- fear kiting. well that be nice with a snarer, or a pain without =)<br />
<br />
Siphon Life- lifetap, pretty decent. depending on the casting time, i can see tap tap canni, tap tap canni ect till fm. free dd damage too. <br />
<br />
Rage- good combo buff, but kinda blah compared to the rest. Personally I think we should shoot for VotB or better yet Yaulp V.  <br />
<br />
[Edit: mind afk, need sleep]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know nothing about this eqemulator thingy. Is this something new that just popped into some data file or something thats been in for months? I could be 5 minutes work for them to flesh out the rewards as the quest progressed. Its a whole different animal for them to put in several long involved quest similar to the qeynos badge quest or the iksar weapon quests.<br />
<br />
Oh well heres hoping its good news, its always has bothered me the tribunal quests stopped before they really even started. I'd sure love a reason to visit my homeland other than collecting permafrost crystals for my pottery fanatic buddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dang, woulld be sorta cool if the sham one summoned armor, assuming giving armor to a pet helps.   haven't tried it at all cause there is no need.  Mainly I would use the summon spell for the large bags that the armor comes in :)   Help when master looting.   Or leave it in the bank as CR gear... Except of course WE CAN&quot;T WEAR PLATE.   SO that idea was shot fast.   Glad to hear it is an AC buff.<br />
<br />
  If it stacks with our AC, sweet.  If it stacks with our AC AND bramblecoat?   HEAVEN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQ Emu is an emulator that lets you run your own personal EQ server.  Requires a Linux machine and not for the faint of heart I'd assume.  Last I read, lots of features were broken, i.e. dual wield and some other stuff, but fun to run around and play God in I suppose =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Does phantom plate have any stacking issues with regular raid buffs? IE Aegolism, FoS, RH,PE, etc? If not its a pretty damn nifty click.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">EVEN MORE FEAR!! =D<br />
<br />
Was getting tired of just having animals and undead running away me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I thought Dread of Night was undead only fear? IMO the best goes:<br />
<br />
Phantom Playe (Ac and regen? wow)<br />
Siphon Life (as long it has cast time of 6 sec or below..)<br />
Dread of Night / Rage (Tied cause the usefulness isn't as much as the others)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>koradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There are a few stacking problem with Phantom Plate, doesnt stack with aego style spells and doesnt stack with our own pure ac buffs or cleric pure ac buffs. Plus the regen part doesnt stack with form of the bear. <br />
<br />
IMO Phantom Plate would be a bit of a waste for a shaman to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">if that is true i concur, phantom plate would be no useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Correct me if I'm wrong, but the EQemu only has items that have been collected from the datastream from a Magelo-like program.  Therefore, any items you have in EQemu are either ones that people have on live servers, or fake ones people have created for use in the emu.<br />
<br />
So how can you be sure that there are really in game?  Or even in the live database?</div></div><hr />
