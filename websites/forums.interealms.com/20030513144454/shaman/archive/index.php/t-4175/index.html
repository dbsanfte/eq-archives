You can download it from here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?threadid=732&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1).<br />
<br />
Spell icons and background images came from  here (http://pub37.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=74.topic).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tried that UI, but when I went to do the /loadskin drakah, it threw all the bars all over the screen instead of packing them in at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Decided to ditch it as I don't really want the lag associated with running that high a resolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have the new UI and is working. I have the new icons and they are appearing in the spell book and buffs, but not in the spell gems. Any else have this problem?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Aye, it will only work in 1280x1024.  hehe I wish i could run it at a higher resolution.<br />

I have the new icons and they are appearing in the spell book and buffs, but not in the spell gems. Any else have this problem? <br />

Read through the thread on the message board where ya got the spell icons from.  The person who made the spell/buff icons hasn't had time to create the spell gems yet.  :) I can't wait till he has those completed.</div></div><hr />
