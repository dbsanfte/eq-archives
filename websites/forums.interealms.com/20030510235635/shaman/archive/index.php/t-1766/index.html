<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I'm camping the mobs with my main (52nd ranger) to collect the bits and pieces needed. But one of the mobs is Grizzlenot in SK. Since I have tracking to my advantage thats a huge plus, but where does he spawn? Does he have a PH? Does he always drop his bark? If I can i only want to kill him once... i'd like the druid to still like my woody ranger! hehe Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
So far i've collected<br />
Chiefs Tounge<br />
Barbed Bones<br />
Ghoul Guts<br />
Lancer Fin<br />
Terror Spines<br />
Tidal Lords Sea Shell<br />
Ogre Cho.... something or other<br />
<br />
Currently camping the Basalt Drake in Rathe. Yes I'm going to get a full set of Totemic if I can. I wanna see what a Kitty looks like in full Totemic! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I loved doing this quest. Except for the no exp for the turn ins. If I remember, Grizz can spwan near the stables and I think he always drops his bark. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank ya... if and when the Basalt drops his scale i'll be off to SK for those drops. And yes, these quests are alot easier than the ranger Ivy Etched. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also remember &quot;A Drake&quot; also drops it too.  He is one of the placeholders for the monk epic/j boots spawns.  Usually can be seen running around hg plateau.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I quested (at lvl 19) for my Totemic Boots, and in my low 30s quested for the Breastplate.  Easily some of the most fun I've had, since it was me and 3 RL friends doing most of it (hehe except Grizzleknot - he is hard to find, never up, etc).<br />
<br />
Bought Totemic Legs and Arms also, and an Oger looks good in plate :)<br />
<br />
Congrats on questing for the items (even if it is with a ranger lol) and wear the BP with pride - its one of the rarer BPs in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't know a Drake had a chance of dropping the scale. I found one of the drake spawn points near the sphinx (to the south of HG valley). Their on a one minute spawn time so all I do is clear the drakes on track, run to that spawn point and if I had a pet (ranger) i'd /pet guard here. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I gave up for now on Grizzleknot, so I collected the feather from the griffonne, the snowball from the wizard in perma and the mammoth rib. I went to the hidden cave and started the camp for the glacier bear... all I have to say is... ummm where? Any help guys and gals? I kept the skellies cleared but I stayed away from the human farther down...the one with a gobby near him. Is the gobby a PH for the bear? Also I read on alakh's that there are 2 wandering skellies. I only found 5 with tracking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I quit totemic quest simply because I dont have enough money for dufrenite..<br />
<br />
Seriously thought, remove Dufrenite and other gems from Old  world class armor quest already.  It does not serve any purpose now.</div></div><hr />

From what I recall, you have to head to #3 on this map - sitting just outside it in the tunnel, you can safely watch the Lich go by without getting aggro.  There are two Ice Boned Skeletons that will wander up to you - they are the PH's, and are on a 6 or 7 hour timer.  Kill them, log, come back later &amp; pray for a bear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Indrii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, when I did this, i waited at #2 on the map.  And the bear and his PH's were on a 6hr 45min timer when I camped him.  When it was time for him to be up I would Sense Animal, that's how I got to him.  It'll either be 2 IB skellies or 1 and him, every time.  Keep see invis up too :/ too many people tried to KS him.<br />
good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I was 35 I decided I needed to upgrade my helm of rile, so I tried to do the totemic helm quest and camp the bear.  I spent about 2-3 hours down there waiting for the bear or skellies, and I finally got the skellies.  Killed them, set my alarm clock for 6 hours 30 minutes later, and went to sleep.  Got up and sat in the cave for a bit and the skellies spawned again.  Killed them and went back to sleep.  7 hours later, more skellies.  I cleared the placeholders of the bear ELEVEN TIMES and he never spawned.  80 hours into, though, the lich of miragul finally got me and I died a second time drowning in the water trying to get my corpse.  I was unguilded and didnt have any friends or money, so I was unable to get a cleric to come rezz me.  I bummed an EB from a low level shammy, looted my corpse, and logged out.  I didn't come back for a long time.  I actually quit EQ for several months thanks to my frustration and disappointment with this quest.<br />
<br />
Good luck, have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cats look GREAT in totemic.  I quested the totemic BP, bracer, legs, helm, gloves, and boots (have JB arms, but same graphic as totemic).<br />
<br />
If you see any of the cats in Shar Val in full plate, just imagine that the plate is a med-dark colored green.  Some people tell me it looks greenish-brown to them, but I see only green, no brown.<br />
<br />
I'd post a picture if I had a clue how to do that.  I see Alla's still has no picture of a cat in totemic..../shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, they do look sweet! All i'm missing is the BP, helm and cloak (oh well). A guildy said she might have the bark from Grizzle... so heres hoping. Gotta get together with her and come up with the plat. I ran out buying all the gems. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My shaman stumbled over Grizzleknot near the splitpaw lair.  Of course, he already had his Hate BP by then, BUT the druid who got my first 2 totemic BPs (quit, gave it all away, came back, upgraded) found Grizzleknot around splitpaw as well.  Tracking from splitpaw gives you a good central point to nail this rare spawn.  BTW, I was JUST SW of SP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grizzlenot walked by me one time just after I zoned in to SK and ran to the top of the little hill in front of the bridge.  He was proceeding left to right.  The second time I found him he was wandering near the Centaur village, headed toward the bridge.<br />
<br />
I have read elsewhere that he spawns near the Centaur village as well.</div></div><hr />
