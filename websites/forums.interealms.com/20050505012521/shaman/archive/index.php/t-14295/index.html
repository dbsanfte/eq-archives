<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this looks like it's a new levitation spell to me.<br />
<br />
Slighly confusing though as we all know that we get the componentless lev at 51.<br />

What da?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taoxek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Geussing they just copied the 51 lev and forgot to remove the classes. Id say this will be an effect on an item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That would definitely explain it:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Duration still sucks~  I don't see why they can't make levitate last longer, anyplace it's handy for pulling I just leave it up, because it's got a stupid recast of a few seconds, and only lasts 20 minutes &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't see why the class that gets SOW five levels before druids and Levitate the same level as druids can't get SOE at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Because druids are so underpowered that they need those little edges to stay balanced!!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spirit of Bih'Li &gt; Spirit of Eagle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spirit of Bih'Li &gt; Spirit of Eagle<br />
<br />
While I admire the class loyalty that makes you say that, it's sadly just not true. What Bih'li is superior to is Pack Spirit... and it still get overwritten by it.<br />
<br />
Even ignoring the situationaly useful Lev, See Invis and Infravision effects bundled on SoE, the bottom line is that it will increase movement by a maximum of 60%. And Flight of Eagle will do a flat 65%. In comparaison, Bih'li caps at 55%. And so does SoW for that matter, which means that SoE pretty much owns.<br />
<br />
And which means that Shaman should really get SoE at 49 and FoE at 60 *grin*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SoE/FoE is superior for travelling, but Bih'Li is superior for exp grouping/raiding in outdoor zones. Most people don't want to be levitating unless it's necessary. The speed difference is negligible, is more than outweighed by the attack buff (for melees).<br />
<br />

<br />
SoW overwrites Bih'Li and vice-versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most of the time, the melee will sacrifice the 10% additional movement in exchange for 14atk.  <br />
<br />
If you're a kiting class, soe &gt; sow/billy.  If you're melee, atk makes billy &gt; soe.<br />
<br />
All depends on perspective, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe Druids were once underpowered, but no more. <br />
<br />
Druids on the high end with a little work in AA's can crit for 2800. I recently acquired a Harla talisman the best I can do with our 54 Poison DD at least so far is 1037 with no crit and no AA's in SCF.<br />
