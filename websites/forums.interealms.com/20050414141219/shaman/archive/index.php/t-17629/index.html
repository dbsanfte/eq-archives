<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Humlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The subject says it all, every time I zone EQ crashes and I get a pop up window telling me that my client has crashed and offering to send an error report to Sony.  This just started hapening tonight after playing successfully for over a month on this machine.  Any tips?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having the same problem, also having this problem when sitting at character select. Also getting randomly kicked to desktop for no reason whatsoever.  Using default UI, Ive reinstalled EQ, updated video and sound card drivers and reinstalled direct x.......any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It would appear that zoning crashes are an enhancement with the last patch.  They fit well with the memory leaks from the previous patch.  As far as I can tell, the only solution is to wait until SOE figures out what they did to cause them.  No doubt there will be an emergency patch 'real soon now'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Humlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I ended up deleting all my *.ini files and that seems to have worked.  maybe one of them was corrupted.  Also ran the thurough file check at patch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're on XP - I went into network properties, then LAN properties (works for modem as well, fixed it for a friend) and uninstalled QoS packet scheduler.  From what I've read, it's a pretty much useless component that's installed with XP by default.  Something with the new patch apparently gums it up pretty bad.  My disconnects (which started with this patch) have pretty much stopped since I did it.<br />
<br />
Hope that does it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would like to try this solution but need a bit more clarification on just what exactly you did. <br />
<br />
Anything would help and I'd appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
