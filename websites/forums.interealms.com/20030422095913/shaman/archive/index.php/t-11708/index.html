<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanibal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all! im new to the board and was had a few questions. i recently started playing my shammie again who i havent played since velious and need he is in desperate need of equipping.  i havent kept up on shammie news since that time so im nearly clueless on what is considered good gear now.  currently i plan on getting him a horse, but after that i dont know where to go from there.  his magelo is here.<br />

i have the back slot covered, ive been 1 pg away from a cloak of the wise for him for 2 weeks now and am bound to get it(unless this isnt a good cloak for shammies that is) so dont worry about the back slot at all. my main character is a well equipped 61 necro that i am going to use to obtain items for the shammie.  my main goal for him is to box with my necro, tho i might do some occasional soloing or grouping. 80%+ of his time will be with the necro tho if this will effect what equip i should obtain for him.  my shammie is currently lvl 55, which brings me to my next question, should i do some basic aa now to set me up for canni5 at 59, or wait till then?  also what is a good shammie aa for archetype? SCM3 rocks on my necro, is it as good a bargin for shammies?  anything else that i should know? thanks for your help in advance  :)</div></div><hr />

Your HP is WAY lower than it should be.  Shaman don't usually equip themselves like other casters, who value mana over HP.  HP &gt; Wis.  Your HP is your mana, and it keeps you alive when slow is resisted.  I usually die because I'm ooh, not oom.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kanibal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the info :)  what is a good goal to aim for for hp total?  i know for my necro when i reached 2k unbuffed hps that was a pretty good amount, what should i aim for as a shammie?  the consensus for necros was 2k unbuffed hps and 200ish int,  is there a certain wis/hp ratio i should aim for? thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">good goals for higher level shaman are 2500 hps and 1100 ac unbuffed.then you can survive most spankings and have enough hp to can V without getting low HP aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xorraiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ouch yea Hdaana is correct, at 50+ we really dismiss WIS for HP &amp; MANA gear...goal being high HP &amp; AC, mine isnt great but am getting there<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow...been awhile since I saw a shaman with Wis in every slot.  Most shaman, as stated above, value HP, STA, and mana items to Wis items.<br />
<br />
However, since you say that you are going to be playing this shaman with your necro this MIGHT not be a bad setup.  I say this because cannibalizing takes attention, and that might not be something that you are going to be able to do while trying to play your necro.  I do it, but the shaman is my main and my SK is there just to tank while I do real damage with the shaman.  Not knowing your play style and motivations its hard to say.  If that is the case then having a large mana pool might be preferable to having a fast mana regen.  But...With a wis of 213 Magelo says you have 2566 mana.  I am 55 as well, and have 179 wis, with 2357 mana.  So you have 34 more Wis than I do, but only 209 more mana. Thats less than one cast of Turgurs.   <br />
<br />
But if you are wanting to make this shaman into something that will be able to stand up solo, and do well in groups (withouth the necro) I would follow the advice that has been given above.  Check some of the Magelos that are floating around the boards, lots of times we tend to wear alot of the same stuff at the same levels.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
