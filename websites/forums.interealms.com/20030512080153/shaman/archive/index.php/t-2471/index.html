<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just so you know, I tried to solo him (on Thurg faction).   He is in the room RIGHT by the Dain.   You can fight him if you don't move around much in there, and not get adds, but too far one way, you get guards from Dain, too far the other and you get Coucilors from below.<br />
<br />
  He didn't cast while I was buffing, so I figured a straight melee battle.  But alas, he turned out to be a cleric type mob, and cast off his little Judgement Nukes regularly.<br />
<br />
  His Hp is the standard Velious WAY TOO MUCH Hp.   he hit in the 130s or so, and I could not land ANY spells (except Insidious Decay of course, but couldn't get Plague after that even).   Tried malo, poison and disease dots, and slow on him.   As well as root.<br />
<br />
<br />
  With me tanking him and pet whacking on him, I got him to half before I was too low on mana to believe I coud win.   If I kept going and did get him down, pretty sure he would have run, and that would mean straight to Dain + guards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Bring a ranger (snare and much damage melee) along, and I bet you can kill him easy, just be sure you have enough Dain faction to avoid going KOS, or getting your ranger pal out is gonna be tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Know the who and where - question is how?  <br />
<br />
1. How do you get into his room (invis?)<br />
<br />
2.  I read on these boards that a 60 Shaman and 60 warrior could take him pretty easily.  Sound like this might be the case.<br />
<br />
3.  Any safer place to fight him and if so how do you get him there.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are KOS to Thurg, I don't think you can possibly take him solo.   Maybe if you wandered in while someone did Dain, then stuck around for 12 hours in the room (ick).<br />
<br />
   You gotta be on good faction with the dwarves, Including Dain, and there is NO way to pull him out unless you want to try Feign parking him at the zone with a monk friend or something.    But your chances of doing him outside of a raid when KOS to dwarves is Nil IMO</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was doing this fight about a year ago with 60 monk (me) 55 ranger, 55 shaman 40's cleric.. Is a joke of a fight and you can't snare him from what I remember. All about getting him killed before he runs out of the room (pretty exciting) Huntsman across the hall is pretty much an identical battle but you don't get any CH's. Hope you get that thing killed before he aggro's the guards!<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/nod As Bakkal said about no snare and kill before getting to guards. Can be exciting yes indeed. (Make sure the druid has an evac memed lol)<br />
<br />
Getting to the scribe is easy enough, just invis on up (erm, not sure if dain sees invis come to think of it.. he's pretty much dead all the time).<br />
<br />
Scribe is in his room (left of throne) all alone. He can be bashed as I recall.<br />
Luck!</div></div><hr />
