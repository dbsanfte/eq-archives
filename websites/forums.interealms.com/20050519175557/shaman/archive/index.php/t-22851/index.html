<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Call me an idiot if you want, but I'm having a hell of a time figuring out where to even get started.  Anyone mind giving me a quick run down on how to get started on this?  Would appreciate it.<br />
<br />
I looked at Allakhazam, and they have a nice chart but it is meaningless to me.  Or I can't find the meaning in it.  Which is probably the truer answer :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GoD guide (http://home.cwru.edu/~srp5/Gate_Tiers.htm) <br />
<br />
That's a pretty good guide for getting started in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the link.  I'll be reading it over.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just to let you know.. the information in that guide is not 100% correct.  Most of the stuff that is incorrect is because certain mobs/trials have been changed a bit.<br />
<br />
For instance, in the three group Ikkinz trials, the final named are now slowable... and do not require 3x clerics and 2 wiz to complete.  I have completed them all with far from ideal groups, and have done them all with me as the second healer (mind you.. i haven't done any of them since they made the final named easier to tank with pal/sk and slowable.. which should make it that much easier now).  I completed the 2nd trial once with war, cleric, sham (me), pal, bard and mage.  The mage died when the 2nd priest agroed at the very beginning and the other five of us got the first priest dead and the 2nd one to 0% when the last of us wiped.  Very close but the cleric made it out of the zone alive before we had to redo it.  We smoked it easily after the rez.  Less than ideal groups can finish this if you are talented enough and with a little bit of luck.<br />
<br />
The Vxed expedition now only requires you to have killed 50 mobs before the final npc spawns.  <br />
<br />
The Ikkinz raids were changed slightly.  The Ikk raid 3 (Transcendence) was made so that when you killed the mobs, after they respawned you will get a message about what class/spells/anything needs to kill it the next time in order to pass that part of the trial.  The guide just mentions that you don't know what it is that can kill it.  No longer will it require some class that isn't in the zone to kill something.. or even if it does, you should be able to get past that point by just killing that mob again and it will change who needs to kill it next time.  Next, Altar of Destruction was changed so that each respective mob in there is harder.  Before it was just almost straight melee events, but now they added a differrent element in AEs.  The AEs are smokers and don't be surprised to have partial wipes on just about every mob, if not full wipes.  I think that the first time that my guild finished this trial after it was changed (we had beat it easily before) we wiped on just about every mob in there at least once.  I still know guilds that have beat Uqua that can't get past this trial since they changed it (the AEs kill them cause their overall resists are too low for most characters).  <br />
<br />
Also, Uqua was changed to be far easier now.  No longer do the mobs quad for 2k, although they do still hit pretty hard.  The guide says that if you lose one person, than you are prob likely to wipe.  This isn't true, although it has a potential to happen if you have people who aren't paying attention and consistantly overagro and get themselves and others killed in the process.  This raid requires full force effort and everyone to pay attention from beginning to the end.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you a bit.  I suggest being in pretty good overall gear for Ikkinz raid 1 - 3, and in great gear overall for Altar of destruction (Ikk 4) and Uqua.  I think just about any guild can beat Ikk 1 - 2 at least and farm the items out of there for their members.  I would also suggest you going into the one group Ikk trials and farm the items in there for everyone who wants them (Glyphed Prayer Rings for everyone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got my first GoD group last night.  Thought I was in store for a Sewer trial, but instead got dragged to Vxed.  :)  If I understand things correctly, I did get a flag but I can't do anything with it yet since I do not have the Sewer trials done.<br />
<br />
I was grouped with 5 members of a French guild, so comunication was a bit tough.  But a couple of them did speak English, so we managed.  Had a wipe on the first named we came to, Umbiki, but recovered and then took him down easily (with a charmed pooka this time).  Cleared some more, got to the room where the Stonespiritist was located, and then lost a couple folks on an overpull.  I was told to invis, run to the Stonespiritist, uninvis, hail it real quick and the click the stone.<br />
<br />
Got a temporary flag.  Not sure what it means yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.<br />
<br />
Got 3 AA I think in the time I was there.  Was very fast exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It means you are flagged for Vxed.   Until you finish Sewers you can't get the permanent flag but that doesn't matter since you need Sewers + Vxed + Tipt to get in Kod`Taz anyway.  Once you get Sewers you can get your flags fixed by talking to the Nihil dudes in Barindu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Scribe fellow near the High Priest?  Yeah, he told me that he heard of my efforts but I needed to talk to the High Priest again and continue my efforts.<br />
<br />
Was a little unclear, but think I've got it cleared up now.  Need to get back here more often.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Once you get Sewers you can get your flags fixed by talking to the Nihil dudes in Barindu.&quot;<br />
IF your guild is capable you can do the smith rhondo event to bypass all the sewers trials, thats what i did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, heard about that.  Unfortunately we're not able to handle that event right now.  Troubled times, but we'll come out better than before I am sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To be KT flagged, you need to complete 6 trials ( 4 sewers, vxed, and tipt ).  You can bypass the sewers if your guild can kill Smith Rondo.<br />
<br />
Trial One, Plant.  Mobs tend to hit hard in this trial, and you will need a decent tank / healer.  You need to fight to an NPC, and he triggers for the stonemites to spawn.  There are nine of them, and once they are all have been killed, the stonemite boss spawns.  Kill it, and you will get a flag for the first trial.  If you are working on BiC quest, there are some items that you might want to pick up.  Mud: this is used for Qinimi and creating your Stone of Entry key.  Larvae:  this is used in Barindu for making a poison.  There are two named that spawn here.  They also drop an item that is needed to complete the Sewers BiC part.<br />
<br />
Trial Two, Cermatory.  Slime drop a vial of corrosive slime that is used for creating a poison for Barindu BiC quest.  I do not remember too much about this trial.<br />
<br />
Trial Three, Pools.  Mobs tend to be weak in this trial.  <br />
<br />
Trial Four, Lair.  I forget about this trial.  Only did it once if I recall.<br />
<br />
Vxed.  Kill 50 mobs, and a spirit will spawn.  Hail the spirit at the end of the zone, and you will get your vxed flag.  There are five drops: a container, uncoiled springs, greased belt, control rods, and a tarnished sprocket.<br />
<br />
Tipt.  You need to kill a Kvy Boss, and you will get your flag when you hail an npc at the end of the zone.  For both VXed and Tipt, there are stones present that will zone you out.  Also, there are BiC quest pieces here - Cells A, B, C, D, and E.  I got almost all the pieces in one instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What are the min tank requirements to do the single group trials? Our pally is currently at 61 with about 6100 buffed hp, will 65 about 7k hp and a few aa's be suffucient or is it going to be impossible.  Doesn't need to be easy, just want to know if its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're not comfortable doing a LDoN hard with the tank I would stay out of the trials.  I know I wouldn't want to tank one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely you would need a few healers for that.  <br />
<br />
I suppose if you had two clerics or a cleric and 2 druid would do.  But, I think you would be hard pressed.   Like what shamuofxev said, if you cannot do LDON hards, you should not try the sewers.  I think you best bet would be to only kill near the zone in/out.  If you feel confident enough to travel deeper, then do so.<br />
<br />
Tank Class ( PAL, SHD, WAR )<br />
CLR<br />
DRU ( Healing / Evac / Snare )<br />
DRU/CLR<br />
SHM/ENC - SHM for slow and healers OR ENC for slow and CC ( might want to go with the ENC if only one Tank )<br />
DPS - ROG/MNK? ( CRs )<br />
<br />
I was always in groups with level 65 players, so these are merely guesses.  You best bet might be invis, pacification.  Kill only what you need.  Your biggest challenge will be the Bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We've got a good selection of healing classes to work with. Will definately do some practice on ldon hards first. Need to get him to 65 though to begin with, then will have <br />
<br />
65 pally<br />
65 monk<br />
65 sham<br />
65 dru<br />
2 x 65 Clr<br />
65 Enc<br />
65 Mag<br />
<br />
To make a group out of.</div></div><hr />
