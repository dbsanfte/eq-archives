<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for our wards instead of just hp regen , why isnt it made a hp/mana regen? (if stam no go) half the regen amount , but it regens mana and hp at that regen?<br />
<br />
or if anyone can think of other ideas:)<br />
<br />
mind i saw someone mention about being able to sumon different pets that can heal, proc, mana refresh, but dont do mellee damage which i though would be a nice difference for our pets, specially if cant mellee well anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because we have slow ;)<br />
<br />
When you look closer at our spells you will find that we have 0 mana regen spells to cast on others. Only canni for us self. I can't see us getting a mana regen ward. It's sad that our ward is not endurance regen as the description says. It would fit perfectly into the role of a shaman most of us see (strengthen / weaken melee combat).<br />
<br />
Ideas for other wards? How about DoT shielding or stun resists? Or shielding or accuracy? All the effects we would like to see on our buffs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
thing is this is true, and because we are a diverse class rather than a focused class - by focused i mean wiz = nuke clerics = heal etc - (ignoring slow) we lose out on things, and because of this there will be a split in views, if thats the case and we start getting looked at, why not suggest that our dogdog (spirit guide anyone?) becomes 2 different types of dogdog, one that enhances our benifical spells (effects/mana costs/speed) and another that enhances our detrimental spells so that we can cast our pet dependant on a) what role we want to play and b) what role were needed to play, and cos yu can only have one pet out at a time, yu cant be great in both aspects, allowing for 2 shaman to actually be useful in the same group!<br />
