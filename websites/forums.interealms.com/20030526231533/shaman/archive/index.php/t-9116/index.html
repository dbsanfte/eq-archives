<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've come to accept some mark-ups on shaman spells. After all going price (as seen over the last 4 months) on Karana Server is about the following:<br />
<br />
Torpor: 45k+ (if you even see on in bazaar, been months since last copy)<br />
Malo: 80k+ (last seen at 120k)<br />
Voice of Berserker: 15k<br />
Pox: Have yet to be seen by my eyes in bazaar<br />
PE: 30k+ <br />
True Spirit: 20k (lowest seen was 15k)<br />
Tnarg's: 20k (7k+ if you are lucky)<br />
Avatar: 60k+<br />
<br />
These are just to name a few. I'm also used to seeing non-shaman class ppl selling vendor bought spells like Replenishment for 300pp to 1kpp, and other basic spells for a hell of a lot more than they should. <br />
<br />
But was really gets me is when a 57 kitty shaman tries to sell Mending of Kragg (yep, that vendor bought, 5pp and change, level 58 almost-CH spell) for 75k! No wonder ppl think we are rich, and can pay so much for our damn spells!!! I can understand a little mark-up like 50pp resale, but a mark-up of 74995pp???? Someone please shoot that kitty shaman and do us all a favor!!!<br />
<br />
Better yet, if it keeps up, or gets worse, please shoot me!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bane of nife seems pretty common in the Bazaar on BB now, cheap too.<br />
<br />
Pox is still rare, usually between 10 and 20k when it does turn up.<br />
<br />
PE/Group acumen seem to have quite a surcharge on them, why I don't know, they are easy to get and not at all rare.<br />
<br />
Tnargs has only just started to see a markup in its price now, 15k and climbing.<br />
<br />
Truespirit is still the pricey luclin spell for us though, usually on offer for 20 to 30k, funnily enough Eatoo STILL seems to have his copy for sale that he started out at 75k for.  Hopefully he will take the hint and just destroy his copy =)<br />
<br />
Avatar pops up for 40k or so every now and again, why I don't know, its a waste of time.<br />
<br />
A few Torpor's cropped up lately, but I can't say I've seen Malo for sale in a long long time.  Although to be fair, on BB malo usually sells for a 'reasonable' 30k.</div></div><hr />
