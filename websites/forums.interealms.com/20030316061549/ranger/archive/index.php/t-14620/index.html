<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daeroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have an MQ question regarding the Swirling Sphere of Color.  Here is my problem...  Right now I have the Sphere on my warrior which is on the same account as my ranger.  I assume I can still MQ it if I park them both and turn in the sphere then log in my ranger for the next piece.  (will probably bring a friend to ensure no one else tries the turn in while I'm waiting to log in my next char)<br />
<br />
My question is... Will this work or is there any sort of time limit between turn ins?  Also I'm wondering about faction.  Is Mairee on druid/ranger faction of some kind?  My warrior has spent alot of time in PoG killing various things.  Will this pose a problem or should he be able to do the turn in?<br />
<br />
Any information would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mairee Silentone is on True Spirit faction, which doesn't have anything to do with PoG.   There is now a quest based in Solusek Ro that can increase your True Spirit faction if need be, though most people wouldn't need to.<br />
<br />
Your MQ idea will work fine as long as no one else tries to do a turn-in in between, and you seem to have that covered. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or do the shaman epic quest to raise it ....all the shaman epic is based on the true spirit faction .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gilarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it will work, just do that after patch or something so that it will make you sure noone before has screwed this part and your warrior wont receive upgraded hammer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daeroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the input.  As soon as I get a couple more pieces so I'm ready for that step I'll give it a shot.  (Just glad it doesn't sound like faction is an issue in this case)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>victoriatana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hope I'm not too late, but DO NOT TRY THIS!!!!  Your items WILL get eaten up.  You have about 30 seconds to do turn-ins (atleast that's what I know from past experiences), and unless you can /q and login in less than 30 seconds, it will not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daeroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ack.... Well I might be able to get back in that quickly....  I have no idea...   Not sure if I should try it or not now.  Not worried if I lost the Swirling Sphere since it's useless on my warrior anyhow, but I would hate to loose the other items and have to start from scratch again....  /sigh now I'm not sure if to try it or not.  My problem is that I recently left my guild and am not looking for another one in the near future, so my chances of getting back to sky for the Swirling Sphere are slim to none....  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Umm, Victoriatana, a friend of mine just did the hand in and log another character to MQ the SSoC last weekend.  She had no problems, and now her ranger has Swiftwind (her wizard had the SSoC).  Dunno what you're talking about as far as the time limit to MQ stuff; I've never seen any evidence of it; in fact, on other quests I've seen evidence there is no such time limit (other than server going down or the NPC's death).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i doubt there is a 30 second limit.. when i handed in my two epic stones in FV, i got one of em back...<br />
<br />
i really doubt that someone had handed in one of them less than 30 seconds before...<br />
<br />
<br />
they prob hold it until they are killed... at least that would be my best guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even if there is, start camping out your first character, do the hand-in at the 5-second mark, and you can get it done in under 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
But there is no such limit...if you want to prove it to yourself just for peace of mind, do something like an ivy etched quest or SS faction turn-in (or whatever) using the same procedure, and wait like 5-10 minutes in between turn-ins.  It will still work.</div></div><hr />
