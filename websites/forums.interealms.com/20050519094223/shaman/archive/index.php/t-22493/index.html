<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just read a post bout the epic 2.0.. and how yall still like ur spear.. well maybe the new shaman epic can be a shield? sort of like the harvestor, looks like a wep but isnt, IMO the new epic looks awesome.. well tell me how ya like that idea =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JustinTimberlake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't it look like a giant chicken head on a stick? Or was that some other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like an epic shield better really. I think it would be a cool Idea. it could be some spirit that shields you :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, the new shaman epic looks like a lion head on a dildo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah I'd like an epic shield, that would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd actually like to see some options on a new epic item.  If you got to choose whether you wanted it as a shield, ranged, 1h, or 2h item, it would make the quest more desirable to different types of players.<br />
<br />
No matter what, it is going to need stats and abilities beyond what is currently out there or be a scaled item, like the iksar cudgel, to get anyone interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think the epic look sweet.. cept.. the took the head off one of my people  :mad: also.. i think they should be the BEST weapon u can get (and for sham its shield ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a shield that gives you the ability to bash ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I want a spear for Primary slot with click Balance of the Nihil.<br />
<br />
Or a secondary/range slot, cool looking totem/shield with click Malos.<br />
<br />
I also want to win the lottery...............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A shield sure would be nice....<br />
<br />
Although something with clicky malos... *drools on self*... oh huh.. yes, what was I saying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They're not going to put clicky balance on the epic. You're not gonna replace your TA, so might as well make the epic a shield. I think this even fits pretty well with the shaman idea, it could be like the essence of a guardian spirit protecting you. Give it like a worn &quot;vie&quot; type effect... oh and bash mod of +200 thanks :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have the shield of ssra atm, 6 mana regen + dodge + 100 hp 100 mana etc..<br />
<br />
I really hope the epic is multi-slot, or is better than a slot I currently have a good item in.  <br />
<br />
I mean, if they make the epic primary, are shaman with TA actually going to replace TA for the epic if all it has is a dot effect or something? Doubtful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Considering the luck we have, epic 2.0 will be a type 7 augment.  Or a potion.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">wouldnt it be cool if it was a necklace and u could actually see it over ur chest piece? a barbarian with a tiger head on a stick necklace.. lol thats a barbarian!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just want a spear.  Is that too much to ask?<br />
<br />
2.0 will be unattainable by me.  I just hope 1.5 isn't the cat head.  Stupidest graphic I've ever seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>horaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How bout shield that clicks for Quiessence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">why q? if u made it something else.. u could have q AND something else :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Malos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Epic With clicky pet, a pets with More Dps. our pet is Really useless hitting for 60 heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">they should make the pet better from what i read.. would make yall better at dps.. which is what needed (also what ive read)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">How about a clicky shield with a DC for 64 lvl mobs!<br />
<br />
(Being a bit rediculious here but hey if you don't ask you will never get)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">how bout a choice for the effect depending on what u like to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I wonder how they treat Classes that have more than one Epic reward  . Rangers Get 2 swords if I recall. Bards Get some Drums and I think a Lute in addition to the SSS.  I got a Shield and a Nifty set of Boots outt my Epic quest so far. I could certainly use a new Pair of Faster boots. Maybe with an upgrade to SoW.   and Perhaps a Better shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">idea for new epic 07-21-2004 04:36 AM If it was the best you could ever get, no other weapons would have any use  got this bad rep.. and the reason i said that is because itd actually be a quest thats good and ull have for al ong time and worth doing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">epic 2.0 is trash graphic wise.  and I absolutely do not want a &quot;weapon&quot; looking graphic in my off hand.  give me a shield or orb (umbracite swarm orb 4lyfe! =P) or nothing else off hand.  I don't want a book.  I don't want a book on a stick.  And I sure as hell don't want an off hand weapon look.  I'm a caster, not a dual wielding melee.  Necros with double scythes look absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah an orb type sheild or other thing would be kick a$$. I can't imagine having another spear in my off hand, how stupid would that be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look at the stupid Shaman with a spear in each hand.... what does she think she is? A duel weilding melee class or something???&quot;<br />
<br />
I want to be able to use BOTH epic items at one time. I haven't gotten the first one yet, but I'm getting semi-close now... I don't want just an upgrade for it, I want two epic items. becuase no doubt that the epic 2.0 will be hard to obtain and will be like doing a whole different epic quest. /shrug<br />
<br />
I saw the book on a stick thing last night for the first time. Yeah, that's ugly. How do you read a book if it's on the end of a stick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Epic shield with clicky malos and some hoss a s s foci.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">That shield of falsehood is just a joke, i never even put it on. I said &quot;oh look I got the shield.... oh great I have to allocate an inventory spot to it until I can deposit it in the bank...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Im not sure bout this.. but i think with the harvestor.. if u carry a weapon.. it looks like ur carrying the harvestor still (ok if not make it the necro reaper pet).. it would look like the graphic of the thingy but u could still use ur spear.. i LOVE the new graphic thats why im saying stuff like this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">That shield of falsehood is just a joke, i never even put it on.

<br />
What are you talking about?  Shield of falsehood rox joo sox.  The negative stats on it are only there because it'd be overpowered without them.  Duh.<br />
<br />
Nice reward for running around for hours looking for the wandering spirit.  When I first did it, I thought the spirit would be a spirit wolf.  I saw a wisp float by and was like jee, don't remember seeing any wisps on this part of the zone.  Of course I didn't click on him... reread the walkthrough an hour later... was like #@%^#!!!!  Then I started the search again.  I could have asked a drood to track, but back then, I couldn't because they were too busy running from four wyverns in cobalt scar =O</div></div><hr />
