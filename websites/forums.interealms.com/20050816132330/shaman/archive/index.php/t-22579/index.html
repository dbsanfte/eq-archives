<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well what should have been the high point of my EQ life turned out to be the most disappointing. We have been Potime flagged for sometime now, however due to retirements and MiA's we have failed to push past CT.<br />
<br />
Our guild decided to make an alliance with 2 other guilds playing in the same timezone (Euro) as us, but who did'nt have the power to get past Rathe and Corniav to be PoTime flagged. We decided rather than struggle with low numbers and never get Potime finished we would make a powerful alliance and finish it before the next expansion came out.<br />
<br />
So after several weeks of back flagging on the above PoP Gods we get the 2 other guilds PoTime flagged, with just 2 Potime raids we get to Quarm! Now here is where the **** hits the fan for me, based on RA we have a fixed number of places for the raid as do the other 2 guilds, now my RA is way above any shaman in the guild and is amongst the highest in guild. Now don't get me wrong this is'nt an attack on my guild they have done everything for me, and I have worked hard to help repay them and I love them all!<br />
<br />
Sunday arrives and we gather in PoTime A and make groups for tier 1, we cleared to tier 4 the Friday before, after several minutes I get raid invite only to be told after several minutes to drop raid, which I do, several more mins pass, and I see in Guild chat that the raid is now full! After sending a few /tells I'm told that my class is'nt deemed critical! I don't have DPS. But you know what what really disappointed me, was that one of the other guilds who were now Potime flagged with help from my guild had 2 shamans in the Raid!! 70%+ RA PoTime flagged since before Xmas 2003 and I get asked to step down from 1st Quarm attempt whilst 2 shamans from the other guild get a shot at Quarm after just a few weeks in PoTime, because my class is'nt deemed critical!<br />
<br />
You bet your ass I was pissed off! but more at Sony than my guild, they made the decision based on what they thought best for the guild and I can handle that, but to weaken shaman to the point where they are over looked for EVERY other class makes me want to give up! I'm sure I'll get my shot at Quarm and it's lootz soon, but somehow the victory will tainted with this memory. I'm still stunned typing this that I should have played 100's of hours to get to this point, to be told that we are not needed, I cannot tell you how disappointed I am /sigh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not knowing the exact arrangements for how the various guilds &quot;choose&quot; who represents them in the raid, it's hard to really judge why they would bump you in favor of them.  If I could hazard a guess, each guild is given a certain number of slots that they fill - with some loose guidelines on what the raid needs to be successful.  One of the guilds might have been given a number of slots and chose to send in two shaman (for whatever reasons, high attendance, long tenure, who knows).  Your guild saw this as said &quot;they filled the slots for shaman, we need to get more DPS/Healing/whatever&quot;... and then bumped you out.<br />
<br />
It sucks for sure... not only that we've been relegated in some cases to second class citizens, but also that you got bumped.  However, unfortunately guild alliances such as this lend itself to hard feelings over exactly these kinds of issues... (people not getting flags, loots, exp, etc because someone in the other guild DID get it).<br />
<br />
I feel for you.  Good luck on the next run - hopefully something similar won't happen again.  It doesn't replace the First Kill for a guild - but it will be YOUR first kill... which is nearly as sweet.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think that comment about shaman being useless on Quarm is kind of funny. First off he needs to be debuffed 4 times and slowed 4 times. Slow is hard to stick but 2 shaman could do it. However, this is your FIRST quarm attempt with people from guilds that are NOT time geared everyone and their freakin grandma are gonna need cures and heals. Quarm has an AE for every resist and the adds that spawn proc a slow, so I don't see how in your circumstances 2 shaman was a wise number. I would have gone with 3 or 4 at least until people upped their resists and HP pools. BTW did you guys win?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe its time for a new guild on a different server?  I know there are plenty of Time level Euro guilds who need people.  As to friends, they will still be friends after you leave.  If they arn't, then what kind of friend were they in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Strange, Quarm is one of them few encounters where shaman is great to have alot of due to group cure and RGC. Put a Pally (groupheal) and shaman in same group and that group wont die as easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shamans are intensely useful on Quarm.<br />
It's not Sony's fault you were booted from your raid.<br />
It's your guild's fault for booting you.<br />
You guys teamed up with another guild on your own choice, instead of building up your numbers as necessary.<br />
For about 2 months, my guild had 1 successful Quarm kill done, because our average 70 people per raid was dwindling down to about 55 each Time raiding night.<br />
What did we do?<br />
We just kept raiding and gearing ourselves up on p1-5 gear, and doing GoD heavily.<br />
Now we've done Quarm 4 times in a row with a ~55 person raid force.<br />
We didn't have to stoop to flagging some other guild and allying with them and giving them half of our loot just so we can get to Quarm.<br />
Doing things on your own is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Allying with other guilds to do backflags is ok, cuz no one likes doing them.<br />
Allying with another guild to be able to do Time is a waste of good guild loots.<br />
Find some new recruits, do a round of backflagging, and clear time on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, that sucks. But it really IS your guild's fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, that sucks. But it really IS your guild's fault.<br />
<br />
I have to agree.  Don't blame it on the class when shaman whom YOU helped get there were on the raid.  If I were you, I would be bordering on furious.<br />
<br />
From what you say YOU did the other guilds a favor, Time flagging them all for a combined effort, but it was YOU guys who took the initiative.  Therefore, you get dibs.<br />
<br />
Most people just care about themselves, so I'd implement some tough love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My last Quarm I was the main healer in my group, and we were the only group in which nobody died during the fight. <br />
Rotate hots,nadox,grc,a few emegency blast heals.<br />
Shaman are far more useful against quarm than any other mob in time. <br />
Funny how they dropped you for dps when I always support the dps group. bard,rogue,rogue,rogue, other priest/pally is what I get 4 out of 5 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes the 72 raid limit is kinder nasty cos it forces you to leave poeple out , specially after guilds had geared up to way past that.<br />
<br />
that said , one late night after a few logged we killed quarm on second attempt with 54 ppl:)<br />
<br />
shaman are useful in this to cure , patch heal various dots. there is always a shaman in the cleric groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I also have to agree. This is more the guilds fault then SoE, though im not saying SoE isnt partly at the heart of this.<br />
<br />
Point is, if you were in the time geared guild that helped people get flagged you had the right to be one of the shaman in the raid. Im not saying you should quit your guild, but they should have spoke up on your behave if its upsets you this much. Or perhaps they didnt know it upset you this much ?<br />
<br />
Either way, im sorry you didnt get to kill quarm, i think we all have been in your shoes at some point, i know i was on RZ. Sucks man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We actually kick out beastlords from the raid (we have 7 active beastlords) to bring in shamans on Quarm.  We have beastlords cure tanks of Quarm's adds' slow, but they never do, so the tanks complain and get them removed from the raid and replaced with shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not actually to quarm yet but we are in time and have done threw phase 5. I have to agree with what I know of phase 4 and 5 (which it looks like you still had left to do) and of quarms fight shaman are very useful your guild just had thier head up thier asses when they dropped you for some random dps.<br />
<br />
Phase 4 you've got terris, saryrn and vallon that all spawn adds. My experience with them is that they need to be debuffed asap. Also terris and saryrn have ae mana drain dots which can be a world of hurt on new folks there with low resists. Definitely could see a 3rd better geared shaman being useful on them.<br />
<br />
Phase 5 you've got Rallos and inny that spawn adds multiples at a time that will need to be debuffed and Berts ae dot which a shaman can cure on the whole group in one cast. Call me crazy but being able to cure a 700 hps a tick dot on the entire group in 1 cast sounds pretty useful to me. Not quite babs but still call it really handy on that fight.<br />
<br />
Lets see phase 6 and quarm himself. Respawns 3 times threw the fight so needs to be redebuffed 4 times. Has multiple ae dd's and dots that need to be cured and healed. Once again shaman can group cure the poison and disease stuff, cure the curses and keep thier group up very effectively threw the ae with Q/BoT. Given that efficiency so you don't run oom is more important that big fast heals shaman win hands down in that area especially with thier more effetive curing.<br />
<br />
Honestly can't see why anyone who actually knew what to expect with these fights would not want to take an additional shaman with them especially since you should be the best geared and most familier with the phase 4 fights of the shaman there.</div></div><hr />

Group cure and piles of adds to debuff/slow plus quarm's exploding head trick really let shaman shine. Granted, we've only beaten quarm twice now and resists are still an issue for some. After he's farm bait, I'm sure 3-4 shaman will be better, but for now the more the merrier.<br />

They'd have some serious asskissing to do to make that one up to me. I call shenanigans on your raidleader, beat him with a broomstick. I haven't sen quarm yet, hell, I haven't even seen tactics yet, but as long a fight as it probably is, I can't see a reason why a shaman WOULDN'T bein demand, given everything we can handle. DPS classes are good only as long as they are alive, thats where we come in.</div></div><hr />

Malos/malosinia/slow/cripple Quarm and each head as they fall off. Send in the hounds on head 1 to get rid of AEs asap. Heal group and other people around hurt by AE. Blood of Nadox on group to cure AEs, takes 2 casts. Remove greater curse on group and others to cure manadrain/slow ae. Heal group. Possibly help with CC mobs though there is no way I have time for that usually. I do more on Quarm than any other mob in Time.</div></div><hr />

or the fact that apart from the group poison/desease cure, pallies, cleric druid can all do what we do too. and a beast or enc could slow the heads. (pallies actuually more useful with a group cure)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>DarkFather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Slace, you totally miss the point!<br />
<br />
just a few words, because this post makes me verry angry!<br />
<br />
from your words it sounds that your Guild (Nexxus of Faith) did all the work in this &quot;new Alliance&quot;... fact is that NoF was no longer able to finish Time... ya, NoF was not even able to backflag their new recruits.<br />
What i wanna say is that all the 3 guilds did their part in our new alliance, and not only NoF...<br />
You think that you have more right to join &quot;this&quot; special time raid than the two other shamys just because &quot;you had your time flag in 2003&quot;??<br />
bull****!... the two other shamys have done the same like you for this time raids... the same work! like everyone!!<br />
NoF Raiders dont have a privilege on this Raids just because they are NoF... understand this. When you Raid with BaG/FD everyone has the same rights, no one will be favoured!!<br />
<br />
btw, it was an agreement from both raidleaders (yea two... NoF actually joined a raid alliance) that they choose who can come and who not. We had 98 Time flagged people at this sunday, so 26 people had to go.<br />
<br />
search the word &quot;alliance&quot; in your dictionary and learn what it means... as long as you dont understand that you are part of an &quot;alliance&quot; you will never understand what i mean.<br />
<br />
Sorry for this words, but those things makes me sick<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw... just that you cannot cry because of an anon posting... Ronya from FD speeking here. Oh ya and dont search for mistakes in my posting... english is not my native language :D<br />
<br />
btw, i hope this stops here... this should not be posted on an open board</div></div><hr />
