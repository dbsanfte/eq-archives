<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have notice a disturbing thing thru my EQ career as a ranger. The thing is that I always seem to have to be LFG for over two or three hours ( sometimes a lot longer)  before I can find a group, even in PoP type zones. I am a level 59 ranger atm and it seems to be getting harder to find groups since all the zones are populated like crazy. So I was wondering if I should just stick wih the old method of being LFG or should I just start my own groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do both. Try to join groups already in place, if that doesn't work attempt to form your own party if enough people are available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Join a good guild and stick to guild groups.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you get snapped up quick join a group.But start your own if you go 15 minutes without an invite.Plenty of other people lfg too in PoP who dont want to sit on their arses.Now you may not get the &quot;perfect group&quot; but you can usually cobble some thing workable together out of the /who lfg spam.<br />
<br />
And after awhile ,if people think you have an idea of what your doing,they will shoot you tells asking if they can join &quot;your&quot; group.I have pretty big list of people who I met by starting groups who will come join me anytime,even leaving groups to come join mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lasalle Stormreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's what happens with the LFG process.<br />
<br />
Dozens of people whose guilds don't have any exp groups going turn on LFG.  The, something called &quot;diffusion of responsibility&quot; occurs-- all the LFG folks assume that they will be invited to an exp group that is already running.  <br />
<br />
The trick is that as exp groups in PoP lose people, those folks tend to find in-guild replacements or find replacements from people who are LFG in /ooc in that particular zone.  The quickest method to get their replacement so they can log.<br />
<br />
The short message here is, always take the initiative to start your own group with the other people who are LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dlaritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A ranger is pretty versatile.  You should be able to scrounge up enough people that arent wanting to just waste their time LFGing.  Ya its not the perfect group all the time, but youd be suprised about just how much having a reputation as a good xp grouper will do for you.  Make a few friends by starting some groups and over time reap the rewards by having those friends send you tells from other zones asking if you want to xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Philby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grab: Shaman or Chanter<br />
Grab: Cleric or Druid<br />
Grab: Plate Tank or You (depending upon camp)<br />
<br />
Any other classes work, so don't waste time looking for the ideal group.<br />
<br />
The shaman/enchanter is the most important slot. A shaman can even act as healer/slower/haster in an easy camp. Helps if you have paladin/sk to keep agro and if ranger/paladin/BL has KEI to heal the cannibing shaman. <br />
<br />
Enchanters get nervous with druids as main healer, due to their more limited variety of heals plus no rezzer but it is doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarlyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild has an alliance woth 3 other guilds, none of us very large. We have our own channel. When I am LFG, there are always others in the channel who are LFG but don't have whatever to start their own group. So I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Step 1) ask guild/friends if anyone has a group, or if they know of anyone looking for someone that a ranger would fit.<br />
Step 2) put LFG on<br />
Step 3) start actively looking for groups. If it's not above your annoyance tolerance, have friends in the popular exp zones to look for you in /ooc or whatever.<br />
Step 4) /who all LFG 55 60 &lt;-- fit in level range of choice. you can also add in a class to that search. It's powerful. :p<br />
Step 5) have people you're forming the group with ask their friends or whatever. This should happen automatically, but not always. :p<br />
<br />
There's nothing worse than people who sit somewhere LFG doing tradeskills or whatever and whining how they can't get a group. Getting a group is a proactive deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Duoing w/ a 60 shamen I've found that the best core to a grp is a slower (Shamen, Chanter) and Healer (Druid, Shamen, Cleric).  If you have these 2, your fine.   Having a 60 shamen make getting a group for a 54 ranger that much easier.  But sometimes (like last night) things just arn't meant to be.  Had the RCY camp in PoD reserved, could not get a group for the life of me.  There were only 5 players LFG on the entire server (/who all lfg).  Gave up and decided to go to Burning Woods and start my epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xlurkerx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have problem with finding groups too, 65 hunting in PoP.<br />
<br />
Problem is, I'm not exactly well-known, I'm not guilded yet (applying atm), so I don't get invited to guild/friend groups.<br />
<br />
Trick is, to get some friends and guildies that will hunt with you preferrably over a pickup group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nunyas Bidness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">blah... when ever i end up LFG i usually go to someplace i can solo and leave the flag on... that way if i get an invite i do... if i don't then i didn't waste my xp time sittin around on my arse...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>triggerbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LFG has been tough.  I am a 62 ranger and find it almost impossible to get a group.  I am very lucky to have an awesome guild that groups with me alot .    IF I had to rely on LFG i would have quit the game becuase I would never get a group.<br />
<br />
So if I cannt get a guild group with is rare now I will forrm my own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Alrighty then. Thanks for replying to my post. I will try out all of the advice that you have given me. Thanks very much again. I appreciate all the replies . I remeber seeing a post from someone 65 that solo. I am just a bit curious as to where a ranger in the higher levels can solo? Just curious is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Killanyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I usually have a hard time getting a group in PoV since many don't even know what rangers can do damagewise. Many times a 61 monk with epic fist and stave of shielding will get picked over me (AM3 ranger). So instead I just started soloing in honor graveyard and got 62 that way. It's actually better exp then alot of the groups i've gotten in PoV. It reminds me of a long time ago when I had to level up in dreadlands with a cleric, huge lag time between pulls, people going afk at odd times, groups breaking up in 5 minutes, etc. Generally pickup groups suck..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My advice, make some friends to exp with often. This is my method of choice for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">do you have any knowledge how many groups that Ive formed over the past 3+ years heh?  Im sure so many others have done the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tirronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I am a 59 ranger on A Ro.  My exp with LFG is so so.  Friends of mine will invite me and some that know me will ask for me also.  I do notice a growing knowledge that rangers can deal lots of damage and that helps in PoP.  Still I end up forming groups about half the time.  I don't have EQ or AM3 yet and that is my goal after 60.  I do hope someday the general population will realise how great rangers can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Utherwayn Leafwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes diffusion of responsibility is totally what happens, I now have no problems with getting XP groups because I just wait and I grab whoever is LFG promise them riches then go have a good time people are starting to get to know me hehe.</div></div><hr />

Friend and Guild groups are the way to go, less aggravation, but pickup groups can still be alot of fun for a change of pace.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hehehehe, I must be likethe only Luclin ranger here. I have yet to see one post under my topics or others. Then again I may have bad vision. You know with all the eye straining in EQ I think I'm going blind. LOL . j/k  :)<br />
<br />
BTW thanks for the resonse I am starting to get groups a bit better. Hopefully it will stay  that way. Only problem now is when something drops I have been like rolling under 20 when the seed is like 700+. Must be ranger's luck or a tradeoff for getting groups, but I don't mind as long as I get groups I am good.<br />

Thanks again . I really do appreciate the time and effort to reply to my post. Untill we meet again my Tunare and Karana lead you to journeys afar and keep you safe under the glade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Garawin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, it kind of depends on my energy level. If I feel up to it and no guild groups available or all full, I'll start a group up. Once you have 3 people things seem to get easier.<br />
<br />
However, sometimes I just don't feel like having the responsibility of doing the organizing, camp finding etc. and just go LFG and use our servers (Karana) &quot;plane&quot; channel to advertise I'm LFG. If I can't get a group at this point after 15 or 20 minutes I usually log an alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I do neither, pickup groups=bad.  I stopped joining pickup groups about a year ago.  They almost always have a death in them, there are always lots of idiots and there is no chemistry with the people.  Just join a guild and group with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>daktarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Generally, when I log on I sit in the bazaar for a few mins just looking at whats for sale and making sure I have enough stuff to get through the days adventure.  I generally throw the LFG flag up.  I generally get a tell for a group once a week or so (more if I play later at night or earlier in afternoon).  If by the time I'm done in the bazaar I don't have a group, I try to round up a few friends and guildies to start one and then throw in folks from the LFG pool to plug holes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vectors</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I usually start my own group.  Tough for me at my level to get into an established group.<br />
<br />
I always log on, turn on LFG and begin doing a /lfg search for clerics.  Then enchanters.  Then shamans.  Then warriors.  Then fill out the other two spots.<br />
<br />
Some nights I spend about three out of four hours sending random tells and getting replacements.    What always happens in these pick up groups is that by the time you are ready to start, some one has to leave.  Your screwed if it is the cleric/enchanter/shaman.   Begin the search again, wait 15 min for them to get there, they get there, someone else has to leave, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
Ideally I could just hunt with my guild, but most are 60 plus and are in Tier 2 zones, so not much help there.<br />
<br />
Pick up groups = Evil, but neccessary</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've probably had more good pickup groups than bad ones, so I don't avoid them.  But I will try to make sure it looks like a decent group before I commit to it.  I like to stick with a group once I've joined it, not ditch them the first time some little thing goes wrong.   There is a feeling of satisfaction that comes from getting a group of random people to become an efficient XP machine, especially after getting off to a bad start.  But if things are really hopeless, I'm going to ditch them and avoid those people in future.<br />
<br />
Fortunately CR's in POP are trivial, so at least a bad group that results in a death isn't going to result in hours of CR and a ruined evening.<br />
<br />
I'll throw on my LFG flag, try for a guild group, and see what happens.  Sometimes I get something right away, sometimes two hours later I'm still looking (in which case I have been soloing or doing something during that time, not sitting there staring at the screen...).<br />
<br />
It depends  a bit on my mood also.  I'll try to put together pick-up groups sometimes, but it helps a lot in that case to already have some of the core people for it. It is rather daunting to sit there and try to find cleric, shaman, (CC), (plate tank) all at once.  Much easier to fill out a group with one or two more than to build one totally from scratch.  If it takes too long to put together the group, people will get bored and wander off or join a different group (especially if they are the key classes like shaman or cleric).<br />
<br />
It helps a lot to be able to solo while having LFG on.  I used to solo in POD while LFG, now I solo in POV (root/shoot in both cases).  But in all cases (unless I am in a really anti-social mood or planning to camp in a half hour) I prefer an XP group to soloing.<br />
