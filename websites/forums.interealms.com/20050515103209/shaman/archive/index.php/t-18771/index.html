Did anyone notice this;<br />
&quot;New Tribute System enhances gameplay by allowing players to choose beneficial attributes, skills, or effects through offerings at their home cities. &quot;</div></div><hr />

Don't talk Neriak to me - I nearly died twice just scouting around to find the guy to start the Wayfarer business.  Having a guild leader and trainer in the Foreign Quarter does not make this place any more homey than Oggok/Shodow Haven/Shar Vahl<br />

Setting up another way to rub salt in the wound must make the devs laugh, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My main is an agnostic warrior, of course he was created back when everyone recommended agnostic.  The only thing this made me wonder was if this was going to be another deity specific screw-over like the way a lot of the deity specific armor turned out.  Guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This sounds really promising and I guess to an extent it may tie in with the speculation that certain aa could be acquired differently.</div></div><hr />

I am in same boat as you, and hope to god that is not what it is...would be nice if one of the things you could do with this system is change diety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wouldn't be suprised to see them offer diety change as their next $50 service...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know that in PoK on the evils side when you talk to the monk guild leader he talks about our weak agnostic choice of a god and talks about the strength of his and how we should worship him.  I wonder if its another quest that we havent figured out.  Might be the warrior guild leader too.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think it makes everyone laugh. Laughing at trolls is a passtime for me...especially if they are fellow shaman. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Like I said in a post about EQII, if they keep making things easier and easier, its gunna take a maybe 10 hours to ding 65... Need examples. PoP, some of us who played b4 it remember boats!?!? /GASP Luclin, more hunting for obsenely fast xp. I could name more, but I gotta go get some Mc'D's...  To sum it up, what happened to the RP element of EQ? Now its all about A) Get to 65 as fast as possible, and B) Get PoT flagged and own everything. If GoD gives noobies 1 more option to get to 65 faster, I just might lose it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who cares how long it takes to get to 65?  Just face it, EQ starts at 50 now when you can group with all your friends, or maybe even 58 when you can LDON with them.  Why should that bother you?<br />
<br />
About 80% of the pre-60 population is level 65's PLing their alts anyway, so it's impossible for the other 20% to get a reasonable group.  Get them up to 50+ ASAP so they can participate.</div></div><hr />
