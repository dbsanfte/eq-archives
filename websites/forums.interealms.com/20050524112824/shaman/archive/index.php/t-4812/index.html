<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 57.  No epic, have Bane of Nife &amp; a Fungi.  All my good solo spots are now light blue &amp; was wondering if I could take the Iksar guards, either in WW or FOB.  They wander so I'm pretty sure I can get a solo.  They are listed at level 50 in EQ Atlas.  Anyone ever try them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Claymoore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just from exp.. alot of guards like that are very resistant.. i havnt killed any iksar guards but i do know that alot of others can be very resistant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Level 50 guard npcs = bad idea, Trooper Taer (The fob guard that wanders far from the gate) quads for 150ish with a VERY low delay and is as good as magic immune, oh he outruns sow with ease too (I've had the pleasure of accidently agroing him before).  The same seems to be pretty much true of all the Kunark guards regarding magic resistance, the goons in OT are incredibly resisty if not immune, heck even the level 30ish guards roaming the FV/DL tunnel are resisty even after malo =)<br />
<br />
I've tried my luck with Qeynos hills guards a couple of times though, but with no luck yet, low damage output, but again incredibly resisty =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When i was still playing my wizard all the time someone asked about that on graffes.  A lvl 60 something or other went and tested it and got serverely waxed by them. Think even if you killed em wouldnt be worth the exp per effort required. Chardok was nice for 57 for myself but only if you can get a camp. I was lucky for a few days and did the whole lvl there in pretty good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Claymoore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if i remember right.. 57 is the first lvl you can single pull at zone in.. solo there.. nuthin beats HS solo exp.. cept maybe hawt dorf sex0rs.. but lets not get into that..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Plus, the crusaders will FUBAR you.<br />
<br />
Nasty harm touch, high level pet, triple for 400, 20khp, and completely MR.<br />
<br />
I remember when Kunark went live, and some guard killing druid decided to go hit Iksar guards. The crusader out-ran her sow and ate her in about 5 hits. She was whining, everyone else was laughing, very very hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had the exact same thought once. <br />
<br />
Everytime I ported into Cab from the firepots I was tempted to go for a solo near zone. I finally decided to give it a try out in the field. I called in my level 60 ranger friend. We buffed up and he single pulled one. It was quading in the 250 range if I remember correctly. We aggroed another that was MILES away and the ranger dropped fast. I couldn't land anything on them. As he was getting beat he called for me to make my escape. <br />
<br />
Their con is a joke. Just keep walking, nothing to see here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Might try the guards inside the city if that is your bent.  Anything outside that might be &quot;protecting&quot; lower level chars is usually mean with MR that makes dragons look gimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try pulling a guard into the PvP arena. On the off chance you die, you may not lose exp. (Don't know if that was fixed in all zones)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahh I love our iksar guards, Im pretty sure they are just about the toughest guards in the game.  <br />
<br />
The troopers which are the easier ones than the sk crusaders, triple or quad maybe for 187 with about 150% haste.<br />
<br />
Pretty damn close to invincible if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">katta guards....by bank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's the concept...  N00b guards are there to guard the n00bz.  The risk to reward on ALL of these guards is crappy because of that.  Often, inside the city the guards that look just the same give good exp, but not outside.  Verant was sick of hearing from n00bz that died to this or that mob because the guards they designed to help out were killed by high levels looking for some great exp.  It's also the reason that they removed all loot from any mob that's designated as a merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When uber monsters attack.... other uber monsters.<br />
<br />
There is a mob in the Field of Bone named Pendle Dash-something.  He sits near Kaesora and lets people know they can be bound there now.  He is very green to level 51.<br />
<br />
Well, I got cocky one day and felt like taking him out.  I was 53, had my Epic and decently equipped.  Start off with Epic since I have the time to set up (he is not KoS even though he is an elf).  Resisted, and then the chase was on!  I tried Root, Immobilize, Malosi, Turgurs and everything I could get memmed before he would catch up with me.  But nothing would stick, and he hit hard and fast.<br />
<br />
So off the the Cabilis guards I went.  My first thought was to zone, but when we got close the Iksar guards came to my aid.  I turned around and saw 4 Iksar guards (Trooper Taer, Quarg, and a couple others) pounding the living crap out of Pendle.  But Pendle held his own!  The fight went on for minutes and Pendle actually managed to kill a guard or two, who instantly respawned and rejoined the fight.<br />
<br />
After several more minutes Pendle did fall.  Very long fight, and hilarious to watch!  Not as fun as watching the Kelethin guards fight the PoD and seeing lowbies dying from the PoD's AoE spells, but still a sight to behold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">lol i know pendle. I nuked him once with the my wizard for the heck of it and resist. Cast snare resist and started smacking me for 170ish i luckily made the zone to kaesora. <br />
<br />
   Fast forward a bit and a friend of mine is deleting a noob bard he made and was lvling in fob. He didnt feel like transfering the few items he had so he put them on Pendle. Another friend of mine wanted the boots he had put on pendle so he wanted to kill him and asked me to help. I told him I'd be glad to watch you zone but we have no chance. He cast slow and sent in pet. Pet was dead roughly 10 seconds later watched my friend run into kaesora lol. Think pendle went blue to me in my 30's but he is tough.</div></div><hr />

Ya think pendle's KOS to Tangrin? <br />
<br />
I'd put my money on Pendle in a bout versus Tangrin.  But you better pull Pendle to the island instead of trying to pull the Tangrin.  Tangrin is faster than SoW.  :)</div></div><hr />
