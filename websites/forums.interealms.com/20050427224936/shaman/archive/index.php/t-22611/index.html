<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zrrak420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone got a good map of BoT that might show where these camps I hear of are?  I've recently started hunting there, and I've been to le and ss.  Other than that, I dont know where to go when I hear the other initials.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its not so much of mapping things as just understanding how BoT is arranged.  I'll try to help.<br />
<br />
When you zone into BoT, you are in the graveyard.  Exit this area up the stairs into another room and directly across from you is a small room that is referred to as SS or Safe Spot.  You can sit in this room afk and be reasonably assured that you won't get trained.<br />
<br />
Leaving SS you go to your right and up some stairs into a large &quot;courtyard&quot; type area.  This is the point of reference for the rest of the standard BoT camps.<br />
<br />
There are four &quot;halls&quot; you can kill in.  North, South, East and West.  Some of the halls are fairly small . . . North and West for instance.  Some are much larger and can support two (East) or even three (South) groups killing in them.<br />
<br />
UE for instance stands for Upper East.  I've also seen it called Deep East.  Most of the times people who do this camp will set up in the room that is near the little strip of water on the map.  There are a lot of places they could be, but usually it's this room.<br />
<br />
LE stands for Lower East.  Most times people doing this camp are actually in the courtyard of BoT pulling the mobs down the ramp.<br />
<br />
US stands for upper south.  I've also heard this called Deep South.  This usually means the group is in the huge room far into the South hall.  You can't miss this room, it's freakin' gigantic.<br />
<br />
MS stands for Mid South.  It is, strangely enough, about halfway between LS and US.  There is a room with a bunch of giant sized tables in it that is typically used as the &quot;camp spot&quot;.<br />
<br />
LS stands for Lower South.  Most of the time LS is pulled to the courtyard area.<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't take but a few visits to start to understand the camps in BoT.  They aren't really much more than descriptions of where the party is killing at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zrrak420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks that clears it up alot.  I just didnt want to be the guy the group tells to come to ** and I go where is that? lol.  thanks again</div></div><hr />

The camp names vary wildly depending on server.  If Sudedor is on the same server as you (I didn't look) then use his terminology.<br />
<br />
US=Upper Sand on E. Marr, not Upper South.  I don't remember if Sand wing is to the south or not.<br />
UB=Upper Blizzard, UL=Upper Lightning, UW=Upper Wind.  MSL=middle sand left.  LS=Lower Sand.  The lower camps typically pull nearby the stairs right to the area on the side nearest their wing.  Lower camps on E. Marr frequently get trained repeatedly by middle and upper camps (and even by another lower camp's mobs) camp that have an incompetent group.<br />
 <br />
The named spawnpoints are also sometimes called by their mob's first name.  So the UB camp might also be called out as &quot;Oreen&quot; when someone asks for a camp check.<br />
<br />
The 'courtyard' area on E. Marr is the spot in BoT where the sparky dildo is (to enter the Agnarr lair), not the area nearby the 'safe room'.  Courtyard is typically the gather point used for BoT Tower &amp; Agnarr raids on E. Marr.<br />
<br />
I personally avoid BoT except for raids most of the time.  I recommend always zoning in to BoT invisible. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Frek - Sand/Earth is South.<br />
<br />
And I think Wind is West as well, though I've never seen 2 groups in that area to warrant an upper / lower distinction.<br />
<br />
BoT is boring and can be dangerous, but for those who haven't gotten far in their planar progression, it's really the best experience available.</div></div><hr />

On povar is Sand/water/fire/wind.<br />
<br />
us/ms/ls<br />
uw/lw....sometimes middle water..if people are runing out of camps<br />
<br />
fire....one camp most times<br />
<br />
wind..one camp most times...sand and water are the most camped..fire and wind seldom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On Cazic Thule server, TS (Top Sand), MS(this is actually a corner of the room with generally 4 Jords, and is between the pull spots for the 2 Krigers/named in the table room, and the 2 named/krigers in the other room), and BS(bottom sand).  Also, have Oreen/MW/BW (for the water/blizzard wing), Lightning wing is a whole 1 group camp generally, and tornado wing... I honestly dunno, almost nobody ever xp's/hunts that wing. Go figger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Though I try to stay out of BoT when able, as I find I can exp elsewhere and not have to deal with the trains and such(preferably LDoNs). Druzzil Ro seems to differ from those already listed.<br />
<br />
Camps go something like this...<br />
<br />
Top -&gt; Sand/Earth Top<br />
Mid -&gt; Sand/Earth Mid<br />
Bottom -&gt; Sand/Earth Bottom<br />
Oreen -&gt; All mobs in water near/around Oreen's spawn point<br />
ORares -&gt; the other water/blizzard camp, has the other rare spawn<br />
               points and mobs that Oreen doesn't<br />
Light -&gt; Lighting wing<br />
Wind -&gt; Tornado/Wind wing<br />
and occasinally &quot;Courtyard&quot; which is the open area with stormriders and such between the towers.</div></div><hr />

That is a really kick-ass map of BoT.  Wish I had that about 6 months ago...<br />
<br />
*Edit for spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I was on Karana, camps were called:<br />
<br />
Inner North, Middle North, and Outer North<br />
Inner South, Middle South, and Outer South<br />
For East, it was mainly Outer and Inner.<br />
For West, it was just West.<br />
<br />
For all I know, this could have changed.  I haven't been on Karana for six months - thank goodness :D<br />
<br />
I have no clue what the camps are called on Morden.  I haven't stepped into BoT unless we are backflagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On Bristlebane the camps are called:<br />
<br />
E=East<br />
W=West<br />
N=North<br />
SB=South Bottom<br />

ST=South Top<br />
Bees=Courtyard near entrances to the greater towers (named after the ugly giant bee-like mobs there)</div></div><hr />
