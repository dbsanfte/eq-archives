<br />
had thought about spirit call but its a toy and would rather get something that i use constanlty and makes a more of a difference. <br />
<br />
what route did people take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spell Casting Mastery: Nice mana preservation on this, it's pretty highly recommended around here.<br />
<br />
Currently I have SCR 3, with Crown of Ambivalence I get 1800 hp out of Torpor pretty regularly, I heal back what I canni5 down. 3.5 more aa til SCRM.<br />
<br />
QB is nice of course, I have QB1 and will be working on it after SCRM.<br />
<br />
Spiritcall is nice enough for 4 points, I'm happy with it. Don't have Virulent Paralysis yet so I can't comment on it.<br />
<br />
Combat Agility can wait for me, I have enough experience with the game to try and avoid aggro altogether... it'd be nice but there's other things I'd like to get first.<br />
<br />
What you do is really up to you, you have a good start on AA, choose the one that's best for your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went SCR/SCRM before some of the stuff you even mentioned. It's awesome for torpor and it benefits all your buffs as well so it's double win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get at least one level of QB before you finish off scr IMO.  It's still a nice boost on torpors, and handy on hastes / other buffs too.  I think I'm going for SCM next, though nd is really tempting.  I want to put points in spirit call, but I just think at least 1 in all the others would be more useful first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">QB1: -10% casting time for 3aa<br />
5.4 sec torpor<br />
<br />
QB2: -25% casting time (another -15% for 6aa)<br />
4.5 sec torpor<br />
<br />
QB3: -50% casting time (another -25% for 3aa)<br />
3.0 sec torpor<br />
<br />
As you can see, QB1 is the most bang for your AA.  QB2 is a good choice if you plan on getting high level spell haste focus items that aren't limited by spell duration (enhancement haste won't affect torpor).  QB3 would make spell haste focus useless since the total cap is 50%, but would be a great choice if you have nothing else to spend the AA on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SCR gives 2.5% duration/1 aa<br />
SCRM gives 4% duration/1 aa (20% more for just 5 aa)<br />
<br />
If you're going for SCR at all, go for SCRM.  That's where the big payoff is.  Or, look at it this way: SCR3 costs 6 aa and gives you a mere +15% buff duration.  SCRM gives you +20% for only 5 aa.<br />
<br />
QB1 on the other hand is the best bang for the buck out of the whole QB line.<br />
<br />
Can5 first, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Uman,<br />
<br />
Only problem is that SCRM is 8 points and not 5.<br />
<br />
It is listed on Casters Realm as 5 points but when you check<br />
it in game it is 8 points and the 2.5 % / aa ratio is maintained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what route did people take? <br />
<br />
Personally I went<br />
run3 -&gt; regen3 -&gt; MC3 -&gt; Cann 5 -&gt; MGB -&gt; QB1 -&gt; ND3 -&gt; SCM3 -&gt; Spirit call -&gt; radiant cure -&gt;scr3 -&gt; scrm -&gt; QB2<br />
<br />
and thats where i'm at now. I did ND 3 right when they added it for shaman. After mgb until ND was added I kinda slacked off on aa. SCM3 came right after pop came out. <br />
<br />
Spell casting mastery is definitely nice. The mana savings is always good. I've found it to be very worth while.<br />
<br />
Spirit call is some what of a toy but relatively cheap and does add a descent amount of dmg when needed.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion of QB is to stop at lvl 2. This should max you out or very close to it with a descent enhancement haste item. Something like a Speed of Mithaniel item or the leggings from vt with Wind of the Nightcrawler are perfect paired up with QB2. Gets all your buffs, torpor included down to thier 50% cast time and hastes all other benificial spells too. Since I hope to get one of these items either way to help speed up my TM among other things I don't see any reason to spend the 9 points on qb3 currently.<br />
<br />
SCR and SCRM are definitely nice and 1800hps torpors go very well with cann v. It's also nice to have longer lasting buffs, especially haste if your having to cast it. <br />
<br />
CA is nice but you probably want lightning relfexs with it too which brings the total cost up quite a bit. It's nice to not get hit when we do get aggro but how much time do you really spend getting beat on compaired to casting spells to save mana or make them last longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So far: run3, regen3, mc3, canni5, scr1, hg1, qbuff1, MGB, Spiritcall 1, scr2 in that order<br />
<br />
Next planned is: scr3, scrm, qb2 for elder title<br />
<br />
Then I'll probably do VP/RC to one level, then nd3, then maybe some aa to help Tnargs better (2600 crits with hg1 make me smile)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My progression so far which I like, was <br />
Run Speed 3 then I got SC1 then got regen 3 followed by MC1,2,3 and cann 5. Since then got Radiant Cure(very nice and VERY glad I bought it) SCR2(buffs lasting longer, just my own personal prefence like me tuning this page), CA1(noticing the misses more) I will carry on to CA2, then get SCM 1 and 2. Deciding which has helped me most I will progress to a 3rd lvl of one of these or go for QB1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ahpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have scr3+srcm and QB3. 3sec on Quiescence with 1800hp dot heal is very useful on xp/raid ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SCR3 is not 15%, it's 30%.  That and SCRM, for another 20%, give you a total of 50% extended buffs and torpor.<br />
<br />
I posted detailed opinions about this elsewhere, but they came down to basically, I thought the best thing to do was find what helps shamans most and work on that, with the others as accessories.  <br />
<br />
To me that was torpor and canni.  It makes sense, because the ways we can improve torpor and canni add very dramatically to our power.  Not just a little -- a ton.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 is no question the first thing you should do, but you have it.  So the rest of the truly important stuff is all about torpor. <br />
<br />
Which aspect of torpor mattered most?<br />
<br />
I asked myself what my most dramatic problems were.  Solo, if I died or had real problems, it was almost always because I got too many interrupts before a torpor was able to land.  I could almost always land a slow sooner or later; landing torpor was the problem, and doing it seemed to solve most problems.  Grouping, the biggest problem was the same thing, plus not being able to land torpor on OTHERS fast enough due to interrupts or what have you.<br />
<br />
So I went with quickbuff, so I could land torpor faster.  The first level, frankly I didn't notice.  The second level seemed HUGE.  The third level I put off for a while.  <br />
<br />
Well, then I mixed in SCR and ND.  My hitpoints really aren't so hot, so I found myself casting canni 5 less often than I wanted to.  I like to do it during fights when possible, but it was always tricky, because low hitpoint aggro isn't a pleasant thing.  <br />
<br />
I picked up a couple of hundred points by the time I got through ND3.  This definitely helped me max canni 5 use. SCR3 made my torpor last 30% longer, which really made a huge difference -- an extra tic on torpor was pretty mighty, bigger than it sounds.  And longer hastes are a godsend.  I think someone said you can get an extra tick out of torpor just by getting SCR2.  I was going to power through to SCRM too though, so I pushed through SCR3 as the prerequisite.  SCR3 was very, very worth it.<br />
<br />
If I remember right, I snuck in at one level or two of SCM.  It's been a while now so it's harder to remember.  I was very unimpressed.  Ultimately, SCM3 is supposed to save you some nice mana and add up.  In truth, I found it hard to notice.  Saving mana is simply not a huge priority with me as a shaman compared to some other things.  Certainly even with SCM3, I didn't notice anything as dramatically beneficial as I got from ND3, QB2 and 3, SCR3, or SCRM.  That's a LOT of points right there -- all of them better value than SCM in my opinion.  ALL very notable and useful.  I think I got SCM2, found it nothing to cheer about, then went back to it out of a sense of obligation almost after I got SCRM.  SCRM rocked the house.  Eventually I went back and got QB3.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend all the things that effect torpor and canni.  At this point, my survivability and the general ease of doing things is far greater, as I can cast in a torpor that lasts 50% longer in half the time for only 160 mana(specialization plus SCM3).  A 3.0 heal for 1800(with a possible extra tick sneaking in for 2100) is a huge deal and a massive improvement.  That stuff will make a difference you can feel every session.<br />
<br />
What else have I gotten so far?  Nothing near as important.  I don't have too much more than 110 AA.  Radiant cure 1 was very nice, spiritcall is fun and free damage.  Combat agility 2 -- I suppose it's probaby good.  Can't say it's making a difference I really notice.  Critical Fury 1 -- it's very nice to crit!  Torrents are 720 max, ice strike(with a focus item) I've gotten from the normal 675 to 1022 I think it was, 1021, whatever.  But...it doesn't happen often enough.  Can't say it adds up to a lot of damage overall, but it only costs a few points, so seems worth it for at least one level.  Healing gift 1 -- seems pretty nice when it works -- actually I think I've only critted a heal 3 times in the weeks I've had it, but one might well have saved my life.  When you need a heal, sometimes you need it bad.  Probably a fully maxed healing gift and its PoP version will be very nice when using the level 62 Tnarg's Mending -- not worthwhile really till then, as you can crit on chloroblast but not kraggs.  Crits seem exceedingly rare so far, because I do so much of my healing with torpor or kraggs.  MGB -- almost never have used it.  Might have been the first person of any class on my server to get it; doubt I've used it more than a dozen times.  If you're the only shaman in your guild, its value rises a lot. <br />
<br />
Well, that's the stuff I can remember.  None of it is worth a damn compared to QB/SCR/SCRM/ND, and to a lesser extent SCM.  SCM is eventually a keeper because you might as well save mana, right?  Even if it's undramatic.  And ND is not nearly as important for shamans with better gear and plenty of hitpoints.  But for day in day out always-there and always-working utility, I'd go QB/SCR/SCRM in that order.  QB3 may or may not be a priority depending on your focus gear, but QB2 is very dramatic; I truly believe it is by far the best thing to get after canni 5.  Er...assuming you have torpor.<br />
<br />
(Edited cuz I saw I typed in tnargs instead of kraggs TWICE --ugh--musta been kinda misleading, but hopefully the context made my error not too weird.  Anyway, fixed now.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Blarg, SCR3 is 15% more than SCR2.  And yes, I was wrong about the AA cost from SCRM (web page I looked at was).  Every AA toward SCRM helps equally (well, there's a bigger difference between 105% and 100% than there is 110% and 105% but ... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm level 61, i have Canni V, and 1 point into my next choice<br />
i'm running 50/50 till i get to 65 .. no rush .. and i want to accumulate AAs while i go about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">do you need SCR 1 or 2 to get the extra tic on torpor every time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">SCR3 to get the first extra tick everytime I belive, if I remember right, SCR1 made me far more likely to get a 1500 heal, SCR2 for some reason set me back to getting 1200 heals everytime,  SCR3 meant consistent 1500 heals with frequent 1800s, SCRM = consistent 1800 with frequent 2100 heals.  Quick buff, SCM and SCRM are all fantastic really, you can't go wrong with any of them, bumping Radiant cure up to 2 wouldnt be a bad idea either though, RC1 was always highly unreliable for me.<br />
<br />
Personally, if your more of a raiding shaman, go for QB2 or 3 first, if your more of a soloer, get SCM, if your mostly a casual grouper, get SCR3/SCRM.</div></div><hr />
