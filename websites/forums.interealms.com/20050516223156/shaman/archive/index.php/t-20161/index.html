<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Vxed and Tipt trials are causing frustration within my guild. Were an Elemental guild(just need Coirnav).<br />
<br />
We've been farming keys/flags lately but it seems many classes are unhappy with their group desireability. Typical group make-up for these trials is the following;<br />
<br />
Cleric -a must for healing, rez and buffs<br />
Warrior -nearly a must. Could get by with a well-equipped pal/sk I     suppose<br />
Enchanter -nearly a must for CC, debuffs, buffs, pulling and insane DPS with pet<br />
Druid -for spot healing, snare, pulling and buffs<br />
Shaman -buffs, debuffs, spot healing<br />
----- -the poor filler class. any will do<br />
<br />
That seems to be the successful group make-up for these. Anyone get by on different group make-ups? Does anyone else's guild have many unhappy members feeling left out?</div></div><hr />

I think every guild trying to get their members through this is finding it difficult, but it's no more difficult than the PoJ trials when they first came out, at least not in terms of making sure everyone gets through.<br />
<br />
We set aside nights a week where everyone helps out and gets people flagged, we keep track of who has what and assign people to groups that we feel have a good chance at succeeding. We reward people for participating to keep those who are just sitting around for a couple hours from getting frustrated.<br />
<br />
But, as with any guild, you must decide what works best for you. There is no easy way, and there will be frustrations and burnout trying to get any sizeable amount of people through this in a short amount of time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best (fastest) non Time group I have seen so far was 2 clerics, 2 chanters a ranger and a war.<br />
<br />
This expansion is yet another throwback to the old Chanter Charm issues of group make up. I managed to get myself into this group in one of the chanter slots but there was alot of griping about the lack of DPS.<br />
<br />
And honestly theres no need to slow stuff thats dying before you can even finish casting slow. (charmed pets quad for 1100 +/- and hit alot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Vexd trial really is cake.  It almost doesn't matter what make-up you use if you have elemental+ geared tankage and a competant cleric (with divine arbitration--don't overlook that skill in these trials).  Pal, SK, warrior, are all fine.  The rest of the group is really dependant on whether you have a chanter for charm pet.  If you do, I'd go a defensive mix and go heavy back-up healers for charm breaks--you'll be slow on kills without the charm pet, but much safer overall.<br />
<br />
Frankly, in vexd, once you have the tank/cleric filled out, the rest can be just about any mix.<br />
<br />
Tipt is a different story.  The named there is brutal.  It might as well not be slowable (since the 18% or so slowable it actually is isn't all that useful and is darn hard to land).  You don't HAVE to have a defensive warrior, but if you have a SK or Pally tank, they almost have to be time geared.<br />
<br />
Note, on tipt.  IMPORTANT--DO NOT PULL THE NAMED IN THE LAST ROOM OUT OF HIS ROOM.  KILL HIM IN THE ROOM!  If he's pulled out of the room, he gets substantially stronger.  I think he hits for 3400s outside of the room, but max of 1800s in the room.  One of our first guild groups to kill him took him out with a pally tank OUTSIDE the room!  I don't recommend going for a repeat!<br />
<br />
Tipt groups have to be a lot more circumspect in their choices of people.  1 heavy tank, 1 cleric, one solid back-up healer, someone who can take rampages on named, and the rest ought to be dps classes.  Crowd control isn't really needed in either trial if you don't try to skip content--just have a good puller, and/or one who isn't afraid to just die to avoid training a group.<br />
<br />
Once you get them down, neither trial is particularly difficult (except the tipt named), but they do get really tedious.  I've probably done both trials a good 10 times now to help flag guildies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh...hard enough to find one enchanter let alone two ;)<br />
<br />
The best group I've been with on these trials had a cleric/monk/warrior/chanter/bard/druid as its make up, but you can play around with composition quite a bit. A warrior tank does make it a lot easier though, knights have issues with the named unless they are well equiped apparently. Even on regular mobs it can be iffy because of their generally lower hp/tankability. On progression nameds we have found using riposte discs on the monk and warrior to be very effective due to the high dps/low hp these mobs often have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vxed is not too bad, just long and tedious. All you really need is a tank and sufficient healing. It may take ages with a low DPS group (personal worst: 5.5 hours) but you will get there.<br />
<br />
For Tipt you will have to build your group with the final named in mind. That means: <br />
- a cleric<br />
- a second healer<br />
- either a solid tank or a charm pet or (risky) 2 people with riposte/parry disciplines<br />
- damage. lots of it. the faster you end this fight the better.<br />
<br />
And make absolutely sure to dispel the boss. If some roaming Shaman hasted him he may well rip through your tank even with an optimal group.<br />
<br />
That being said, try to conserve your main tanks' and clerics' energy for Tipt. You should be able to do Vxed without or with fewer of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hell, i've done these about 20 times total and I have yet to do one with a charmed pet (chanter I have grouped with seemed a bit scared to do it.. or lazy.. one of the two).  I will agree with Chutoi.. it's not worth attempting to slow the final Tipt named more than a few shots.  I was using one of the guilds warriors a few days ago with a beastlord and chanter in the group plus two of our best clerics, and the chanter/beastlord decided to chain cast slow.  Needless to say, 11 quick casts by the beastlord later, both slowers were dead, but the mob was slowed and with it went our dps (other cleric pulled and ate rampage while trying to heal the slowers).  It just wasn't worth it, and the warrior didn't have enough dps to burn the named down.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I've completed the Vxed trial before with two clerics, two monks, me and a pally tank.  You really don't need to have a super awesome group, just at least one competent cleric and a decently equipped tank.  I've pulled them several times myself and if I did happen to get two of them, I always pull with malos and give myself plenty of room so that I could turn around and get that one that I malosed rooted before he gets to camp.  Mobs in there seem easily rooted especially using malos first.  There are alot of roamers in there, so just pay attention to them.  Most of the roamers spawn at the very top of the path.  So, if you kill them at the bottom of the hill, they might spawn on you as you go up it.<br />
<br />
So.. like I said, Vxed can easily be done without real cc.  Just be quick on the roots and do what you can if you get more than one to get one of them out of the tanks area and rooted off to the side.  Oh, yeah, i've done it before where if I had more than one in camp, I've ran a slight circle around the camp while the healer got a heal off on me and someone else got the mob either mezzed/rooted.  I know it sounds funny, and it's not something that I've ever done, but when you got the mobs hitting as hard as they do, you do what's necessary to survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nothing funny about that =-p Standard kite mez tactics (or in this case kite CC, but still!)<br />
<br />
I usually do<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter<br />
Druid<br />
Necro/Pally, necro prefered<br />
Anyone else, rogue/rangers are nice, especially in Tipt.<br />
<br />
As for not slowing the Tipt boss.. you need to slow or dispel him asap. He's hasted, so you want it slowed or dispeled as soon as auto-riposte disc wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And as I have described it, if you make a mistake in Tipt, you pay, right away pretty much. Room for failures and slipus here is slim to none, and that is probably what makes it frustrating.</div></div><hr />
