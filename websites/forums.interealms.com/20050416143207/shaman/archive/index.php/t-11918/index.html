<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lengis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got sick of ds because i couldn't afford my 34 spells, so i went back to the old world and ran over to lavastorm. <br />
<br />
I started killing all the gnomes in sol a.  After 2 hours, i made a level and a half, over 150 plat, a molten cloak and the crappy quill from gabby.  I am guessing that i would have seen the EXG at least once, but she never spawned.  That might have got me a chared gardian shield, or the chared bp.  Both of which sell fairly well in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
It is not bad for xp and the mobs hit for 40-80 usually.  Watch out for some that proc knockback on you (keep your back to a wall to avoid a lava bath). The EXG is also totally magic resistant.<br />

edit:<br />
<br />
this will mess up your gnome faction.. i stand corrected =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noktylde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i never had a good time in solA good loot, but the greenie gobbies to me were a little tough and TRAINS FROM HELL.... my root never seemed to hold once they hit 10% or so and then they ran off dragging 3 more (not a prob w/ my lvl 40 pally friend but as a solo :|)<br />
<br />
we headed down south and met a couple solusek champions/preists... didnt have fun there and i died 4 times, he died once.... i had to grab a 50+ BST to clear the way for my corpse.....<br />
<br />
i havent tried the gnomes yet BUT if we are that much deeper into this place id be afriad of dying... maybe i just had a bad experiance???<br />
<br />
will try again because so many of u honor this place... if i can coax my pally friend to tag along</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how were you able to kill everything? I went there last night and was having a terrible time at it. I think my equipment was ok I have 1076 hps self-buffed, not really sure of my AC I think it's about 600. Where did start fighting the gnomes?</div></div><hr />
