<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all, its not like we would get as much benefit out of a pet aug<br />
as the trinity (Bst, Necro, Mage).  <br />
<br />
10% boost to hps, dps on Doggie wouldnt be anything close to 10% of the other 3.<br />
<br />
Just like a cold nuke focus is best in wizard/dru hands but shaman/bst/ranger can use it.<br />
<br />
Would it really overpower, to put Shm on all these items.<br />
Perhaps this should be added to our 10 Class Definition Items?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But we are a pet class.  There in lies the dilemma.  <br />
We might be the &quot;weakest&quot; pet class, but it would be part of our definitions to me because we keep getting pet upgrades.<br />
<br />
Pet Upgrades take one of our limited spell slots in each major expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just because we have a pet doesn't make us a pet class (see SK for example).  Our primary abilites do not focus on our pet, it's a dot that barks and occational speed bump.  Yeah I agree it would be nice if we could use the pet aug but I'm not pulling my hair out because we can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">According to SOE, no, we're not, and never have been. Our wolf is a &quot;companion&quot;, not a pet in the true sense of the word as is applicable in EverQuest.<br />

<br />
Cmon.  Thats like saying are Bsts and Rangers considered healers.<br />
It's a lousy comparison.<br />
<br />
Cleric &quot;pets&quot; aren't lasting pets.  So like Wizard swords aren't a commandable pet class<br />
<br />
Druids get 1 spell, as a stand alone.  <br />
<br />
Compare that to Shaman, who get multiple upgrades to our pet.<br />
We are a &quot;pet&quot; class enough that each expansion they bother to use one of limited number of spell slots for a pet.  POP at 61, and now Omens at 66.  <br />
<br />
If we're not a pet class, then we should get a more useful spell at 66.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the 20 AA ability we get called &quot;pet affinity&quot; that just so happens to be shared with....  drum roll....  badaba .... <br />
Necro, Bst, Magician... ie pet classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Must agree with Corlathist, we are enough of a pet class that we should share in pet augments.  Multiple pets/upgrades, pet specific spells, and pet specific aa's.  If we are not a pet class, then why all the pet related spells and aa's?  <br />
<br />
Saying something does not make it true, reality is often quite different.  Whether SoE says we are a pet class or not, I can tell you that since I got my first doggy I've had him by my side constantly.  He may not have 4500 hp or proc/bs/cast, etc., but he is a part of the tactics and playing style that most shaman use.<br />
<br />
And yes, if a druid or SK decides to use their pet as an integral part of their playing strategy, I'd consider them a pet class.  They don't for obvious reasons, but most shaman do.<br />
<br />
If SoE has given us pet affinity and is still proposing upgraded pets in Omens, then we should be able to use the pet augments and spells in LDoN, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe this is narrow minded of me.<br />
<br />
But considering there are - what - THREE pet focus items in the game, I'll concentrate on one, the gloves from VT.  Last time we went, they dropped.  The guild mage other than my man had em.  There was one necro there who could've bid, but he didn't - because he knew he didn't feel as tied to his pet as my dear mage did.<br />
<br />
What if the bored as hell shamans could've bid on that thing?  Again, maybe this is just the wrong way to think about it, but I would've been extremely pissed off if some shaman had outbid him on this for a toy to push dogdog from 30dps to 33dps instead of pushing HIS pet from 100dps to 110 (or whatever it is).  Hell, shamans aren't even ALLOWED pets on raids (with my old guild)... but you know some bonehead would bid.<br />
<br />
Do you REALLY think it wouldn't be stupid for an enchanter to outbid you on a BA focus item?  Maybe that's because enchanter dots are as much of a joke as dogdog is?<br />
<br />
The only one I can agree to is the LDoN point-buy augment, because getting that won't screw any REAL pet class out of something that'll make a difference for em.  Poochie is a lot of fun, but it's hardly a battle that's going to help the shaman class out.<br />

<br />
Short Sighted city.<br />
my guild already has the Time Level Focus Pet ROTTING.   between Symbols of Ancient Summoning, Ring from Primals, and the Augs in Ikky3<br />
shaman could get.<br />
<br />
Not to mention then, I assume you feel Shaman shouldnt be able to bid on a Cold Nuke Focus, since better classes can use?  Or your mage never big on an item where the stats/focii were better for someone else?<br />
Thats just silly.  Typically in bid systems, people don't bid as high<br />
for things that arent as well suited to them, but thats different than not being able to bid.<br />
<br />
and in a merit guild, id place money that those focii would go to stronger pet classes first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">persoanlly i count sk`s as a pet class. aswelll as our self as we both get pets at regular levels and it is controllable. just because they are weaker than the main pet classes does not mean they arnt pets or that we arnt a pet class, we are!. not a main one but diffinately one.<br />
<br />
to qualify as a pet class you need a pet that is persistant, controllable, and get it at regular levels. note this means druids, cleric, wizard, enc are not pet classes. but sk, shm, mag, nec, bst are.<br />
<br />
i think soe just cant be arsed to changed and made that excuse, that we are not a pet class, so they didnt have to bother, when it is very clear we are a pet class.<br />
<br />
if we are not a pet class where the hell do beast get thier pet from? monks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you can summon a persistent pet, you are a pet class.<br />
<br />
Where do you guys get this stuff: &quot;SOE doesn't consider us a pet class.&quot;  Where do you get that?  I've been playing this game for over 4 years and I've never read anything like that.  Never ONCE did I read an SOE publication that said &quot;Mages/necros/bsts are pet classes; shamans and SKs are NOT.&quot;  Someone's making up some fluff!<br />
<br />
&quot;Companions&quot;?  That's your technical reason why shaman are not a pet class?  Well, necros have &quot;minions&quot;.  They don't cast a spell called &quot;Summon Pet.&quot;  So I guess technically necros aren't a pet class either.  Pffft!<br />
<br />
I'll re-iterate it: If you can summon a persistent pet, you are a pet class.<br />
<br />
When you have pet spells well into your upper levels, and they summon creatures that are within 7 levels of your own level, with 3k hps and quads for 60 (alpha'd and buffed) and does around 40 DPS, and enrages, THAT'S a pet.  Sorry to say it.  Just because they aren't quite as strong as mage/necro/bst pets, doesn't mean they don't qualify.  Dogdog parses out to 35-40 DPS consistently.  The mage and bst pets that commonly get stuck in my parses do roughly 65 DPS, which is hardly earth-shattering.  Not compared to rogues, monks, rangers, wizards who pump out 100-150 DPS in their sleep.  Occasionally I'll see a warder go ballistic and approach 80 DPS.  Woo!  The owner of that pet has a minimum of 300 AAs and full LDoN pet augs.<br />
<br />
Remember the 49 necro pet?  Used to be the beast of EQ?  That's now the final SK pet.  He does about 40-45 DPS if fully buffed.  THAT's a pet.  Combined with a good SK who can get around 100 DPS just by himself, and you have a owner/pet combo approaching 140-150 DPS in their sleep.  I see it all the time...  The SK pet is NOT insignificant in most situations, especially xp/ldon groups.  In a lot of situations, I've found the only reason the SK doesn't summon one is because they just plain are lazy.  Their preference, but that's not something to ignore.  Just like the occasional shaman you find who doesn't bother with pets because they don't find them to be worth it.  Rubbish!<br />
<br />
If I'm a shaman, and I have a chance to add an element to my group that does 40 DPS and makes mobs fall that much faster, I summon the damn pet.  It's something I always have up and rely on in groups... I always have a pet by my side 'cept for raids, and therefore I'm by all means a &quot;pet-class&quot;.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'd like an aug for dogdog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would I like it?  sure anything to help pooch<br />

Convince Sony of that, then your argument will have merit. Until then it's only &quot;according to you&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'm not the only one here who remembers the long tirades that resulted when someone from Sony (was it Abashi back then?) made the claim that &quot;Shaman aren't a true pet class&quot;. If you've been playing for 4 years, it was definitely during your tenure. I'm surprised you don't remember it.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. I'm on the side that wishes we WERE considered a pet class. I use mine where ever and whenever applicable (if for no other reason than I just love having my dog with me! :)) I'm just pointing out what has been stated by Sony on several occasions, and is the root of the problem(s) related to the power of our pet abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Valgoth is right.<br />
<br />
After Kunark was released, the level 55 shaman pet was slotted to consume like 850 mana or something.  Folks were screaming, and there was some comment from Abashi that shaman weren't a pet class.  But they did adjust the mana cost.  <br />
<br />
At least, I think that's how it went.  <br />
<br />
Of course, then we got True Spirit at 61 in PoP, and I think getting a pet that /cons blue settles the issue whether we are a pet class or not.  <br />
<br />
I don't know if Abashi's comment was really an official statement or just him offering opinion.  <br />
<br />
I think our pet is lagging now, and an upgrade would be much appreciated.  I really love the pet zoning addition, and I find myself using Goner more these days.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I should get Suspend Minion and Pet Discipline....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">the big question is would getting the gear/focii fixed be worth putting on Shaman Definition Top 10 list.<br />

<br />
I know dog dog isnt that powerful, but a little extra dps is a little extra dps.<br />
<br />
basically it adds 2 to 3  to max damage , but that isnt all it adds to level aswell, i believe, making pet hit better, more hp  etc. therefore it would be worth having, probably more so that say alchemy, unless they really did fix it:) or mgb shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I usually think of there being three &quot;tiers&quot; of pet using classes:<br />
<br />
* MAG/NEC/BST<br />
The top tier, with powerful pets - and those classes gain a substantial portion of their DPS from them.<br />
<br />
* SHM/SHD/ENC<br />
These classes all get regular upgrades, and the PoP enchanter animation is similar to True Spirit in that it's also L58, has around 2K HPs and enrages. However, the pet isn't a main source of DPS.<br />
<br />
* DRU/WIZ/CLR<br />
Either one-shot pets or very weak ones - and these classes don't get pet upgrades, either. They're more of a party trick than anything else...<br />
<br />
As such, it makes sense that the top tier should get pet focus items. However, I'd argue that if shamans were to get access to them (much though I'd like it), then it would only be fair to make them affect SHD and ENC pets too... the former being a problem due to their low level.<br />
<br />
Here's the DPoC focus, from Lucy:<br />
<br />
Summoner's Boon<br />
Unknown #167 (100/15/0) <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Min Level(59) <br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, the levels refer to the level of the pet itself, and as that's 58 for SHM/ENC and low 40s for SHD... well, a cynic would say they set it at 59 to avoid any shamans moaning about how we could use the focus if only our class were on it!  :p <br />
<br />
Havng said all that, we do now get L60 pets, but they're in the form of swarm pets that can't be controlled - and it's highly likely IMO that our new Omens wolf will be base level 60.<br />
<br />
As a final point regarding pet DPS, I see these are still on Lucy, despite the AAs having been pulled at the last minute from GoD (along with Ancient Fury, which would have made our pets crit)....<br />

It's not much, but having seen how often BST pets proc (far, far more often than dogdog dual weilding proccing weapons) - it would be a handy increase in DPS, and with the resist adjust the procs would land more often than BST pet ones, which don't have any form of resist adjust.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes another example of SOE getting it wrong, when these came out alot of shaman complained that they weren`t very good for us (witht he exception of the proc, and only if they took up other aa that could be better, which it turned out they didnt) as our pets where so weak (ie our pet needed an u/g) instead they removed them all and didnt really replace with anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">All I have to say on this is:<br />
<br />
Despite not being true healers, rangers and beastlords can still use and benefit from items with healing focus effects. <br />
<br />
Classes that are not dps caster classes and those that are not even true spell casters can still benefit from improved damage focuses (even effects procs)<br />
<br />
Classes that are not true melee can still use (or miss use dpending on how you see it) effects that boost their attack etc.<br />
<br />
Hell, even classes without a use for endurance can rack up massive ammounts of it.<br />
<br />
So why can't a psuedo pet class use a pet focus. The precedent has been set that other classes can use things not necessarily meant for them - just to a lower degree of usefulness.<br />
<br />
Thats my opinion of it in any event.</div></div><hr />

Pet Upgrades take one of our limited spell slots in each major expansion.<br />
<br />
Spell slots aren't limited in expansions.  They don't have a max number of spells they can implement.  Compare amounts of spells each caster class gets at each level, you'll find quite a variation.<br />

SK only on 1.<br />
<br />
I'd say its pretty fair to ask them to fix shaman Pet capabilities.<br />
Add Shm to pet focii items, and even AA Pet Crit/Flurries AAs.<br />
<br />
If dog was able to go from 20-40 DPS currently, to 40-60 DPS that wouldnt be unbalancing as Shaman really do need some DPS upgrades in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">yep soe make arbitory descisions and then poeple try to defend them! most of the reason why somin is done boils done to 1 person i feel, or  a very small group of poeple with thier own reasons.<br />
<br />
for instance if you just went on the normal progession of pets we would get a pet at 54 not 55, and 59not 61, then 64 then 69. someone made a discission that no other class got to increase the timebetween our pets, all other where the same or decreased.<br />
<br />
most changes have very little to do with actual balance and more to preceived point of views it seems to me. Also seems dependant on what you think your balancing against? to me soe just dont know.</div></div><hr />
