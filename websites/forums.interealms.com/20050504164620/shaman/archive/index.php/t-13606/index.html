<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the whole E3 thing going on lots of new games are being revealed.  EQ is getting fairly old, and even though it'st still a great game many are wanting something new.  So I'm kind of curious as to what others plan to do in the future.  If you choose other, please explain :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ill probly try all 3<br />
<br />
ive heard swg is terrible .. just the thought of some guild called &quot;wookies gone wild&quot; makes me never want to try it<br />
<br />
wow and eq2 both look good, but im more gunhoe for WoW<br />
<br />
planetside beta really sucks, was great for a week but then it died<br />
<br />
<br />
untill then .. ill be playing the CounterstrikeWC3 mod .. its alot of fun .. if you liked CS .. you should try it</div></div><hr />

Will play eq till wow comes out.<br />
Friends and the fact that there is nothing better mmorpg wise right now make me still play eq.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's Blizzard. That should tell you the quality of WoW.  Yeah, they take forever to release a game. But, when it does finally get released, it is so worth the wait.  SOE needs to take a page out of their book on how to make a quality game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll probably stay with EQ unless WoW is really good. Might check out SWG, but doubt I'd pay to play that genre. EQ2 doesnt interest me. I'll check out WoW, and if it's as full of a game as Everquest, I may give up EQ.</div></div><hr />

EQ2...no thanks. Just a different spin on the same old lore/world from the same company who brought you EverCamp.<br />
<br />
WoW...absolutely. I'll be there opening day.<br />
<br />
You left out a very important one...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am going for warhammer online or WoW. will test swg and eq2. <br />
<br />
Warhammer world will probly have a much better storry much more writen about it already and i like it, i play the warhammerFrpg, the best fantasy rpg ever made.<br />
<br />
Blizzard always make good games and i think they will do a good job WoW. Still the story in WoW is not that good. Warhammer have so much more to offer there. Will try WoW and warhammer.<br />
<br />
Did read that they are going to do a Dungen &amp; dragons online now.<br />
i only hope they pick darksun world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I voted for try all three, as I do like the look of EQ2, however WoW looks and sounds like real next gen gaming so am probably gona end up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only future game that appeals to me is SWG - mainly because they're trying to do something different. Every other MMORPG seems to be very EQ-like (ie kill mobs for xp, loot mobs, repeat).<br />
<br />
It could well be that SWG fails miserably, because either it's just too different, or they don't deliver on the promises. But it looks worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm gonna keep playing eq till wow comes out - if wow is any good (and I mean any good at all), i'm cancelling eq &amp; never playing another soe product again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Me too - EQ is losing the appeal these days, and there doesnt seem to be a lot they can do to change that.  I think it has just come to the limits of what can be done with the game engine, and am fed up of SoE and the way they do things.<br />
<br />
WoW looks amazing and sounds it too, I also have a lot of conifdence in Blizzard to bring out a quality title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm in SWG beta. Was tired of EQ, been there more time then is normal anyway, game stopped being fun 3 years ago. Only the great people in the game - players - kept me moving on. At the beginning of may cancelled subscription and never felt any need or wish to get back. And then SWG beta &quot;came&quot; and I like it. Sure, there's loads of things to polish still, but it's pretty good and getting better with each update.<br />
<br />
As for the future games, then SWG and WOW for sure. EQ2 - not so sure, if it's similar to EQ1 (i.e. catered for no-life uberguilds, non-existing customer support, static world, and so on), then bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am surprised no one mentioned Middle Earth online.  I know it is still far off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I certainly hope that these are the sentiments of all of the 60+ crowd. I would love to see you all leave EQ in droves. To hear that certain uber-guilds are disbanded forever is something to which I look forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm skeptical of some of the changes in EQ2.  Specifically, the focus on tradeskills.  I like doing tradeskills in EQ, but I don't want to HAVE to do tradeskills.  I wish they would just remake EQ using the new graphics engine.<br />
<br />
WoW looks too cartoony, and I'm wary of what I've seen of the combat system.  I'd much rather see the realistic graphics of EQ/EQ2 than be wandering around in a Warner Bros. creation.<br />
<br />
SW:G isn't my thing.  I like Star Wars and all, but it would have to be one hell of a game to take me out of my Fantasy comfort zone.  From what I'm hearing, the game itself isn't that great.  <br />
<br />
I'd love to find an alternative to SOE.  It's becoming blatantly obvious that EQ is now run by a large business-focused corp. instead of  gamers.  I was actually looking forward to having to get flags.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I’m not really sure what I’ll do in the future.  I’m still enjoying myself immensely in EQ.  If that changes, or if all my friends leave the game, I may well have to decide what to do at that point. <br />
<br />
One of my friends is extremely excited about SWG and I must admit that some of the concepts sound very intriguing.  However, when it comes to PRGs I much prefer a fantasy environment.  That having been said, there are a lot of options on the horizon.  EQ2 is a possibility, but I think there’s too much of a “been there and done that” feel for me.  World of Warcraft might be interesting.  The graphics are nice, but I know very little about the game.  I’m a long time player of the Warhammer fantasy tabletop game.  An online version of that game could be very fun indeed.  Another game that looks good but I don’t know much about the actual game play is Final Fantasy XI.  Here’s a link to an in game camera feed from one of the betas (http://kefka.playonline.com/strmv1.asx).   <br />
<br />
For now I’ll stick with EQ and continue having fun.  When I’m no longer having fun I’ll see what’s out there and perhaps find another game to eat up all my free time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Darn, and I had my hopes up. I have recently moved over to Stromm and enjoy the fact that there is only one guild trying to be the &quot;uber&quot; guild at the moment. They came over from the English Server to be the first ones to do all the planes on Stromm. Not to belittle their goal, I don't quite see the point of getting excited over being the first ones to the planes on a newbie server.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll start a guild on Stromm called the Gosh Darn Independents or the Legion of the Unguilded whose sole purpose is to be as anti-uber as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I wish i could be there at that moment when certain people realize that SoE is not that horrible. When WoW comes out of its hype, which isnt based on actualy playing cause i doubt everyone here is on the beta, and cant get quests done , or people start making hacks for the game  ( classic blizzard problem that has been there for a decade ) when all the problems that another company gives them are in plain view and they sit down, lean back in the chair and slap their hand against there faces and in a homer sound go ... doh ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I was gonna continue playing EQ, until I saw the trailer for WoW...<br />
<br />
Damn it looks sweet, unless it has some sort of design flaw I couldent possibly live with ill play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've moved on from paying money monthly for entertainment. I will never pay to play a game monthly / yearly again. I'm looking forward to NWN expansion, and Doom 3 as well as half-life 2. <br />
<br />
The only thing that would bring me back into a pay to play game would be the following.<br />
<br />
I would need a game where there are completly unique world, each with its own appeal and design, also the game must be able to adjust to the players (ie. The world would have to change). For example, lets use EQ. When I completed my shaman epic, the curse of CoM should of been lifted. A new evil could creep in a few weeks or days later, but that evil should be able to be held off and a city created. Players should be able to create citys and homes, and cause perm changes to the world. This would make each server different and unique. There would need to be a well thought out strong pvp element similar to shadowbane, but also have a well thought out PvE element. It would need item degradation (spelling?) so that the economy does not over inflate. And most importantly, The game needs to run on release. I'm sick of games being so buggy they are unplayable at release. Shadowbane was horrible, DoAc was horrible, AO was horrible. I am so sick of the &quot;Well EQ wasn't good on release&quot; argument. I can accept quest bugs, item and class balance tweaks, spelling errors, broken mobs, etc. But the game must actually run (no mem leaks, CTD's, BSD's, etc).<br />
<br />
Do that, and I'll give you 13 bucks a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">or people start making hacks for the game ( classic blizzard problem that has been there for a decade )<br />
<br />
<br />
The big difference is that battle.net games held the data on your computer, WoW will be server held in the same manner EQ is and therefore I would anticipate have the same chance of hacking as EQ does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">In the process of making the poll I forgot to mention what I was going to do lol.<br />
<br />
I will heading to EQ2.  I've seen SW:G in beta form and didn't really like it (Ya, its still beta but the whole Star Wars type thing never appealed to me anyhow ),  I've seen lots of pictures, videos and previews for WoW and the game does look interesting...but not as interesting as EQ2 has looked so far.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of Player Housing and Guild Halls.  The new graphics look very sweet.  The more life like graphics seem to appeal to me more.  I also like the idea that they have going with the Tradeskills and how that system will work.  That you will actually have to think when you make an item instead of just placing needed items into a container and hitting combine.  Also, buildings and large structures will be able to be made which will require the work of multiple Tradesmen, which sounds pretty neat :) The only thing I'm kinda unhappy over is that they announced the Rotunga ( Rat men) as the 16th race.  I was hoping for maybe Orcs or something heh :)  I was still suprised at how neat they look though, so its not too bad i guess  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Why are ppl so worried about hacks?<br />
<br />
If u invest enough time you will find that there are quite a few hacks for eq.<br />
Memory offset hacks show eq etc.<br />
<br />
A rastafarian man told me once<br />
<br />
Anything a man can make another man can break.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any form of security oor anti-cheat devised by a mortal mind can be broken by another mortal mind sooner or later no matter how brilliant.<br />
<br />
Did you know that there are programs that allow you to run about 10x faster than the fastest bard?<br />
Or stay underwater as long as you want?<br />
Or even fall for no dmg ever?<br />
<br />
Yeah they are done. Yeah soem take a chance and use them. They get caught and all those chars they worked hard to get dissapear along with all their accomplishments in eq on that account.<br />
<br />
Will there be hacks for wow? You bet your @ss. But i challenge any of you to name ONE game that has no hacks and no exploits and no ways of cheatign the system in some way. (non console heh :D)<br />

Wow will rock and i am leavign eq the day it comes out. Nuff said.<br />
