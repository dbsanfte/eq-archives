<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shayman Quod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure when this happened, but I noticed in another thread that someone was complaining that the iksar cultural stuff was crap.<br />
<br />
It is now &quot;almost&quot; exactly the same as the other classes Cultural<br />
<br />
Iksar Cultural Stats (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/smithing_stats_iksar.htm) <br />
Ogre Cultural Stats (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/smithing_stats_ogre.htm) <br />
Barbarian Cultural Stats (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/smithing_stats_barbarian.htm) <br />
<br />
Time to find a Iksar smith I be thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fearsome skyiron stats are the same as they have allways been as far as I know ;). The are based on the chain template, which is the same template that all other shaman races use. The debate about the stats centered around warriors/SKs, who have to wear the chain template as Iksars, unlike other races which have access to far superior plate templates :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was me that complained about the Iksar stuff because I am an iksar smith.<br />
<br />
You are right that the stats are pretty much the same. It does look exactly the same to other shaman usable cultural armor. The other poster was right when he said that the ac isnt that great because SK and War have to share the armor.<br />
<br />
I guess what I was complaining about was the incredible cost to make it for the stats. My opinion is skewed since I am on Rallos Zek and items can be taken. No one wants to spend 10k on a item that the first time they slip it on and a mob gets them low then roving wizard_01 ganks their shiny new 10k BP from them. Not much of a market for it imo on RZ. I will make a couple of items and see hwo they sell.<br />
<br />
To me since the item is recommended level 45, why not get the one or two levels and just hit the planes? But if you have cash to burn, then buy the stuff.<br />
<br />
imo the only items I would wear are the belt and one bracer. But I have to be careful because Mana Burn can kill you in one shot. Not enough time to bag any good stuff. Once MB is nerfed so that it is castable only in PvE then us shaman are safe to wear the good stuff.<br />
<br />
On a blue server, this stuff would be pretty good. I would wear this stuff on a blue server, but on RZ I would be very careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, but the beauty of smithed armor is that it's not nodrop.  The decision that you make in joining a red server opens up portions of the game that we on the blues never see, but it also opens up similar troubles.  The game is built and designed for non-PvP (because of the horrors of UO at the time) and it doesn't look like they'll add say, the ability to 'key' smithed armor to yourself.  It's either all or nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Time to start an iksar smith - HEHEHEHEHEHE...HAHA...HAHAHAHA!!<br />
<br />
Better start collecting Iksar blood now! It'll be years before you have enough to make the blue diamond armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well as an Iksar smith.<br />
<br />
No of pieces made: 2<br />
No of pieces in use by myself: 1<br />
<br />
Market for this: non existent<br />
<br />
It is to expensive for the stats, the only piece that has some use is the bracer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The iksar cultural has two problems:<br />
<br />
1. The same as all the other high end cultural chains- the ac ratio between it and the cultural plate is HORRIBLE compared to velious quest ratios<br />
<br />
2. The iksar sks/warriors  get shafted hard on it- but then they generally get shafted hard on armor, aside from a bone here and there since velious.<br />
<br />
I'm just glad I hadn't gm'd smithing before the new cultural came out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm in love with the troll inny armor.<br />
<br />
But you're telling me this stuff is no drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no it is NOT no drop that is the whole point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He can say there is no market, because for chain classes, THERE IS NO MARKET.<br />
<br />
A number of pieces of the plate armor are superb...especially if you are a human smith (The rallos zek imbued armor they make for warriors is monstrously good). Chain is...not very good. AC needs to be increased to half again what it is.<br />
<br />
The armor is extraordinarily expensive to make (ignoring the time and effort in getting your smithing up to 240ish), and fails a LOT. Maximum skill smiths (250 natural skill, and a +5% skill mod item) across all servers, with 255 wis/int/str/dex, show less than 50% success rate on the final combine. That ignores failed intermediate combines, which can effortlessly eat the blue diamonds that each of these pieces take. Blue diamond cost has skyrocketed since the May patch which put this new armor into the game. Why? Because these armors eat blue diamonds like a raid cleric eats peridots. Breastplates average 44% success rate, game-wide, and take THREE blue diamonds per attempt.<br />
<br />
Combine outright cost (metals, imbuing, enchanting, vials of mana, molds, blue diamonds, etc) with the obscene rarity of most culture's temper components (Iksar blood being the most extreme example, with maybe 1 such vial dropping every 3-4 RL days on any given server, and most of those destroyed because nobody thinks they are valuable), the fail rate, and you are looking at 10-15k for even the low priced, higher demand items, like the bracer...which for almost all sets, the best piece. For legs and breastplates, which are the hardest to make, and required the most (and most expensive) components, 50-60k is not out of line.<br />
<br />
You can get a kael/skyshrine multiquest for considerably less, and for many slots, the item will be a lot better (or have a spiffy right click, which none of the smithed items have).<br />
<br />
It is nice armor, and if you are lucky in your race (ie: Human, who got such a long end of the stick, that the other races can't even see the stick), you could probably make some money at it (only if you hit 242 smithing before June 5th however)...but to say that there is some kind of large market available is just ignorance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm a 250-skill Iksar smith ... the success rates quoted here are materially correct.<br />
<br />
I wear the mask and the belt.<br />
<br />
I've sold a few shoulders and a bracer.  For the most part it isn't worth making.<br />

<br />
It was mentioned that Iksar blood is used in the making of this stuff.  Iksar blood drops off sarnaks, doesn't it?  I'm at work so I can't really check, but I know I have a handful of &quot;some&quot; blood that came off sarnaks in LOIO.  Anyway, on to my point.<br />
<br />
That stuff has value?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sarnaks drop- interestingly enough- Sarnak blood...which is also used to make scale temper.<br />
<br />
Sarnak blood does not have much of any value, no. Neither does froglok blood. Iksar blood does..to a gm iksar smith(I'd say it's a rare server that has more than 1 or 2 gm iksar smiths that use it)</div></div><hr />
