<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, i use a mod that i have grown very fond of, and with the release of LoY it wont load anymore due to all of the extra onscreen things added to the game. I was wondering if there was ANYTHING i could do to fix this so i can play with the updated buttons and boxes with my old UI. Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks.</div></div><hr />

Not really sure what it is you need help with. You don't describe anything at all.<br />

If you like you can zip up the mod and PM a link to me and I can take a peek and see if I can find how to make it work.</div></div><hr />
