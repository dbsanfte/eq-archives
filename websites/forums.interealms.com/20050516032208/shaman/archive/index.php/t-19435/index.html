<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
I have been away for seven months or so, and I was wondering if anything has been changed that will really impact the way I played my shaman?<br />
<br />
A lot of things have been nerfed/updated/improved? or what have you, I am sure, but I am looking for shaman specific things?<br />
Any new/interesting quests that I should look into?  My shaman is level 63, with Canni5, and a few decent pieces of gear,nothing spectacular of course.  I am not guilded, never have been.<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only thing that i can say that's changed, is that the new expansion, has let you have a different place to earn AAs/exp at and at the same time, earn points to spend on items/gear/augments that upgrade your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on play style and how willing ya are to group ...<br />
<br />
The LDoN expansion is a really great source of XP / AAs / gear for alot of players that find regular groups.  Each adventure is usually complete within an hour, great for casual players :)<br />
<br />
PoP is still here, but some of the higher Tier Zones have had their Flag requirements removed so that you can get in there and XP with a group of mates without having to be flagged via guilds ....<br />
<br />
Never soloed at 63, so not sure what its like, but I assume mobs like the PoStorm frogs and PoV Cave Dwellers are pretty free camps nowdays ..<br />
<br />
Hope some of that helps :P<br />
<br />
PS. Watch out when you load up Turgur's Insects, it has now been nerfed to a single target Charisma buff .... <br />
<br />
