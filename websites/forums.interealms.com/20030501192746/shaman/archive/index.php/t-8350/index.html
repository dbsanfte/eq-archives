<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well at the moment, I have about 30 in alchemy, and am *losing* about 20 PP for each 10 dose SoW potion I sell at 90-100 PP.<br />
<br />
Right now if I had to guess my success rate is somewhere around 66%. Considering that it's pretty obvious why I'm losing money.<br />
<br />
Anyways, on to the point... what I'm wondering is if I get 37 alchemy (the point at which SoW potions become trivial) will my success rate go up by a signifigant amount? The 10 dose SoW potions without any failures cost about 65 plat for all the materials, whereas I can spend upwards of 100 plat on just getting 10 complete. So I'm basically wondering if I can ever expect to stop losing money making SoW potions.</div></div><hr />

Always 'member to work on faction and buff charisma.  I would hate to think how much would've spent without doing that. <br />
<br />
Dang, I just thought about it =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For me, I did not get that golden &quot;5%&quot; failure rate until my skil was 70 - where ants potions trivial.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, the potions with the higher trivials - like gate - you will actually succeed more on under their trivial than sow, because of the way the algorithim works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the tradeskills work the same way regarding success rates and trivials, and it goes something like this:<br />
<br />
At the low end of a given skill, the trivial point comes a good bit before the max success rate (95%) point.  The higher up in the skill you go, the closer the triv point and the max success rate point get to each other, until they pretty much meet at the upper end of the skill.<br />
<br />
There are, however, items at the upper end that have trivial points higher than the maximum skill you can obtain (the various blue-diamond cultural smithed armors, for instance, are estimated to have a 'trivial' point somewhere around 300, and the most smithing skill you can have is 250) so the high end stuff generally doesn't get to reach that happy 95% success rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It will be worth your while to spend some money on charisma items. This will lower your material costs to about 53pp. You should get best rates from all vendors at around 125-130 charisma. Jewelry, mugs, and cha buff.<br />
<br />
After purchasing the herbs, trade out the cha gear with your best wis gear and try to get a wis buff so skill ups go a little faster.</div></div><hr />
