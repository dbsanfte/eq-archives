<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That's about as close a chad smiley as I'm going to find.  Anyway, I just thought I'd point out my observation, that since the let down of very unexciting spells of PoP.  No one is even bothering to speculate on new spells for LoY.<br />
<br />
Just an observation. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we all officaly give up hope on anything new<br />
<br />
lol<br />
<br />
plus alotof us have vowed to NOT buy LoY untill soem thigns are addressed , so not alot to get excited about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">alot as in like...7 people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I aint buying ****, why the hell would I buy an expansion for whatever - 60 level ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">seen a thread in the spells section about possible new spells.   Course, they are mainly thinking upgrades on the replies, only original poster did much work on thinking of lowbie spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just figured the new spells were Stoicism and the Disinfecting Aura ripoff.  Is anything else new showing up on Lucy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Originally posted by Oaks <br />
alot as in like...7 people? <br />
<br />
many more then 7 heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only way I will buy LoY is if we can somehow research Topor and Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Implement quest mobs that will trade you high lvl shaman spells for hard to make special potions. Ingredients would drop in specific dungeons or acuired through mini-quests. <br />
This way alchemy could be worth investing in again perhaps.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i tink its a good idea to solve 2 problems. making alchemy useful and making spells available.<br />
<br />
would have to be implemented right though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">more than 7 . <br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm a pack rat, and I tradeskill too much.  Expanding the banks will give me more than a few character slots back.<br />
<br />
Besides, I wanna be a froaking shaman, even if they don't look as cute as they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ive gotten used to the bank account limits, so I have no urge to spend money on an expansion on something they should give us for free. Everything else is pretty pointless for those of us over 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm buying it.  But only because I haven't spent my monthly allotment for computer games yet.  Generally speaking, EQ has been a good buy, keeping me entertained for many hours/dollar.  <br />
<br />
I expect: more lowbie shaman spells that aren't upgrades, but maybe just variances on existing spells.  More group buffs most likely.  Stoicism.  Maybe a mini avatar if you are lucky.  Expecting the high shamans to get one or two spells on vendors . . . something JUST good enough to make us want to buy PoP, but not really good enough to improve the class.  <br />
<br />
Whatever.  I played a wizard tonight (getting a friend flagged) and it was enlightening.  I had basically zip to do about it if a mob aggroed me in a raid.  I had to hope my epic rune kept me up until someone could get it off . . . and before I died.  Hmm, wasn't the level of control I was used to.  For goodness sakes . . . these were weeny little PoD castle mobs!  And they owned me.  And my best nuke at lvl 62 was only like 1450 with dmg focus.  Not too impressive, tho I did manage to pump out some DPS with fast nukage.  Wiz nukes seem bout twice as fast as shaman nukes.  The class seems to be incredibly easy to play tho.  1) med, gather mana, 2) /assist MA and nuke after a bit of dmg done to mob by melee, 3) Avoid aggro, 4) do the occasional TL or decession, and 5) evac the group at the end.  <br />
Simple.  Nobody begging for buffs.  Nobody needing me to slow something.  Nobody depending on me for heals to keep them alive . . . hardly any responsibility at all!  <br />
<br />
eh, it's just not for me.</div></div><hr />
