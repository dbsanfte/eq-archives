With this patch we introduced the ability for intelligence casters (Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers and Wizards) to create additional spell scrolls using their research skill. Many of the newly researchable spells have only been available from quests or killing NPCs in the past. The new research still requires components from risky locations or dangerous foes. Our goal is to increase the number of ways to earn rare spells, without reducing the challenge required. <br />
<br />
This, however, creates a bit of an inequity between the intelligence casters and the priest classes (Clerics, Druids and Shaman) when it comes to acquiring this type of spell. While there is nothing inherently wrong with different classes earning their spells in different ways, we don't see a reason to give more options to one type of caster than another. In this case, we have taken the opportunity to give the research skill a little more value and at the same time negate any imbalance between classes. <br />
<br />
Some time in the near future we plan to introduce recipes for the creation of certain spells for the priest classes. Intelligence casters can use their research skill to create these priest spell scrolls, and priest classes will benefit by having an alternate method for obtaining these spells. This helps out both priests and intelligence casters, and creates a new niche for research as a trade skill. <br />

Could this mean alternative methods of acquiring Torpor and Malo?? Sure sounds like it.</div></div><hr />
