It especially Numbuk's first attempt at writing story from an ogre perspective.  Me will try to update dis tory every day or so, so keep checking back.<br />
<br />
Please no reply to dis thread, so it make it easier to read from chapter to chapter.  If yous have any comments, suggestions, or anyting about dis story, please post it in Dis Thread (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=850).<br />
<br />
Me hope yous enjoy dis story as much as me is writing it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and me never really been writer before, so grammar stink.  But hey, me is an ogre, so cut some slack!<br />
<br />
<br />
Chapter 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
In a small cave in Oggok dere lived a nice ogre family.  Like many ogre families, dey had a mommy, a daddy, and two boy ogres.  Dis family was da Emgood family and dey were a happy bunch.  Smash was da older brudder and he would play &quot;How Many Lumps Can I Make Yous  Head Get&quot; with younger brother Bash.<br />
<br />
Dis was a happy time.  Daddy Emgood would fish all day long and sell his wares to the shopkeepers.  Mommy Emgood would spend her days dirtying up da unsightly &quot;clean spots&quot; in da cave and make her usual Froglok Booger Pie.  All was going berry well, until one night.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was yous day, Bash?&quot; asked Daddy Emgood while his family was sitting at da dinner table.<br />
<br />
&quot;It fun!&quot; said Bash excitedly.  &quot;Smash gave me record number of lumps on head!  He gave me 14!  At least, dat what he say.  But me tink he no can count good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; growled Smash, &quot;Yous is just a dumbhead!  Me give yous more tomorrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now be quiet both of yous,&quot; barked Mommy Emgood.  &quot;Don't make me have to give you both baths!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both young ogres immediately slammed deir mouths shut and began eating quietly.  Nothing was heard but da sound of chomping and slurping.  Nothing, until da cave door exploded into a pile of smoldering rubble.<br />
<br />
Da Emgood family looked up with a shock.  Standing at da door was a mean looking goblin wizard.  Hand still smoking from some spell, he point a finger at Daddy Emgood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ha!  So you're the one I've been hunting for all these years!&quot; da goblin cackled gleefully.  &quot;Now I've found you, and now you shall die!&quot;<br />
<br />
Without another word, da wizard send two fireballs hurling into da Emgood family.  It hit both Mommy and Daddy Emgood and dey disappear into a cloud of smoke and ash.  Bash and Smash just look on in disbelief and horror.  The goblin just smiles and blows on his finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;That takes care of that,&quot; da goblin say. &quot;No more worrying about that ogre coming to slay me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yous dumbhead,&quot; Bash yell out sobbing.  &quot;He was good ogre!  He no wanted to kill anyone but gnomes, frogloks, orcs, bears, lizards, giants, treants, mammoths, sarnaks, skeletons, zombies, beetles, griffins, and dorfs.  He no wanted to kill goblin magic ting!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but he would have,&quot; said the goblin.  &quot;He was prophecied to kill me, so I just did the deed first.  Prophecy speaks of an ogre who will be my downfall, and I have tracked him to this house.  And by process of elimination, I figured it was your dad since you two are both too small and your mother was just a female.  So you see, now I can be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me tink yous is telling us too much information,&quot; said Smash.  &quot;But why did yous kills our mudder too?&quot;  Smash's eyes started to well up in tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've nothing to fear from telling you too much information,&quot; remarked da goblin snidely.  &quot;You're just kids!  As for your mother, well, I just happened to miss with my first fireball and hitting her was an accident.  Oh well, nobody's perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yous name is... Smellybreath?  Or is dat just a trait?&quot; asked Bash inquisitively.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is both a name and a trait.  How did you know it was my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yous have a sticker on chest dat say, 'Hello!  My name is Smellybreath' with words 'A.A. Meeting' at bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Right.  I forgot to take that off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  We will not forget.  Us is gonna train now for few years and we'll bash yous good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck with that.&quot;  Smellybreath chuckled to himself.  &quot;I'd like to see that happen.  Yeah right!  Take care, you little kids!  I am sure I'll never be seeing you ever again!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with dat, da goblin vanished in a puff of smoke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash and Smash never forgot da face of mean goblin who killed deir parents.  Dey never forgot da evil glint in his red eyes, but mostly, dey never forgot his horrible breath.  Dere was a good reason his name was Smellybreath.<br />
<br />
Dey both went and lived with deir ogre grandfather.  Deir granddad was an ogre hippy, so he would always be using &quot;special herbs&quot; and listening to ogre sitar music.  <br />
<br />
Bash and Smash no had need of such tings, and so began to teach demselves da art of combat.  Dey knew dere was more to it dan just picking up big stick and smashing tings wit it, and dey knew it gonna take more dan said stick to bash Smellybreath.  Dey practiced hours on end learning different moves, different swings, even a few shamanistic spells.  Dey did nothing else but practice fighting wit each other.<br />
<br />
Well, until a few years later when dey discovered ogre girls... but let's skip past dat part right now.  Fast forward a few years and us is now on same page.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moondoggy,&quot; said Papa Smurpheater while sitting in a meditative pose in da living room, &quot;come on in here child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa, my name is Bash,&quot; Bash said getting tired of reminding his grandfather of what his real name is.  &quot;Me hate name Moondoggy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right.  Far out, man!  Moondoggy, can you go grab your brother Shroombaby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa,&quot; said Smash, &quot;Me name no is Shroombaby and me is already here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right.  Outta Sight!  Feel the love.  The love!  Then cherish the colors.  The colors!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash and Smash looked at each other and rolled deir eyes.  Dey had been through dis routine before.  Once grandpa got going, he never came back until a few hours later.  Luckily, dis time, he snapped out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!  Trippy.  Now look here, flower children, I have had a revelation this night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like when you had a revelation dat we should spend adolescence naked wit our names painted on our butts?&quot; Bash asked not all too kindly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, dat was embarrassing!&quot; excalimed Smash.  &quot;Us still get picked on today!  How about da time yous had a revelation dat lizardmen now like ogres and we should go try and make friends wit dem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me still have lizard teeth stuck in me arm!&quot; shouted Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Settle down, lovemonkeys,&quot; Papa said calmly.  &quot;This hip revelation came from the Sacred Peyote.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both brothers just stared in silence.  Papa's revelations were never wrong when he smoked the Sacred Peyote.  It was rumored he had pilfered it from a wizard's spire long ago in his adventuring days.  He rarely touched it, but when he did, his predictions always came true.  Well. most of da time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you should know that one of you isn't going to like this,&quot; Papa said with glazed eyes.  &quot;I have had a vision of that goblin you crazy cats always are talking about.  I have had a vision of where he's hiding out, and what you boys are to do about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both ogres just stared with jaws agape.  Dis was good news.  Dey would do anyting to smash dat dumbhead goblin.  Dey waited intently for da old ogre to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears,&quot; Papa began, &quot;that unrighteous oppressor has been shacking up in a mountain range known as Trakanon's Teeth.  And, my vision has said that only one of you may go to slay him and the other must stay behind.  If it is any other way, then you will both be killed.  Whoever leaves, man, it must be tonight.  And, man, if you don't do the deed within three months, it'll be too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do yous mean, 'too late'?&quot; asked Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure, Moondoggy.  It just says, 'too late.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It actually say, 'too late,'?&quot; Smash interjected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no.  I saw the vision of a donkey skinnydipping in a vat of chocolate ice cream.  We ogre hippies concluded long ago that that particular image means 'too late.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Da young ogres could no deny da wisdom of da ogre hippies of yore.  Dey thought about what deir grandpa had told dem.  Dey thought so hard it make deir heads hurt.  Finally, Smash stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me will go!  Me will go smash goblin!  Me is oldest, and derefore me should be one who goes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash didn't like da idea of his brudder on his own and felt confident dat he himself could kill mean old Smellybreath.  But, he and his brother have become almost perfect equals in fighting over the past few years.  He no could argue with his older brudder, and he knew no udder ogre -- udder dan himself -- was suited for da job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smash,&quot; Bash said with tears in eyes, &quot;Me know yous will avenge our parent's death.  Me sure you not gonna fail and den force me to go on adventure of me own.  Make sure yous give dat wizard an extra good bash for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me will.  Me promise.  Me will come back and den us will finally be like regular ogres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shroombaby,&quot; Papa said placing his arms on Smash's shoulders, &quot;Take care of yourself.  I have put together a journey pack for you.  It has all the things you will ever need.  Well, it has all the things I ever needed on adventures.  Hurry up and take it and get out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod, Smash picked up da ogre backpack off of da floor.  He gave his family each a good, big ogre hug and den opened up da door.  He stepped out into a starlit sky, and jogged off towards the city gates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me hope he be ok,&quot; sniffled Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shroombaby's got a good head on his shoulders.  Nothing's gonna happen to him.  He'll be back before the three months are up.  Man, I've got 'the munchies' something fierce!&quot;<br />
<br />
A year passed by and dey never heard from Smash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lilting was a young male halfling who grew up in Rivervale with his family.  Like almost all halflings, Lilting was a druid.  His mother was a druid, his father was a druid, and his uncle was a used armor salesman... but we won't speak of dat black sheep of the family.<br />
<br />
On a particularly hot afternoon, Lilting was on da outskirts of town trying various techniques of da druid ways.  Da blond haired halfling liked to try unconventional methods of his magic.  He thought dere was more to being a druid dan what most people tink.  Unfortunately, he just wasn't very good at spell casting at all.  And even more unfortunately, he was a bit clumsy and some would also say a little slow in da head.<br />
<br />
&quot;See that bixie over there?&quot; Lilting asked his halfling buddy who was out wit him dis day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do,&quot; his friend Nappyhair replied wit a hint of irritation.  &quot;It's five feet in front of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well watch this!  Watch how a tried and true method can be used more effectively when reversed!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Nappyhair responded not really, caring anymore.<br />
<br />
Lilting began waving his arms around and chanting.  Blue sparks emanating from his fingers, he spoke da magic words. &quot;I call upon the spirits of wolf!  Come to me and enter this bixie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nappyhair, hardly listening but catching dat last line, snapped his head in Lilting's direction wit pure puzzlement.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure that you want to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh!  Watch!  Trust me,&quot; the halfling said as he quickly began casting his second spell.  &quot;Sticky feet come to me, Ensnare my foe and don't let him free!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of pointing at da bixie, however, Lilting pointed to himself.  His feet seemed to magically acquire some powerful adhesive dat made it much harder for him to run.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm...&quot; is all Nappyhair could say.  He was in complete bewilderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I call this a 'Reverse Kite.'&quot; Lilting said proudly.  &quot;You see, I figure that if most druids have a hard time when they are sped up and monsters are slowed down, that if the opposite were applied then I should have an easier time with everything.  The theory is sound!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm...&quot; is all Nappyhair could say as he looked at his friend in disbelief.  About dis time, da small bee-like fairy realized what was going on.  It turned and made a mad dash for Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Run!&quot; yelped Nappyhair.  &quot;You've made it mad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, don't worry!  My theory will work.  It's been...  OW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da bixie easily caught up with da slower halfling and stung him right in da arm.  Even da bixie couldn't believe how stupid dis particular halfling was.  Realizing dat maybe his idea might not be as brilliant as he had thought, Lilting opted to do what druids do best:  Run away like mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get out of here!  Ow!  Ow!&quot; Lilting said turning to his friend, but Nappyhair had long since bolted away.  Lilting started to make a run for his home, but it was slow-going because of his ensnare spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in Rivervale, an out-of-breath Nappyhair explained to Lilting's parents what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we to do with our son?&quot; asked Mama Lildruid.  &quot;He doesn't seem to want to learn our ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we'll just have to punish him.  Again.&quot; Daddy Lildruid was disappointed his only son wouldn't learn da art of being a druid.  &quot;How far behind you was he, Nappyhair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uh,&quot; stammered Nappyhair, &quot;I think he, uh, was right behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly a faint noise could be heard coming from just outside da city gates.  &quot;Ow!&quot;  It progressively became louder.  &quot;Ow!&quot;  Many halflings exited deir homes to see what dis noise was and crowded around the center of da town.<br />
<br />
Coming over da ridge, a very stung and very slow Lilting jogged towards his parents.  Just behind him was da mean bixie who kept stinging his backside.  &quot;Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!&quot;  Lilting kept yelping.<br />
<br />
Daddy Lildruid came to da rescue and swatted da bixie away.  &quot;Get out of here!&quot;  Da bixie just made a laughing, buzzing sound at Lilting and left da way it came.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, young man,&quot; Daddy Lildruid began, &quot;What were you thinking?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to try...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to get yourself killed!&quot; Mama Lildruid scolded.  &quot;Why do you have to try different things?  We're druids!  We cast, and then we run away!  We cast again, and then we run away again!  Anything else is suicide!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da gathered crowd of halfling villagers all nodded deir agreement at what da boy's mother had said.  Dis was da art of kiting first invented by da halfling legend, Kiter McTerrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son,&quot; his father told Lilting sternly while placing a hand on his shoulder, &quot;I'm going to have to punish you until you learn.  No supper for you tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo!!!  Dad, please, no!  Anything but that!  Anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, I say, Hold on here!&quot;  A voice from da crowd rose up.  A halfling pushed his way through da crowd.  He was older dan da rest of da halflings, fatter too.  &quot;Now what is, I say, what is the problem here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mayor McFurrybottom!&quot;  Daddy Lildruid said in astonishment.  &quot;There's no problem.  Well, nothing too big.  It's my son, your honor.  He rejects our standard druid ways and tried a new fighting tactic.  He trained a bixie into town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?  Bixies, eh?  Nasty little, I say, nasty little buggers.  Can't have them running around town.  Certainly not.&quot;  Da crowd of halflings shook deir heads in agreement, wit several others repeating &quot;Certainly not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of you understand,&quot; Lilting began, &quot;I feel that druids are capable of much more than what we know!  I think that we can become one of the land's most respected people and not just a running gag!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, my boy,&quot; da Mayor said in disbelief,  &quot;We druids have survived hundreds of years by holding dear to the truths and teachings of our beloved Kiter McTerrified!  We will continue to do for hundreds of years more.  Running away is what we do best!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe I'm tired of running away!&quot; Lilting said wit tears of anger and frustration welling up inside him.  &quot;Maybe I want to use a weapon now and then!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mama Lildruid snapped a hand up to her mouth in utter horror at what her son had just said.  Da crowd of halflings gasped in shock and began whispering amongst demselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I want to actually use spells like thorn skin!&quot; Lilting said defiantly.<br />
<br />
Mama Lildruid's second hand snapped up to her mouth.   Louder gasps and whispers came from da crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe I want to shave my foot hair from time to time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mama Lildruid's eyes rolled back into her head and she fainted.  Daddy Lildruid could stand to hear no more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Blasphemy!&quot; said Daddy.  &quot;Son, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that!  I'm going to pretend the bee stings on your backside are causing you to think irrationally!  Look what you did to your mother! Go to your room this instant!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One more thing, dad.&quot; said Lilting.  &quot;Maybe I want to actually join a group when I go out fighting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it, boy,&quot; Mayor McFurrybottom said wit a finger pointed straight at Lilting, &quot;You're a bad seed.  Thoughts like that will destroy this town!  You bring a nasty bixie here today, what will you bring tomorrow with these foolhardy ideas?  A bear?  A giant?!  I hearby decree that you shall be banned from this city for a period of no less than 3 months!  If being out on your own doesn't teach you that our ways are the correct ways, nothing will!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go!&quot; da mayor pointed towards da gates of da city.  Da crowd all nodded in agreement with the mayor.  Each halfling had a scowl on their face and waited impatiently for Lilting to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son,&quot; Daddy Lildruid said wit restraint, &quot;I think this is for the best.  Please do as the Mayor says.  And please remember our teachings.  They will keep you alive.  Don't be a fool and try to change them.  Now, please go.  Your mother and I will await your return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, son.  For your mother, for me, for yourself.  Just go.&quot;<br />
<br />
And without another word, Lilting turned around and slowly walked out of Rivervale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was da middle of da night and all was silent in Oggok.  Well, all was silent except for all da loud snoring coming from every single ogre cave in dat town, and da loud scraping sound made whenever da guards needed to scratch demselves.  Udder dan dat dough, all was quiet.<br />
<br />
On his bed dat was made of a big slab of rock, Bash slept uneasily.  He always had nightmares of what he feared may have happened to Smash on his journey.  It had been a year since he saw him last and Bash worried he may no have killed Smellybreath.<br />
<br />
A very loud *THUD* woke Bash up with startle.  Bash looked over to see Papa Smurpheater on da floor cursing someting about it being too dark during night time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa!&quot; said Bash as he jumped out bed to help da old ogre up. &quot;Is yous ok?  What you doing in me room dis late?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grandpa rubbed da side of his face for a few seconds and den spoke.  &quot;Well, Moondoggy, I wake up because I had the munch...er.. I was hungry.  So I stumble into the kitchen to grab a bite to eat.  Well, I accidentally grabbed the Sacred Peyote and didn't know it.  I took a huge bite and swallowed it down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash hoped his grandpa wasn't going to die.  He never seen him so sick and wobbly before.<br />
<br />
&quot;The funny thing is,&quot; said Papa, &quot;I found out that I've been using the Sacred Peyote wrong all these years.  You're not supposed to smoke it!  It was a groovy experience, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what happened?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... let me think... it's all a little fuzzy.  Well, naturechild, I think your brother's not coming back anytime soon.  And I think he may even be in danger.  The Details are a bit funny.  I do know this though:  You must go to Halas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Halas?!&quot; Bash said in complete shock.  &quot;But dat is farthest away place of anywhere in dis world!  What is me supposed to do dere?!  Buy a kilt?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Settle down, hip cat.&quot;  Papa said wit his hands raised.  &quot;You need to head to that land of uncool coldness to talk the one person who can tell you where to find your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who would dat be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea.  I just know he's hanging around Halas.  That's what my vision said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And is dat all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it said that if you find people willing to help you along your journey, that you should let them.  Maybe even go out of your way to ask a few people.  If I had not smoked the Peyote last time, I bet the same would have applied to your brother.  Stupid me.  I should have realized that trying to solo in this world is the second dumbest thing there is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's da first dumbest ting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Answering a female ogre when she asks, 'Do yous tink me hips look fatter now dan before?' instead of running away.  There is no way to answer that question without getting several broken bones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.  Me remember dat.  Is dat all da visions yous had?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.  Well, after all that I did have a good conversation with a purple camel and a very foul-mouthed rock.  But it wasn't anything important.  Something about 'A Banshee and sock puppets.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Me will leave in da morning for Halas.  Me was having good dream about dat cute ogre girl in da Shaman guild.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no!  You have to leave tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that was part of my vision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said dat was all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah.  Shut up.  You have to leave tonight or else...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Da donkey and da ice cream?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it.&quot;  Papa reached into his tunic and pulled out some coins. &quot;Here, take these and buy some food for your journey.  And also...&quot;<br />
<br />
Papa walked to the other end of the room and opened up a secret, false-rock panel.  He pulled out a gigantic, gold-plated mallet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to take this.  I should have given it to your brother, but I was too stoned to remember it.  This hammer has seen many adventuring days in our family and has squished many an orc head.  It is said that if the right ogre were to ever wield it...  Ah, I can't remember the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash's eyes were wide open, staring at da most beautiful hammer he ever seen.  He thought he was not worthy of such a ting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa... me... me no can take dis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you can, and yes you will.  I can't smoke it, so what good does it do me anymore?  Besides, you may need it for some nasty, harrowing, climactic escape or battle.  Now, get out here.  There's little time to waste!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash gently took da mallet from Papa's hands with awe and reverence.  He den hugged his grandfather and left da house he and his brudder had been raised in for several years.  Bash stopped at da 24 hour ogre store near da Oggok entrance to buy some rations and den set off on his journey.<br />
<br />
Bash jogged down da road dat lead southeast in da Feerrott swamp.  Swatting at buzzing mosquitoes and stomping on da occasional snake for fun, he made good time.  An hour or so down da road he noticed dat da sun was starting to come up. <br />
<br />
Bash stopped as he saw a small lizard camp dat he knew well.  He saw da three lizardmen warming demselves around a fire dat he and Smash used to beat upon to help demselves train.  He smiled.<br />
<br />
Da lizardmen all looked up at da same time and saw Bash wit a wicked grin on his face.  Den dey saw da big, golden hammer da ogre was carrying.  Dey looked at each udder, and den dey immediately scattered in all directions to hide from da ogre dey remembered all-too-well.<br />
<br />
Bash frowned.  Da lizards no wanted to play.  He sighed and prepared to continue onward, but he heard a noise come from somewhere above him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a tree!  I'm a tree!  I'm a...&quot; Da snapping and cracking of a branch was heard shortly after da voice was interrupted.<br />
<br />
Bash scratched his head in puzzlement and a few seconds later he saw a blond halfling fall from da sky and land wit a loud *THUMP* in front of him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash looked at da unconscious halfling dat lay in front of him on da forest road.  He said many 'tank yous' to his god, Da Warlord, for giving him such a fine meal dis day.  He bent over and picked up da halfling, opened his mouth and prepared to take a big bite.<br />
<br />
Da halfling awoke just as his little head was inside da big ogre's mouth.  A muffled scream came from inside Bash's throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleesh donf eaf mef!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash pulled da halfling out of his mouth.  &quot;What did yous call me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said,&quot; the frightened halfling stammered, &quot;'Please don't eat me!'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?  Yous look like a good meal.  Me is hungry.  Me have long journey ahead of me and me need da protein.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...  But I can help you!&quot;  The halfling would do anything at this point to get out of being eaten.  &quot;You need someone to carry that big hammer for you on your journey?  You need someone to help you fight whatever it is you need fighting?  You need anyone to slay some mean wizards or someth...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizards?  What yous know about wizards?&quot;  Bash was intrigued.  Maybe he stumbled upon a ting who knew where Smellybreath was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing other than they use magic.  I was just saying I could help...&quot;<br />
<br />
Den again, maybe not.  But Bash remembered what his grandpa said about letting peoples join his group if he meet peoples who is willing.  He decided to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Yous can come along wit me and me will no eat yous.  Me name is Bash Emgood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; The halfling became excited and relieved at the same time.  Maybe Lilting will be able to do something to prove dat druids is more dan what everyone tinks on dis journey.  &quot;My name is Lilting.  So where are we headed and what are we doing when we get there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us is going to Halas.  And when we get dere, us is looking for a person me grandpa told me about who can tell us where me brudder is so us can find a goblin who bashed our parents and den bash it and come back and be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting just blinked in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Us is going to Halas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok!  Well, let's get going!  I hope you don't have anything against druids because I am one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash's urge to eat da halfling resurfaced.  He did his best to stifle it.  At least, Bash thought, he'll be able to haul his little butt away from any danger.  Me will no have to protect him too much.  Dat is good.<br />
<br />
&quot;However,&quot; Lilting began, &quot;I'm not like most druids.  I don't believe in using the same tactics every other druid employs.&quot;<br />
<br />
So much for dat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's get going!&quot; the enthusiastic halfling excalimed excitedly.  &quot;Can I carry that big hammer of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ride on your shoulders?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I sing some traveling songs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I pick fights with everything that passes us by because you'll pound them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Da questions of da halfling trailed off as dey headed east towards da murky, foul, Innothule Swamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Da big ogre and tiny halfling made it to da pass dat lead to da swamp in just half a day.  Once through, dey found da swamp was thicker, muckier, and more stinky dan normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I run circles around you for excercise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I hop up and down instead of just normal hiking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I...&quot;  Da smell of da swamp hit da halfling's nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ewww!  This place is gross!&quot; a very disgusted Lilting said as he placed his hand up to cover his mouth and nose.  &quot;How long do we have to endure this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You not know?&quot; Bash asked curiously.  &quot;Didn't yous come through swamp to get to da lovely Feerrott?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uh, no.&quot; da halfling said nervously.  You see, I, uh... well... I tried to teach myself to teleport but in an unconventional way.  To make a long story short...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Save it.  Me tink me hear someting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Through the dense fog and trees covered wit vines, Bash thought he could see a lot of movement.  He figured da sounds he heard came from dere, so he decided to head towards it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uh!&quot; a defiant Lilting said.  &quot;I'm not wading through that muck!  You can just go on without me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da next sound heard was da splash of water about as loud as a splash dat a halfling makes when thrown by an ogre into a murky bog.<br />
<br />
Bash and Lilting trudged through the thick slime for about an hour until Bash spotted da ting he saw from da pass.  A large group of green, stinky trolls were huddled together in a large circle cheering and hooting about someting.  Bash decided to get a closer look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy?!&quot;  Lilting was not happy about going to meet a bunch of stinky trolls.  &quot;They'll eat us alive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No dey won't.&quot;  Bash said. Lilting's face became washed wit relief.  &quot;Dey will only eat yous.  Trolls no mess wit us big ogres.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Lilting's face contorted wit fear again.<br />
<br />
&quot;But no worry.  Just don't talk and yous be fine.  Me have idea if trolls ask questions.  If anyone is gonna eat yous, it gonna be me!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Lilting thought dat was good, but wasn't sure.<br />
<br />
Da ogre and halfling approached da trolls cautiously.  Da trolls were excited about someting in da center of deir circle.  Dey were throwing gold pieces all over the place in da center.  Bash and Smash no could see into da circle of trolls because da green, smelly tings were tightly packed together.  Bash pulled one troll aside to ask some questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dumbhead,&quot; said Bash with authority and intimidation, &quot;What is going on in dere?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da troll looked back and forth with a little bit of fear.  Not wanting to get involved wit an ogre, and also wanting to get back to whatever it was he was doing, he decided to just answer da ogres questions quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miz iz warchin dim barsh gud!  Us trows monies at chumin ilf gud barsher.  Miz maykz lotz uv monies!  Himz barsh de froggo bist miz evur see!&quot;  Da troll, not wanting to waste more time talking to da ogre, turned around and begain cheering some more.<br />
<br />
Lilting raised one eyebrow in complete confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did he say?&quot; whispered da halfling to da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said dat dere is a human-elf in dere who can bash frogloks better dan anyting he ever seen before.  Me guess da trolls is betting money on who will win, and he made tons of money from betting on human-elf.  Me guess it never lost yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see!&quot; da halfling said excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yous is too short to see over da trolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you pick me up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.  Dat true.  Maybe dat good idea and yous tell me what yous see.&quot;  And wit dat, da ogre picked up da halfling and held him high over da heads of da trolls.<br />
<br />
What Lilting saw was two beings locked in a fight. Both a froglok and a light brown-haired half-elf were circling around each other, waiting for da udder to strike.  Da froglok wore chainmail and was holding an axe. Da half-elf wore leather armor with udder bits and pieces of green cloth all over  da place (but nothing on his head) and wielded a longsword in one hand and a forward-curved short sword in da udder. <br />
<br />
Da froglok attacked first.  It swung its axe in a chopping motion towards da half-elf.  Da half-elf easily dodged and parried da blow down to da ground.  Da froglok lifted its axe and swung at da half-elf. It was easily parried wit one sword as anudder stabbed da froglok in da arm.  Da froglok went into a frenzy and swung wildly at da half-elf.  His axe was blocked again and forced downward to touch da ground again.  Da half-elf brought up his short sword in a blinding rush and caused da froglok to try and dodge.  As soon as da froglok did, dough, da half-elf switched directions wit his short sword and den spun around in a quick flash and stabbed da froglok wit his longsword straight through its head.  Da froglock fell over in a lump and da trolls cheered and roared.<br />
<br />
Lilting watched da whole ting in amazement.  Da fight was over in a blink of an eye and never before did he ever see such skill and speed in a swordsman.  <br />
<br />
Da trolls in one part of the circle spread apart to let anudder troll walk in.  Dis troll was carrying a bigger, meaner looking froglok.  He set it down and joined da udder trolls.  Da trolls formed a tight circle again.<br />
<br />
Da froglock, not wanting to be away from its home any longer dan needed, began attacking da half-elf right away.  But instead of using a weapon, it started to cast fireball spells at da half-elf.  Da half-elf was quick dough, and dodged back and forth avoiding da fireballs.  Leaping and rolling, he moved closer towards da froglok.<br />
<br />
Da froglok summoned more power dis time and its hand glowed brighter dan before.  It shot out a massive fireball towards da half-elf.  Da half-elf leaped high and did a flip towards da froglock.  At da end of his spin, and before he touched da ground, he stabbed da froglock wit his longsword and den sliced downwards wit his shortsword, splitting da frog's head in two vertical pieces.<br />
<br />
Landing and den pulling his swords out sharply, da half-elf watched as da froglok just slumped to da ground next to a dozen or so udder froglok corpses.  Da trolls roared and cheered even louder dan before.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on in dere?!&quot; Bash asked quickly.  &quot;What do yous see?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see....  Wow!  This guy is amazing!&quot;  Lilting was too awestruck and breathtaken to find words.  &quot;He killed them all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who did?  A troll?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  That wizard had no chance at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizard?!&quot;  Bash became excited at da thought of someting being able to kill a wizard.  Bash needed whatever's help was in dat circle of trolls.  He got an idea.<br />
<br />
At da top of his lungs, Bash shouted.  &quot;Me saw Jocka da female troll outside of Grobb entrance skinny dipping in da swamp!  She said someting about free food to da first 3 'cute' trolls to come see her!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da entire group of trolls immmediately shut up and turned towards da ogre.  Den, each at da exact same time, turned deir heads in da same direction looking off into da swamp somwhere.  A split second later, da trolls were running off into da swamp at extreme speed.  Well, fast for trolls anyway.<br />
<br />
Looking downward and brushing himself off, da half-elf started to talk.  &quot;Thanks for that, I didn't think they were going to let me go anytime soon.&quot;  Da half-elf looked up and saw da ogre holding a halfling in one hand.  Swords instantly came up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me alone, big one!  I'm sure you'll kill me, but I'll go down with a fight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me don't want to kill yous.  Me want yous help.  Us is looking to kill a goblin wizard and we need someone like yous.&quot;<br />
<br />
A little confused, da half-elf furrowed his brow and just stared at da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true!&quot; Lilting piped up.  &quot;He hasn't eaten me and it's been almost a full day since we met!  I'm pretty sure he's telling the truth!  You were amazing in there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was this close to being killed.  Had I been in there one more minute, I'd be dead right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?  You were wiping the floor with them!&quot;  da halfling said not believing dis half-elf.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was brushing near death each time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't even get a scratch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was lucky.  Had you not come along...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you just kill the trolls and be done with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, I knew I was going to get killed any time now.  It's a miracle I've lived this long.  I figured I might as well go out a hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash had enough of da question and answer session.  &quot;Look, will yous help us or not?  Us is in kind of a hurry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da half-elf considered it for a minute.  &quot;Well, I'm positive I'll be slain within a day and won't be much good to you.  But, I've got nothing better to do while waiting for my inevitable death.  Sure, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Us need a good elf fighter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not an elf or a fighter!  I'm a half-elf ranger!  Fighters can at least survive their fights!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you just surviv...&quot; Lilting began but was interrupted by Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Me is Bash Emgood and dis is Lilting.  Us is going to Halas and we need to get going now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.  My name is Treehugger.&quot;<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da three of dem trudged northward in da swamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Onward through da icky swamp da three heroes charged.  For hours and hours, dey marched never stopping.  Well, ok, dey did stop once at a McNuglug's for a Big Nug and some fries, but dat's it.<br />
<br />
Through slime and stagnant water, dey trode.  Avoiding such dangers as mad frogloks, mean alligators, and female trolls in heat, our party finally made it to da trail dat lead out of da swamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this it?&quot; an exhausted, slime-covered Lilting asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me tink so,&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Me pretty sure dis is da way to Halas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This, my friends, is the way to Southern part of the Desert of Ro.&quot;  said Treehugger.  &quot;Not exactly the fastest way to Halas, but probably the least dangerous.  I came through here from the town of Freeport.  We'll need to go there and head west.  From there, we'll need directions because that part of the land is new to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Dat sound good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wit dat, da party walked da trail to Southern Ro.  Expecting desert, Bash and Lilting were surprised to see a lush, green landscape full of trees and grass as far as dey could see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you lying son of a...!&quot; da halfling started to say but was cut short.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilting!  Be nice.  Treehugger, dis not look like a desert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm aware of that.  The desert is a few miles north of here.  There seems to be some magical barrier that prevents the desert from touching the swamp but I'm not sure if...&quot; <br />
<br />
Da ranger was cut short when an orc approached dem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hul-lo,&quot; the orc said in a deep, raspy voice.  &quot;Me are Smeg.  Smeg wants sell you copper coin for two silver!  Smeg say it good deal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash fought da urge to pound the hated orc into vanilla pudding.  He never liked orcs and never trusted dem.  Lilting spoke for dem all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that sounds like an 'ok' deal Smeg, but I think we're not interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den, Bash felt his hammer become warm.  It became warmer and warmer and he didn't know why.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said Treehugger, &quot;We've no time for orc deals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den, Smeg smiled and four orcs appeared out of da trees and surrounded da little party.  Bash's hammer flared up.  It turned bright white and was berry hot to da touch.  For some reason, Bash not minded it and no dropped it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smeg think that since you no like deal, he say you die!&quot; the orc said.  Da four orcs all wit weapons drawn, closed in on da group of good guys.<br />
<br />
Treehuggers swords instantly appeared.  Lilting pulled out a tiny, tiny, miniscule dagger.<br />
<br />
Da orcs rushed in.  Treehugger took da orc nearest to him.  Lilting squealed like a little girl as one orc rushed him.  Bash felt da heat from da hammer and almost seemed to speak to him.  It wanted orc blood.<br />
<br />
Treehugger had little trouble fighting his orc.  Da orc was clumsy and stupid.  Treehugger was not.  Slapping da silly orc's club dis way and dat and kicking it square in da chest, da orc just got madder as it fell backwards to da ground.  It sprung back up with a mean sneer on its face.  Treehugger grinned.<br />
<br />
Lilting, on da udder hand, was scared out of his little britches.  He saw big, nasty, green orc charging at him with a shortsword.  His first instinct was to run.  But some, sane, rational, quiet part of his mind told him not to.  He instead, on instinct alone, started to use da same trick he tried on da bixie.  He started to cast da Spirit of da Wolf on da orc.<br />
<br />
Bash was oblivious to everyting but one orc charging in on him.  Da orc let out a little snarl.  Bash let out a roar.  A deafening roar.  A roar dat would have made a giant lion proud.  A warrior's roar.  Dis made da orc slow down a little bit in confusion.  It was all da time Bash needed to bring up his hammer and send it swinging down towards da orc's head at a blinding speed.<br />
<br />
Treehugger seemed to be having a little bit too much fun taunting and mocking his orc opponent.  Da orc would swing his club at da ranger only to find dat da ranger would swing his swords underneath the club and force it back at da orc.  Da club would den smack da orc's face.  <br />
<br />
Da half-elf realized da trouble Lilting might be in and decided to end his own fun.  He turned his back to da orc and with a quick backwards thrust slammed his longsword into da orc's gut.  And without even turning around, Treehugger quickly bent backwards and  thrust his shortsword in an upward motion dat arced right into da orc's head.  Treehugger quickly bent forward again to stand upright and da orc just fell limply to da ground.<br />
<br />
Lilting quickly began da words to his spell.  &quot;Spirit of Wolf I beg of you; enter this orc, oh please do!&quot;  And wit dat, da orc started to run at twice da speed it did before.  Da halfling pointed his dagger straight at da orc and shut his eyes in a wincing manner.<br />
<br />
Da orc, fully surprised dat it was moving much more quickly now, realized much too late what to do about it.  Before it had a chance for its brain to tell its feet to stop moving, da orc looked down and saw dat it's chest was bloody.<br />
<br />
Lilting opened his eyes to see a very shocked orc impaled on his tiny, tiny, oh-so tiny dagger.  Da orc looked at its chest wound, looked up at Lilting, and looked down again.  It den finally fell backwards, dead as a doornail.<br />
<br />
Bash's hammer came straight towards da orc.  Da orc, realizing it's doom, swung its sword at da ogre in desperation in da hopes it would hit someting.  A split second latter, where an orc once was, dere was just a messy mess of orc splat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see that?!&quot; and excited Lilting exclaimed loudly as he ran up to Bash.  &quot;It worked!  My theory worked!  Woo hoo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den, da fourth orc charged at Lilting (me said four orcs surrounded dem, remember?).  Not even noticing, Lilting just danced around.  Without even tinking, Bash dropped his hammer, picked up Lilting, straightened da halfling's little arm dat was holding da dagger, and threw da little guy at da orc like a spear.<br />
<br />
Screaming through the air (not just a figure of speech, Lilting literally was screaming), Lilting headed right for da orc.  Da orc stopped and just watched dis blurry little guy come right at him.  Da orc exploded as da halfling went right through it like a warm knife in butter.<br />
<br />
Bash picked up his hammer and stomped over to an onlooking Smeg.  Treehugger jogged up right next to him.  Both had weapons drawn ready to finish off da devious orc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smeg sees you are not stupid customers.&quot; da orc said nervously.  &quot;Smeg make deal.  Smeg sell copper piece for one silver instead of two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked at Treehugger, and da ranger silently nodded at da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den,&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Dat is a good deal.  Here is yous money.&quot;  And wit dat, dey purchased da copper coin and Smeg walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  I can't believe I survived that!  I thought I was surely done for.  That orc came real close to killing me!&quot; da ranger said with no amount of sarcasm.  &quot;If you guys hadn't been there I....  say, Bash, you're wounded!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked down.  His thigh was sliced open by da first orc he smashed.  He didn't even realize it before, but now dat he did, it burned like fire.  Da blood was coming out pretty rapidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What we need is a cleric,&quot; Treehugger said.  &quot;A cleric could heal that, no problem.  Plus, a cleric might be able to keep me alive longer than 24 hours.  Maybe I'd be able to live 48.  I doubt it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den,&quot; Bash said as he grinned against da pain.  &quot;Where can us find one of dem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oasis, I bet.  They're always hanging around there to heal up the idiots who think they can take on crocodiles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Let's go dere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, Lilting slowly wobbled up with arms outstretched and a look of shock on his face.  Da halfling looked down and noticed he was completely covered in orc goo.<br />
<br />
&quot;EWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!&quot; da halfling screamed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Treehugger dressed Bash's wound as best he could, but he was no doctor.  Treehugger was sure da bandages would no last.  <br />
<br />
After a quick bath (more like &quot;ogre dunk&quot;) in a nearby pond, Lilting was, for da most part,  cleaned up and ready to go.  Northward bound, our party trekked.<br />
<br />
Through da desert dey went.  Hot sands blowing into deir face, sand blowing down up deir shirts, sand blowing down deir paints, it was not da best ting each of dem remembered.  Da worst of it, dough, was Lilting constantly complaining about his chapped lips and how he needed some chapstick or he'd &quot;just die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Half a day's journey through da desert, Bash started to feel da effects of his loss of blood.  His bandages had long since been bled through and dere was nothing any of dem could do but hope dey made it to da Oasis in time.  Pushing back da pain and fatigue, Bash moved onward.<br />
<br />
A couple hours later, Bash collapsed.  Lilting and Treehugger spent some time rigging up a stretcher dat dey could drag da ogre on.<br />
<br />
After several hours, dey gave up.  Dere is no way in da Plane of Hate dat a halfling and a half-elf can move an ogre.  No possible way.   So, dey just dumped some water on Bash's face and smacked him around a bit.  After twenty minutes of dis, Bash wake up enough to continue on.<br />
<br />
Barely able to lift his hammer anymore and just dragging it in da sand, Bash saw finally saw a ray of hope.  In da not-too-distance, he saw what appeared to be a small oasis.  He concluded dat dis place must be da Oasis.  Dough, it confused him because just a few hundred feet from da Oasis was da ocean, but he soon forgot about dat and concentrated on more important tings like how much a good halfling, lettuce, and tomato sandwich cost.  And how does paper actually beat rock?  And, oh yeah, how he can get dis nasty cut in his leg cured.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is it! Treehugger said.  &quot;We're bound to find a cleric here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so.&quot; whined Lilting.  &quot;I'm sure to die if I don't get my lips healed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger just gave da halfling a scornful look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah.  Right.&quot; Lilting remembered da ogre's big gash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me.... be... ok.&quot; Bash said in ragged breaths.  &quot;It.....just....papercut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without hesitating or arguing da point, Treehugger lead da way down near da shore to a small, abandoned dock.  Well, it was abandoned by da original owner, but it was currently occupied.  A berry long line of peoples of all shapes and sizes was formed for someting.  As da party approached, dey saw what it was for.<br />
<br />
A high-elf female stood at da beginning of da line, facing all da peoples who was obviously waiting for her.  She was dressed in a blue and white robe and had light brown hair.  She was tall, tall even for a high-elf.  Treehugger made haste to get to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's your problem?&quot; da high-elf asked a human who's arms and legs apparently had been chewn off.  &quot;And I suppose you want that healed, huh?  You sure?  You could get quite the many ladies with a nickname like 'Stumpy' and a tale of woe about the loss of your limbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da man started to frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh all right!&quot; da high-elf said exasperated.  &quot;Blah biddy blah, you're healed.  Now get out of here.  And if I see you again today, you're going to be 'Stumpy' for good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Next in line was a male wood-elf who was not bleeding and had all of his limbs.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's your problem, little man?&quot; said da high-elf, obviously not caring.  Da wood-elf turned around to show what was wrong.  Clamped onto his rear was a baby alligator who did not want to let go it seemed.<br />
<br />
With a quick yank and a loud scream from da wood-elf, da high-elf removed da alligator and threw it into da ocean.  &quot;Blah blah blah, you're healed.&quot;  Da high-elf became real saracastic and condescending and said, &quot;Now don't pick on those mean ol' babies anymore!&quot; and den cackled.<br />
<br />
Treehugger appeared, out of breath from running.  &quot;Ogre.... cut..... lips.... leg.... orc....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, honey, I don't care what kind of panting pervert you are, but you're going to have to get in line like the rest of these poor saps!&quot;<br />
<br />
Catching his breath, Treehugger stood up straight and finally realized just exactly how beautiful dis high-elf female was.  &quot;Whoa!  Hey baby!  What's your sign?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Red and octagonal.  Now get in line!&quot;<br />
<br />
Remembering just why he was here, Treehugger focused his mind back on da situation at hand.  &quot;Forgive me, but I am dire need of help.  An ogre friend of mine is in need of your aid or he will die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I should care because...?  Look, all of these people in line are 'on the brink of death' and many of them have been waiting here for hours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like you're not enjoying this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I love to sit in the hot sun healing idiots who think they're all big and bad by fighting crocodiles only to learn they get the tar pounded out of them.&quot; said da high-elf sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, look, what if I said we could get out of here.  What if I said I can take you to a place that is nothing like this hot desert?  We are in need of a cleric.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're in need of a brain.  But still, it would be nice to get out of here.  What's the catch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My ogre friend...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right.  You're mortally wounded ogre friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  Can you please go over there and heal him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right!  I'll go.  You lead the way though.  I don't want you staring at my elven behind, pig!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing.  My name is Treehugger.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Am I supposed to care or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about all these people you need to heal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure they'll manage.  They've survived this far in life despite the fact they're idiots.  They'll continue to survive somehow.  Morons never seem to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
All da people in line began to start frowning and crying.<br />
<br />
And wit dat, Treehugger lead da way towards da place where Bash had passed out yet again.  &quot;I think she likes me,&quot; he thought and smiled.  &quot;I'm such a smoothie!  Too bad I'm going to die any day now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da two approached da prone ogre and a crouched halfling searching da ogre for any sort of chapstick.  He turned around and shot straight up as he saw da high-elf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, big momma!&quot; said da shocked halfling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, big intelligence!&quot; said da high-elf mockingly.  &quot;Now, stand back, both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da high-elf removed da blood-soaked bandages, placed her hands over da wound and said, &quot;Blah blah, yakkity yak.  You're healed.&quot;<br />
<br />
She moved her hands away and da wound was gone.  Bash's eyes snapped open and he sat up.  &quot;Me had bad dream.  Me dreamt me was getting felt-up by Lilting!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My lady,&quot; Treehugger began, &quot;Meet Bash Emgood.  The little one is Lilting Lildruid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah.  Let's get acquaintences over with already.  I'm Medsa.  Medsa Lotte.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a pretty name for a pretty lady,&quot; Treehugger thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Da party moved northward through the desert.  Reaching da northern side of da oasis in Oasis dey stopped at a merchant's tent for some supplies.<br />
<br />
&quot;So just where exactly are we going?&quot; asked Medsa in her usual over-authoritative brash way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halas!&quot; said an excited Lilting after having just purchased some lip balm.  &quot;It's gonna be fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HALAS?!?!!&quot; said a not-so-calm cleric.  Turning to Treehugger, she asked, again in a not-so-calm fashion,&quot;What in the 3 planes and 3 unreleased planes of existence made you think that I'd enjoy that frost-ridden, savage-infested, slippery, slushy, iced hell-hole of a waste of space on this planet?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A little more than afraid, Treehugger bowed his head in silence.  Den, he remembered someting and said, &quot;Well, I did say that we were going to a place that is nothing at all like this desert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa just sneered at da ranger but didn't say anyting.  Treehugger just winked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, tiny lady,&quot; Bash joined in, &quot;Us is on an important quest.  Us needs to stop a powerful goblin wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From doing what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm... us just needs to stop him, ok?!  If yous want to go back to heal da losers den just go.  Yous not need to waste our time and insult me friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa considered da ogre's words.  But, den she looked back half a mile and still saw da line of peoples waiting to be healed.  Da peoples were still looking around not knowing what to do, while some where just looking in her direction.  She thought she could still see some crying.  Da cleric decided dat life was not for her and maybe she needed to go on dis adventure after all.  Maybe it would be nice to have some friends for a change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine!  I'll go on your lame little voyage. But I'm just doing it because I feel sorry for you pathetic people!  Always remember that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Let's get moving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den, dey all heard a loud, deep scream of terror.  Dey turned around to see a big, mean Sand Giant running from a tiny skeleton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help!  Help!  It's gonna kill me!&quot; da Sand Giant yelled as it came near da group.  It stopped in front of Bash and pleaded.  &quot;It's gonna kill me!  He's gonna kill me!  Please help!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da skeleton caught up to da giant and laughed.  It poked da giant in da ankle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!  Ow!&quot; da Giant cried.  And den, a split second later, it fell over dead.<br />
<br />
Da skeleton laughed again and did a Pee-Wee Herman dance with a bit of disco thrown in for good measure.  Over da hill, a tiny gnome came running up to da dead giant.  Da gnome had white hair, a big nose, and a brown robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good work, Jakontiklarkiak!  Here's a skellie snack!&quot; da gnome said as he pulled out a green and blue box dat had da words 'Skellie Snacks' on da front.  He took out a brown cookie-like object and tossed it to da skeleton.  <br />
<br />
Da skeleton jumped up in da air and caught it in it's mouth and swallowed it.  When da skeleton landed, da cookie crumbs just went through its ribcage and landed on da sandy floor.  Da skeleton no seemed to mind or even notice.<br />
<br />
Treehugger looked at da gnome and skeleton and rolled his eyes.  &quot;Oh great,&quot; he said, &quot;A necromancer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da whole group rolled deir eyes and moaned at da news.<br />
<br />
Da gnome bent over da giant's corpse and took some loose change from its pocket.  A split second later, da giant disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br />
<br />
Da gnome stood up and noticed da group. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi guys!&quot; da gnome said.  Seeing da supplies in hand dat da party just purchased, da gnome became curious. &quot;What are you fellows up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuttin'.&quot; Bash said quickly.  &quot;Yous can go back to giant killing now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing what was going on, da gnome excitedly said, &quot;You're going on an adventure!  Oh boy!  That sounds like it's going to be fun!  Oh boy oh boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da gnome started jumping up and down wit excited glee.  Da skeleton looked at da gnome, shrugged, and started jumping up and down too.<br />
<br />
With fingers in his ears, Lilting shouted, &quot;Can you please stop doing that?!  That rattling from the skeleton is making my ears hurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da gnome stopped jumping and den da skeleton did too.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Philiac, but you can just call me Phil.&quot;  Pointing to da skeleton, da gnome said, &quot;And this here is Jakontiklarkiak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing his name and seeing his master point at him, da skeleton wasn't really listening to what had been said so it just started to do 'da moonwalk' and ended wit a spin.<br />
<br />
Da group half-heartedly clapped.  Jakontiklarkiak bowed for da applause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, we both were wondering if you would like to have a necromancer and a skeleton along for the ride.&quot; da gnome said.<br />
<br />
Da group looked at da gnome, and den each member of da party turned deir heads to da skeleton.  Da skeleton just pointed at da gnome, shook its head and shrugged at da party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm... look, us appreciate da offer but...&quot; Bash began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm really powerful!  Look how I took down that giant!  I can kill anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're sure you can but...&quot; Treehugger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got more money than everyone in Norrath combined!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's nice but...&quot; Lilting started.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got three banks-worth full of ultra-uniquely rare items!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat's great, but, why would yous want to join us if yous have all dat?  Us is not in dis for da money or da items.  Well, me is not.&quot; Bash said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because,&quot; Phil said, &quot;Well.... You see.... Well....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; da party said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm.... I'm lonely.  All I do is sit here waiting for the next giant to arrive so I can kill it dead.  Then I wait some more.  And then I kill some more.  And then I wait some more.&quot; da gnome started to sniff some tears back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody wants to be my friend.  Nobody wants to date me.  All this power, and no one to share or frighten it with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da skeleton nodded at da party and den made a 'L' shape wit his hand and stuck it up to its forehead looking at da gnome.  Phil wasn't paying attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me is sorry,&quot; said Bash, &quot;But yous is just a necromancer.  Us is not wanting... er... needing a necromancer right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;PLEEEEEASE?!&quot; da gnome said desperately throwing himself at da ogre's big feet.  Stench overpowering, da gnome backed up a little bit.  &quot;Oh please oh please oh please let me join!  You have no idea how boring it is having my life!  Please please please let me join!&quot;<br />
<br />
Phil began to sob uncontrollably and his whole face seemed to leak.  Da gnome used part of his robe to blow his nose on.<br />
<br />
One eyebrow raised, Bash looked at da skeleton for an answer.  Da skeleton just shrugged.<br />
<br />
Treehugger had an idea.  &quot;Say, what if we said that we'd let you in the group when Hate freezes over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sniffling, da gnome said &quot;You... *sniff* guys would *sniff*  do that for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure we would!&quot; da ranger said looking to da party for some false support.<br />
<br />
Da whole group nodded with eyebrows raised and big smiles all around.<br />
<br />
&quot;*Sniff*... you guys *sniff* are the greatest!  *Sniff*  Come on Jakontiklarkiak, let' go bag us some more worthless platinum pieces!&quot;<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da gnome smiled and waved to da party and was trotting off in da desert.  Da skeleton, mockingly rubbed his eyes like it was crying and pointed at da running gnome and den laughed.  It looked at da party, shurgged again, waved goodbye, and den ran off after da gnome.<br />
<br />
&quot;Necromancers,&quot; said Medsa, &quot;Not the brightest bunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us almost had one in our group!&quot; da big ogre said.<br />
<br />
Everyone shuddered.<br />
<br />
Da party snickered some at da gnome now too small to see from dis distance, and den headed northward towards da town of Freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a thick cloud of red fog, a demon sat on a throne made of bones from different races.  Da red fog surrounded everyting as far as da eye could see.  Moans and wails of pain and suffering could be heard from unseen captives in dis dense, nasty haze.  Dis was da Plane of Pain.<br />
<br />
Adjusting his huge black wings jutting from his red, scaly body, da demon made himself more comfortable in his chair.  Pure white eyes stared off in da distance in pleasure as he listened to da harmonious sounds of da tortured souls in his &quot;care.&quot;  Blood stained fangs jutted out from both upper and lower jaws and curved into a smile.  Dis was his home.  Dis was his paradise.<br />
<br />
Some people said dat da souls were screaming in pain because of da eternal fire dat is scorching deir bodies.  Some say it is because of da mourning of a life dat dey screwed up.  But most say it's because of da demon's favorite music dat is piped in throughout da Plane -- music made by an elf named Yanni.<br />
<br />
Da Plane of Pain is where dumbheads go when dey die.  If yous did sometime particularly stupid, den you ended up here.  All da people who claimed to have seen da Lake Rathe Monster were here.  All da people who ever typed da words &quot;sow&quot; or &quot;plz&quot; were here.  And all da peoples who shout conversations across vast areas were here.  Dey didn't like it much.<br />
<br />
Nodding his head in-time to a particularly torturous melody, da demon noticed green smoke starting to form at da foot of his throne.  Realizing he was about to have company and not wanting dem to know his secret admiration of dat elf's music, da demon pressed a button on his throne dat made Yanni's music disappear and some heavy sounds pipe through from an ogre group named Savatage.  Interestingly enough, da captured souls sounded a bit more happy.<br />
<br />
Da smoke cleared and da image of a robed figure was standing before da demon.  Da demon couldn't see da figure's face, but he knew who it was.  Da demon had dealt wit dis person in da past.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh, good old, Killdead.&quot; da robed figure said.  &quot;I see you're back to your usual self and enjoying the fruits of your office.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No easy thanks to you.&quot; da demon grumbled in a low, gutteral, hissing voice.  &quot;Speak what you need and then get out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da shade laughed a ****y laugh.  &quot;I'll stay for as long as I choose!  You have very little power over me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da demons eyes turned into mere slits with hatred towards da shadow.  He knew it to be true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I came here to ask of your assistance.&quot; da figure said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've already forced me to grant your one wish, fool!  Remember?!&quot; Killdead da demon was quaking with rage.  &quot;You asked for power beyond that of my own and inso doing got your wish but reduced me to weaker state whilst you gained abilities your kind could only dream!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is quite true.  I'm not sure why you just reminded me of that bit of history because I obviously know it.  But who knows what demon logic is like, eh?<br />
<br />
&quot;No I have come here to ask of one and only one favor.  In return, I shall grant you some of your former power back and also never bug you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even on my birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even when you want to show off your newest Pokemon trading cards?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have got yourself a deal!  I will do anything to be rid of you.  What is that you would have me do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a group of adventurers heading towards the barbarian home lands.  I do not know exactly where they are or just who these people are themselves, but I do know they must be destroyed.  Demons are the best at that sort of thing, so naturally I thought of you.  Kill them all, and you will be free to do as you wish without me in your life to bug you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweeeet!&quot; Killdead excalimed.  &quot;I'll have to do some tracking once I get down to the mortal Plane since you've robbed me of my demonic finding power, but it shouldn't be that difficult.  Now, once they're gone, you promise I'll never see you again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do the eternal damnation soul oath.&quot; da demon said wit a smile.  Dat oath no character could break.  Good or evil.<br />
<br />
Da shade sighed and den placed his right hand on his head.  And den his left hand.  And den placed his right hand on his hip, followed by his left.  And den he stuck his right hand straight out, and den his left.  Den he put both hands on his hips and moved his rear around in a circular motion while ending wit da sacred chant,  &quot;Haaay Mock-a Ray-Na!&quot;<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Killdead smiled his approval.  &quot;I will set off for those pathetic souls tonight.  Now, if you don't mind...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha.  I'm gone.  Do as I ask, or you'll be seeing a lot more of me.  A lot more.  And I just got my Ultra-Platinum Limited Edition Pikachu Trading Card Series that I'm dying show somebody.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da demon shuddered wit revulsion and made a silent vow dat it would complete dis quest or die trying.  Shortly after, da shadow disappeared in a puff of green smoke.<br />
<br />
Switching his music back to Yanni and hearing da screams of anger, hatred, and ultimate pain begin again, da demon settled back comfortably into his chair.  He wanted to relish every last bit of scream and music before he took flight to da mortal plane.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes and lips turning into a contented smile, da demon just contemplated etnernity one last time.  One last thought occured to him before he finally left his throne.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, even that guy's shade has really, really bad breath.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Ha ha!&quot; da knight shouted.  &quot;Your evil taint will foul this magnificent city no more, dragon!  Taste holy steel!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da townspeople of Freeport knew dat cry well.  It was da ravings of da local village idiot, Sir Yessir.  Some said Yessir used to be a great paladin, but too many blows to da head ended him up here.  Some said he never was a paladin because no holy order would let such a fool in deir ranks.  Some just didn't give a rats foot what his past was.<br />
<br />
In da middle of one of da crowded streets of Freeport, a tiny lizard scuttled by.  Hearing da battlecry of Yessir moments before, da villagers in da street were smart enough to split apart and make room for the soon-to-follow bumbling idiot.  Sure enough, da knight came around da corner at a full run.  Losing sight of his prey, he came to a halt.<br />
<br />
Sir Yessir was dressed in a patchwork of rusted armor full of chinks, holes, and dents.  A tarnished sword and a trash can lid served as his weaponry.  An old bucket dat was used for wellwater was atop his head used as a helmet.  Bits of da man's grey hair jutted out from underneath da helmet in a random, chaotic pattern.  Blue eyes wide open searching, his weatherworn face tightened wit concentration.<br />
<br />
A little girl giggled at da funny man.  Yessier noticed da little girl and hobbled over to her, armor squeaking all da way.  He bent down to see da girl face to face.<br />
<br />
&quot;My lady, didst thou see where the fearsome dragon went?&quot; said Yessir to da small girl.<br />
<br />
Da girl giggled and nodded.  She den pointed down da street in da direction da lizard ran.<br />
<br />
&quot;A thousand thank yous, my lovely lady.  Be not afraid, for I am Yessir the Dragon's Bane!&quot;  Yessir kissed da girl's hand while she giggled some more.  He den stood up and bowed, and den ran off in da direction da girl had indicated.<br />
<br />
Da girl's mother scolded da little girl for talking to da knight and da crowd of people went back to deir daily business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ha!  There you are!  You could not hide from me forever, dragon!&quot; Yessir had found da  dragon in da courtyard outside of a tavern.  &quot;You shall not elude me with your tricks again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da lizard just perched itself on a branch oblivious to anyting around it udder dan da bug it was gonna eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prepare to burn in Hate!&quot; da knight shouted.  Yessir smacked his sword against his make-shift shield and charged.<br />
<br />
Da lizard stuck its tongue out and caught a bug.  It began munching happily until da sword came down and split it into two pieces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Triumph!  Triumph for the Holy Order!  One less dragon to spread its evil across this land!&quot;  da paladin said wit his sword raised high into da air.  He den kneeled down and stuck his sword into da ground.  Yessir den gave tanks to his god for imbuing him wit da power to be da greatest dragonslayer dat ever  walked Norrath.<br />
<br />
Finishing his prayer, da knight stood up and looked around.  Noticing da convenient tavern nearby, da knight became thirsty.  &quot;I think my victory deserves a toast!&quot;<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da paladin took off his helmet and walked into da bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash's group made it to da gates of Freeport wit not too many problems.  Well, unless you consider constant whining about having to go to da bathroom by Lilting a problem.  Or da constant pick-up lines Treehugger was dishing out a problem.  Or da fact dat Medsa got fed up and kicked Treehugger wit extreme force in his &quot;lower area&quot; and let him suffer a bit before healing him up a problem.  No, it was a pretty smooth journey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halt!  Who goes there?!&quot; a fully armored person standing in front of da Freeport gate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!  State your business now or be cut down  where you stand!&quot; said da udder fully armored person standing in front of da gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail, friend guards.&quot; Treehugger said.  &quot;We come to the city for supplies and information.  No trouble walks with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You speak the words, ranger, but what of that big fellow behind you?&quot; da guard said pointing to Bash suspiciously.  &quot;He looks like an ogre.  Ogres are to be killed on sight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash's face became an expression of anger.  He wanted to squish dis little human wit his hammer.  Treehugger quickly interjected.<br />
<br />
&quot;An ogre?!&quot; Da ranger laughed.  &quot;What would I be doing with an ogre?!  Besides, you intelligent guards would have seen an ogre coming from miles away, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da guards looked at each udder and nodded deir agreement.  &quot;Yes, that is correct.  Nothing gets by us!&quot; said da first guard.  &quot;Quite right!  We are trained from childhood to detect such things!&quot; said da udder guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.  Now, if you would let us pass, we'd like to enter.  We're on urgent business.&quot; da ranger said wit a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good.  In you go.  Hurry along now.&quot; da guard said.  Da group not wanting to waste any more time began to march through the gate when all of a sudden one of da guards spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute!  Something's not quite right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I sense it too.&quot; said da udder guard.<br />
<br />
Bash looked uncomfortably at Treehugger, and da ranger just looked back with uneasiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;There!!  There!!  I see it!!&quot; said da first guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; da udder guard said.  &quot;SNAKE!  SNAKE!  To arms! brothers, to arms!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da two guards rushed passed da party and ran out into da field where a tiny, harmless moss snake was slithering past.  Da guards drew deir swords and began circling da snake cautiously.  <br />
<br />
Cries from udder guards inside da city could be heard.  &quot;Snake!  Snake!&quot;  Five more guards  rushed out of da gate to join da first two.  Three more guards came to block da entrance to da city.<br />
<br />
Da seven guards surrounded da snake in a circle so da party couldn't see what was going on.  But swords were flying all over da place, clanging against each udder every few seconds.  Screams of panic and fear were constantly heard from da little group of guards.<br />
<br />
Da moss snake slithered through one of da guard's feet and den hurriedly sped away from da city.  Not noticing at all, da guards continued to hack away.<br />
<br />
One of dem finally said, &quot;It's gone!  We killed it!&quot;  A loud cheer erupted from da guards in da group, da guards at da gate, and several guards up on two battlements who spectated from above.  Patting each udder on da back, da guards marched back to deir posts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that&quot; a guard said to da group.  &quot;You may enter now.&quot;  Da guards made way for da party and Bash's group walked into da city.<br />
<br />
Lilting quietly said to Medsa, &quot;Wow.  Such fuss over something completely harmless.  Makes you wonder what they'd do if they saw a bat or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
A guard caught part of da conversation.  &quot;BAT?!!&quot;  Anudder guard heard da guard.  &quot;BAT!  BAT!&quot;  Soon, all da guards were yelling da warning across da whole entrance.<br />
<br />
Twelve guards stormed out of da gate weapons drawn.  Dey began searching for da dangerous threat to da city.<br />
<br />
Bash's group just sighed and continued on into Freeport.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; said Bash turning to da party.  &quot;Us needs to find two tings.  We need to get information on how to get to Halas, and if possible, we need to find more peoples to help us fight Smellybreath.  Let's split up and meet back here in an hour, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; said Treehugger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah,&quot; said Medsa, but willing to do it anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okie dokie!&quot; said an excited Lilting.  And wit dat, da party split up.  <br />
<br />
Lilting raced around dis great big city.  He was not used to everyting being bigger dan him.  He ran around and around, poking his head into several different shops and giggling.  He eventually got tired and found his way into a bar.<br />
<br />
Lilting pulled up a barstool.  Da bartender moved over and said, &quot;What can I get for ya, pint-size?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm.  I'm looking for a courageous fighter to help us kill an evil foe!  I'm also looking for the way to Halas.  Do you know where I can get these things?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing what da halfling sitting next to him had just said, a grey-haired man turned to Lilting.  &quot;My boy, I can help you.  I am the greatest dragonslayer that ever lived!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting just stared in awe of da man.  He knew he had found someone who could surely help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash stood on da street corner tapping his big foot impatiently.  He told his group to meet back here in one hour.  Dat hour had been up over half an hour ago.  <br />
<br />
Bash was getting more angry by da minute, and had just about almost resolved to go continue da journey on his own when he saw two silhouettes approaching from down one of da streets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; said one of da peoples.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you shut up!&quot; said da udder.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash saw dat da two peoples coming were Medsa and and a sludge-covered Treehugger.  Dey both not looked berry happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, why is yous fighting?&quot; asked Bash.<br />
<br />
With a frustrated scream, Medsa just said &quot;Why don't you ask hormone boy here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?!  I didn't jump into that food trough  voluntarily!  Some pyscho witch who doesn't know a good man when she sees one pushed me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you hadn't followed me everywhere I went and actually split up like Bash  said, maybe you would  be high and dry right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash, trying to follow da converation, said, &quot;Me take it yous not find someone to help us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa and Treehugger both instantly turned to da ogre and simultaneously yelled, &quot;NO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.  Ok den.  Me neither.  Peoples here no like ogres much, so me couldn't get much more dan a scream from most.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And another thing,&quot; began Medsa to da ranger, &quot;This whole, 'I'm gonna die tomorrow for sure, so how about some lovin' routine is getting really old!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's true!  Pretty soon my luck is going to run out and I'll be killed! I suck at fighting!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You suck at a lot of things!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash just rolled his eyes and threw his big ogre hands up in da air and turned around and let da two crazy peoples go at it.  Dat's when he saw da halfling.<br />
<br />
Lilting trotting along wit a big smile on his face came bounding towards da ogre.  Behind him, an old man hurriedly walked behind da halfling with armor creaking and  squeaking noisily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi guys!&quot; said da halfling even more excited dan normal.  &quot;Guess what I found!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A whino?&quot; Treehugger guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!  A great knight who's willing to join our cause against evil!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da old man attempted to make an elaborate bow, but his armor and old legs somewhat prevented dat.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's the greatest dragonslayer that ever lived!  He's killed more than forty dragons in his day!&quot;  Lilting barely could contain his excitement at his find.  Bash would surely be proud, he was certain!  Turning to da old man, da halfling said &quot;Go ahead!  Tell them about the Dragon of Qeynos and how you tricked it into drowning!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course!&quot; da old man said.  &quot;There I was, polishing my armor, when I hear this tremendous roar...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash couldn't quite put his big ogre finger on it, but dis man seemed a little odd to him.  Medsa and Treehugger just ****ed one eyebrow at each other not knowing what to tink of da knight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Save yous story, old man.&quot; Bash said.  &quot;Us is sure you're a good hero, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot; asked Lilting a little sad about what he might hear next.<br />
<br />
&quot;...but, us not sure about yous skills.  Us really is needing a guide to Halas right now more dan a 'dragonslayer'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My boy,&quot; said da knight, &quot;Not only do I know the way to that frigid region, but I personally have slain 12 ice dragons there!  I can show you the way, with most certainty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash considered his words.  Dey needed to get to Halas as quick as possible, and dis crazy old man seemed to know da way.  Da ogre shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den.  Yous can come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank ye, my good fellow.  Ye'll not regret it!  I, am Sir Yessir!  Evil trembles before me!&quot;<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da party headed westward out of Freeport wit Yessir telling of his good deeds, Lilting listening intently, Bash tromping ahead focusing on his goal, and Medsa and Treehugger bickering some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In da huge forest of Faydark, nestled snugly deep within, was da tree city of Kelethin.  Dis was da home of da tiny, wussier elves of da lands lovingly referred to as wood elves.  Long ago, it was decreed dat calling dese elves &quot;Tiny Wussy Elves&quot; didn't go over well wit da Kelethin residents, so da races just created da term &quot;wood elves&quot; as an accepted standard.<br />
<br />
Dese wood elves were a clumsy sort.  Dey was always falling flat on deir faces.  Some said dat da race was magically born wit da subconscious desire to kiss dirt, udders just  believed dey had no coordination.  In any case, da ancient wood elves long ago decided to erect a city dat was as far from da ground as possible.  Da theory was, &quot;If us is not near da ground, den us can't smack it wit our faces!&quot;  Like most theories, when it was applied to da real world it didn't work berry well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail, NoodleArm!&quot; said a wood elf as he walked into one of da Kelethin shops.  Da wood elf took a few more steps and den fell flat on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail, Jammypants!&quot; said da dark brown haired elf.  &quot;Need some more supplies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting off da floor and rubbing his nose, Jammypants just got up and smiled.  Dis was a regular occurrance for a wood elf. <br />
<br />
Turning to look out his shop window at da beautiful day, NoodleArm noticed a couple wood elves walking along one of da ramps high in da trees.  Like clockwork, dey both began to stumble and den fall right off completely.  A short scream was heard by dem and den dey fell out of da shopkeepers sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you got for sale today?&quot; asked Jammypants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same stuff as yesterday,&quot; said NoodleArm.  Three more screams erupted from wood elves outside as dey lost deir footing and tumbled seventy feet to da ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heard anything about the trouble brewing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just making small talk.  There's no trouble.  Especially not here in this wonderful city.&quot;  Jammypants fell on his face again and two more wood elves outside could be heard falling to deir doom.<br />
<br />
Just den, da shopkeeper heard a different sound amidst da sound of wood elves hitting dirt.  It sounded like da flapping of two huge, slow bird wings.  Jammypants and NoodleArm looked around da shop in confusion.<br />
<br />
Whoosh.   Whoosh.   Whoosh.<br />
<br />
Jammypants stood up and shrugged at da shopkeeper.  Da beating of da huge wing-like tings stopped and da whole city shook like someting monstrous had jumped up and down on one of da platforms.  <br />
<br />
A nasty, loud, deep, bloodcurdling roar was den heard.  Jammypants and NoodleArm became berry afraid.  Dey didn't know what was going on.  Screams of terror erupted from many wood elves outside.  Da two elves in da shop heard many elves running around in a panic, and even more falling off da city and to da ground.  Some even on purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back here and face me!&quot; a deep, booming, gutteral voice yelled.  &quot;You will answer my question or be destroyed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jammypants quivered in fear and so did da shopkeeper.  More screams from da elves outside did nothing to calm deir nerves.  All of a sudden, dey could hear da ting outside move closer to da shop.<br />
<br />
Da whole shop shook more violently wit each booming step.  Da footsteps came to a halt where it seemed to be just outside da door to da shop.<br />
<br />
Dere was complete silence and da two elves just stared at da door.  Too scared to move.  Too scared to fall down.  Too scared to wee wee.<br />
<br />
A gigantic, black-clawed, red hand smashed through da door and swung upward to rip off da ceiling of da shop.  A fifteen foot tall demon stood snarling over da elves.<br />
<br />
Jammypants let out a shriek and started to run, but da demon snatched him up and bit him in half wit his massive jaws.  NoodleArm just  stared in utter horror.  Den da demon moved over to him.<br />
<br />
Da demon picked up da shopkeeper and brought da elves face just inches from its own.  NoodleArm could barely breathe da fetid breath coming from da demon's mouth.  Blank white eyes stared back at him wit pure hatred.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you know of a heroic party heading towards Halas, elf boy!?&quot; da demon asked in an otherworldly voice.  NoodleArm just shivered wit fear.  &quot;Answer me!!&quot;<br />
<br />
NoodleArm just froze up in shock.  Da demon, realizing he was not going to get any information from dese clumsy, wussy elves decided to try to acquire it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that idiot Crush will know something,&quot; da demon mumbled.<br />
<br />
Da demon took to da sky once again and headed north.  Da last thing heard was da scream of NoodleArm as he was flung into da mist below Kelethin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over da treetops Killdead da demon flew.  Looking downward only to spit da occasional demonic loogie on a poor unsuspecting adventurer's head, he kept his flying steadily northbound.<br />
<br />
On occasion, Killdead would hear da shouts of  some mortals auctioning off deir petty wares.  Da demon smiled evilly for he knew da secret, evil pact dat da gods made when dividing up da land.  Dis pact said dat anyone who shouts lame tings or auctions anyting in Faydark will spend da rest of deir lives in da Plane of Pain.  Dis pact also apply to a place called East Commonlands, but da demon wasn't entirely sure where dat was.<br />
<br />
He finally saw da pass dat lead to Emperor Crush's city.  Flying over it he saw many orc  tents and buildings.  Hundreds of orcs were fighting hundreds of different 'heroes' dat comprised of elves, dwarves, humans and gnomes.  It was just one big chaotic mess.  It made Killdead smile and brought a tear to his eye.  But da demon had more important tings to tink about.  He headed straight for da castle in da middle of da orc town.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, your majesty,&quot; grumbled a dark elf in a red sportcoat.  He standing along side a particularly stupid looking, cross-eyed orc in a castle tower.  &quot;I am here but to serve you,&quot; da dark elf said wit obvious sarcasm and disgust.  <br />
<br />
Da orc, being da stupidest of his race, didn't catch any of da elves hidden messages and just took da words at face value.  &quot;That right!&quot; da orc said.  &quot;Me are Crush!  Me are Emper... Eperom... Eeprom... Me are king!  You is just elf!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you are so correct, oh great one,&quot; da elf said rolling his eyes.  &quot;You're the one who's really in charge here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den, a small group of dwarves came running up da castle steps into da tower room.  Dey readied deir weapons and growled at da orc king, ready to attack.  Da orc king just looked stupidly onward.  Da dwarves den began to advance until dey caught sight of da da dark elf dat was standing next to da big orc.  <br />
<br />
Da dark elf turned towards da dwarves and made his eyelids become slits.  Da dwarves' eyes opened so wide dey almost popped out of deir heads.  Dey dropped deir weapons and ran screaming in fear from da tower.<br />
<br />
Da dark elf turned back towards da orc.  &quot;As I was saying, your highness, I think that we need to take your orc forces and GURAMMFF!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  What Gurammff?  It nasty high level?  What?  What is it?&quot;  Da orc not notice da elf was gone.  &quot;What?  Gurammff?  It is a gnome, isn't it?  Crush hate gnomes!  Oooh, Crush hate da little GURAKKK!!&quot;<br />
<br />
A big red hand had reached in from da outside window and yanked da dark elf from da  tower.  Anudder hand reached in and yanked da orc.<br />
<br />
Da demon flew a little bit aways from da castle wit da two beings's heads palmed in each hand.  He set dem down not-so-gently on da ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crush want to know why you take Crush from castle!&quot; da orc yelled at da demon, seemingly not afraid.  &quot;Crush crush da crushness out of Crush's crushed crushy crush man!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da dark elf, being slightly more quick-witted dan da orc, saw da demon and recognized who he was.  &quot;Forgive his highness, he is not accustomed to one such as great as you visiting his land.&quot; da elf said wit a berry low bow.<br />
<br />
Da orc just screamed obscenities at da demon and danced around in a fit threatening Killdead, occasionally even giving him da orc &quot;finger.&quot;  Killdead, also being quick witted realized who really was in charge here.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am looking for a group heading towards the ice country where Halas resides.&quot; da demon said towards da elf in his booming, growl of a voice.  &quot;There is a good chance it is being led by an ogre.  Do you know of such a group?  Tell me now or I will kill you where you stand!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da dark elf searched his memory of recent news.  He remembered someting a dark elf scout had told him.  &quot;I have heard of such a group.  They were in Freeport a little less than five days ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da orc looked confused at dis news, but den nodded an agry nod at da demon like he knew of dis information all along.<br />
<br />
Da elf continued, &quot;It is rumored they acquired a knight who is leading them to the ice country you spoke of.  Our dark elf underground web...er... Emperor Crush's vast orc empire stretches far across these lands and there is little I... er... He doesn't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da orc just stared his cross-eyed face at da demon wit pride and dignity.  Da demon wanted to just bite him in half, but he knew dere was probably a reason his dark elf friends kept him alive to be used as a puppet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said da demon, &quot;You have served me well, elf.  You shall be rewarded after your soul departs this plane.&quot;  Da demon gave anudder look of disgust to da orc king and den flew straight up fifty feet and den zoomed westward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crush no like stupid red bird!  Crush want it crushed in crush-like manner!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da dark elf sighed.  &quot;But my lord, the bird is already dead.  You killed it, don't you remember?  You slew it thirty seconds ago!&quot;<br />
<br />
Crush not wanting to admit he didn't remember such a ting, just puffed out his chest wit power and conceit and said, &quot;Of course Crush did!  All peoples fear and tremble before Crush!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they do.  Of course they do.&quot;  Da dark elf got an even worse look of disgust on  his face.  Some wandering adventurers came nearby and da elf spun towards dem.  &quot;Boo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da adventurers screamed and bolted da udder way.  &quot;D'Vinn!&quot; dey shouted!<br />
<br />
Soon, udder people shouting &quot;D'Vinn!&quot; and &quot;D'Vinn's out!&quot; and den mass hysteria ensued.  Elves and humans were tripping over each udder to get to da pass dat lead out of Crushbone.  Dwarves and gnomes were getting smooshed under da weight of all da panicking peoples.<br />
<br />
Da dark elf smiled evilly and quietly said wit dripping sarcasm, &quot;Yes, Crush, people do indeed tremble before you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they do!&quot; said da orc who obviously heard.<br />
<br />
And wit dat, da dark elf and orc walked back towards D'Vinn's... er... Crush's castle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Traveling for two days straight, our heroic party had trudged through da commonlands.  Yessir was now in da lead as everyone else was too exhausted to even move.  But, wit da warnings of da paladin saying dey no could stop until dey reached East Karana, da party received no rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Here we are,&quot; said da knight.  Da party reached da entrance to da haunted Kithicor Forest.<br />
<br />
Lilting gave a frown.  He knew of dis forest, but he no had explored it much.  He heard too many ghost stories to even tink about going in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't this place haunted?&quot; da halfling asked as he saw da moon beginning to rise as da night slowly began around dem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is!&quot; sad Sir Yessir.  Everyone in da party got a look of terror on deir faces.  &quot;But fear not!  For 'tis only haunted by day!  Never at night!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.  Everyone except Medsa, who had to keep shoving Treehugger away.  &quot;Get away from me!  I don't need any of your comfort to get rid of my fear!&quot; said da cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I do!&quot; da ranger said with shivers.<br />
<br />
Da cleric just sneered at Treehugger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, lads!&quot; said Yessir.  &quot;Let's hurry up and get through this place as quickly as possible before the morning dawns!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group trotted along following da crazy paladin.  Dey ran into da forest and it looked pretty spooky.  Each tree seemed like it was dying and dey felt like dey was being watched from every angle.<br />
<br />
Dey continued running along da path through da forest.  Spooky hoots and howls could be heard all around dem.  Lilting wanted to run away.  Bash wanted to smash da dumb owl hooting.  Treehugger wanted to be held because he was so afraid.  Medsa wanted da ranger to leave her alone.<br />
<br />
Dey was making good time for about half an hour when all of a sudden dey was ambushed by a group of skeletal mages and zombies.  Da undead tings jumped out of da trees and bushes and surrounded da party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye know, come to think of it, I think I may have been mistaken&quot; da paladin began saying outloud but tinking to himself.  &quot;I think maybe the forest is haunted at night and not by day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger's swords instantly appeared in his hands.  Bash readied his hammer.  Medsa placed her hands on her hips and glared at da  undead tings.  Lilting drew out his tiny, tiny, almost microscopic dagger.  Yessir still contemplated if he truly was wrong about da forest being haunted in da daytime.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll not take us without a fight!&quot; da ranger said wit a snarl.  &quot;I'm sure I'm no match for you, but my friends will take you down after I die!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den, da biggest, meanest skeleton made its way through da circle of undead.  It carried a huge doubled bladed axe in one of its massive hands.  It looked at da little ranger dan den laughed.  It was at dat moment, Bash found he was frozen in place and  couldn't move.  Da udders noticed da same ting about demselves.<br />
<br />
Da zombies in da undead group all had hungry glints in deir eyes.  Da skeletons raised deir weapons.  Dey all started moving in closer.  Da big skeleton raised his gigantic axe, and den swung it downwards towards Bash's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  Wait!  Stop!&quot; yelled a voice from somewhere behind Bash.  He no could see who it was, but da voice sounded familiar somehow.  &quot;Stop!  Hold on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da big skeleton's axe stopped just inches away from Bash's forehead.  All da udder undead stopped deir advance as well.  Out of da corner of his eye, Bash saw da big skeleton look at da unseen figure and den walked in its direction.  He heard da person talking to da skeleton, but he could barely make it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said da voice.  &quot;I'm aware of the deal.  But these guys are not a part of it.  They're my friends!  And you know what happens if you hurt my frends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash knew he had heard dat voice before, but he could not figure out where.  Dis was worse  torture dan waiting for da skeletons and zombies to eat him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.  Now, release my friends before I get mad!&quot;<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Bash found he could move once again.  He spun around to see who da voice belong to.  Dere, standing in front of da huge skeleton, was a tiny gnome wit a brown robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phil!&quot; shouted Bash wit relief.  &quot;Me glad to see yous!&quot;<br />
<br />
Phil looked at da big ogre and smiled.  Den he turned his attention back towards da big skeleton.  &quot;So what do you have to say for yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da skeleton moved it's jaw like it was talking, but no words came out.  Only da sound of bone scraping against bone could be heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right then,&quot; said Phil.  &quot;But don't apologize to me.  Apologize to my friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da skeleton opened and closed its mouth and shrugged its shoulders like it was sighing.  Den, it turned towards da group and moved its jaw again like it was saying someting.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's better!  Now don't you feel better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da skeleton looked down and den moved its mouth slightly like it was muttering someting under its breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, now make sure my friends get out of this forest safely, ok?  I would be upset to find out they didn't have your protection.  Most upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da big skeleton nodded.<br />
<br />
Done wit talking to da skeleton, Phil excitedly ran up to da party.  &quot;Hi guys!  You still on your adventure?  Is it fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya Phil!&quot; said Lilting.  &quot;We're glad to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger and Medsa said sarcastically at da same time, &quot;Yeah.  Real glad.&quot;  Realizing dat she was tinking along da same lines as himself, Treehugger winked at da cleric.  Medsa just rolled her eyes in disgust.<br />
<br />
Just den, anudder skeleton came running up da trail through da woods.  It was Jakontiklarkiak, da same skeleton dey saw wit  Phil in Oasis.  Jakontiklarkiak waved to Bash and den saw da udder skeletons dat were gonna eat da group.  It jumped up wit joy and ran over to dem.<br />
<br />
Jakontik jerked his head up quickly as if to say, &quot;Wassup?&quot; to da group of skeletons and zombies.  One of da skeletons held out its hand and Jakoktik slapped it wit his own.  He patted a zombie on da back and den began moving his jaw like da big skeleton did before.  Da udder skeletons did da same.  Da zombies just made moans and growl sounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; said Phil, &quot;You've got clearance to pass through the forest now.  Skeleton kings can be so fickle when it comes to tresspassers.  Not to worry though.  He'll make sure you get through safe.  If he doesn't, he'll be sorry and he knows it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Bash, &quot;Yous is pretty powerful to command da king.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, duh.  I'm a necromancer.  I have more power than a god!  I'm just waiting for Hate to freeze over so I can join you guys!  You're so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to be around da annoying necro much longer, Bash decided it was time to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok peoples, let's go.  Tanks for helping us Phil.  Us will give yous a shout when it ok for yous to join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okie dokie!  I'll be waiting!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da party den said deir goodbyes and began marching westward once more.  Yessir, not having said a word, had his brow furrowed in concentration da whole time.  He finally spoke up as he lead da way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye know, I've been thinking about it.  I'm pretty sure the woods is haunted in the daytime.  I don't think I was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash sighed and den looked at Lilting.  Da halfling seemed to be looking northward and was crying a little bit.  Da ogre decided not to bug da halfling.<br />
<br />
Dey reached da trail dat led out of da woods and evntually found deir way to East Karana.  Dey decided dis was a good place to rest.  It was a good idea, until Bash's clothes suddenly and magically burst into flame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash smelled smoke and looked down to see his pants and shirt engulfed in flames.  Confused for only a second, panic took over as da heat found its way to his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAHHHH!!! PUT IT OUT!  PUT IT OUT!&quot; da ogre screamed as he ran around in circles.<br />
<br />
Da group, not exactly sure what was happening, each had deir own ideas of which was da best ting for Bash to do in dis situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep running and the fire will get tired!&quot; said Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flap your arms faster to fan out the flames!&quot; said Treehugger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand still and act like something that doesn't look like it would burn!&quot; said Yessir.<br />
<br />
Medsa just calmly said, &quot;How about Bashing that woman over there with the flaming hands laughing at you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole party turned to see who Medsa was talking about.  Everyone, except Bash of course.  He was still running around in a panic.  The woman dat da cleric had pointed out was a dark skinned, dark haired erudite wit a red robe.  Her eyes were orange, like dey demselves were ablaze.  She was cackling wildly at da sight of da flaming ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go take her out!&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;You guys can use my corpse as a shield if she starts getting rough!&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa thought dat was a good idea.  Da group, minus Bash, walked over to da much-too-happy erudite.  Her cackling abruptly stopped and her eyes snapped to da peoples now standing in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go away!&quot; she said wit a hiss.  &quot;This doesn't concern you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You set our friend on fire!&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;Of course it concerns us!&quot;<br />
<br />
A big ball of flame da size of an ogre ran by da party screaming loudly.  Nobody seemed to notice as all focus was on da erudite woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that magical fire is tied to ye, m'lady, then I am guessin' it will be extinguished with your life!&quot; da paladin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, no.  It's normal fire.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got more things to burn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da erudite's hands started to glow red and flames danced about dem.  She shot out fire balls into trees and bushes and anyting else nearby.  She cackled some more as she watched da flames rise up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you witch...!&quot; started Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizard.  I'm a wizard, well, wizardess.  I'm not a witch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you wizardess!&quot; Lilting corrected himself, &quot;You help our friend right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I?  You know, I haven't seen a roasted halfling in a while...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting immediately shut up.<br />
<br />
Medsa realized dey was getting nowhere.  Noticing dat dis lady had some decent fire summoning power, and her seemingly overjoyment of setting tings ablaze, she got an idea.  &quot;Look, we're on a quest.  A quest that our large friend has undertaken.  We'd like it if you came along.  There will be many, many, many things that are combustable along the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of things that will burn?&quot; da woman asked as her eyes lit up.  &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh..... yes.&quot; said da cleric.  &quot;Lots of things to burn.  Will you help us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da big ball of flame ran screaming by again.  Like before, no one noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say there's things to burn, then count me in!&quot; da wizardess said happily.  &quot;My name is Pyra.  Pyra Maniaca.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Medsa,&quot; said Medsa (obviously), &quot;And this is Lilting, Yessir, and this cute...er... ugly guy is Treehugger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your large friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone's mouth dropped as dey remembered deir big, burning friend.  Dey looked around for Bash.  Dey saw him running around in circles, stopping, and den spinning place.  Screaming still, but more out of panic and fear dan pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's Bash!&quot; said Lilting.  &quot;He's the nicest ogre in the world!  Can you please put out the fire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; said da halfling.  He turned to da cleric.  &quot;You said she could help him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da cleric shrugged.  &quot;I thought she might, since she set him on fire in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't put the fires out,&quot; said Pyra, &quot;But that river can.  Maybe you guys should have told him to jump in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group looked over to where da wizard was pointing.  Dey all smacked deir foreheads.  Dey all hurriedly ran towards da bright, burning ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash!&quot; said Lilting.  &quot;Hurry!  Follow me to that river!  If you jump in, it'll put out the fire!&quot;  Da halfling took off towards da river.<br />
<br />
Bash, still in a fearful panic, got up and ran after da halfling.  He saw dat Lilting stopped near da edge of da water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here!  Here!  Jump in!  Quick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Witout hesitation, da big ogre jumped into da river.  He landed wit a humongous splash.  Steam hissed and rose from da water as da flames were extinguished.  Bash's eyes rolled back and he let out a berry, berry contented sigh.<br />
<br />
Da udders reached da edge of da water and saw da ogre bathing in extreme pleasure.  Bash, noticing he was being watched. quickly stood up.  Unfortunately, da ogre's clothes were burned to a black crisp and dey just broke apart into flakes and fell of his ogrish body.<br />
<br />
A good laugh was had by all, except for a very beet red Bash.<br />
<br />
Da naked ogre climbed out of da water.  Lilting noticed dat da ogre did not have a burn on him.  He thought it odd.  But not as odd as da hammer dat Bash had in his hand now looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash!  Look at your hammer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked down at his hammer and saw dat it was pulsating berry, berry rapidly.  It was turning from white to orange with extreme speed.  Bash had no idea what was wrong wit it.  Figuring he could smack some sense back into his grandpa's mallet, he swung it towards a nearby boulder on da ground.<br />
<br />
Da hammer hit wit such force dat it created da sound of lightning striking nearby.  Da rock was instantly smashed into a thousand, burnt pieces.  A ring of fire exploded outward from da point of impact.  Bash was amazed at by what his hammer was doing, and by da fact dat da fire dat passed through him from da hammer did not harm himself in any way.<br />
<br />
Lilting was not so lucky.  Da blast wave hit da little guy wit such power dat it knocked him completely off his feet.  He landed into da river.<br />
<br />
Everyone just stood completely still wit jaws agape and eyes wide open, including Bash.  Da big ogre even forgot he was naked, let alone burn-free from da previous fire.<br />
<br />
Shaking da shock of da hammer-blast free, da party realized what happened to da halfling.  Dey all went rushing up to da river's edge.  <br />
<br />
All dey saw was da tiny outline of a halfling being pulled downstream, and den out of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Lilting!&quot; shouted da big ogre.  &quot;Lilting!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get him!&quot; said Treehugger pushing his way past his friends trying to get to da river's edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; exclaimed Pyra.  &quot;The current is too powerful!  Nobody but our big friend here could withstand the pull, and even he would be too slow to catch up to the halfling!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what can we do?&quot; asked Medsa.  She looked down at da ground and started to feel bad dat she ever made fun of da little guy.<br />
<br />
Nobody knew what to do.  Dey all kept looking down da river where dey last saw Lilting being carried away by da raging water.<br />
<br />
Yessir scratched his stubbly chin for several minutes.  He finally broke the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye know,&quot; da paladin began, &quot;I remember fightin' a river dragon in this here stream.  The current toppled both me and the fearsome beast this way and that, but in the end I was victorious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group turned deir heads listened intently to da crazy old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I beat the dragon, but the river still had it's icy grip of death on me.  I could do nothing but wait for the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luckily, a few miles west of here, the water's flow is disrupted greatly.  The water weaves back and forth, and I was thrown onto the shore of Southern Karana.  Most large pieces of debris eventually end up on the shallow, southern end because of this figure-eight like water pattern.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is yous saying dat Lilting is probably on udder side of da river?&quot; asked Bash.  Da ogre was concerned for his little buddy.  But, concern suddenly shifted to himself when he realized he was still naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a possibility,&quot; said Yessir.  &quot;We can but only search, can't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash went over to a nearby bush and uprooted it.  Sliding da bush on like a pair of underwear, it did well to hide his ogreness.  Mostly well.<br />
<br />
Da wizardess Pyra suddenly pointed to da south-west. &quot;We can't cross the river here, but there is a bridge in Northern Karana that we could use.  It would be just a matter of tracking the halfling down once on the other side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave that to me!&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;I can track a falcon on a cloudy day!  Well... ok... maybe not a falcon... or on a cloudy day.... but I can track some things!  Sometimes, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's get to it then!&quot; said an impatient Medsa.  She started off along da riverbank and headed west.  Da party immediately started marching behind her.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Life was going good for Cam-Pur and his gang of thugs.  They'd wait outside the little rat-hole known as SplitPaw and just 'jump' the poor dogs and rob them of their gold and trinkets.  It required no effort whatsoever.  This was Southern Karana living at its finest.<br />
<br />
It was da greatest time Cam-Pur and his gang ever had.  Da best time, dat is, until a female treant came storming over da hill screaming in a panic and rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;My baby!!  Where's my baby?!?  Someone kidnapped my baby!!&quot; screamed da treant.<br />
<br />
Cam-Pur and three friends, Loot-Hor, Ock-Shun, and Pack-Rat spun around to see da treant coming right at dem.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was you, wasn't it?!&quot; da female treant screamed.  You see, dis female treant in particular was berry near-sighted.  She could no tell who kidnapped her child and dese guys looked like da culprits as anyone else.  She decided dat da best course of action is presume guilty until proven innocent.<br />
<br />
Da female treant ripped through da four peoples like dey was tissue paper.  She slammed her massive trunk-like arms into one person, den she broke da neck of anudder.  Blind mudderly rage filling her body, da small group was dead in less dan ten seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's my baby?!&quot; da treant asked aloud.  &quot;Where's my baby?!!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not seeing her offspring anywhere nearby, she set off wandering in a blind fury and panic in no direction in particular.<br />
<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackness is all Lilting could remember.  All he could see was black.  Someting hurt.  Someting throbbed.  He couldn't pinpoint it in dis nothingness.<br />
<br />
A sound helped stir his brain as to what was going on.  What is it?  Something moving.  Something roaring.  Water!  River!  Yes, there was a river.<br />
<br />
Da next ting dat he noticed was da cold stickyness of someting.  Someting soft and berry sludgy.<br />
<br />
Da halfling finally realized his eyes were shut. He opened dem and in poured a blinding amount of daylight.  Dis caused the throbbing to continue much harder and faster.  He pinpointed da location to da sides of his head.  Once realizing it, da pain appeared.<br />
<br />
Lilting noticed he was face down next to da river in a big pile of mud.  His whole body, from head to toe, was completely covered in da brown muck.<br />
<br />
What happened?  How did I get here?  Da halfling probably could have figured it out if he had a moment longer to tink about it, but a moment longer didn't come.<br />
<br />
What came was a berry large treant.  When it saw Lilting sitting up, it screamed wit delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;My baby!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
It launched itself at Lilting and heaved him right out of da muddy bank.  It den curled its big, barky arms around da halfling and held on for dear life.<br />
<br />
Da treant, wit Lilting in arm, headed south.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Far away, on da very peak of da highest mountain top for as far as da eye could see, stood a pitch black castle.  Da walls of the castle glistened in da light as if dey was covered wit some type of dark slime.  Dis castle would have glistened brighter, but da sun was not out.  It was eternally hidden by deep, grey, overcast sky.  No pure light ever entered dis place it seemed.<br />
<br />
Inside da castle, Smellybreath, da goblin wizard, stood atop an altar made of arcane runes and symbols.  With arms outsrethed to ceiling, da goblin was chanting in some arcane tongue dat anyone within earshot would  not have known.<br />
<br />
Da only spectators da goblin had were four knights.  Dese knights wore armour as black as da castle walls.  Each held swords with blades equally as dark, but wit blood-red hilts.  None of da knights faces could be seen for each wore a full helmet wit sharp horns justting out of da sides.  Dey stood like silent statues as Smellybreath continued his chanting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooom bop zoppa doo wop zoppa doo wah ditty,&quot; da goblin continued.  Da goblin's body began to glow blue and a humming sound could be heard hanging in da air. His chanting continued uninterrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh Eee Oooh Ahh Ahh ting tang walla walla bing bang...&quot;  As da goblin continued speaking getting progressively louder and louder, his body began glowing even a brighter shade of blue.  Da humming also continued to get louder while da color kept getting lighter and lighter.  It became so light and so bright, dat da goblins body was engulfed in a pure white luminescence.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath was screaming his magical incantation to be heard over da loud and throbbing humming sound.  He couldn't see anything anymore.  He finally cried out da final words, &quot;Shayka bom bom, shayka bom bom!!&quot;  <br />
<br />
As da last words exited da goblins mouth, Smellybreath flung his outstretched arms towards da black knights.  All da light dat encompassed his body was shot out into four directions and slammed into each of da black warriors.  Each  knight jolted and and convulsed as da light seared through deir bodies.  None made a sound as da light arced and twisted around each knight.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, the light disappeared and all was dark within the goblin's hidden sanctum once again, save for the light of the torches on the walls.<br />
<br />
Da goblin collapsed on his altar from overexertion.  Rising to his elbows, da goblin managed to speak in rasped breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;There.... it is.... done!  You.... are now infused with the powers of the elements themselves....&quot;<br />
<br />
Da knights, each looking down at deir swords, noticed dat each glowed very brightly.  Each, also, glowed wit a different color; blue, orange, white, and brown.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now the guardians.... of what will be ... the future Lord of the Planes.  You are now imbued with powers that are more ancient than time itself.  I now.... dub each of you.... with the names of your respective magics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fire.  Ice.  Earth.  Air.   Your are now the Elemental Guardians.  And I.... have just brought forth the second stage of.... the prophecy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go now.... guard each corner of the castle.... until I call upon you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each knight silently nodded and turned around and began hurriedly exiting da room.  Da goblin held up a tiny finger da largest of da knights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.... you.... you will be my personal guardian.  You will be the general of the other three.  Such a calling will grant you more power than what you have just received, so.... so states the prophecy.  Do not fail me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da knight banged his guantleted fist against da chest of his black breastplate and turned around and marched to his post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sir Yessir led da way westward along da riverbank at a hurried pace.  Da squeaks from his rusty armor was almost too loud to even hear da river itself.  <br />
<br />
Da udders were right behind da paladin.  Bash noticed dat da sun was going down.  He didn't tink dey would make it to da udder side of da river before it got dark.  He also no liked da fact dat it was gonna be cold and he  was pretty much naked.<br />
<br />
Pyra was busy shooting small blasts of fire at everyting along da river bank.  Most of da  fires she created never lasted too long.  She eventually became curious about da group she was wit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who is the old man?&quot; asked da wizardess to a nearby Medsa.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Some guy named Yessir,&quot; said da cleric who was walking briskly next to Pyra.  &quot;I guess he's a paladin, though I don't know what paladin would be caught dead with a bucket for a helmet.  He claims to be a great dragonslayer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the ogre?&quot; asked Pyra.  &quot;What's his story?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of us are really sure.  He says he needs to get to Halas to find some type of seer or oracle.  I guess there is some big danger to the lands that he either won't speak of, or isn't sure of himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the halfling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just your standard, run-of-the-mill, halfling druid.  You know...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Annoying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bingo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what of the ranger?  He seems kinda cute.  Are you two...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; said da cleric a little too quickly.  &quot;No way!  I'd never date Treehugger in a million gazillion years!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing his name, Treehugger turned around and smiled at da cleric.  He winked at Medsa, but da cleric just scowled back at him.  Da ranger quickly raised and lowered his eyebrows twice at her, and den turned back to continue keeping pace wit Yessir.<br />
<br />
Da night set in, and when da sun was completely gone da party saw da bridge.   It was a huge ting dat spanned da big river dat seperated da northern part from da southern Karana plains.  Part of da bridge was a guard outpost.<br />
<br />
Dey reached da outpost and went inside.  Two guards stood directly in front of da archway to da bridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halt!&quot; said one of da guards.  &quot;None shall pass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse us sir,&quot; said Treehugger, &quot;But we need to get across this river.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da two guards said in unison, &quot;None shall pass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked Medsa.  &quot;Is it because we have an ogre in our group?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash gripped his hammer tightly.<br />
<br />
Da two guards looked at each udder.  Den da first one said, &quot;No.  None shall pass because  the bridge is under repair.  The construction crew has gone home for the night.  If you want to cross, you'll have to wait 'till morning when they can guide you across.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said da udder guard.  &quot;If you want to wait, there's a room upstairs you can stay in 'till morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; da first guard said.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked a little confused.  But in da end, dey all went upstairs to sleep until morning.  If dey no could get across da river, dere was not much dey could do.<br />
<br />
Bash got no sleep dat night.  He kept tinking about Lilting, his hammer, and his clothes.  Why had Papa Smurpheater not told him about dis hammer?  Why did it act so funny?  Bash blamed himself for losing da halfling.  Da ogre silently vowed dat he find Lilting and den find Smellybreath and bash da goblin once and for all.  He was tired of da tings dat was happening to him, and it was all dat wizard's fault.<br />
<br />
He would smash him good if it was da last ting he did, dis he swore.  As soon as Bash thought dat, he thought he almost felt his hammer grow warm for an instant and den cool of a split second later.  He figured he imagined it.<br />
<br />
Outside, da moon shown brightly.  Nothing could be heard but da crickets, owls, and occasional wanderer accidentally being squished by a distant hill giant's foot.  All was pretty much quiet, until da sound of giant wings flapping appeared.<br />
<br />
If one were watching, dey would see a giant shadow on da ground from someting high in da air flying past da bridge.  And if one were watching closely, dey would see it was humanoid wit wings and headed west.  And if one were watching really closely, dey would see dat da 'head' of da shadow was moving back and forth as if it was searching for someting.<br />
<br />
Nobody was watching dough, and da shadow disappeared westward as quickly as it came.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At da brink of dawn, da party went to go cross da Karana bridge.  Da construction crew had a fun time using cranes and lifts to get each person over, especially da big ogre.  But, it was accomplished in da end.<br />
<br />
&quot;So dis is da 'Dreaded Southern Karana', huh?&quot; asked Bash to no one in particular.  &quot;It not look so bad to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true.  Da sun was shining in da eastern horizon, birds were singing.  It was berry nice.  At least, until dey took deir first steps off da bridge and onto da grass itself.  Da second da ogre's foot touched soil, da sky darkened and down came da rain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me take it back,&quot; muttered da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's hurry and search the river's edge for signs of Lilting before they get washed away from the rain!&quot; Treehugger said.  &quot;If they disappear, we've got no chance of finding him.  Us rangers are the masters of tracking, but we suck at it.  How's that for irony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could ask a druid to track him down if we  can't find him,&quot; said Pyra.<br />
<br />
Da party agreed dat dey would rather live with a lost friend dan deal wit anudder druid.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was off in an instant racing eastward along da side of da riverbank.  Da group followed soon after.  Not too far down da ranger came to a dead halt.<br />
<br />
Catching up to him, da group saw da ranger paused still in his tracks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; whispered Medsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh,&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;I hear something.  It's like the sound of a thousand miniature horses walking the field.&quot; The ranger frowned.  &quot;Erm, don't ask how I know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ranger signaled da group to follow him and he went south a little ways.  Beyond some trees dey saw what caused all da noise.<br />
<br />
Walking in a southern direction was a wood elf wit his held head high.  Behind him, several thousand peoples silently followed him.  Humans, elves, half-elves, all different sizes, but each wearing green.  Most were sniffling or shedding some tears.  All, but da leading wood elf.<br />
<br />
Treehugger bowed his head in respect.  He seemed to know who da elf was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is dat?&quot; asked Bash?<br />
<br />
&quot;The Glademaster,&quot; Treehugger solemnly replied.  &quot;The greatest ranger that ever walked Norrath, it is said.  His time in this world is up and he goes to give his life essence back to the forest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked at da elf.  He no could see what da fuss was about, but kept quiet out of respect.  Dis elf didn't seem as wussy as udder wood elves, he was sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glademaster, eh?&quot; said Yessir wit raised eyebrow.  &quot;Sounds like some sort of gardening tool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Glademaster, it is rumored, has slain over a thousand banshees.  It is said he is immune to their wailing cries.  He has done much for our forests and our heritage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da elf and da thousands of peoples following him marched off into da distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, let's continue our search for the halfling,&quot; Treehugger said wiping a tear away.<br />
<br />
Da group was once again following Treehugger along da riverside.  Bash couldn't see how da ranger was paying attention to details at such a pace, but he was somewhat sure da ranger knew what he was doing.<br />
<br />
After a time, da ranger stopped and squatted down to get a better look at someting on da riverbank.<br />
<br />
Da group caught up wit da ranger and looked to see what he was examining.<br />
<br />
Dere, in da sticky mud, was da impprint of a halfling sprawled out face first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Treehugger immediately recognized da annoying facial imprint in da mud.  He stood up immediately and stuck his arm straight out in front of him wit palm facing to da side.  He den began to spin slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you...&quot; a confused Medsa began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blip...&quot; said da ranger. &quot;Blip... Blip... Blip....&quot; da ranger repeated as he slowly spun in da clockwise direction.  Den, he began saying da word faster as his arm stretched in a southern direction. &quot;Blip Blip Blip Blip...&quot; He finally stopped and was facing a bit southwest. &quot;Bliiiiiiiiiiiip!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ranger got a smile on his face and den was racing off in da direction at a break-neck pace.<br />
<br />
Da group sighed in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me wish he would start letting us know when he gonna take off like dat!&quot; exclaimed an irritated Bash.  Da udders agreed and dey all ran off after da ranger.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Dey eventually came upon a copse of trees and saw what dey was looking for.  Dere was Lilting, covered in dried mud, struggling wit all his might to break free of da grip of a large treant.  Da big treant not even seem to notice dat Lilting was trying to get free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go, barkface!&quot; said Lilting.  Da treant not even seem to hear.  She continued to cradle da halfling and rock back and forth while singing her lullabye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rock a bye baby in the treetops...&quot;<br />
<br />
Da party looked on wit disgust and horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've got to save the lad!&quot; said Yessir in a loud whisper.  &quot;I'll go in and slay that thing that reminds of a dragon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; whispered Bash.  &quot;Us not want to fight a treant.  Especially a protective mother-type.  Us need to figure out what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She thinks Lilting is her baby?&quot; asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;It look dat way,&quot; said Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what should we do?&quot; asked Treehugger.  &quot;I found the guy, but that's pretty much all I'm good for.  I can't fight that thing because I'll get killed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nobody knew what to do.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Medsa spoke up.  &quot;Why don't we just find her real baby?&quot;  Everyone turned to  da cleric.<br />
<br />
One by one, each party member slapped deir forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, let's see if I can track that thing,&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;Radar signals get very jumbly in this area since there are so many crossed frequencies with all the druids around here tracking.  I'd need a general direction.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked at where da treant was sitting.  Next to her was a cradle.  By da cradle, where some bird-like footprints dat lead off to da west.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me is no expert tracker,&quot; said Bash, &quot;but me is wondering if dose footprints have anyting to do wit da kidnapping?&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger looked at da big ogre amiably.  &quot;I think you've got it, Bash!  Let me test it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ranger stuck his hand up in da direction da footprints led and said, &quot;Blip Blip Blip Blip Bliiiiiiiip!&quot;  Da ranger smiled.  &quot;Yep!  Let's go!&quot;<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Birdbrain da aviak sat high in his treetop home.  He looked at da treant child and laughed to himself which sounded berry much like clucking.  His partner-in-crime, Egghead, stood closeby scheming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cluck cluck cluck, BickAww cluck!&quot; said Egghead, which was Aviak for &quot;We're going to be rich!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cluck!&quot; said Birdbrain, which was aviak for &quot;Darn tootin' we are!  It is conceivable that that treant female will pay handsomely to us whether in gold or magical services!  We shall be kings amongst birds!  Hail to us!  Hail!  Hail!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck, Bickaww, cluck cluck cluck hoot hoot cluck whipperwhil!&quot; said Egghead, which was aviak for &quot;w00t!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den deir friend Chickenlegs burst into da room at blinding speed.  Slamming da door behind it, da bird began speaking out of breath, &quot;Look out... *pant*... someone is onto our scheme.... *pant*....  they're coming!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CLUCK!&quot; yelled both Egghead and Birdbrain which was aviak for.... well.... me can't say because it not a nice word.  Just know it showed dat dey was both angry and frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long do we have?!&quot; asked a panicked Egghead.<br />
<br />
He needed no answer.  For just den, someting massive slammed into da door wit a thunderous cracking sound.  Da birds looked at each udder wit eyes wide open in terror.  <br />
<br />
Da wooden door flew apart into many splinters as a giant hammer slammed into it a second time.  A monstrous, naked ogre forced his way into da room and roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;CLUCK!&quot; screamed da three petrified birds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Da aviak treehouse was ransacked by da enraged ogre.  Not much was left except all da molted feathers flying around from da many terror stricken aviaks.  Bash even destroyed da stereo system dat was playing da annoying John Tesh music da aviaks seemed to enjoy so much.  Dere was much cheering from all da druids who was camping at da bottom of da treehouse.<br />
<br />
Bash came running back up to da place where Lilting was being held against his will.  He carried someting bundled up in a blanket.  Treehugger looked at ogre and gave him a silent nod.<br />
<br />
Da group watched as Bash went into da clearing, somewhat out of sight of da treant, and unwrapped da blanket.  Dey no could see what was in da blanket from where dey was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!&quot; cried a tiny voice in da direction of Bash.  &quot;Mama!  Mama!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby?&quot; a confused mommy treant said.  &quot;Baby?&quot; she said again while looking at Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!&quot; da voice cried.  Bash was sure to get out of da way and headed back to where da party was hiding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby!&quot; da big treant screamed while dropping Lilting and running to whatever it was dat Bash brought back.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was quick to run in and snatch da halfling before anyone was da wiser, including Lilting.  <br />
<br />
Da big near-sighted treant screamed wit joy when she found da ting she had been looking for all along.  She picked up her baby and cuddled it close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!&quot; said da baby.<br />
<br />
Da group finally was able to see da treant's child.  It was a baby Hill Giant.  Dey all looked at each udder and shrugged.  At least da baby and mommy was happy once again.  Bash sniffed back a tear.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about freakin' time!&quot; said a high-strung Lilting.  &quot;Where the Hate were you guys?!  Do you have any idea what the Hate it's like to be snuggled against by a thing whose skin is made of rough bark?!  Gaaah!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us is sorry, Lilting,&quot; said Bash apologetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better be!  And where's your clothes?!  And what was the deal with your hammer?!  And what was....&quot;  Lilting stopped in mid-sentence.  His eyes became distant and glazed.  Without a word, he spun around and bolted away from da party.  Da halfling waved his hands and his feet sped him up even faster.<br />
<br />
Everyone just stared in shock and confusion at da distant halfling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess we better follow the idgit,&quot; said da Paladin.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Grizzleknot da treant was feeling good today.  He didn't like to venture out into the open much, but today felt different.  He felt alive and good about life.  So much, dat he felt like singing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doo bee doo bee doo bee dee doo,&quot; sang da treant.  &quot;Well it's a doo ba dee doo, I mean a doo ba dee doo, I mean a doo bee doo bee doo bee doo ba dee doo!<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a.... hey!&quot; at dat moment a halfling druid had leapt out of some nearby bushes and attached itself to Grizzleknot's leg.  It den began pounding at da treant wit its fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now, little britches!  What's the big idea?&quot;  da treant began.  But just as he did, two more halflings came running up from different directions and jumped and landed on an arm and his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on here?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Four more halflings came running up and jumped and latched on to da treant.  More halflings were seen running up behind dem.<br />
<br />
Grizzleknot was starting to have a hard time standing up wit all da halflings on him.  Dey was grabbing his neck and his waist, everyting.  He started to fall down.  He saw even more halflings coming his way.  One was a little odd, he thought, because it was covered in dried mud.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Da group saw where Lilting had went when dey caught up.  Dere, standing three stories high, was a giant mound of halflings piled on top of each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are we going to find him now?!&quot; shouted a frustrated Medsa.  &quot;I say we ditch the guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den, da group heard some peoples trotting up behind dem.  A troll, a barbarian, and anudder ogre came lumbering up as fast as dey could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chococake heard that Grizzleknot was around?&quot; said da barbarian.  &quot;Chococake wrong?  Can you tell Chococake where he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da troll looked like it was deep in thought and then pointed to da halfling pile-up.  &quot;Deyz iza ona Grizzy dere!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ogre, troll, and barbarian ran up to da pile and roared.  All da halflings scattered in every direction like dey was ****roaches when da lights come on.  On da ground, dere was da skeleton of a treant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh.... dang it!!!&quot; da three shamen screamed aloud.<br />
<br />
Bash saw da halfling he was looking for running in a direction similar to where he was at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no yous don't!&quot; said da ogre as he grabbed da halfling and hoisted it into da air.  Lilting legs were still moving wit effort like dey not knew it dey wasn't on da ground anymore.<br />
<br />
Lilting had a frenzied look in his eyes and his teeth gritted a piece of bark dat he apparantly had torn from da treant.  <br />
<br />
Bash smacked da halfling upside da head.  Lilting's face returned to normal.  Bash grabbed da bark from his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; said da halfling.  &quot;I don't know what came over me.  I just had this overwhelming urge to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Save it,&quot; said da ogre.  &quot;Right now, us have overwhelming urge to kick yous tiny butt!  Let's get to Halas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right-o, my boy!&quot; said Sir Yessir.<br />
<br />
And wit dat, dey all followed Yessir to da northwest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Ahhh... we're almost there!&quot; said da paladin.  &quot;I remember this place.  See that cave?  That's the entrance to Splitpaw, which is in turn the entrance to Everfrost, which is in turn the entrance to Halas.  Golly, I remember killing three dragons on this very spot!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pyra looked a little confused.  &quot;Dragons?  Here?  I think you may have been mistaken, sir.  The only things near here that resemble a dragon are the harmless little gecko lizards that run around.  I should know, because I've fried more than...er... I've seen 'em around!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geck Ko?  Never heard of the beasts.  All I know is that three dragons appeared one day and I slew them!&quot;  Da paladin beamed proudly and as he threw his shoulders back his rusted armor squeaked loudly.  &quot;Erm, we should get moving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash suddenly got a chill.  It sent shivers down to da berry marrow of his bones.  He wasn't sure why.  Maybe it was a warning dat someting bad was gonna happen.  Maybe it was a ghost of a family member dat was nearby.  Or maybe it was da fact dat he was mostly naked.  Us will never know.<br />
<br />
Da group marched on towards Splitpaws entrance in da distance.  Da sun was beaming high overhead and casting it's rays down upon da party in triumph.  It had only been a week since dey left Freeport and dey were finally near deir destination.  Hopefully, some mysteries would finally be answered.  <br />
<br />
Lilting was feeling much better ever since Bash had dunked him in da river to wash away da mud.  He was feeling especially much better since his clothes finally dried.  He was happy dat he was with such good friends.  Maybe he could prove himself on this journey to his halfling brothers and finally be accepted as a druid and not a fool.  He hoped with all his halfling might.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was hoping he wouldn't get killed today.  He looked down at his swords hanging from his belt.  How he longed for da day he would be able to use them with some amount of skill.  He longed to even be a fraction of da famous warrior swordsman and teacher, Da Geistmeister.  He hoped one day to meet the revered man, but nobody has seen him in over 20 years.  Treehugger's thoughts eventually drifted over to Medsa.<br />
<br />
Da brown-haired cleric was walking slightly in front of and to da side of da ranger.  She pretended not to notice Treehugger looking at her.  She also pretended not to care.  She hid her blushing well.<br />
<br />
Pyra was walking behind everyone else.  Not because she was slow, but mostly because she didn't want anyone to see dat she was setting  trees and plants and anyting else ablaze wit some fireball spells as dey passed dem.  She quietly giggled as she set another tree stump on fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are!&quot; said Yessir as he stopped at da cave's entrance.  &quot;I'd better go ahead and check to make sure no dragons are lurking just inside the cave entrance.  I've found a few there before.  Wait for me, I'll be right back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da paladin pulled out his rusted sword and wit a battle cry and armor squeaking and grating loudly, he charged into da cave.  Bash couldn't see how a dragon could fit into da tiny, seven foot cave.  He began to wonder if dis paladin really what he said he was.<br />
<br />
Den da thought disappeared just as it came when Bash felt his hammer grow very, very, warm for an instant and den cool down just as fast.  Almost like it was warning him about someting.  Bash didn't want to take any chances.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessir, wait!&quot; screamed da ogre. &quot;Don't go...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was too late.  Da paladin vanished from sight as he ran deeply into da cave.  Da group looked at Bash and wondered why he would have yelled what he did.<br />
<br />
Den dey found out why.<br />
<br />
A loud CLANG! was heard and Yessir came flying out of da cave backwards wit tremendous force.  He flew horizontally about 30 feet and den slammed into da ground, unconscious.  Da group just stared wit jaws agape and in shock as dey watched da paladin go limp.<br />
<br />
Den dey heard a very low, growling chuckle come from da cave.  Dey turned and saw two bright, white orbs in da cave moving up and down wit da chuckling.  Da group den saw da orbs move closer and dey heard loud THUD followed by anudder.  Bash saw what da orbs were.  Dey were eyes.<br />
<br />
A fifteen foot tall demon, hunched over, pulled himself out of da cave and stood upright in da noon sun in front of da party.  Sunlight glistened off its red scales and black horns.  Da demon waved its hand and a sword appeared in it.  Da blade was black, so black dat light seemed to be absorbed into it and lost forever.<br />
<br />
Da demon smiled a wicked, evil smile dat bared all his long, sharp teeth.  It pointed its sword right at Bash and den laughed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash just stared at da demon, frozen in pure terror.  He had never known such fear before.  He could easily see da demon's fangs were stained wit blood while it smiled wickedly.  He watched as da demon unfolded its massive black wings to deir full extension.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're the one that I've been looking for,&quot; da demon said in an otherwordly growl.  &quot;Pity.  I expected you to be much bigger, much more intimidating, and much more.... clothed.  No matter, you will die today in any case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da demon let out an ear-splitting roar and den charged Bash.  Cloven hooves digging into da ground, da demon moved wit lightning speed towards da ogre.  Killdead slammed his shoulder into da ogre and sent Bash flying into da air.<br />
<br />
Killdead laughed as da ogre landed wit a CRUNCH.  He knew his fun was just starting.<br />
<br />
Pyra screamed at da demon after watching her two friends be tossed about like rag dolls.  She sent two fireballs flying towards da demon.<br />
<br />
Killdead turned just in time to see da balls of flame hurtling towards him.  He did nothing to stop dem.  Da fireballs slammed into his body, and da demon didn't even blink.  Da conjured spheres of fire did not even phase da demon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fool!  Do you really think such primitive spells could harm me?!  I've let you all live for too long.  Now the killing begins!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da demon ran towards Pyra wit sword raised and ready slam down into da wizardess.  Da demon came into striking distance and swung his sword right towards da lady's head.<br />
<br />
Treehugger came running up behind Pyra and leapt over da wizardess and put both his swords up in a cross formation while in mid-air.  Da demon's sword collided wit da ranger's and it sent da force sent da ranger flying towards da ground.  Treehugger's body slammed partially into Pyra and da wizardess was sent into a daze and laid on da ground.<br />
<br />
But da ranger was quick and jumped to his feet.  He whipped his swords up towards da demon and let out a snarl and his eyes filled wit rage.<br />
<br />
Treehugger called out, &quot;Medsa!  Go tend to Bash and Yessir!  Now!  Lilting, help me take this sucker down!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da cleric quickly nodded and ran off to Bash and Yessir.  Treehugger's eyes never left da demon.  Da demon's eyes stared back, glowing even hotter wit rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it will be you who will die first today,&quot; da demon growled.  &quot;Tell me ranger, will you still be so courageous when I am torturing your soul for an eternity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you'll just have to find out!&quot; yelled da ranger as he sliced his shortsword towards da demon.  Da demon blocked it wit his massive black claymore and den swung it  towards da ranger's head.<br />
<br />
Treehugger easily ducked underneath it and rolled towards da demon.  He spun upwards and  chopped at da demon.  His swords bounced off  da demon's scaly hide doing berry little damage.  He leapt back in surprise.<br />
<br />
Da demon grinned at da ranger.  Den it lifted up its sword, roared, and charged.<br />
<br />
Treehugger parried the forthcoming blow and sent two more Killdead's way.  The two combatants were now locked in intricate swordplay.  For every thrust there was a parry.  For every parry, there was a swing.  For every swing, there was a block.  For every hack, there was a dodge.<br />
<br />
Medsa reached Yessir first who was just coming back to consciousness.  He sat up blinking.  Da cleric casted a quick refreshing spell dat let him come to his senses quickly and den she was off towards Bash.  Yessir saw da fight between ranger and demon and immediately stood up.  He ran towards da battle wit rusty sword raised.<br />
<br />
Da demon swung his claymore downwards towards da half-elf again, and Treehugger brought his swords up in an X shape once again.  Da swords banged into each udder, and den just stopped in place.  Killdead pressed downwards on his sword and Treehugger did his best to push back wit his swords.<br />
<br />
Da ranger was losing da test of might.  He was going to be forced off his feet soon.  And probably would have had not a halfling appeared on da back of Killdead.<br />
<br />
Lilting climbed up da demon's backside quickly and stood on its shoulders.  Den da lil guy screamed, &quot;Booot to the head!&quot; and kicked da side of da demon's head wit all his halfling might.  Dis distracted da demon enough to let Treehugger jump away from da demon.<br />
<br />
Killdead howled wit rage and grabbed da halfling wit his free hand and tossed Lilting away from him.  Da halfling floated gently to da ground.  Treehugger sprang back into the demons range wit swords flailing.<br />
<br />
Medsa reached Bash and revived him wit a spell.  Bash sat up and blinked.  He saw da battle his friends were having wit da demon.  His friends were losing.  He didn't know what to do.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What are we going to do, Bash?!&quot; pleaded a frightened Medsa.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Me no know,&quot; said Bash wit a frown.  &quot;Me no kn....&quot; Bash's hammer flared and became hot to da touch again.  It glowed a brilliant white.  &quot;Wait.... me have idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da demon's sword nicked da ranger now and den spilling bits of da ranger's blood here and dere.  Nothing worse dan scratches, da ranger was skilled at avoidance.  Treehugger did his  best to dish out as much damage as he was taking, but da demon's scaly hide prevented him from causing much hurt to Killdead.<br />
<br />
Pyra started to come out of her daze and turned to see Treehugger locked in combat wit da demon.  Da ranger's swords were moving so fast dat dey was just a blur.  She started to stand up to try and help.<br />
<br />
Yessir ran as hard as he could.  He hoped he could get to Treehugger as quickly as possible to lend some muscle to their side.  He saw da two swordmasters in a perpetual dance.  If he could just get dere quick enough...<br />
<br />
Treehugger started to feel the strength leave his body.  Da toll of his fighting began to set in.  Killdead noticed his opponent was becoming slower.  He knew his chance was coming soon.  It was inevitable, he knew.  No mortal could ever hope to defeat him.<br />
<br />
Treehugger swung into da demon one more time.  Killdead swung his sword wide and hard and forced Treehugger's own swords to swing wide.  His midsection exposed, da demon swung his free hand and clawed at da ranger.  Treehuggers stomach was split wide open.<br />
<br />
Da rangers eyes went wide and just stared into da distance.  Da demon smiled.  Da ranger fell to his knees, still staring at nothing.  His swords fell to da ground, and den da ranger fell over backwards.<br />
<br />
Medsa turned to see Treehugger just as he fell to da grass limply.  She screamed.  &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash no could believe what he saw.  One of his friends just dropped to da ground dead.  He knew dat it would happen again and again if he no did anyting.  He grabbed Medsa and picked her up and ran to where da demon was.<br />
<br />
Yessir made finally made it to da demon.  Out of breath, he took off his bucket-helmet and threw it to da ground.  Da old man's grey hair was sticking out in every direction.  His eyes were filled wit rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, demonspawn,&quot; spat da paladin.  &quot;Let's see you fight me when I'm expecting ye!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da demon turned his attention from da limp ranger to da paladin.  Da demon licked da blood from his hand and den grinned at Yessir.  &quot;Looks like my belly will be rather full tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yessir charged wit rusted sword raised and trash-can shield held high above his head.  But as he ran underneath da demon, he did what nobody, not even da demon expected.  He jumped high into da air and spun in da air to  deliver a roundhouse kick to da demon's face.  He landed on da ground wit sword poised ready to strike.<br />
<br />
Killdead's head twisted to da side wit da blow of da paladin's foot.  He slowly turned back to da paladin wit a look of amazement and puzzlement.<br />
<br />
Yessir grinned.  Den he swung madly at da demon.  Another swordfight bewtween mortal and demon ensued.<br />
<br />
Da demon didn't see da ogre approach.  Bash pointed to where Treehugger lay.  &quot;Heal him,&quot; da ogre said to da cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't!  He's... he's dead!&quot; cried Medsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heal him!  Heal him now!  You can do it.  Me know yous can.  Me need him alive for plan to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll.... I'll try.&quot;  da cleric said wit a sob and went to da ranger.<br />
<br />
Bash felt da heat from his hammer more intensely.  It kept getting hotter.  He approached da dazed halfling and wizardess.  &quot;Ok yous two... listen up, us not have much time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa knelt down next to Treehugger.  She saw da wound da ranger suffered was deep and gaping indeed.  She choked back her tears.  Da rangers eyes stared blankly at da sky above and his hands still clutched tightly to his swords.<br />
<br />
Medsa just wanted to leave dis awful, awful place.  Run away from all dese emotions dat appeared from nowhere.  Fear, hate, mourning, and... love.  She knew she couldn't dough.  Her friends needed her.  Bash needed her.  Treehugger needed her.  She mustered up her courage and placed her hands six inches above da ranger's wound.<br />
<br />
Yessir did his best to block da demon's attacks, but he was nowhere near da fighter dat Treehugger was and he knew it.  &quot;If this thing were only a dragon...&quot; da paladin muttered out of breath.  It was only a matter of time before da demon overtook him.<br />
<br />
White light flared from Medsa's hands.  It grew brighter until encompassed both her and Treehugger.  Her face contorted and strained wit pain and concentration.  Da light grew so bright dat she no could see anyting anymore.  She put all of her energy she had into dis spell.  All of her hope, all of her mind,....and all of her heart.  &quot;Come back to me...... please....&quot;  Den she screamed from da pain da spell demanded of her.<br />
<br />
Da light disappeared.<br />
<br />
Da light distracted da demon for a moment as he looked to see where da source of it was coming from.  It was all Yessir needed.  Da paladin stabbed his sword into da demon's wing and tore downwards, ripping da leathery wing open.<br />
<br />
Da demon roared in pain and anger.  It kicked da paladin square in da chest and sent him flying.<br />
<br />
Medsa collapsed from fatigue.  Da spell had drained her.  Treehugger just lay there, motionless still.  Medsa wailed for her lost friend.  She did not know what else dere was to do.<br />
<br />
Da ranger'ss eyes continued to stare into nothingness.  Until, dat is, dey blinked.  His eyes blinked once more.  He turned his head to da prone cleric.  &quot;Hey.... baby,&quot; da ranger rasped.  &quot;Couldn't stand to.... be without me for..... two minutes, huh?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Medsa laughed as tears of relief streamed down her face.  She did her best to try and hide her joy, but it didn't work too well.  &quot;Shut up, worm!&quot; she tried to say wit a scowl.  &quot;Bash.... Bash needs you to fight....&quot; da cleric was growing weaker.  She needed to rest badly.  &quot;Can you.... can you fight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ranger sat up.  He looked at his torn armor and saw dat a scar was now visible where da demon and ripped him open.  &quot;I think I can.  I believe I owe a certain demon some steel.&quot;  And wit dat, da ranger leapt to his feet.<br />
<br />
Medsa smiled and den passed out.<br />
<br />
Da demon stomped up to da paladin on da ground.  It raised it sword to strike at da old man.  It was about to swing until it felt  someting tapping its shoulder.  Killdead turned his head to see what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiyas,&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Remember me?&quot;  Da ogre slammed his hammer into da side of da demon's skull.  Da demon spun about in a 360.  It came to a stop and shook off da daze.  It roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, me heard dat before.&quot;  Bash stabbed his hammer into da demon's chest and Killdead staggered for a second.  It den raised it's sword in a flash and began swinging at da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pyra, NOW!&quot; da ogre screamed.  Off to da side, da wizardess began summoning fire from out of nowhere dat collected around her hands.  It accumulated into da largest fireball she ever cast.  She sent it reeling towards da ogre and demon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Foolish ogre,&quot; da demon growled.  &quot;Have you learned nothing yet?  Such a spell cannot harm me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It not for you,&quot; said Bash calmly.  &quot;It for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da fireball slammed into da ogre.  Flames arced all around Bash, but none of it touched him.  Bash's hammer took all da fire in like it was hungry for it.  Flames swirled and swooped into da hammer.  Da demon furrowed his brow in confusion as it looked down at da flashing orange hammer.  Da next ting it saw was da hammer slamming into its torso.<br />
<br />
The sound of a thunderbolt ripped through da air as da hammer struck.  A ring of fire spread outwards and da demon went flying straight back.  Killdead slammed into da rock wall right next to da mouth of da cave.  It fell over in a lump on da ground.  <br />
<br />
Bash grinned.<br />
<br />
Yessir got up and shook his head violently to  regain his senses.  He trotted up next to Bash.  Treehugger arrived seconds later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it dead?&quot; da ranger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; said Bash.<br />
<br />
Da ogre was right.  Killdead got onto his feet.  It did not look happy.  But it did look like it had been hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, us need to fight it at da same time,&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Charge!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da three of dem went at da demon.  Killdead did his best to deflect a blow, but as soon as he blocked one, anudder sword or hammer slammed into his body.  Treehugger jumped into da air, did a flip, slammed his swords into da demons shoulders, and den leapt off da demon's back pulling his swords wit him.<br />
<br />
Killdead was losing, and he knew it.  Da hammer-fire dat slammed into him hurt him more dan he thought any mortal weapon ever could.  But he had a few tricks up his sleeve yet.<br />
<br />
Da demon arced his back and roared. He became surrounded by a red flame.  He seemed stronger.  His wounds seemed to heal, and his tear in his wing sealed up.  Da flames went away and da demon smiled.<br />
<br />
He den attacked wit a ferocity dat dey had never seen before.  Bash expected da demon would not be easy to defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilting, us need dat teleport now!  It is distracted!  Cast it now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da halfling was waiting for da ogre to say so.  He began his spell.<br />
<br />
Bash fought as hard as he could.  He knew Treehugger and Yessir were giving it deir best as well.  He just had to keep da demon from disrupting da halfling so Lilting could evacuate dem away from da demon and maybe dey could hide from it until dey could figure out how to destroy it.<br />
<br />
Lilting waved his hands some more.  He knew his teleport spell would take several moments to cast.  Da halfling it was up to him now.  He had an idea.  He spoke da magical words, &quot;Woodland spirits, my voice hear it.  Come down from above, and give me the power to teleport with love!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Da halfling's hands spewed forth blue sparks.  But instead of pointing dem at himself and his friends, he pointed dem at da demon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilting!  What is you doing?!&quot; yelled Bash.  &quot;What is you....?&quot; his words were cut short as he watched what happened.<br />
<br />
Da demon looked at da halfling wit puzzlement.  His body became surrounded by da blue sparks.  &quot;Fool!  What do you think you will accomplish?  You cannot get rid of me on this mortal plane!  I can find you from anywhere on this world!  I can....&quot; da demon's voice started to fade.  Da demon started phase out of dis area.<br />
<br />
Da sparks swirled around da demon faster and faster and den da demon and da sparks disappeared all together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilting!&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Dat was great!  But he'll back... he said....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry guys,&quot; shouted da halfling.  &quot;Trust me, he's not coming back.  I call that my 'Reverse Port'.&quot; Lilting winked.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Killdead opened his eyes.   He found it hard to see because of all da bright light around him.  White light seemed to permeate da area all around him.  His eyes started to adjust and he saw dat he was standing on some cotton-like clouds.  His eyes adjusted further and he saw houses all around him made out of da same cloud-like material.<br />
<br />
A gnome in a white robe appeared from one of da buildings and saw da demon.  &quot;Brothers and sisters!&quot; da gnome called out.  &quot;Come!  See!  A new friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da demon raised one eyebrow.  He saw hundreds of gnomes, dwarves, and halflings pour out of all da buildings around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He looks like he needs a hug!&quot; da first gnome said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!  Yes!  Hug!  Hug!&quot; all da udders started to say cheerily around da demon.<br />
<br />
Da demon was suddenly filled wit terror and dread.  He knew where he was.<br />
<br />
One halfling came and hugged Killdead's leg.  Den anudder followed.  Da demon screamed in fright.  He knew where he was indeed.  A place he never hoped to see.  Da Plane of Love.<br />
<br />
More and more little peoples piled onto da demon.  &quot;We love you!  We love you!&quot; da all started chanting wit happiness.<br />
<br />
Da demon was toppled by so many of da little guys piling onto him.  He screamed again.  He began clawing at da ground to try and get away.  It was useless as he became swarmed.<br />
<br />
Killdead screamed in horror one last time before it was muffled.  Da demon disappeared under a huge pile of one big group hug of small peoples.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
In his castle, Smellybreath's eyes snapped open from meditation.  Da goblin looked at da big black knight standing by his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;There has been a change in plans.  The demon has failed.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Emerging from da other side of da cave, da party just stared in wonder and awe.  Dey had never seen snow before. Well, none but Yessir, who recounted tales of how he slew three snow dragons in one single day.<br />
<br />
Snow covered everyting in dis mountain canyon dey was in.  Rocks, trees, mountains, nothing was untouched by dis cold, white substance.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The one thing I don't get,&quot; said Lilting, &quot;Is that how can it get so cold over here when it's like 80 degrees just on the other side of the cave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh!&quot; da party shushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what about that desert we went through,&quot; da halfling started again, &quot;How did it go from hot humid swamp to dry arid desert  in just a blink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh! Da gods might hear you!&quot; Bash said.  Da last person he knew dat questioned da gods was an ogre shadowknight friend of his.  He had questions and sought answers, but one day he woke up wit no intelligence.  Dey said he only had enough brain cells to breathe, eat, and blink.  Bash never forgot his friend whose name was Nurphed.<br />
<br />
While pondering on his friend Nurphed and anudder friend who had disappeared from dis world altogether, Bannedfur Good, someting hit da ogre like a ton of troll casserole.  It was cold!  It was berry cold outside!  Freakin' cold!  Bash was suddenly berry aware  of his naked ogre body.  He started to freeze all over, from his head, to his feet, to his jumblies*.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys...&quot; Bash said shivering, &quot;Dis starting to suck.  Me need clothes!  Bad!  Let's get to dis Halas place soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yessir lead da way through the cold slush and ice.  Overhead da clouds moved in and blocked out da afternoon sun.  It den began to snow.<br />
<br />
Dey came upon a fork in da canyon road.  Yessir became puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.  I don't remember this place having a fork in the road.&quot; da paladin mentioned confusedly while rubbing his stubbly chin.  &quot;Hmmm.  Maybe we'll go this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
And da party took da right fork.  Dey came upon anudder fork shortly after.  And anudder.  And anudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place wasn't this maze-like before!&quot; da paladin exclaimed.  But den he asked himself under his breath, &quot;Was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da party was so turned around dat dey didn't even know which was up anymore.  No sun could tell dem where north was, and da only tings Treehugger and Lilting could track was demselves.  Finally, dey came out in a big snowy clearing.  About a hundred yards ahead dey saw a gigantic frozen river.<br />
<br />
Bash's skin was now purple.  He was so cold his brain started to tink he was warm.  His whole body was numb.  He just wanted to lay down and go to sleep.  Den he saw two figures wave at him from a distance.  He didn't know if dey was real or not.  Da figures den started running towards him and he finally saw who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnn.... Nnnnnn.....&quot; Bash chattered trying to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Bash?&quot; asked Medsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnnn.... Nnnnneeee....&quot; da ogre tried to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you see?&quot; asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
Da party strained to see what Bash saw.  Several seconds later dey saw da figures for demselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnnn.... Nnnnnecro!&quot;<br />
<br />
Up came running a snow-covered Philiac followed by his skeleton friend Jakontiklarkiak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi guys!&quot; da gnome said cheerily.  &quot;Cold enough for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da skeleton just waved at da group.<br />
<br />
Bash wanted to pick up da gnome and chomp him, but he was too cold to even do dat.  So he just gritted his teeth in a big grimace.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was studying how snow looks, so that, you know, when Hate freezes over I'll be sure to know!  You remember our deal, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash just grimaced some more.  Tink happy thoughts, Bash.  Tink happy, warm thoughts. thought da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah!  I almost forgot!  Come see what I found!  Hurry!&quot; da gnome was off running back towards da frozen river.<br />
<br />
Da skeleton shrugged at da party and was off running after his master.  Da group slowly and reluctantly followed.<br />
<br />
Bash couldn't keep up wit da group.  His limbs were almost gelatin.  He saw his friends step out onto da river and look dowanrds at to someting Phil was pointing at.  Den dey looked up at Bash, and den back down at da ice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash,&quot; shouted Lilting, &quot;I think you better come look at this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash made it to da river and looked to see what everyone was staring at.  He looked down.<br />
<br />
Dere, frozen in da ice wit eyes open wide and  mouth in a timeless scream, was an ogre dat appeared to look just like his brother Smash.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash just stared at da frozen ogre wit puzzlement and shock.  Could dis be his brudder?  Could dis be...<br />
<br />
&quot;Smash?&quot; da big ogre asked quietly to da ice-ting.  Obviously, it no responded.<br />
<br />
Bash's friends just watched silently.  Dey felt sorry for da big guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smash!&quot; shouted Bash.  &quot;Help me get him out of here!  Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash,&quot; said Medsa, &quot;I'm still very weak from healing Treehugger.  Even if you got him out I don't think...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us have to try!  Please help me get him out here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shivering from being almost frozen to the bone and also from being so shaken up over seeing his brudder, Bash lifted up his hammer and began slamming it into da ice.  He repeatedly hacked away trying to break up da thick, frozen sheet.<br />
<br />
Lilting pulled out his tiny, tiny, ultra-tiny dagger and ran up beside Bash.  He bent down and started chipping away at the ice to help his big friend.  <br />
<br />
Phil joined in too.  He came up next to Bash and started jumping up and down on the ice in the hopes to break through. Following his master's lead Jakontiklarkiak started jumping up and down alongside the gnome.<br />
<br />
Da rest of da group sighed and started helping deir friend.  Everyone was chipping away what dey could.  Da person who gave da most help was Pyra.  She sent out a stream of flame dat spewed forth from her fingers like a blow-torch.  Da ice started to melt away quickly.<br />
<br />
Bash noticed da ice around da ogre was melted enough.  Slush covered da face of what he thought may be his brudder.  He signaled everyone to stop.  He took his big hand and brushed away da snow-cone like ice remains and took a look at what dey uncovered.  Bash began to sob.<br />
<br />
What appeared to have been an ogre trapped in ice was nothing more than a large, brown rock.  Everyone's eyes went downward feeling bad for da ogre.  Dey knew he missed his brudder very much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me should have known,&quot; sniffled Bash.  &quot;Me should have known he not be here.  Why would Smash go to Halas?  Why would...&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ogre stopped.  He looked to his side and noticed dat Phil was still hopping up and down like mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll get that ogre out!  We'll get him!&quot; da gnome chanted as he leapt up and down and slamming as much force into da ice as his tiny body would let him.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, da ice underneath Bash's feet began to crack.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll get your brother out Smash!&quot; said da necromancer.  &quot;Don't worry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger saw what was happening.  &quot;Phil!  Stop!  Don't jump anymore!&quot;  Da ranger just looked on as da gnome didn't seem to hear him and da ice began to crack some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, Phil!  Stop&quot; each person started scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry guys!&quot; da gnome said again unaware of da warnings being shout at him.  &quot;I'll rescue that ogre! I'll....&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ice underneath Bash and Philiac gave out.  Both the gnome and the ogre were immediately plunged into da icy river.  Da party just stared in surprise and horror as dey saw da forms of deir friend and gnome acquaintence get pulled underneath da ice by da river's strong current.  Da two bodies could be seen moving at a great speed under da thick ice sheet dat covered da rest of da river.<br />
<br />
Jakontiklarkiak looked at da group, shrugged, and den hopped into da newly made ice-hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that,&quot; Sir Yessir said, &quot;Is why I'll never group with a necro.  They never listen.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Bash's mind was racing.  He knew he was being pulled somewheres at an alarming speed.  He knew he was in someting berry, berry cold.  And he knew dat if he tried to breathe, he would die.<br />
<br />
He tried his best to grab onto someting as his body zoomed by large, icy, underwater outcroppings.  His hands were so numb dey couldn't get a firm hold onto any of da slippery surfaces.<br />
<br />
He eventually gave up trying to struggle and faced da fact dat he was gonna die.  He prayed dat his brudder would one day find his way back to Oggok.  He prayed dat Smash had found Smellybreath and bashed him real good.  He started pray some more when his body slammed into someting berry hard.<br />
<br />
Bash realized he had come upon a rocky bank.  He mustered what strength he had and tried to climb out of da river.  He plopped himself onto da stony ground, sat up and realized he was in an underwater cave.  Not five feet away fom him was Philiac lying unconscious, face-first in da gravelly rock.  Bash sneered at da gnome.<br />
<br />
Den da ogre felt someting hot on da back of his neck.  Bash spun his head around and saw, just inches from his face, da muzzle of da biggest, meanest, white-est, bear he ever saw.  Three times da size of da ogre, it was.<br />
<br />
Da bear roared at Bash.  Our hero, overcome with fear, fatigue, and hypothermia, passed out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;The time has come, my Elemental Guardians,&quot; Smellybreath said while standing atop his small altar, &quot;To set in motion my grand design.  You four are but the first step.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da four black knights stood motionless in front of da goblin wizard.  Each of deir swords glowing as brightly as da day dey was created was in each knight's hand.  Fire, Ice, Earth, and Air these dark warriors were named and deir bladed weapons glowed brightly da color of each respected element.  If dey could speak or not, only Smellybreath knew.  If dere was actually someting inside da ebony armours, only da goblin knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was very difficult in acquiring these, but well worth it.  Here, each of you take one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da goblin reached into a pouch he had on his belt and pulled out a single, polished, shiny, black, oval-shaped stone.  Da stone had a single white rune symbol on it.  He handed it to da first and biggest black knight, Fire.  Da black knight closed his fist around da stone and stood back at attention.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath den did da same for da udder knights until each had a single stone of deir own.  Da goblin grinned wickedly when his presents were passed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, using these stones is simple.  If you trace the rune one way with your left index finger, it will teleport you to a destination I have predetermined for each.  If you trace it the opposite way, it will teleport you back here.  Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da knights just stood stock still, full helmets just staring straight ahead at da goblin.  Smellybreath chuckled to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.  Now, go.  And when you arrive at your  destinations unleash vengence.  My vengence!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eeach knight simultaneously banged deir clenched sword hand against deir breastplates.  Da room was filled wit a resonating CLANG!  Each knight put deir swords in deir magical scabbards and den traced da different patterns on deir stones.<br />
<br />
A whirlwind of colors swarmed around each individual knight.  Then colored lines raced up and down each of deir bodies.  A bright flash briefly appeared and den each knight was gone.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath smiled evilly, each pointed tooth clearly visibile in da light of da torches surrounding his altar. <br />
<br />
&quot;And so begins the prophecy...&quot; da goblin said to himself.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we do?!&quot; pleaded Lilting.  &quot;We can't go after them!&quot;  Da halfiling looked across where da frozen river ran where he saw his ogre friend disappear out of sight.  Lilting sniffled back some tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....  I don't know.&quot; said Treehugger.  Frustration, anger, and sorrow welled up inside da ranger.  He slammed his sword deeply into da ice out of rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;There isn't a thing we can do, lad.&quot; da old paladin said.  &quot;But that doesn't mean there isn't a thing anyone can do about it.  Let's go talk to the barbarians.  They skinny dip in this thing all the time, like it's some sort of test of manhood.  I bet they may know where Bash ended up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Test of manhood,&quot; snorted Medsa.  &quot;Sounds more like a test of idiocy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll find that those two things are often one and the same, my dear lady.&quot; Yessir said wit a smile.  &quot;Come, I think I can remember the way to Halas.  Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
And wit dat, Yessir trekked off into da snowy hills wit da group in tow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dan YellSan was one of da best monks in his class.  He lived in Qeynos wit all da udder monks.  He spent many years training berry hard to get where he is today.  He mastered every move dere is in da Book of Chan, da monks' bible.  He most recently mastered da &quot;Hold Fists in Front of Self, Shiver and Shake With Rage, and Scream Waaaah!&quot; technique.  He currently waited in the &quot;Room of Patience&quot; just outside his master's dojo.<br />
<br />
Dan YellSan's sensai, Mee YahGee, was quite proud of his student.  Today, in his dojo, he  was going to present da black belt to his finest pupil.  He was quite confident dat Dan YellSan could face any opponent and be victorious.  This was the price of 25 years of hard work, training, discipline, and doing odd jobs for Mee YahGee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan YellSan, come here!&quot; shouted Mee YahGee while he stood in da middle of da wooden dojo.<br />
<br />
Dan came running and bowed before his teacher.  He stood up and met his sensai eye to eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me, San-Do-Floor!&quot; exclaimed Mee YahGee.  Dan started spinning his arms in huge concentric circles.  Mee started quietly giggling.  Dan YellSan always fell for that and still believed it was of any use in da battlefield.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan YellSan, you have achieved great rank amongst the monks.  You are deserving of this.&quot;  Da old man held up a folded belt of black color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sensai,&quot; said Dan wit a bow.  &quot;I will do my best to....&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan YellSan was cut off by screaming outside.  He and his sensai looked at each other and immediately bolted to da door and went outside.  If dere was someting looking for trouble, dey was gonna find it wit Dan YellSan and Mee YahGee.<br />
<br />
What dey saw horrified dem.  Da streets were completely covered red wit running blood.  A dark figure was slashing monks left and right and ripping through dem like dey was tissue paper.  To get to udder peoples, it would crash through houses and den throw limp bodies outside.<br />
<br />
Da dark figure came closer to where Dan and Mee stood.  It slashed more monks along da way until it stood right in front of Dan YellSan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan YellSan!&quot; shouted Mee YahGee, &quot;The Crane!  If do right, no can defense!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan nodded and put his arms up in a 'Y' formation and lifted one foot off da ground.  Whoever dis ting was, Dan was sure it finally would pay for da deaths of his friends.<br />
<br />
Da dark being looked at Dan and den swung its  sword downward towards da young monk.  Dan YellSan was split into two symmetrical vertical pieces.<br />
<br />
Mee YahGee just stared in disbelief. &quot;But... but he did right...  No can defense!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mee YahGee looked at da big black ting in front of him.  He could see dat it was a knight, at least seven feet tall.  His eyes trained downward to da bright, glowing, white sword da knight held.  Mee YahGee took up an offensive stance.  It was time to show dis ting what an old monk can do.<br />
<br />
Da big knight made no advance on da monk.  Instead, it thrust its sword downward into da ground.  A blast of hot air shot out from all around da knight.<br />
<br />
Da wave of air slammed into Mee YahGee, instantly ripping him apart.  Da air continued outward from da knight totally destroying anyting, building or person, in its path.  Da blast wave died out about one hundred feet from da knight.<br />
<br />
Air, da black knight, pulled his sword from da ground and turned around to continue his carnage.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Norrath had just begun to feel da wrath of Smellybreath by his guardians.  Da black knight, Earth, was seen ripping apart da underground dwarf city of Kaladim.  No dwarf was safe from dat black knight as he chopped, sliced, and fileted dwarves by da dozens.  Occasionally da knight would cause massive earthquakes dat brought many of da beautiful earthen structures down killing many more.<br />
<br />
Ice was seen in da High Elven city of Felwithe.  Elves were instantly frozen in deir tracks and den shattered into millions of tiny pieces wit a swing of a sword or a punch of a black gauntlet.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath could feel his anger manifested through his guardians as each scream echoed in his tiny, green ears.  He could feel each soul taken away from the mortal plane.  Da prophecy da goblin knew about was indeed coming to pass.  He would make everyone pay for what dey did to him.<br />
<br />
Soon, he would become so powerful that none would be able to stop him.  This he knew, and this he planned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Halt!&quot; shouted a voice from behind Ice.  Da black knight had been continuing his razing of Felwithe for several hours uninterrupted... until now dat is.  Da black knight pulled its giant sword out of his latest high elf kill and turned to face dis nuisance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Orclous Calbane!&quot; shouted an elf decked out in fine armor,dat glowed wit magic power, and held two swords dat looked like dey was looted from a powerful dragon's hoarde.  Standing next to him and behind him were several scores of powerful looking peoples of all races and classes.  Wizards, warriors, rangers, magicians, necromancers, monks, everyting.  &quot;Prepare to die, foul fiend!  For all seventy of us are level 62 or higher!  We have destroyed gods and dragons alike in multiple different planes!  You'll soon be nothing but dust in the wind!  Have at you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da huge group of &quot;high level&quot; peoples charged da black knight holding da glowing blue sword.  Da knight just ****ed its helmeted head in curiosity as da peoples came rushing towards him.<br />
<br />
About thirty seconds later Ice walked away from a berry bloody, destroyed section of town.  In his left hand he held da head of &quot;Orclous Calbane,&quot; da idiot elf who thought he and his buddies could kill da Elemental Guardian.  Da knight shook his head and den tossed da elf's noggin behind him as he went deeper into da city to do some more killing and destroying.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
<br />
Bash began to awaken from a deep, unconscious slumber.  His body hurt too much to move, and he couldn't feel much in terms of his arms and legs.  Da ogre tried to open his eyes, but it only hurt to do so.  He found he was able to squint witout da pain being so bad.<br />
<br />
He saw dat he was lying on his back.  He also noticed dat a single torch was attached to da wall near his head.  It didn't give off a tremendous amount of light, but it was enough to hurt his eyes further.  He saw dat da wall and floor around him was made of rock and ice.  And since da light no hit da ceiling, and since his breathing echoed loudly, he could only guess he was in a huge cavern.  Anyting beyond dat, da light would not penetrate.<br />
<br />
Bash tried to sit up but found he was berry much unable to do so.  He got his head up a couple feet before he felt completely spent of energy and had to plop back down.  He was berry tired and berry sore.  He was able to see dat somone had put some blankets and straw over da ogre to keep him warm while he slept.<br />
<br />
Bash was confused.  He tried to tink of da tings dat happened before he blacked out.  He remembered floating along da raging river.  He remembered da passed out gnome.  He remembered....  he remembered.... he almost remembered someting else when he heard sounds of footsteps.<br />
<br />
Da light from da torch no would let Bash see what was going beyond da length of his make-shift bed.  But he could tell dat da footsteps were entering da same cavern he was in.  Bash's ringing ears were able to distinguish two different patterns of footprints.  One set was light, and da udder... da udder set was...<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the promising ogre has awakened&quot; a berry, berry deep but comforting and somewhat  famliar voice spoke.  &quot;I am glad to see you are not dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da sound of da lighter footsteps began to walk around his bed as da voice spoke.  &quot;I knew you would come, just as you did.  Just as he did.  I expect there are many questions you must have.  I will do my best to answer what I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is me?&quot; asked Bash in a raspy voice.  It felt like he no used his voice box in ages.<br />
<br />
Da deep voice chuckled, but in a non-threatening or mean way.  &quot;You're deep underground.  Beneath the frozen, icy fields of Permafrost.  Below the barbarian city of Halas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where..... where is me friends...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They go to seek the help of the primitives...er... barbarians as you call them, for their help in rescuing you.  It is too bad they do not have the gift, for they would know you are in far safer hands than one could imagine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have spent your time searching for a certain person, Bash.  You have faced many dangers and acquired powerful allies into finding the one who can guide you along your path.  Your grandfather knew you would find that person.  And now you have.  You have found... me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And...&quot; Bash wheezed, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
A larger-dan-average gold-tinted skeleton stepped out of da shadows.  It stood next to Bash.  Bash looked at da ting in curiosity.  He wasn't expecting a skeleton to be da ting he had been looking for.<br />
<br />
Bash den heard a louder, heavier set of footsteps come closer to him.  Out of da darkness emerged da biggest, white-est bear Bash had ever seen.  <br />
<br />
Da bear began speaking and Bash recognized da voice as da one he'd just been listening to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the oracle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash, unable to stay awake any longer, let his head fall backwards and den slipped back into a deep rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rest now,&quot; said da bear.  &quot;All will be revealed in good time.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash's eyes snapped open.  He no knew how long he been asleep.  Last ting he remembered was some weird dream about a talking polar bear and freaky looking skeleton.  Bash heard and felt a deep, earth-shaking rumble.  His whole body shook wit da sound.  Da ogre immediately sat straight up.<br />
<br />
Bash saw dat he was in da same cavern from his dream.  Da torch, da bed, da ice, da cavern, all was da same.  Da deep rumbling sound came again and he shook even more fiercely dis time.  Bash pinpointed da sound to have originated from his stomach.  It was den dat he realized dat he was famished.  Da big ogre no could remember da last time he ate.<br />
<br />
Bash heard some footsteps enter da room he was in.  Wading out of da darkness was da bigger-dan-average skeleton holding a huge dinner tray.  It set it down next to da ogre's bed and den raised its hand in a &quot;thumb's up&quot; postion to da ogre.<br />
<br />
Bash was so hungry he no cared about anyting anymore.  He grabbed da tray and pulled off da tin lid.  He set da tray on his lap and looked at was steaming on top of it.<br />
<br />
Lying on its stomach, apple in mouth, was a gnome dat had been roasted to perfection wit a light lemon glaze.  Bash began devouring da  wonderful looking meal.  About halfway through, he looked at da skeleton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ish dish...&quot; da ogre tried to say wit a mouthful of gnome, but den swallowed.  &quot;Is dis Philiac?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da deep voice Bash remembered from his dream all of a sudden boomed throughout da room.  &quot;The annoying necromancer?  No, that's not him.  Though, that isn't a bad idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash heard da big footsteps come from da direction of da voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you've regained much strength since we last spoke.  Excellent.  Now we can discuss what it is we need to discuss.&quot;  Da footsteps came closer and den da voice said, &quot;Lights!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da whole cavern lit up brightly.  Bash squinted his eyes in slight pain, but dey adjusted quickly enough.  He saw da big bear and da skeleton as plain as day standing next to him in da most beautiful, wondrous ice cavern Bash knew he would ever see.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't much time,&quot; said da bear.  &quot;Swallow your last bit of dinner, and follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da bear, on all four legs, led Bash down some windy tunnels dat were carved out of da ice.  Da ogre walked alongside da bear dat was at least twice his size.  Da skeleton followed behind da two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is you?  What is you?&quot; asked Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a bear, nothing more.  Just smarter than your average bear, I suppose.  I have many names.  To some I am called the Glacier Bear.  To others I am the White Death.  To many orcs I am known as &quot;Squish Squish Run Away From Squish Squish.&quot;  And to a very, very small group of extremely special people, I am  known as The Oracle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yous is da glacier bear?!  But, isn't yous pelt needed for da shamanic totemic helm?  Me have seen a shaman wit dat!  Yous must be dead!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah!  How many of those 'totemic helms' have you seen around?  There are over a thousand of them in circulation.  Many idiot shamen come down here to kill me and claim my hide for their own selfish purposes.  All have never seen me.  I almost figured you for one of those morons, until I saw your hammer... and the fact that you're pretty much naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked down at da leafy bush dat he had uprooted and used as a make-shift un-embarrassment.  &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; said da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, if dey all have totemic helms, and none have ever seen yous....&quot;<br />
<br />
Da bear stopped.  It turned his head to look behind itself.  &quot;Miragul, would you care to show our young ogre friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da skeleton saluted da big bear and began waving its arms.  Yellow light shot out from da skeletons hands and where it landed, a big, white bear appeared.  It looked just like da Glacier Bear, but was about two-thirds da size.  It roared at Bash and den disappeared wit a wave of da skeleton's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miragul is a wonderful lich, conjurer, and good friend.&quot; da bear said.  Da skeleton, bowed.  &quot;He creates those things to fool the idiots.  He can create one every eight hours or so.  The hide from the conjured bears can be used to make a totemic helm.  It's too bad they're not real totemic.  A real totemic helmet is about thirty times as powerful as the pieces of huddah they think is so special!<br />
<br />
&quot;If the shamen would only take the time to open up their minds they may actually get a real one someday.  But do they ever even try to talk to me?  Do they even hail any of the bears they meet?  No!  It's all about 'kill kill kill, die die die, pelt pelt pelt!'&quot;<br />
<br />
As da three peoples continued walking, anudder skeleton came running around da corner.  It saw Miragul and ran up to da lich.  Da two exchanged high fives and den began moving deir jaws up and down as if dey was talking to one anudder.  Da sound of bone scraping against bone echoed throughout da hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there's Jakontiklarkiak.  A good friend of Miragul's.  It is too bad that gnome of his isn't as cool.  I had to put him in stasis.  He'll be hibernating for a good long time.  Maybe that will cure him of his highly annoying demeanor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me doubt it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; said da bear shaking his head wit a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Bear... uh sir...&quot; said Bash.  &quot;What is me doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prophecy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What prophecy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prophecy.  There are all sorts of prophecies in this world.  Some are unimportant, some are very important.  Some are right, some are wrong, some are just plain weird.  There's even one that speaks of you stubbing your toe in this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OW!&quot; screamed da ogre as his bare foot accidentally kicked a protruding rock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that particular prophecy was one of the correct ones.&quot; da bear said wit a shrug (as much as a bear can shrug at least).  &quot;Prophecies are tricky things.  They're not set in stone, and they can be changed.  But not always.  Sometimes there are loopholes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does dis have to do wit me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The goblin that killed your parents became a student of prophecy.  He found a particularly  nasty one that he felt he could twist to his own advantage.  He learned all he could about it, and took measures to make sure all the things that kept the prophecy in check were eliminated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each prophecy, good or bad, has a seperate part to it that keeps it in balance.  For example, if a prophecy states that you'll stub your toe, there will be a subsection or a clause saying that it's possible a big, white bear might possibly warn you about the rock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why didn't yous?&quot; asked da ogre a little upset.  His toe still hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was just an example.  Besides, it had slipped my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, the goblin, whom you know to be called Smellybreath, found a prophecy that worked to his advantage.  He studied the parts that could stop him from bringing it about and made sure the loose ends were tied up, so to speak.  This is where your family comes in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smellybreath did indeed put a stop to the things that would be his downfall.  Your father, your mother, and... your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash fought some tears back. &quot;Den what can me  do, if Smellybreath took care of everyting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh... well, I think he has overlooked some  important information.  Prophecies were written by not just by ancient prophets, but ancient lawyers too.  The language is always hard to read and understand.  I think it was a mistake to overlook you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am forbidden to tell you some of the more important information, for such knowledge would cause your head to implode.  Sorry, but  it would.  I don't make the rules.  But I am allowed to give you a small bit of the prophecy and point you in the right direction.  You must figure the rest out for yourself.  That is your destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me understand...  me tink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well.  Listen closely Bash, for it shall be spoken only once and once only.  So is the way with prophecy.<br />
<br />
Ancient word, sends a bird<br />
End of world, magic swirled<br />
Born of fire, to rule desire<br />
To make men slaves, or to their graves<br />
Champions four, are good no more<br />
Born of fire, believed a liar<br />
Tricked with fish, a demonic wish<br />
Fueled by hate, will life negate<br />
Fed by deceit, destroyed complete<br />
Born of fire, champion aspire.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is all I can speak of the long prophecy that the goblin uses against this world.  Whether you use it to your advantage or not is up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me no understand it!  What it mean?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell you.  Sorry.&quot; said da big bear as it lowered its head.  It den raised its head once again and looked straight at Bash.  Da bear appeared to have a slight smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, how about we get you some respectable clothes, hmmm?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash stood before two massive, arched, swinging doors interlocked wit each udder.  Da doors were at least fifty feet high.  Dey appeared to be made of da same material as da cavern walls, but dey obviously stood out from da surroundings.  Bash no could feel anyting but awe in front of da huge doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prepare yourself for a sight that few have ever seen... and lived to tell about it.&quot; said da Glacier bear who was standing alongside da ogre.  Da bear padded up to da doors and stuck it's nose on one of da doors.  Both doors began creaking and groaning as da heavy weight of da two structures began shifting and swinging inward.  Da noise from da doors was berry loud and Bash could feel da whole cave floor shaking beneath his feet.<br />
<br />
Bright light spilled in from da opening slit in da middle of da doors.  As da doors opened wider, more light filled da cavern in which Bash stood.  Da ogre had to squint against da luminous white dat spewed forth from da gigantic entrance.<br />
<br />
Da doors eventually came to a halt when dey swung as wide as dey could.  Da whole caves shook violently from da massive slam da doors made against da walls, but da bear seemed unconcerned.  Bash guessed it would take more dan dat to collapse dese caves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me, young ogre.&quot; da bear said solemnly.  It bowed its head and sauntered slowly into da bright room.  Da bear den loudly said, &quot;Miragul!  I will require your assistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da gold-ish skeleton appeared from around a corner behind Bash and ran at full speed into da room behind da bear.  Da two disappeared into da light.<br />
<br />
Bash gripped his hammer tightly in his right hand and used his left arm to shield his eyes from da blinding light.  He den walked in after da bear.<br />
<br />
Once inside, Bash's eyes adjusted quickly.  Da light no seemed as bright in da room.  Da room was da biggest room Bash ever saw.  He no could see da udder end of da room, it was so big.  Everywhere Bash looked, he saw golden objects of all shapes and sizes.  Some floating, some not.  Some with light magically cascading up and down dem, some not.  Dere were armors, swords, axes, shields, moneys, and a big stockpile of toilet paper.<br />
<br />
But da ting dat drew Bash's full attention, da ting dat made his heart skip a beat for some reason, was da big fountain in da middle of all da golden objects.  It was an octagonal shaped pool dat was eighty feet wide wit crystal clear water.  No color.  Just pure transparency.  Out from da middle of da pool sprayed a fountain dat shot at least ninety feet straight up.  <br />
<br />
From each point at da edge of da pool rose a hollow, see-through column.  Eight ramps ran from da middle of da pool down to da columns.  On top of each column was a piece of da most beautiful armor Bash ever saw.  Gauntlets, leggings, boots, yous name it.  Each was da color of when gold kissed silver -- da color of platinum.  Dey hovered each column, spinning ever so slightly.  Da water from da fountain collected into each ramp and it flowed down into each column underneath each armor piece.  Light bounced against da water and appeared to be giving life to da armors.  It was da most beautiful ting Bash ever saw.  It brought a tear to his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see,&quot; said da bear quietly, &quot;There are three columns with some armor pieces missing.  They were gifts to another such as yourself hundreds of years ago.  They have long since been lost.&quot; <br />
<br />
Da bear paused for a moment.  &quot;But that does not mean more cannot be made.  Miragul...&quot;<br />
<br />
Da lich bounded up beside da bear.  Bash heard anudder set of skeleton footprints and turned to see Jakontiklarkiak jog up beside his friend, Miragul.<br />
<br />
Da glacier bear den started to shake himself violently, as if in were drenched wit water.   Tiny, white hairs flew from its beautiful coat.  Da lich waved his hand and dey all floated to da skeleton.  Da skeleton gathered da furball up and den walked over to da fountain.<br />
<br />
Miragul's jaw moved as if it were talking, den it waved its free hand over da pool.  Da pool turned from crystal color to emerald green.  Da room changed color as well, and Bash realized da light was coming from da fountain.  Miragul dropped da bear's fur into da fountain.  <br />
<br />
Da fountain den glowed so brightly dat Bash no could watch.  He shieled his face wit both arms.  A second later, da light faded.  Bash looked up and saw dat hovering atop one of da empty columns was now a platinum helmet wit three horns in a row, from front to back, in da center.<br />
<br />
&quot;These pieces,&quot; said da bear, &quot;Make up the true Totemic Armor.  The true armor of the Pure Shaman.  Few exist today, but one who's heart is true and just may find himself with such a set someday.  You, Bash, are one of those few.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but me is just a fighter.  Me no is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your heart tells me what you are.  You just have not realized it.&quot;  Da bear looked at da fountain and sighed.  &quot;I wish I could give you the breastplate as well.  But, I have not the component I need.  Grizzleknot bark is so hard to come by these days, what with all the friggin' druids.&quot;  Da bear muttered someting under his breath.<br />
<br />
Bash recalled Lilting in Southern Karana.  He remembered grabbing him and pulling from his mouth...<br />
<br />
&quot;Is dis what yous need?&quot; asked Bash as he pulled out a piece  of bark from his make-shift-from-a-shrub shorts.<br />
<br />
Da bear looked at what Bash held.  It den seemed to smile (as much as a bear can look like it can smile) and den said, &quot;Yes!  Throw it in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da fountain changed colors again, dis time to a royal blue.  Da room, again, changed colors as well.  Da bright light appeared once more and den da fountain was back to a crystal white color.  Dis time, a gleaming breastplate was now above anudder column.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; whispered Bash.  &quot;Mr. Bear, uh sir, what about dat last column?  What goes dere?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that?  Well...  hey, you know, your mallet looks a little dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked at his hammer.  It's golden tint glinting brightly in da crystal light from da fountain.  Bash looked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks dirty, Bash.  Dip it into the water to clean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash no wanted to argue wit a bear.  He walked up to da fountain's edge and plunged his hammer into da transparent water.  As he did so, he watched da gold from his hammer melt away in da water.  It washed off as if it were mud.  Bash slowly pulled his bashing mallet out and it now gleamed da same platinum color as da armor.<br />
<br />
Miragul and Jakontiklarkiak applauded enthusiastically wit deir bony hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there you go,&quot; said da bear.  &quot;Now, for the test.  Miragul!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da lich nodded.  It waved its hands and all da armor pieces from da fountain lifted up into da air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not be afraid, young shaman.&quot; said da bear.<br />
<br />
Da armor pieces den came flying straight at Bash.  Bash closed his eyes before da impact hit him.  Nothing happened.  He opened his eyes and found himself covered from head to toe in da beautiful platemail.  He grinned.<br />
<br />
Bash den felt his hammer, his helmet, his breastplate, his pants, everyting, get berry warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not be afraid.  The armor must test you.  It must know your heart to accept you.&quot; said da bear.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
All throughout da underground caverns, an ogre's scream of pain resonated loudly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash stood in da middle of a large, dark room.  Torches hung upon da big stone walls, but still not giving off enough light for da ogre to see much.  In da center of da room was a tiny, circular altar wit weird symbols and runes etched all over.  Da arcane letters gave a small amount of light of deir own, pulsating slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where in da...?!&quot; said da ogre aloud.  His sentence was cut off by someone behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so glad to see you.... my son.&quot; da familiar voice said.  Bash spun around and became face to face wit his father and mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mudder?&quot; asked Bash quietly.  &quot;Fadder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you'd make it!&quot; said Mommy Emgood.  &quot;We knew you were strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we did,&quot; said Daddy Emgood.  &quot;We cannot stay long.  We just wanted to tell you that we love you and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...and that we don't think you should kill another life just to avenge our spirits.&quot; Mommy Emgood finished his father's sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; began Daddy Emgood.  &quot;Forget about the goblin, son.  We're proud of you no matter what you do.  We know you love us.  Please, just leave the goblin alone.  We don't want to lose you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take care, son.&quot; said Mommy Emgood.  &quot;Remember that we love you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash's parents suddenly began to become transparent and den dey disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama!  Dada!&quot; shouted Bash.  Bash let loose some tears quietly and thought about what had just happened.<br />
<br />
Bash became confused.  He spent da last several years of his life waiting to smush dat dumb goblin's head in.  Now his parents come out of nowhere and tell him....<br />
<br />
Atop of a flight of stairs in da room, a door opened.  A lone figure's shadow was seen against da light and den stepped into da room.  Bash recognized who it was instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smellybreath!&quot; whispered da ogre.<br />
<br />
Da goblin no seemed to notice da ogre and stepped onto his altar.   He pointed both hands straight above him and began chanting in a language Bash never heard before.<br />
<br />
Da ogre's face contorted wit rage.  He felt his hammer flare up.  He felt da need to see goblin brains splattered all over da room's walls.<br />
<br />
Bash ran up as fast as he could behind da goblin and quickly raised his hammer to end da miserable ting's life in one blow.  Da goblin heard da ruckus behind him and spun around to see dis massive ogre wit hammer held high above its head.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath couldn't scream.  It just looked at da ogre wit surprise and fear.  Eyes wide open and jaw agape, all he could do was shake his head in a &quot;No! Please!&quot; manner.<br />
<br />
Bash's hammer felt white-hot.  It wanted blood.  It wanted goblin blood.  Da ogre knew it, and wanted it too.  He screamed.  In da middle of his scream, dough, he remembered his parents.<br />
<br />
His hammer made him quickly forget what his parents said and just as quickly reminded him of what happened to dem in da first place, and just who caused it.  Da ogre swung his hammer downwards.<br />
<br />
In dat split second of da hammer's swing, Bash thought again to his parent's wishes.   As his hammer arced down into da perfect curve dat would connect it to Smellybreath's soft head, da ogre pulled wit all his strength to divert its course.  Da hammer just barely missed da goblin and swung wide.  Da force from his swing ripped da hammer out of his hands and sent it flying into da wall.<br />
<br />
Da hammer ripped a hole through da stone and purple light poured into da room from it.  Bash felt da floor begin to shake beneath him, and den saw da whole castle room begin to crumble.  Stones started falling from da ceilings, and da walls collapsed upon demselves.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath, along wit his altar, vanished before da ogre's eyes.  Bash was so confused at dis point, he no thought about his own safety.  Da whole castle began to fizzle, and den pretty much disappear all together.<br />
<br />
Da ogre saw nothing but purple.  He was standing on someting solid, but could no see it.  Da color purple permeated all throughout his surroundings.  Nothing else seemed to exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, Moondoggy!&quot; said a voice from, again, behind da ogre.<br />
<br />
Bash spun around, again, and dis time was face to face wit Papa Smurpheater.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa!&quot;  exclaimed Bash excitedly.  &quot;What in da Hate just happened?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You passed the test, hip cat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What test?&quot; asked Bash confusedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;THE test.  The test the armor had to perform to make sure you were worthy of wearing it!  An evil heart cannot wear such a piece, and it had to know if your heart was filled with nothing but vengeance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me see...&quot; said da ogre, not totally understanding.  &quot;Where is dis place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This?  This is the place few visit other than in dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So da goblin, da castle and.......&quot; Bash began to choke back some tears. &quot;....and me parents...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not real, lovemonkey.  Sorry about that.  It had to feel real to you, or the test wouldn't have been accurate, man.  You're not even here.  Only your mind is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are yous real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better believe it, nature boy!  I'm here, just not physically, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da old ogre pointed to a jar of someting he was holding.  Bash recognized it as da Sacred Peyote.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about what me parents said.... about not smashing dat goblin?  Me not allowed to smash dat dumbhead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, those weren't your real parents.  At least, I'm pretty sure they weren't.   I think you've proven to the armor that you wouldn't kill him if you were told not to.  And since it now knows you're not in this thing only for revenge, I think it's plausible you can beat the crap out of that little bugger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But anyways, Moondoggy, you have to get back.  Your friends are in danger, or will be soon.  The oracle should be able to get you to them.  Take care, my little one.  I love you, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me love yous too, grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash hugged his grandpa tightly and sniffed back some more tears.  Me hope he no cry like baby all throughout story, it embarrassing to write about.  Anyways, he sniffed back some tears and den his world suddenly faded to black.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Smellybreath stood outside on da battlement of his castle, high above da ground.  Da goblin surveyed da surrounding area and let out a sigh of contentment.  All around him thick, grey fog blanketed everyting dat he could see.  But da goblin could see more dan just what his eyes told him.  He felt da surrounding dead trees, he sensed da rocky, black earth beneath da castle, he tasted da setting sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;All will look like this one day,&quot; da goblin said quietly to himself.  &quot;All will be paradise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lousy, good for nothing, Alcoholics Anonymous friends.&quot; muttered da goblin.  &quot;Laughing at me saying my plans for world domination would never happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smellybreath chuckled to himself.  He took in da wonderful, black/grey site once more and den turned around and headed back into his castle.<br />
<br />
Da goblin walked down many stairs until he reached da heart of his home, da underground chamber dat housed his altar.  Da goblin stepped atop it, placed his feet on two particular types of runes, raised his arms up high, closed his eyes, and began chanting.<br />
<br />
Da whole castle started to shake ever so slightly.  So miniscule was da vibration dat most wouldn't notice it.  However, it didn't stop dere.  Da castle began to quake more and more violently wit each passing moment.  It started shaking back and forth so hard, dat torches were flung from deir holsters across da room.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath kept his balance, kept his eyes shut tight, and continually chanted in some acient, arcane tongue.  Da castle was quivering so much now, it was if it were in a giant's grasp and he thought dat da castle was little plastic globe dat 'snowed' when you shook it.<br />
<br />
Just as quickly as it started, da castle's shaking stopped.  All was quiet outside.  Da fog still rolled past, da sun still no gave any light anywhere around.  No birds chirped.  And had one been able to get a good look through da fog, one would see dat da place where Smellybreath's castle used to be on da mountain was now no more dan a huge, empty crater.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But we need to see your chieftain!&quot; demanded Treehugger.  He and da group were outside da barbarian city dat was located in da heart of da icy mountains of Permafrost.  Da barbarians didn't welcome outsiders much.<br />
<br />
Two guards stood outside da city, not allowing da group to pass.  As a rule, barbarians always wear kilts and nothing else.  Da bare chested guards had blue war paint on deir faces, and stood shivering in da snow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnnn...No.  BBBBarbarians only.  NNNnnnn nnnn No one sees Chief except Barbarians.&quot; da guard said as he stood at attention.  His teeth began chattering.  Da udder guard's teeth were locked in a grmaced grit.  Each gaurd's skin was red from being exposed to extreme cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you boys think you should wear a jacket or something?&quot; asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnnnn.... Nnnnnoo!!  Jacket is wwwww...wwwweakness!  BBBBBBarbarians.... strong!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da udder barbarian nodded his headed slightly and quickly.  His mouth never moved and stayed locked in a grimace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah!  Enough of this, lads.&quot; exclaimed Yessir.  &quot;They'll not give us any trouble.  They can barely move.  Follow me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da paladin marched between da two frozen guards.  Da first paladin raised his arm slightly as if to protest, or maybe try to use force, but his arm locked up and became motionless.  Da barbarian just chattered his teeth and shivered while his eyes followed da party as dey walked on by.  His udder guard friend, just stood staring straight ahead, still in his perma-toothy-smile.<br />
<br />
Finding da Chieftain's hut was not hard for da party.  Da barbarians would do deir best to point dem in da wrong direction, but dey was so stupid dey always point in da exact opposite way which da hut was located.  Da group found deir way to da hut wit little problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why for you come to Chief Hardnipple's city?!&quot; shouted a big, angry barbarian man standing in da middle of da hut da party just entered.  Da barbarian was barechested, just as da rest of da males, (to Yessir, Treehugger, and Lilting's disappointment, da females were not topless).  He had blue war paint all over his body, supposedly in articulate designs, but looked like dey was painted on by a toddler.  &quot;Chief Hardnipple is not happy you have come to Chief Hardnipple's city!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought this guy was the Chief?&quot; whispered Lilting to Yessir.  Da paladin just shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is your Chief, good barbarian?  We've an important matter at hand!&quot; said Treehugger forcefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief Hardnipple says you are speaking to Chief Hardnipple!  Chief Hardnipple does not like you being here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger figured it out.  Da chieftain spoke in da third person.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief, please hear us out.  We need your help.  A friend of ours fell into your river of ice and we don't know where he is or how to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief Hardnipple says SILENCE!  Chief Hardnipple does not see you worthy of barbarian acknowledgeme.... acknow.... Well, you know what Chief Hardnipple means.  Chief Hardnipple says you must prove to Chief Hardnipple that your blood is that of a barbarian!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of us?!&quot; asked Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief Hardnipple says, Yes!  All of you!  Chief Hardnipple says that if you....&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief Hardnipple was cut short.   Outside dere came a sound of a gigantic explosion.  Screams broke out from somewhere outside da hut.  Everyone in da Chief's hut looked surprised, including da Chief.  Just den, a big chunk of wood debris came ripping through da hut's roof and landed right next to Lilting.  Da piece of wood was on fire.<br />
<br />
Da party ran outside and saw smoke billowing up from da center of town.  More screams were heard in dat general direction and most were cut unexpectadly short.<br />
<br />
A gigantic ball of flame exploded from somewhere in da center of town, setting more barbarian homes ablaze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Chief Hardnipple is asking what is happening to Chief Hardnipple's village?!&quot; demanded da barbarian chieftain as he stared out at da smoke coming from da center of Halas.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, but we're going to find out!&quot; said Treehugger.  Da ranger turned to da paladin.  &quot;I'll probably die, good knight, so please avenge my death!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yessir brought his fist to his heart.  &quot;Of course, ranger!  I shall avenge thee, those barbarians, and the tiny little microorganisms that were living in the air before they were incinerated!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Micro what?&quot; asked Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind!  Let's go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group charged out of da hut of da barbarian chief.  Lilting stumbled and fell flat on his face while da udders sped away.  Da halfling picked himself up and den began to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spirit wolf come to me, charge my feet; set me free!&quot;<br />
<br />
Blue sparklies formed around da halfling and den he ran twice da speed any halfling ever ran.  He zoomed by da group and raced towards da center of town.<br />
<br />
Lilting could hear da cries of pain, fear, and sorrow as he neared where da smoke originated.  More explosions and gigantic balls of flame erupted.  Da druid rounded da corner and den came to a skidding halt to what he saw.<br />
<br />
Standing amidst a score of charred, barbarian-shaped piles of ash, was da biggest knight da halfling had ever seen.  Standing ten feet high, his armor was da color of pure black.  No light seemed to escape da knights surface.  A horned, full helmet covered da knights face.  In his hand was a huge, glowing claymore sword.  It glowed da color orange.  It glowed da color of fire.<br />
<br />
Da Black Knight was swinging his sword into barbarian homes.  Wood splintered as da sword passed through it and offered no resistance as if da huts were made of paper.  Da places where da sword had passed through began to burn, as if it were a wound dat was somehow infected wit flames.<br />
<br />
What resistance da barbarian warriors put up was easily overcome by da knight.  Slicing peoples in two while deir bodie den set on fire, shooting flames out of his sword, punching udders and sending dem flying, da knight was not slowing down for nobody.<br />
<br />
Da knight den turned and started reigning his carnage in Lilting's direction.  Da halfling was so terrified dat it no could move.  Da knight smashed buildings to da left and right and came closer and closer to da halfling.<br />
<br />
Lilting was rooted in place wit fear.  His eyes were as wide as his mouth as he watched dis walking death draw near.  Da knight came upon da halfling.  To it, da druid was just anudder obstacle.  Da knight raised his sword.<br />
<br />
Just as it was about to strike, a green-brown blur came streaking down from overhead and slammed into da gargantuan knight.  It was Treehugger.  He had tried to drop-kick da knight in mid-air, but even dough da force was enough to take down someone da size of Chief Hardnipple, da ranger fell to da ground as if he had hit a brick wall.  Da knight wasn't even phased, but da ranger had distracted him enough so dat its sword didn't swing at da halfling.<br />
<br />
Medsa dove in and grabbed Lilting by da arm and pulled him to safety.  Yessir charged in and raised his rusty sword and trash-can lid shield.  Treehugger leapt to his feet and pulled both his swords free from deir scabbards.<br />
<br />
Pyra den appeared from behind some smoldering rubble and den proceeded to shoot fireballs into da knight.  Da plan and hope was dat she would distract da big knight long enough for da ranger and paladin to go in for da kill.  It probably would have worked on any udder creature dan dis one.<br />
<br />
Da knight turned its head to see three balls of flame and magma come streaking towards itself.  It immediately went into a crouch wit arms forward and downward.  Even dough no one could see its muscles, everyone was reasonably sure dey were tensing up and flexing.  Da knight den immediately shot  out of his crouch to be upright again and thrust his arms upwards at a criss-cross angle.<br />
<br />
Da air around him became wavy, like da heat rising off a fire.  Da group heard a sizzling sound some small popping sounds.  Treehugger and Yessir had to jump back abruptly from da heat dat was forming.  Pyra realized what was going on.  Da knight was becoming so hot, dat he was burning up da air molecules around him.  Da knight's feet began melting into da ice and stone, and da fireballs rushed on.<br />
<br />
Da balls of flame reached deir target, but da black knight, Fire, had begun to give off so much heat around him dat when da balls of hot goo reached him dey instantly burned to a crisp.   What was glowing hot before, became even hotter and da magma solidified and became nothing more dan harmless, charred carbon.  Da three balls of burnt crispy critters plinked harmlessly off da knight's thick platemail.<br />
<br />
Da group just stared in complete amazement and shock.  And as da heat from da knight slowly began to grow outward, Fire lowered his arms and da air around him stopped sizzling.  Fire pulled its feet free of the liquid lava dey had created and den came for da party.<br />
<br />
Treehugger was da first to meet da knight head-on.  His swords whipping in a figure-eight pattern, following one another, he came at da knight wit battle finesse.  Da ranger den stuck his arms out and sliced at da knight from both sides by bringing dem back together.  Fire just stood there.<br />
<br />
Da half-elf's swords struck da knight, but da knight's armor was still so hot dat each blade just melted as dey collided wit da knight.  Da swords melted down to just a couple inches from da hilt.  Treehugger was not expecting to be no resistance from his swings, and was thrown off balance.<br />
<br />
Fire raised its left fisted gauntlet and den punched da ranger right in da face.  Da force snapped his head back and sent his body flying.  He was brought to a sudden stop by his head colliding wit a stone, barbarian house.  Da ranger fell to da ground limply, and was immediately knocked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilting!&quot; shouted Sir Yessir.  &quot;The snow!  Cool him down!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da druid shook himself to try to get rid of da fear, panic, and awe.  He began casting a spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cold snow, here we go.  Come to me and put on your show!&quot;<br />
<br />
Large piles of snow were lifted off da ground and den were sent flying into da knight.  Hissing and steam came from da black knight and da snow was instantly turned to water.  Dis did not slow da knight down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taste holy might, foul beast!&quot; shouted Sir Yessir.  Da paladin charged da knight.  He swung his sword at da knight and it just bounced harmlessly off Fire's armor.  Yessir den brought up his right foot to kick da knight as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
Fire caught the foot in his left hand.  Almost as quick as anyone could blink, da knight brought up its sword and swung it downwards.<br />
<br />
Yessir let out da loudest scream any one of dem ever heard.  It was a scream of pain.  Six inches below his right knee where his calf and foot once were, was now just a stump.  Da knight's sword cauterized da wound instantly as it went through.  Da paladin's foot fell to da ground.<br />
<br />
Fire shoved da knight and Yessir went flying like a rag doll and landed in a snow bank.  Da knight den looked up at da rest of da group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fire came towards da group while dey just looked at him wit deir moths and eyes wide open.  None of dem could move.  None of dem believed dat moving from da knight would help dem anyway.<br />
<br />
Da black Guardian moved closer and closer to da party, wit sword glowing brighter dan ever.  Da knight reached Medsa first.  Fire raised its sword arm to do da killing blow to da caleric.  Da high elf just bowed her head and closed her eyes in sorrow dat she could do nothing for her friends and wished dem all a quick death.<br />
<br />
A sound made da knight pause in confusion.  It was a voice, and it came from behind da Guardian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...  Dumbhead!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da Elemental Guardian lowered its arm and turned at da sound.  Medsa opened her eyes and watched da knight turn around at dis new sound.  She no could see over da knight, but she did catch a glimpse of a huge, huge hammer twirling quickly, stopping, and den swinging fast to connect wit da knight's helmet.<br />
<br />
A loud *CLANG!* resulted, and da knight was hit so hard dat it spun in place.  It stopped and doubled over onto  one knee.<br />
<br />
Dere, standing behind da knight, was an ogre.  Clad in an armor dat looked like it was dipped in pure platinum, he held aloft his shiny matching hammer, ready to smash it into da knight again.  Da group recognized dis new savior.  It was...<br />
<br />
&quot;BASH!&quot; shouted Lilting.  &quot;You're alive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!  But dis guy no is for long!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da black knight quickly shook its head violently to remove da stun from da hammer.  It got back to its feet quickly.  Standing upright, da Guardian was easily da same size as da ogre.<br />
<br />
It looked at Bash and ****ed its head as if confused slightly.  Instead of making an attack, it immediately went for someting in its black belt.  <br />
<br />
Bash watched wit curiosity as da knight rapidly sheathed it's sword and pulled out a small, gleaming black stone wit a white rune on it.  He watched da knight trace his left index finger from da bottom to da top of da symbol, making sure to follow every line and curve.<br />
<br />
Da knight den vanished in front of dem all in some sort of dimensional gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don't come back!&quot; said da ogre.<br />
<br />
Medsa, Pyra, and Lilting rushed da big ogre.  Dey all each hugged da big ogre (one on each leg, while Lilting hugged a knee cap).  Tears were streaming down everyone's face.  All was quiet except for da loud snort-sobbing of Lilting.<br />
<br />
All was quiet until a roar of cheering erupted from da many hiding barbarians who witnessed Bash getting rid of da terror dat ruined half deir town.  Barbarians came from all over da place to slap da ogre on da back and continued to cheer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What going on?&quot; asked Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;That knight you killed destroyed their town!&quot; said Medsa.   &quot;He also.... he also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He hurt Treehugger and Yessir.&quot; Pyra said solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is dem?  Can we help dem?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can probably heal their wounds, but I'm afraid... I'm afraid I can't do anything for Yessir's leg.&quot; Medsa told da ogre.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to his...&quot; da ogre began but was cut off.  He saw Sir Yessir hopping on one foot.  Half of da paladin's right calf had been lopped off below da knee.  Interestingly  enough, da noble knight didn't seem too upset by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that fellow,&quot; said Sir Yessir, &quot;Was the second meanest fellow I've ever met!&quot;  Da knight muttered someting about da first being some dumbhead dark elf named Giz or Gix or someting.<br />
<br />
A scream of pain and ultimate suffering rose up among da noisy barbarians.  Out of some rubble stumbled Treehugger.  Da ranger held his swords, well, what were formally his swords, in his two hands.  Dey had been melted into nothing more dan hilts.  Da ranger wailed as if he had just lost all of his family in an explosion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Us need to get Yessir fixed up.&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Who here can help us wit dat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm betting that big Chief Hardnipple can!&quot; said Lilting excitedly.<br />
<br />
Da ranger wailed some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den,&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Let's go see him.  Where he at?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group went back to da chieftain's hut, wit Yessir hopping behind and Treehugger walking slightly slower crying and pouting and wailing all da way.  Da biggest line of barbarians hooted and hollered behind dem as dey followed dis great party toward's deir tribal chief's home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Chief Hardnipple is saying thank you for saving Chief Hardnipple's city!&quot; said a very grateful chieftain to da group standing before him.  Dey was standing in da chief's berry large hut.  Da barbarians was uncomfortable being around da big ogre, and Bash mutually shared dat feeling, but da big humans knew well enough just who had saved deir snow covered town.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Hardnipple, sir, I have a question.&quot; stated a concerned Sir Yessir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief Hardnipple is saying ask what you wish of Chief Hardnipple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about my leg, Mr. Hardnipple.  Might I be able to get something to stand on?&quot; da paladin asked his question while hopping on his good foot to keep balance.<br />
<br />
Da chief looked at one of da barbarians standing right next to him and nodded.  Da barbarian was off and running out of da hut.  &quot;Chief Hardnipple will be taking care of that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash wondered what da chief was up to to help his friend.  Da ogre soon realized a sound was coming from behind him.  It got louder and udder peoples in da room noticed it too.<br />
<br />
It was sound of crying and phlegm being snorted back at da same time.  Bash stepped aside and dere was Treehugger clutching his melted swords to his chest.<br />
<br />
Chief Hardnipple frowned in confusion at da ranger.  Medsa just shook her head and sighed.  &quot;You big baby!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Treehugger just looked at her, looked at his swords again, and just started wailing even louder dan before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you do anything to shut him up?&quot; Pyra asked looking up to da chieftain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief Hardnipple would do anything to get wussy human elf to zip lip!  But Chief Hardnipple is not sure what Chief Hardnipple can.... wait.  Chief Hardnipple may have an idea.&quot;  Da chief looked at anudder barbarian standing next to him and nodded.  Den dat barbarian bolted out of da hut at da same speed da first one ran.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, since you have saved Chief Hardnipple's village, by barbarian law you must each marry one of Chief Hardnipple's daughters or sons by tomorrow morning!  If you don't Chief Hardnipple will see it as an insult and comdemn you to death!&quot;<br />
<br />
Each one of Bash's group got a real uncomfortable look on deir faces.  Lilting began to squirm uneasily.  Bash frowned.  Pyra got sick.<br />
<br />
Da chief had a straight face, but den started to snicker.  Den he and his barbarian friends burst out laughing.  Dey laughed REALLY loud.  &quot;Chief Hardnipple is saying he is joking!  Chief Hardnipple says you should have seen the looks on your faces!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da whole group heaved a sigh of relief.  Da laughter died down as da two barbarians da chief had sent away came back wit blankets under each of deir arms.  Da blankets were obvioulsy each wrapped around someting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, here are Chief Hardnipple's loyal subjects!  Let us and  Chief Hardnipple be seeing what they have, shall we and Chief Hardnipple?&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Dark fog.  Dat was all dat surrounded dat black castle.  It slowly moved around da castle, seemingly penetrating da black stone like it didn't exist.  Da only sound heard was violent screaming coming from somewhere inside da structure.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAAAAT!!?!?!?!?&quot; screamed Smellybreath to da big, black knight, Fire.  &quot;Are you SURE you saw what you saw?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da Elemental Guardian slowly nodded its horned, helmeted head.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath turned away from da knight and began to think aloud to himself.  Da goblin tapped his tiny green fingers together methodically.<br />
<br />
&quot;An ogre in True Totemic?  That in of itself is a bad sign.  But even worse it's an Emgood.  I was hoping that the ogre with the party was just your average, stupid ogre.  But noooo, that never happens!  Do I ever get my way?  Do I?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A bird flew past da window on da wall da goblin was facing.  Smellybreath instantly pointed and shot a magical beam of energy at it.  Da bird was instantly fried in magical fire and den floated to da goblin's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get my way this time,&quot; da goblin said as he bit da head off of da bird.  &quot;Oh, I will indeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da goblin spun around to face da big knight.  &quot;It is time.  Begin phase two of my plan!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da black knight nodded, banged its fist against its breastplate's chest, and den pulled out da teleport stone it carried.<br />
<br />
Da knight was gone moments later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Da sun was high in da sky and shone down brightly on da Northern Plains of Karana.  Bash's armor glinted and reflected da light all over da place.  Da ogre was a sight to behold!  Local residents and bandits alike had to stop to watch da strange and curious vision go by.<br />
<br />
Da ogre was not da only odd ting.  Behind him marched a funny erduite wizardess who kept shooting small balls of flame at da woodland creatures as dey passed.  Behind her zipped a hyperactive halfling dat kept running circles around an annoyed looking high-elf.  Behind her trailed two more peoples, one a scruffy old paladin wit a wooden stump in da shape of a boot on one leg who made squeaky noises as he walked; and da udder was a ranger who's eyes were wide open and had a smile like a little kid wit a new toy, for he had two shiny shortswords in each hand and was twirling dem by da hilt in huge circles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you stop that?!&quot; blurted Medsa almost screaming at Lilting.  She gave da halfling a look dat would have made fire turn to ice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't help it!&quot; said da halfling.  &quot;I'm just too happy!  Too happy!  Too happy I am!  Bash is back!  Woo hoo!  Bash is....&quot;  Lilting found dat his feet were somehow rooted to da ground and he no could move anymore.  He saw magical sparklies fade from Medsa's hand.  &quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you,&quot; said Medsa looking back at Treehugger, &quot;Will you stop with the whirling and twirling already?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't help it!&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;These swords are just so cool!  They're lightweight, yet stronger than anything I've ever held!  And look!  Look!  See that?  On each blade there is a barbarian warrior locked in battle with a monster etched on the metal!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know!  I've seen it!&quot; exclaimed Medsa who apparently was a bit high strung.  &quot;You've only been showing us for the past two days!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know.  I just like it when you get mad though.  Your face gets flushed and your eyes get wide so it makes it easier to see how pretty and brown they are.&quot;  Da ranger winked at da cleric.<br />
<br />
Medsa just sneered at da half-elf and faced forward away from him.  She wouldn't let him see it, but she was blushing and trying her best to keep her lips from curling into a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye know,&quot; said Sir Yessir not really paying attention to anything, &quot;This wooden boot actually is better than my real foot!  It's not nearly as painful to walk on.  There's no arthritis, corns, athletes foot, and this weird green fungus that burned.  I think I like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da whole party shuddered wit revulsion at da mental image da paladin just gave dem.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where are we headed, Bash?&quot; asked Pyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freeport.  Da oracle told me of a hermit dat lives out on an island in da ocean dat may have some information to where we need to go to find Smellybreath.  And since Freeport has da only boats dat can sail out into da ocean, well, me guessin' us gonna have to go back dere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guuuuuuys!&quot; a faint voice shouted dat sounded not too dissimilar from Lilting.  &quot;Wait up!  Come on!  I can't move!&quot;  Da halfling's feet finally came free and he ran as fast as his tiny legs could to catch up.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Smellybreath sat on his throne tapping his fingers on one of da armrests.  Da goblin could feel their presence and waited patiently for dem to come.  How dey got here, he didn't know.  But he was confident dat dey would not stay long.  Da goblin thought to himself, &quot;Here they come.  Three.... two.... one...&quot;<br />
<br />
Da door to da goblin's inner room where his throne and altar was blew apart from some magical force.  In poured dozens of peoples all wit berry shiny armors and all carrying weapons dat had sparklies running up and down dem, or swords made of fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail a Smellybreath Goblin!&quot; said da person at da front of da group.  He did not look too happy to see Smellybreath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will ask you this once and only once,&quot; said da goblin.  &quot;How did you get in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?  How?!  What do you mean, how?!  I am Uber Boober, guild leader of the Flames of Heaven&amp;#153!  We can do anything and go anywhere!  We are always the first to do so!  Our &quot;ShowDToT&quot; Linux users have told us that you are a new spawn in this world and are very high level.  We have come to destroy you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You all must be powerful indeed if you come here boasting to kill me without even the slightest hint of fear amongst any of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have spent our entire lives becoming powerful!  We're all just nerds who have nothing better to do with our time other than focus it all into fighting big stuff like you and getting cool weapons and armor!  We are betting you drop some nice phat l00t, so therefore you must die!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think that I will give you something that will help you rule the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not!  In fact, we'll probably just sell what we find on your carcass for about 100,000 platinum pieces!  We just want to be the first to get it, have the picture of it up on the &quot;internet&quot; and have everyone else bow down before us because of our awesome power!  So prepare to die!&quot;<br />
<br />
Smellybreath yawned.  &quot;I grow tired of this.  Since you are all so powerful, you probably will be the only ones to ever figure out how to reach my castle.  This makes me much more happy.  It was nice knowing you, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da goblin outstretched his hands and shot forth a red lightning bolt.  It arced through Uber Boober and den spread out shooting through everyone else in da Flames of Heaven&amp;#153 guild.  An instant later, everyone in da guild was shrunken down to about an inch high.  Da goblin waved his hands again and all da guild members floated up into da air and was pulled towards da goblin.  Da goblin held out a bowl and everyone was deposited inside.<br />
<br />
Smellybreath looked down at all da tiny peoples in da bowl in his lap.  &quot;You guys like being the first of everything, eh?  Well, here's something you may like.  You will be the first of the races to see what my stomach looks like from the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da goblin grabbed a handful of peoples and den shoved dem into his mouth like popcorn.  Smellybreath chewed a little bit, swallowed, dan den spit out some tiny, tiny breastplates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, let's see how my Fire Elemental Guardian is doing.&quot;  Da goblin waved his hand in an arc and in da air in front of him came da image of Fire standing in front of a big lake.  &quot;Good, good.  He's progressing nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smellybreath grabbed another handful of peoples and den sat back to watch da show.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fire stood at da edge of da Lake of Ill Omen, facing da body of water.  Orange claymore blazing in da knight's right hand,  Fire stood quietly waiting for someting.  Behind da Elemental Guardian were several hundred goblins glanced nervously about.  It was obvious dey no wanted to be dere, but none of dem seemed to attempt to leave for some reason.<br />
<br />
Fire raised it's sword high into da air for all da goblins to see, and den with a quick motion, slammed da blade into da lake water.  Da sword glowed even brighter dan before and a massive hiss was heard for many kilometers as steam started to rise from da lake.  A giant cloud of white steam began to pour straight up from da water itself, and da lake rapidly began to drain.<br />
<br />
As da lake became nearly empty, one could see many, many halfling druid &quot;farmers&quot; scatter in  multiple directions like roaches under a light.  Da water was soon no more and all dat was left were several hundred Bloodgill Goblins staring back at da knight whom had just been spending deir entire lives living underwater.  Da knight pointed at dem, and motioned dem to follow in a not-too nice way.  Da goblins not wanting to anger such a ting dat could destroy a lake so easily reluctantly marched on after da knight.<br />
<br />
Fire turned and headed eastward to da Sarnak fort.  Goblins of all sizes marched on after deir new leader, some obviously exicted about what da Guardian had just done.  It was only a matter of time before Fire emerged from da fort holding da Sarnak King by da scruff of his neck.  Da king looked like all Sarnak, in dat he was a brown lizard-man like creature wit a beak dat looked like a vulture's.  Da king hissed at da knight, but da knight silenced him by grabbing da Sarnak's tongue and sliced it off.  Da king wailed in pain and da knight ordered him to follow.  Da king went from an angry to a submissive posture and den motioned to all his Sarnak followers in da area to follow where da knight lead.<br />
<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<br />
After a few sleep-deprived nights (Lilting found a sugar cane plant and ate it.  Da halfling had such a buzz dat he no would settle down for two days), da party reached West Commons.  Da open, grassy field shone brightly in da mid-morning sun.  Dey were almost at deir destination:  Freeport.  As dey walked on, some of da group were engaged in casual conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me, good paladin, just what entails in killing a dragon?&quot; Treehugger asked Sir Yessir out of curiosity.  Da group overhearing da ranger's question quieted down and listened intently to hear what da old knight had to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's a good question, my boy!  Dragons are tricky, evil creatures.  I have dispatched many, but I would have to say that the most common way of dispatching them is by slicing them in half!  Sccchhhhhht!  Nice and clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger puzzled at da thought of dat.  &quot;How do you accomplish that?!  Do you set up some great elaborate trap, with a gigantic metal blade, that the dragon stumbles upon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear me, no!  That would take too much time!  No, I generally run the dragon down on foot, find it, raise my sword and strike!  They will usually be cut in half in one or two swings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash gave a questioning look to Pyra.  Lilting gave da same look to Medsa.  Treehugger's eyebrows furrowed downward in complete confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, my boy, if I can find a dragon nearby I will show you!&quot;  Yessir was off searching some nearby shurbbery.  Da whole group stopped to watch dis strange, puzzling sight.  Trehugger turned around to face da group and raised his eyebrows as if to ask, &quot;What da Hate?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A shout of triumph sounded out from da paladin as he was bent over in one of da bushes.  &quot;Ah ha!  I found one!  Taste, Holy Steel, dragon!!&quot;  Out scurried a tiny gecko lizard.  It ran for its life as da paladin chased it down.  It was a sight indeed as da lizard peddled away from da big, clunky, squeaky old man.  Da old man was quick dough, and caught up to da lizard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your vile taint will poison this land no more, dragon!&quot; shouted da knight as he lifted his sword high into da air.  Yessir slammed his sword downward and sliced da poor, tiny lizard in half.  He den raised both arms into da air and shouted as loud as he could, &quot;Victory!  Victory for the Holy Order!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash was completely stunned at what he just saw.  Da big ogre just got a really bad feeling about dis whole mission.  &quot;Who found dis guy again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da udders in da group said in unison, &quot;Lilting!&quot; and each of dem turned deir heads towards da halfling.  Yessir was too far away and busy praying to da gods he believed in to notce what was going on.  Lilting's eyes shifted left and right quickly and began wringing his hands in nervousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh.....&quot; stammered da halfling.  &quot;I... I listened to him!  He sounded like he was a real dragonslayer to me!  I just... I just wanted to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have known,&quot; said Medsa.  &quot;The man has 'crazy' written all over him!  Now what do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dere not much us can do.  Me said he could come, and me word is final.  Us will just have to take care dat he no gets us killed!  Maybe us can find some nice temple dat will take care of him on our journey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da paladin squeakily approached everyone.  &quot;Well, what did you think of that display of bravery?  I don't see as many dragons as I used to, so my blood is pumping a lot harder than it used to!  There is no rush like there is dragon hunting!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh.... yeah.&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;That was... that was great!  You sure are the best 'dragonslayer' we've ever seen.  Right guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone slowly nodded with raised eyebrows and grimaces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; said Yessir, &quot;let's get moving!  We should try to get to Freeport before the sun sets!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
<br />
As dey trodded on through da grass fields of West Commons, da group saw some interesting tings.  One odd sight was a small band of dark elf adventurers attempting to fight a big, nasty Hill Giant.  Da group was no doing so good.  Da adventurers tried furiously to hack away at da giant's shins, but da giant no seemed too pleased about dis.<br />
<br />
Da giant eventually picked one of dem up, and hurled him as far as it could.  Da adventurer disappeared into da horizon.  Da giant c0cked* its foot back and booted da remaining elves.  Da dark elves went flying in various directions, but all were sent soaring away at a tremendous speed.  Da giant just laughed and den jogged away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was entertaining!&quot; said Treehugger aloud.  &quot;Stupid, no-good dark elves!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den dey heard a cry for help off into a small cove of trees.  Da group ran over and saw dat many trees were knocked over, most likely from da giant.  Da cry for help came from a very well-dressed dark elf standing near a felled log.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, good adventurers!&quot; pleaded da dark elf.  &quot;Will you please help me?  Neriak's Royal Prince is trapped under this log!  He will surely die if you do not save him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let the guy rot, I say!&quot; said Treehugger.<br />
<br />
Bash wasn't so sure.  His grandpa told him to help everyone.  Even someting inside him told him dat leaving anyone to die is not befitting a shaman.  Bash almost swore it was his armor telling him dat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, us will help.  Lilting, please help me.  Cast a levitate spell on dat log so dat me can lift it easire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da halfling sighed and began casting his spell.  Bash sidled up to da log and began lifting it.  Da ogre could hear faint muttering underneath da log.  Lilting's spell kicked in and da ogre heaved da heavy log over his head.  He den tossed it to da side.<br />
<br />
Underneath was a dark elf clad in colorful silk robes.  It stood up and began speaking in a strange tongue non of da group could understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;tH4/\/kS, Sux0R!&quot; said da dark elf.  &quot;j00 r /\/0t 2 b3 0w/\/3d t0d4y!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hate did he just say?&quot; asked Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive his highness,&quot; said da first dark elf.  &quot;He, like most of our kind, only speaks Tier'Dal, which is dark elven to you.  The only Tier'Dal, dark elves, who speak common are Court Advisors and Ambassadors.  I am the prince's court advisor.  The prince wishes to royally thank you for saving his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, dat sound good!  Me glad us could help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;s|-|ut uP, 1D10t!&quot; said da prince.  &quot;pH33r /\/\y l33t h4X0r \/\/r4th!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The prince wishes to extend his gratitude some more and says that if you ever visit Neriak you would be welcomed guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da prince den turned to Medsa and began speaking.  &quot;|-|3y b4By!  u l00k |-|0t!  u w4/\/t 2 cyb3R?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm, the prince wishes to tell the lady that she looks exceptionally radiant this morning and that he is honored to be in the presence of such beauty,&quot; da court advisor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thank you good sir!&quot; said Medsa with a blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;w00t!  4 w|-|0r3!&quot; said da prince.<br />
<br />
Treehugger didn't look to happy about someone else giving her compliments.  &quot;Well, let's get going guys.  We're glad we could help you.... elves out.  Let's get to Freeport before the sun sets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group set off towards da east and towards Freeport.  Da two dark elves got up and headed north-westward back to da kingdom of Neriak.<br />
<br />
&quot;0w/\/3D!&quot; shouted da prince.<br />
<br />
*(Had to change word because swear filter no like word &quot;c_cked&quot; even dough it not naughty.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Smoke rose from da still smoldering rubbled buildings and collected high in da sky.  Da once beautiful city had been decimated by some unknown force.  Rock walls dat &quot;protected&quot; da city were stained black from some obvious recent fires and in udder places were completely blown apart.  It had been just fine when Bash last left it, but now da city of Freeport was nothing more dan a wasteland.<br />
<br />
Bash stood on da hill just outside da city gate and no could believe his own ogre eyes.  Humans were cleaning up as best dey could, but it was apparent dey had been doing so for days.  Even bodies still littered da ground and da people were still trying to take care of dem and get dem to a proper burial ground.  Many peoples were on deir knees wailing and sobbing, probably for da loss of a home, loved one, or both, da ogre thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; whispered Lilting.  &quot;What happened here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me not sure,&quot; said Bash.  &quot;But me have pretty good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our friend from Halas?&quot; asked Treehugger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat is what me is tinkin'&quot; Bash said solemnly in a low tone of voice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I've been meanin' to ask ye,&quot; said Sir Yessir.  &quot;Just what do ye think that thing was and what was it doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me have no clue.  But me would bet all me shares of stock in eqBay dat Smellybreath is behind it all.  Just what he is doing, well, dat is what us is trying to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash looked upon da wreckage of da city and all human children who is now without a mommy or a daddy.  Just like him.  All dis because of da evilness of one hateful goblin wizard.  Bash swore to himself once again dat he will kill Smellybreath or die trying.  And once again, he thought he felt his hammer flare to life for an instant just as the vow entered his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; said da ogre breaking out of his train of thought.  &quot;Let's go see if us can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group descended da hill overlooking da city and headed toward da now destroyed city gates.  Da grass on da hill was untouched by da fires dat had ravaged Freeport, but Bash noticed someting a little odd about all da surrounding shrubbery.  Da ogre got an uneasy feeling, and den his hammer flared to life.<br />
<br />
Out from da surrounding bushes jumped several creatures.  Da party was quickly surrounded by orcs, gnolls, goblins, and lizardmen.  Dere was about eighteen of da bad guys, overall.  Da party, mostly taken by surprise, jumped back.<br />
<br />
Treehugger's newly acquired swords instantly appeared in each hand as he pulled dem free from deir scabbards.  Yessir's rusty sword came loose from wherever da paladin kept it.  Bash, one step ahead of everyone was already in a defensive crouch.  And Lilting pulled out his tiny, tiny, oh-so tiny small dagger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrackkk hrggeakkk hockkrakkk!!!&quot; said one of da bigger lizardmen.  &quot;Horkk Wracckkk!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me no can understand yous, lizard!&quot; said Bash angrily.  &quot;But me bet what yous said is not good!  Us will fight yous!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da lizard made some more sounds.  &quot;Hrackk... Mrmmpph....  HRACKKK!!!&quot; and den spit a big wad of lizard loogie on da ground.  &quot;Ahhhh!  Much better!  Stupid piece of phlegm has been bothering me since we left Cazic Thule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lizardmen can talk?&quot; Lilting whispered to Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me guess.  Dey only tell Bash about how us ogres ruined our own lands dough.  Not much else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anywaaaay...&quot; continued da lizard.  &quot;Me and the guys here were told to take you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Preposterous!&quot; snorted Sir Yessir.  &quot;I do not date lizardmen or gnolls or any of the others there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa whoa whoa!  You misunderstand me!  I mean we were told to kill you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; said da paladin.  &quot;That's a relief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not gay!&quot; said da lizardman quickly.  Maybe too quickly.  &quot;Anyways, enough chit-chat.  Let's get 'em, boys!&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of da monsters had weapons, some didn't.  Da ones witout weapons probably no needed dem because of da claws and teeth dey had.  Already surrounding da party, dey slowly moved in closer.  Den, in da blink of an eye, dey all charged in.<br />
<br />
Da party did deir best to try and stay alive as dey were overwhelmed wit furry and scaly bodies.  Treehugger was da first to get a kill when he stuck out one of his swords and impaled a gnoll, flipped it over his head slamming it into da ground, and den swinging his udder sword overhand to decapitate it.<br />
<br />
Yessir was right behind.  Fending off a mace-wielding orc with his sword and using his trash-can lid shield to block da blows of a goblin wielding a flail.  Doing his best, da paladin seemed to be a little overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
Lilting was having worse luck.  He had to run, dodge, and duck blows dat were aimed to kill him.  He wanted to fight back, but da most it seemed he could do was scream like a little girl.  Eventually one of da orcs picked him up and tossed it to a lizardman.  Dey started playing &quot;catch&quot; wit da halfling.<br />
<br />
Medsa pretty much hid behind Pyra.  Not having offensive power of her own, she preferred having da protection and &quot;firepower&quot; of dis one-woman flame thrower.  And even dough pyra was having a little bit of trouble, da monsters facing her approached wit caution once she set a gnoll's fur completely on fire.<br />
<br />
Bash, on da udder hand, just stood dere.  Four or five monsters had come to melee range and started whacking away at da big ogre.  Since none of dem could reach higher dan his knee, and because he was well protected by his new armor, da ogre felt nothing.  He just yawned as he heard da *ting* *ting* *ting ting* sounds of da creatures below.  Bash lifted up a foot and squashed one of da orcs.  Den a hammer came down and smashed anudder.<br />
<br />
Da fight raged on, and even dough it was an uneven fight, our happy group seemed to be doing pretty well.  Treehugger got into a bit of a scrape with three orcs at once and kept getting sliced up here and dere.  But Medsa was right behind him healing him.  &quot;'Ow! 'You're healed.' 'Ow!' 'You're healed.'&quot; could be heard over and over in dat corner of da fight.<br />
<br />
Yessir did a decent job of holding his own.  Da paladin found it was really fun to kick da crud (literally) out of goblins wit his new wooden foot.  He was doing it quite often until da foot popped off and flew right into a goblin's face.  Da paladin didn't let it get to him.  He just dropped his shield, picked up his foot in front of da stunned goblin, and began &quot;dual wielding&quot; both his sword and  his wooden boot while hopping on one leg.  Amazingly enough, he killed more goblins quicker dis way.<br />
<br />
Pyra kept sending out bits of fire to anyting dat came near.  Cackling wit glee whenever she set one of da creatures on fire, she saw dat few tings actually tried to get close to her.<br />
<br />
Lilting eventually found his way to da ground.  Da druid cast some sort of spell dat slammed a gust of wind into his two assailants and knocked dem back on either side of him.  Dey both came running back.  Da halfling shrieked and hurriedly cast Spirit of Wolf on both monsters.  Da orc and lizard started running twice as fast as before and da halfling dodged out of da way.  Da two bad guys slammed into each udder hard and knocked da udder out cold.<br />
<br />
Bash was having an easy time stomping and smashing anyting dat came near.  Not much more needed to be said about him udder dan he was kicking serious butt.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to make a long story short, or a short fight long, or whatever, da group eventually killed everyting.  Dey found da first big lizard on da ground wounded from someone's sword.<br />
<br />
Bash stood over da lizard wit hammer poised.  &quot;Any last words?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da lizard looked up at da ogre and nodded, and den shifted his eyes over to da paladin.  &quot;I'm not gay!!&quot; it shouted.<br />
<br />
Bash's hammer came down and covered da grassy hill wit lizard splat.  Da group cleaned demselves up quickly and den hurriedly headed back in da direction of Freeport.<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd,&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;Gnolls, orcs, goblins, and lizardmen all hate each other with a passion.  Why were they working together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me don't know.&quot; Said da ogre.  &quot;But me is gonna find out.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;This all happened about a week ago,&quot; said Mayor Fuzzywuzzy, da bald mayor of Freeport.  &quot;Yes, about a week ago from today.  It was terrible!  Just a big black guy with this big nasty orange sword!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was before we met that guy in Halas,&quot; said Lilting to Bash.<br />
<br />
Da group was standing in what used to be da Council Hall of Freeport, but da ceiling had been blown off, da walls mostly reduced to tiny pebbles, and da floor marred wit black burn marks.  Da mayor was explaining what happened as best as he could remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such terrible destruction of my once beautiful home town!&quot; said Sir Yessir angrily wit a raised fist.  &quot;Only a dragon is capable of such razing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da mayor rolled his eyes and sighed.  He obviously knew da knight.  &quot;I just got done telling you what caused the damage!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A dragon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da paladin began muttering &quot;Still, I bet a dragon is somehow responsible.&quot;  Yessir den began speaking louder again, &quot;I will not rest until I have slain the dragon behind this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone just moaned in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, look.&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Us is sorry dat dis happened to yous city, and us is on a quest to make sure it will never happen again to anyone.  But us need to get to get out to an island in da Ocean of Tears.  Do yous know of a way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.  A quest, huh?  Just make sure you don't take a lot of faction hits.  And, oooh oooh!  Make sure you hand in the items one at a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hate is he talking about?&quot; whispered Treehugger to Medsa.  Da cleric shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, all of the ships that we had docked here were incinerated by that... thing.&quot; da mayor said.  &quot;And the only  few ships we have left aren't due back for several weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da whole group looked disheartened.  Dey were so close to getting da answers dey needed.  Mayor Fuzzywuzzy rubbed his stubble-less chin in deep thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmm....&quot; da Mayor said while concentrating his gaze towards da ocean.  &quot;There might be a way.  It won't be pleasant though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us journeys have no exactly been all-yous-can-eat halfling buffet,&quot; said Bash.  Lilting winced.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Da group stood outside a berry run-down wooden shack dat was barely standing.  If yous could even call it a shack anymore, it looked more like a pile of rotted logs.  It looked like da sightest breeze would have toppled it over.  Da shack was down da shore a little ways from da main docks of Freeport.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man,&quot; said Lilting.  &quot;It looks like this house took the worst of the attack of that black knight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said da Mayor, &quot;This cabin was out of the range of the attack.  This is how it always looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pyra frowned.  Everyone else felt da same way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, the man in here may be able to help you guys.  He's a very, very old sea captain.  His ways are a little unorthodox, but he's your only ticket to the ocean other than a very long swim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to Bash!&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Us will gladly take all da help us can get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; Fuzzywuzzy said.  &quot;I just had to give you warning.  He's a little... odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain!&quot; da mayor shouted.  &quot;Captain, I say, Captain are you in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
No sound came from da shack.  Da whole group waited for several minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he's not...&quot; da halfling began but was cut off by a shout from inside da cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  Who be out there?  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is I, Mayor Fuzzywuzzy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  The one with no hair?  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da mayor looked downward, almost in shame.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he shouted.  &quot;The very same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  It be a long time!  I be comin' out then to come greet ye!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok guys,&quot; da mayor said quietly to da group.  &quot;This man is very old and has seen a lot of sea action in his day.  Try not to laugh at his appearance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded silently.  From inside da cabin some loud noises came.  Dey were berry loud *CLUNK*s.  *CLUNK*  *CLUNK*  *CLUNK* da noises got louder and louder until da cabin door opened.<br />
<br />
Standing in da doorway was a berry, berry old man.  Older dan Sir Yessir.  Dough da captain was berry old, he still was a massive figure of a man.  Towering over all but Bash, he was still a pretty muscular fellow.  <br />
<br />
Some old sea captains had a wooden peg-leg.  Dis captain didn't have one, he had two.  One on each leg.  Not only dat, but he had peg-arms as well.  Attached at each elbow where an arm used to be was a &quot;peg&quot; dat looked like da ones on his legs.  Da captain had one of dose &quot;funny pirate hats&quot; as well, and underneath his hat he wore not one, but two eyepatches -- one over each eye.  Everyone but da mayor had deir jaws and eyes wide open at da sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said da captain.  &quot;It be good hearin' from ye again, Mayor!  What is it ye be needin' from me this fine sailing day?  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain,&quot; said da mayor, &quot;These fine folk are needing the best sea captain and his crew to take them out to the Ocean of Tears.  Since you're the best, I naturally would have no one else even dream of the task!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; whispered Lilting to da mayor.  &quot;He's the best sailor in all of Freeport?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; whispered da mayor.  &quot;He's probably one of the worst.  But he doesn't need to know that.  But he's the only one left and he doesn't like thinking he's second to anyone. Remember that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting felt sick to his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  That be very kind of ye, Mayor!  I be flattered a landlubber such as ye think so highly as a scurvy dog such as meself!  Arrrgh!  I laugh at the face of danger!  I be sure I be suited to the task ye require.  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you get your crew ready to sail before dawn?&quot; asked da mayor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  My crew be always ready at me beacon call!  That is what I be gettin' for havin' the best crew in all of Freeport!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how is your fine ship fairing?  I take it that it will be seaworthy by dawn as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  She be as ship-shape as the day she first lost her  virginity to the sea!  She be more than ready to set sail!  Arrrgh!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Da captain pointed down da shore a ways to a ship tied up to a makeshift dock.  Da ship looked worse dan da cabin da captain lived in.  Da big wooden mast was leaning berry, berry far to da left (port, to yous landlovers) and it looked like it was gonna fall off any second.  Da main sail was full of holes da size of Bash's head.  Rotted wood held da ship together, just barely.  And two feet of water flooded every area of inside da ship.<br />
<br />
Almost everyone gulped.  Everyone but Bash.  Da ogre remained hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Us tank yous, captain.  Us is sure yous can help us out.  Us look forward to sailing wit yous.  Me name is Bash Emgood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  That be a good name fer a sailor!  Arrrgh!  My name be Captain Kirk Janeway!  Arrrgh!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dawn came bright and early dat morning and da group reluctantly got out of deir beds.  Even dough da inn dey was staying at no longer had a roof... or three of it's walls... or even beds for dat matter... da group had been exhausted from da trek from Halas.  But, dey each knew dey had to get up.  For today would be deir only chance to set sail to da Ocean of Tears.<br />
<br />
Da group arrived at Janeway's docks to see a handful of burly, rustic, hairy, smelly pirates working on da ship Captain Janeway had shown dem last night.  Da pirates were busily sanding decks, taping up holes wit strips of paper and a seemingly unending supply of phlegm.  Da pirates no communicated to each udder wit words, dey just grunted back and forth and everyone seemed to understand each udder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said Captain Kirk Janeway sidling up next to da group.  &quot;I see ye be seein' me fine crew!  Arrrgh!  'Tis a good lot!  They be workin' on me ship all through the night, they be!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting had turned to listen to da captain, but den turned back to look at da boat in confusion.  Da boat looked exactly da same as it had da udder night.  And dat wasn't really a good ting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  Lads!  Come over here and be meetin' the cargo!  Arrrgh!&quot; da captain shouted.  Quickly da pirates jumped off da boat and lined up shoulder to shoulder so da captain could introduce dem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh.  Gang, I'd like ye to be meetin' the finest crew these waters have 'ere seen!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da whole group of pirates responded wit a resounding &quot;ARRRGH!&quot;... except someone responded wit a high-pitched &quot;Yay!&quot;, but none of da pirates seemed to notice or care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said da captain.  &quot;This here be my first mate and commanding officer!  Arrrgh!&quot;  Da captain pointed to da first pirate whose face was completely covered in grey hair.  It was impossible to tell where his hair stopped and his beard began.  &quot;Arrrgh!  This be Commander Riker McWorf!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; da furry man grunted.<br />
<br />
Da captain den introduced da rest of da crew, who each progressively looked and smelled worse dan da last.  Dere was Tuvok Spockman da navigator, Scotty LaForge-O'Brien da engineer, Data Suluodo da logkeeper, and Bob da janitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  They be a fine crew, don't they?  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da crew returned a hearty &quot;Arrrgh!&quot; but, once again, a tiny high-pitched &quot;Yay!&quot; was heard in unison wit da crew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who keeps saying dat?!&quot; asked Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said da captain.  &quot;Come out from behind the crew, boy!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
A mid-teenage boy weighing about ninety pounds wit brown hair and a grey sweatsuit stepped out from behind da pirates.  &quot;Hi guys!&quot; he said.  &quot;Pleased to meet you!  I'm sure we'll have so much fun together!  I'm looking forward to it!  I really really am!  You bethca!  Oh boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; da captain began.  &quot;This be the last of me crewmembers.  He be Wussly Crusher.  Normally I wouldn't tolerate such a scrawny, annoying, nuisance on me ship but... he somehow manages to single-handedly save our ship each and every time it gets into trouble.  Quite handy to have along, he is!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh.&quot; said da pirates, but it was more of a moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep yep yep!&quot; said Wussly.  &quot;I am the envy of every male in Freeport ages 15 to 35!  They hate me with a passion and focus their rage on me being a whiney, know-it-all punk!  However, their anger is misplaced because in actuality, they hate me only for the fact that *I*, not they, are riding along with this crew, saving the day, and getting many, many, MANY hot chicks!  What a bunch of no-life, losers!  They hate me for being what they wish they could be!  They loathe me, yet still beg for me to sign their official Captain Kirk Janeway &amp; Crew posters!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said da captain.  &quot;If'n ye be ready, big ogre landlover, we be ready to set sail!  We best be off as soon as we can!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!/Yay!&quot; da crew responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Us tink we is ready,&quot; said Bash, &quot;but me just have one question.  How were yous able to introduce yous crew to us one at a time if yous no can see dem?  Yous got two eyepatches!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said Captain Kirk.  &quot;It be easy!&quot;  Da captain started sniffing loud enough for everyone to hear.  &quot;By the smell!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da voyage on da ocean was a peaceful one.  Ok, me lying, it was not berry fun for anyone in Bash's group.  Da ship dey was sailing on seemed on da brink of falling apart, da group  found dat da pirate crew actually was capapble of smelling worse and da stink seemed to outdo itself each day, and da worst and horrible ting dat nobody could stand was da fact dat Wussly and Lilting became instant friends and were constantly talking to each udder in fast, high-pitched annoying voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there was this time,&quot; said Wussly in a hurried pace to his new friend, &quot;We ran into this lady who gave everyone these 'games' and it turned out it was drugs!  I was the only one who didn't try these games so I ended up saving everybody!  It was cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoooooaaaa!&quot; said Lilting in awe.  &quot;There was this time when we were fighting a demon and and and he was like 'Rawr!' and I was like 'Aaaaahhh!' and he was like 'You're gonna die!' and Bash was like 'No we're not!' and he was like 'Yes you are!' and I was like 'Come get some!' and Treehugger was like 'Ouch! My stomach has been ripped open!' and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; shouted Medsa clutching her ears, obviously not able to take it anymore.  Wussly and Lilting turned to her, not understanding why she didn't enjoy their pleasant conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh...&quot; moaned Treehugger as he was leaning over da side of da boat.  &quot;I remember when my stomach was ripped open... it was a wonderful feeling compared to *BLARF!*&quot;  Treehugger had been upchucking most of da voyage.<br />
<br />
Bash stood near da boat's bow staring out into da sea.  He worried for his brudder and hoped he could find him again.  He knew dat each day he was getting closer to Smellybreath... or maybe it was dat Smellybreath was getting closer to him.  He wasn't sure.  <br />
<br />
Captain Kirk had clunked his way up next to Bash disrupting da ogre's train of thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  Looks like I lost the bet.  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What bet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  The bet me and me mates had as to which one of ye would be the 'comic relief who upheaves his dinner over the side of the boat the whole journey.'  Every single group of people has one, ye see.  It offsets the seriousness of the other events at hand!  I was betting the little one be the one who keel hauls his lunch!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Me sorry yous lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  It be nothing much.  Tell me, large mate, what be so dire as to cause you to wear such a frown?  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It a lot of tings.  Mostly it me brudder.  He disappeared a year ago and me no can find him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  And that what ye be doin' right now on this boat?  Lookin' for him, aye?  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Me pointed in many directions, but me still no further dan when me started weeks and weeks ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  Well, me and me crew will do our best to get you in the right direction!  Arrrgh!  Here is something though that I have learned through me many years:  Nothing is greater than the love of a family.  It can break steel, bend mountains, and destroy magic.  You will find yer brother again, that I be certain.  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me hope so,&quot; said Bash looking down at da water, staring into nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said da captain.  &quot;Lookee there now.  Seems we be close to our destination!  Hermit Isle!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How da heck can yous see dat tiny island up ahead!?  Yous got two eye patches!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da captain pointed one of his peg arms to his nose and made loud sniffing sounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain, yous is someting else.&quot; said da ogre shaking his head in wonder.<br />
<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da ship docked at da isle a few hours later and da pirate crew began tying da boat down wit a lot of grunts and arrrghs.  Da island was pretty small, wit a lot of sand, some grass, a few coconut trees, and a tiny little hut in da center.<br />
<br />
Da group stood on da sand (well, Treehugger was propped up by Pyra and Yessir and his skin was pretty green) surveying da surroundings.  Bash was eager to get some questions answered by dis 'hermit.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; said Captain Janeway standing on da plank leading to da shore.  &quot;We will be waitin' fer ye to take ye where ye be needin' to go!  Right boys?  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh/Yay!&quot; da crew resounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's get moving den.&quot; Bash said to da party.<br />
<br />
Dey came to da hut and Bash thumped on da rickety door.  A scream of complete and utter surprise came from inside da house.<br />
<br />
&quot;*BLEEEEEEP!!!*&quot; it shouted.  A very foul word indeed to be shouting, but it obvious da person inside is not used to visitors and especially not used to loud thumps on his door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the *Bleepin* *Bleep* was that?!&quot; an old man shouted from inside da house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me is Bash Emgood, and me was told yous can help me out wit some questions me have!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da door opened and in da doorway stood da scrawniest, scraggliest man any of dem had ever seen.  Da hermit was so skinny, he looked like a skeleton.  A skeleton wit berry, berry long and matted grey hair dat matched his equally berry, berry long and matted grey beard.  Da old man was berry dirty and didn't look like he had bathed for berry long time, even dough his island was surrounded by water.  Da only piece of clothing da man wore was a loincloth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the *Bleep*in *Bleep* are you mother *Bleep*ers?!  You *Bleep* *Bleep* scared the *Bleep*in *Bleep* out of my *Bleep*ing *Bleep* *Bleep*!!&quot;  Da old man was apparantly berry, berry foul mouthed.<br />
<br />
Lilting whispered to Medsa.  &quot;What does *Bleep* mean?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Da group huddled close together inside da hermit's tiny hut.  Da inside of da hut wasn't much to look at.  It didn't have any windows but it had a dirt floor.  A bed made up of straw  filled one corner.  <br />
<br />
Da hermit stood against one wall and eyed da party suspiciously.  &quot;What the *Bleep*in' *Bleep* *Bleep* do you guys *Bleep*in' want?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash stepped forward, platinum armor glinting of da tiny beams of sunlight dat spilled through da cracks in da ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive us rude arrival.  Allow me to introduce self.  Me is Bash Emgood...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm *Bleep*in' Herman the *Bleep*in' Hermit!  Who the *Bleep* cares?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash continued.  &quot;Us have been told dat yous may have some information dat can help us out.  Us is looking for a goblin wizard named Smellybreath.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*Bleep*!  I can't *Bleep*in' help you *Bleep*ers there.  I've never even *Bleep*in' heard of the *Bleep*in' *Bleep* *Bleep*!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us is also looking for a big black knight known to cause massive destruction to towns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah *Bleep*.  Now that, I know a *Bleep*in' little about.  You see, I *Bleep*in' heard that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, cool!&quot; shouted Lilting from across da room.  Lilting found da only udder ting inside da hut udder dan da bed.  It was a big, black, square box wit a big, square glass lens on da front.  &quot;What is this?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Herman, me guess dat is his name, lost his train of thought and began talking to Lilting.  &quot;That, is a *Bleep*in' Magic Box o' *Bleep*in' Fun(tm).  It is my only *Bleep*in' friend.  Well, that, and the *Bleep*in' Magic Console Joy Pad below it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it do?&quot; asked Lilting eyes getting bigger staring into da black screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll *Bleep*in' show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da scraggly hermit moved over to da big, black box and pressed a button on da front.  Da ting hummed to life and da glass 'screen' lit up in one big blue color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoooooooa!&quot; whispered Lilting.  &quot;Is that all it does?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*Bleep*in' hardly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da hermit picked up a weird looking device wit a movable stick on top and a long cord running off da back and handed it to da halfling.  Da device was attached to anudder box, dat da hermit also switched on.  Da blue screen flickered and was replaced wit tiny beings sitting in some weird, magical contraptions wit wheels dat da Magic Box called &quot;go karts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Press some *Bleep*in' buttons and have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting pressed some buttons and found he could choose to 'play' one of da tiny characters and race him around different tracks.  Lilting picked a funny, little plumber in  a red hat and blue overalls.  Da halfling sat down on da dirt floor, eyes locked on da big screen and jaw agape.<br />
<br />
Treehugger stared in amazement.  He den felt da urge to join in.  Da ranger ran over, picked up a second device attached to same box Lilting's was, sat down and chose a character to play of his own (a funny little green and white dinosaur wit a long tongue, if yous really want to know).  Da druid and ranger den went at it on screen, racing against each udder.<br />
<br />
Da hermit moved back to where he was and da rest of da group turned back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any... companionship?&quot; asked Medsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  *Bleep* No!  Who needs *Bleep*in' girlfriends when you have *Bleep*in' video games!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash tried to steer da hermit back to da original conversation.  &quot;Yous were saying about dat black knight...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah.  *Bleep*.  Well, I hear a *Bleep*in' thing or two from the *Bleep*in' birds who come by to rest in the *Bleep*in' trees on this island.  Turns out that some cities  on *Bleep*in' Faydwer were *Bleep*in' obliterated by things similar to what you described.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You little punk!&quot; shouted Treehugger from across da room, his eyes glued to da magic box screen.  &quot;What the heck was that you hit me with?! A turtle shell!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da hermit and da udders soon learned to tune out da bickering between da ranger and halfling.  Herman continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know all the *Bleep*in' cities that were hit, but I do know that *Bleep*in' Kaladim was one of them.  You *Bleep*ers might want to start there.  Maybe you'll get some *Bleep*in' clues as to what the *Bleep* has been going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*Bleep*!&quot; shouted Lilting as da tiny halfling pounded on da buttons of his hand-held device.  &quot;How the heck did that mushroom make your kart go faster?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash continued talking to da hermit.  &quot;Is dere anyting else yous can tell us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*Bleep*.  I don't *Bleep*in' think so.  Well, other than the fact that if you don't *Bleep*in' hurry the whole world will suffer.  But you *Bleep*in' *Bleep*s alread knew that, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group, udder dan Lilting and Treehugger, looked at each udder.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhhh... no.&quot; said Pyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; said Herman.  &quot;Well, no pressure!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How the *Bleep* did you get the *Bleep* ahead of me, you little *Bleep*!&quot; shouted Treehugger.<br />
<br />
Da ogre shook da hermit's hand.  &quot;Us tank yous for yous time and help.  If dere's anyting yous need, us will try to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some *Bleep*in' pants would be nice.  Loincloths tend to ride-up too *Bleep*in' much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash nodded.  &quot;Ok,&quot; da ogre said to group.  &quot;Let's go!  We need to talk to dem little dorfs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group started to follow Bash out when Yessir noticed dat Lilting and Treehugger hadn't moved and were still staring at da black box and pounding rapidly on da devices in deir hands.  Da paladin signaled Bash.<br />
<br />
Bash looked at da two group members.  &quot;Ok guys, let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger and Lilting stared at da screen as if in a trance, racing deir little characters like mad against each udder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, let's go NOW!&quot; said Bash in a slightly loud ogre voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one minute, mom.&quot; Lilting said in a quiet, distant voice; not moving or blinking his eyes.  Da ranger and druid were neck and neck on screen and da 'finish line' was just ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat's it!&quot; boomed da big ogre.  Bash stomped over to where da two were and pounded on da button of da tinier box.  Da race disappeared and da blue screen returned.<br />
<br />
Da ranger and halfling screamed in ultimate pain.  &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da group headed back towards da boat.  Lilting and Treehugger acted as if dey was coming out of a trance wit each step away from da hut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Lilting.  &quot;I can see why that hermit guy cusses so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;That thing was pretty mind controlling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I'm glad Bash turned it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, even though I was about to win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever!  I was about to pound your sorry *Bleep* into the ground!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da two began arguing and Bash just sighed.  Dey were approaching da boat anyway and da ogre could just lock dem below deck if he had to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain Kirk,&quot; shouted Bash to da captain, who was directing minor repairs on his boat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; shouted da captain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Us need to go to Kaladim, on da tiny, wussy continent of Faydwer!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrgh!  We be ready to set sail when ye be!  Arrrgh!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Black storm clouds raced along da sky, seemingly destroying any light dat may have once been.  Da wind wailed like a banshee screaming for someone's death.  Out of da darkness shot a lightning bolt dat lit up da sky for an instant and da silouhette of a castle was seen against da clouds.  Da bolt slammed into a spire at da top of da castle.  If anyone saw da spectacle, dey might almost swear da bolt was blood red.<br />
<br />
In his dungeon throne room, Smellybreath stood hunched over his tiny pool of dark, magical blood.  Peering into da blood, he could see through da eyes of his dark Elemental Guardians but dis was berry taxing on da goblin, even dough it would kill even da most powerful wizard outright.  <br />
<br />
Da goblin watched and a smile began to curl upon his lips.  Da smile widened into a wicked grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.  Good!  You are doing quite well, my General of Fire!&quot; da goblin said quietly to himself.  &quot;Keep bringing me more!  More for my army of hatred!  More for my fist of vengeance!&quot; <br />
<br />
Smellybreath cackled wit glee.  Da goblin calmed down and waved his hand over da blood, as if to change da channel and look on another part of da world.  He den growled angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth!  Get back here now!  I summon you!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Within seconds, a black portal appeared and da black knight, Earth, stepped through.  Da knight banged its gauntleted fist against its dark, breastplated chest and made a slight bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on down there?!&quot; da goblin demanded.  &quot;Why are you not progressing with your task as quickly as your brothers?!  My orders were simple!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Da knight bowed its head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you having trouble?  What is the problem?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da knight lifted its head slightly and da black helmet just stared blankly at da goblin.  It seemed as if da silent knight didn't say a word, but Smellybreath seemed to understand da evil brute.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.  They're tougher than they look, eh?  Well, I am a forgiving fellow.  Go back to beginning of the plan and finish what you started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da knight banged his fist again and pulled out da teleport stone it carried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and one more thing...&quot; da goblin said to da knight.  Earth ****ed it's head slightly.  Smellybreath raised his left hand and shot a streaming force of purple energy into da knight.  Da knight dropped to its knees and shook violently.  If it could scream in pain, it obviously would. Smellybreath just smiled as he continued to shoot out da purplish energy.  After a few more seconds da goblin stopped.<br />
<br />
Da knight jerked and fell forward, putting an arm out straight to catch itself from slamming into da ground.  Earth raised itself back to a standing position, but was still shaking from whatever it was da goblin had done to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Don't fail me again.&quot; da goblin said wit a piercing gaze.<br />
<br />
Da black knight banged its chest wit a shaky fist, and hurriedly traced da symbol on its teleportation stone.  In seconds, Earth was gone.<br />
<br />
Da goblin sighed and walked over to his throne.  &quot;I am a very forgiving fellow indeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da midmorning sun peeked through da clouds as da ship's crew tied off da boat at da dock.  Many of da gruff pirates slapped Wussly on da back and gave a &quot;Arrrgh!&quot; of tanks, for Wussly had saved da ship (again) from certain destruction three times during dis particular voyage.  Bash's group descended down da ship's plank to da docks.<br />
<br />
When everyone was on da dock, Captain Janeway clunked down da gangplank to see da party off.  &quot;Arrrgh!  I be sailin' all around this here ocean many, times I be!  But ye all be bein' the best bunch o' landlovers I e'er be seein'!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrrgh!/Yay!&quot; Captain Kirk's crew/Wussly all shouted at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Us tank yous all for helping us out.&quot; said Bash.  &quot;If yous ever need help wit anyting, me no will hesitate.  In fact, me betting me could round up a bunch of ogre friends to help yous fix up yous ship and yous shack!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da captain looked confused.  &quot;Arrrgh!  What's wrong with my ship and my house?  Arrrgh!&quot;  Janeway's crew looked at each udder and shrugged in confusion as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... apparantly nothing!&quot; Treehugger exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Janeway nodded and smiled.  He den walked closer to Bash and spoke in a quieter tone for only da ogre to hear.  &quot;Arrrgh.  I know ye will be findin' your brother, good ogre.  Arrrgh.  Your heart be bein' full of love and I know he be bein' happy to see you once again.  Arrrgh.  Don't be givin' up hope!  Arrrgh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ogre smiled and nodded, but den realized Captain Kirk no could see it.  So Bash stammered a &quot;Tank yous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting wlaked up to Wussly and shook da boy's hand.  &quot;Thank you very, very, very, very much for saving us against that mean man who could control space, time, and matter with mere thought!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem!  Thanks for helping me figure out that giant, mechanical squid's weakness!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing!  Thanks for stopping that big cubicle ship full of zombies that wanted to turn us all into zombies too to add to their collective selves!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome!  Thanks for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!/ARRRGH!&quot; screamed everyone.<br />
<br />
Da group waved deir goodbyes and was off.  Dey followed da beach to a large, brick archway dat lead to da path dat would take dem through da mountains to Kaladim.<br />
<br />
Taking only two steps on da path, Bash started sniffing da air wit great eagerness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me smell someting good!!!&quot; da large ogre exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Dey continued walking down da path.  A berry, berry loud rumbling sound was den heard by all, and da source was Bash's tummy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me smell someting berry good!  Me not know what!  Me starving now!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group still marched on but Bash was almost given over to da lust after da delicious aroma which he could not stop breathing in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me smell food!  Me smell someting good!  Me smell....!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dwarves!&quot; Lilting shouted in surprise as many armed dwarves jumped out of da bushes on both sides of da canyon trail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;OCH!&quot; shouted all da dwarves surrounding da party in unison.  Dere were at least twenty of da little tings and each of dem held a weapon pointed towards da group.  Some looked like royal guards or some other type of rich warrior, wit deir fine spears and armor shining.  Udders looked like farmers wit deir soiled rags for clothes and pitchforks as weapons.  One ting was clear dough:  all of dem looked battle-weary and none looked too happy to see Bash and his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Och, yourself!&quot; said Treehugger pulling out his swords.  &quot;Let us pass, tiny ones!  Our fight is not with you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya best be puttin' yerrr hands up in tha air, all of yas!&quot; growled da head dwarf who had a black beard and a scar dat ran down da left side of his face, permanently closing one eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would advise everyone to show no aggression,&quot; said Pyra.  &quot;Dwarves are nothing to scoff at when it comes to fighting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash didn't say a word.  But his stomach growled all da more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drrrop yer weapons, all of ya!&quot; da dwarf shouted.  &quot;Ah've  been orrrdered ta brrring yas to see the king!  And ain't nuthin gonna stop me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will stop you!&quot; said Lilting taking out his tiny, tiny dagger.  &quot;Right guys?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da band of dwarves just laughed.  Medsa snickered a little bit too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya bein' brrrave for a 'scrawny', says I!  But we arrre havin' our orrrders!  Though the few of us could surely be takin' all of yas down, therrre be several more of us hidin' yet!  Ah say again, drrrop yer weapons and come along!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash snapped out of his hunger trance long enough to realize da situation.  He felt dat he should not fight back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; da ogre said to his friends, &quot;Do as da dorf says.  Me have feeling dat if us fight now, whether we win or lose, our quest will be lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group reluctantly listened to da big ogre and dropped deir weapons.  More dwarves jumped out of da bushes.  Dwarves snatched up weapons and udders began tying da party's hands behind deir backs.<br />
<br />
Yessir let out a big sigh.  &quot;This is reminding me of a blind date I had many years ago...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you know what you're doing Bash.&quot; said Treehugger uneasily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; said Bash.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves formed a line in front of and behind da group and forced dem to march northward along da path.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da entrance to da dwarven city of Kaladim was a sight to behold.  It looked even better several weeks before, but  even in a ruined state it was quite impressive.  Da entrance to da city was a grand archway dat led right into da mountain itself.  On top of da archway was a statue of a dwarven warrior, fifty feet tall.  Unfortunately, all dat remained of da statue now was da feet and legs.  Da rest of it was nothing but rubble on da ground surrounding da archway.<br />
<br />
Most of da group couldn't help but stare in awe of da remaining craftsmanship of da statue and cracked archway.  Deir dwarven captors however, muttered curses and udder nasty tings dat Bash no could make out.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves led dem straight into da maw of da dwarven city.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da inside of da dwarven city was in ruins, but it still looked spectacular.  Though many of da dwarven homes and buildings dat were carved out of da rock were mostly piles of dust, some remained mostly in tact and da group marveled at da craftsmanship.  All throughout da huge city many boulders and stalagtites had  crashed to da ground, crushing many structures, passageways, and dwarves.<br />
<br />
Bruised, bloodied, and obviously battleweary, all da dwarves in da city seemed mostly unphased by da recent disaster.  Hundreds of dwarves were rapidly working on rebuilding deir city.  Many were working on carving out new passages and archways, while udders were mining stones, metals, and jewels for new buildings.<br />
<br />
Bash was glad to see da dwarves busy at rebuilding deir city, but was a little confused as to how dey was doing it.  Da dwarves did not use mining picks or any udder type of tools.  Dey was slamming  deir fists and fingers into da rock walls to mine ore, and occasionally using deir teeth to bite off chunks of rock dey wanted.  Bash's friends also noticed da strange mining technique of da dwarves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you guys lose all your mining picks in the earthquake?&quot; asked Treehugger to one of da dwarves dat lead da party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mining what?&quot; grunted da dirty dwarf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Picks!  You know, a tool with a double metal blade with a wooden handle that you can use to help you mine better!  Orcs drop them all the time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea what yer talkin' about, boy!  Besides, who needs these 'prick thingies' when we have our teeth?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A bunch of da dwarves smiled at Treehugger, and da ranger saw dat many of da little fellows were missing many teeth and udders and chipped and worn-down-to-da-nub teeth.  Looking around, da half-elf noticed dat dis dental occurance was not uncommon among da hundreds of dwarves.<br />
<br />
Da group arrived at what used to be a grand hall dat lead to a massive, beautiful door.  Dis was obviously da  entrance to someone important.  Four dwarves pushed back each door.<br />
<br />
&quot;In ya go, surface dwellers!  Go to the king, and be judged!&quot; shouted da head dwarf.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da group stood in an elaborate throne room.  Guards in polished armor lined da red carpet leading up to da fattest, ugliest, and smelliest dwarf of all.  His beard was probably white, but it was brown from all da grease and chicken bits dat had fallen into it.  He wore a long purple robe and a gold crown.  Next to him sat a slim dwarven female, who had a brown beard almost as long as da king's, but was much cleaner.  She was also dressed in a purple robe.<br />
<br />
Bash's stomach started rumbling at da sight of da fat king dwarf.  Da smell from da chicken grease in his beard no helped much either.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves dat captured da party all bowed down, and da head dwarf began speaking.  &quot;King Kazon and Queen Nozak, these are tha people whom yer Royal Seer told ya about, and the ones whom ya ordered me ta get!&quot;<br />
<br />
King Kazon scowled at da party of Bash.  &quot;You!  You big meanheads!  You did this to us!&quot;   Da king started hopping up in down in rage.  &quot;You you you you you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa began to say someting, but was silenced by a guard.<br />
<br />
Da king began shouting some more.  &quot;Where is my seer?!  And where is my food?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da queen began to calmly speak to her husband.  &quot;Dear, you just ate.  Shouldn't you take your doctor's advice and not eat as often, especially greasy foods?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you dum-dum woman!  You're just a queen!  I'm the king!  I make the law!  I make the medical advice!  I order my body to stay healthy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But dear, you eat so much chicken that your blood is probably nothing more than a chicken broth...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash's stomach began to moan in agony.<br />
<br />
Da queen continued, &quot;...and I don't want to see you have a heart attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!  Ah, here comes the seer!&quot;<br />
<br />
An old, old dwarf entered da room.  His white beard dangled to da ground from his wrinkly face.  He inspected da group closely and den went to da king.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, these are the ones whom I spoke of.  They are somehow tied to the black knight that came here, though I don't believe they sent it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!  What do you know?  I bet they sent it!&quot;  Da king began hopping up and down wit fists clenched, screaming all da while.  &quot;I order them to be executed at dawn!  Lock them in the prison!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting and Pyra winked at each udder upon hearing dat.<br />
<br />
Da seer looked at da group.  &quot;My lord, they have a druid and a wizard amongst them.  Both are capable of teleportation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; shouted the king.  &quot;I know that!  Throw them in the &quot;Magically Sealed&quot; prison then!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D'oh!&quot; whispered Pyra and Lilting inaudibly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Da doors of da cell slammed shut as Lilting, da last of da group, was hurled inside.  Da halfling slammed into da rock wall and fell down into da straw-covered floor.  It took many, many dwarves to subdue Bash and get him chained up inside da cell, but dey eventually did it.  Everyone sat wit long, depressed looks in da gigantic, poorly lit cell.<br />
<br />
Lilting came to consciousness and immediately tried to cast several spells.  All of dem just made a fizzling sound a couple sparks sputtered from his fingertips.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no use,&quot; said Pyra.  &quot;This cell somehow prevents the  use of all magic.  Believe me, I've tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed she did.  Pyra's pyromaniac instincts no could resist such an abundance of clean, dry, flammable straw.<br />
<br />
Bash's stomach began to rumble, dis rumble so loud and powerful dat it made Bash's chains jingle from da low frequency bass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me huuuungry!&quot; Bash wailed.  He no could take da smell of so much good food around him.  Da ogre's eyes were almost glazed.  It was as if Bash no longer realized what was going on around him, like he was in a trance.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his head, Lilting wondered what dey could do about deir situation and his large friend.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I know what we can do!&quot; da halfing exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Everyone's eyes turned toward da halfing wit hopefulness.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can play 'Get to Know You'!  You know, we each take a turn telling a bit about ourselves so we each can learn a bit more about each other!  Pretty neat huh?!&quot;  Lilting began bouncing wit excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a terrible idea!&quot; grumbled a voice from almost underneath da druid.  Everyone turned to see da straw shift and an aging half-elf sat up from being buried in da straw.  Da half-elf's long, matted hair was almost all gray.  What little color remained was undeterminable from all da grime.<br />
<br />
Treehugger looked at da half-elf and thought dat he looked somehow familiar, but den soon dismissed da thought.  &quot;If you have a better suggestion than the halfling's, old man, then I say spit them out!  Who are you anyway to raise your voice to my friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da old half-elf spat.  &quot;Quit your condescending attitude, boy!  You've likely not gained nearly as much life experience as I!&quot;  And den he mumbled under his breath, &quot;Or as many women either, from the looks of you.&quot;  And went back to speaking in an audible tone.  &quot;My name is unimportant in this hell hole, just as yours will be in time.  Yours will be too, eventually.   Those on the outside who know you will soon forget you, and then this thing you call life will suddenly have been pointless!  But, if you must address me, I guess the name 'Bob' is as good as any.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger squinted at da older man wit distrust and dislike.<br />
<br />
Lilting piped up.  &quot;Well, we won't be in here that long, Bob!  We're supposed to be executed pretty soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A fate I wish I would have gotten years ago,&quot; sighed Bob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, 'Bob',&quot; began Treehugger again wit much sarcasm, &quot;If you have a better idea to pass the time than my friend's here I suggest you let us know it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob scowled at da ranger but remained silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then,&quot; said Lilting cheerily.  &quot;Who wants to go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me huuuuungry!&quot; wailed Bash.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess it all began with my village.&quot; said Lilting quietly.  &quot;You see, everyone there is a druid.  My mom's a druid, my dad's a druid, everyone is a druid.  So, I became a druid too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone listened intently to da halfling in da torchlit cell.  Lilting began to sniffle slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I realized that everyone had the same notion as to what being a druid is!  They were all greedy, brainless people who thought that the only way to live in this life is to cast a spell and then run away like a coward!  I thought there had to be a better way.  There just has to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting began to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my backwards way of thinking that got me exiled from my own city.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting den began to ball like a baby.  Dose nearest to da halfling comforted him reassuringly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss my mommy!&quot; Lilting wailed.  <br />
<br />
Da halfling den just kept continuing sobbing.  When he quieted down, Pyra began to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;My family is one of the most prominent and powerful families in all of Erudin.  Yes, that means that my father and mother were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;King and queen?&quot; Lilting interjected quickly, while snorting back some loosened phlegm from his crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Governors?&quot; asked Bob.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;  Pyra said.  &quot;They were cheesemakers.  As you may or may not know, Erudins love cheese.  They crave it!  Gouda, pepperjack, mozarella, cheddar, we love it all.  We cannot get enough of it.  There is a saying, 'He who controls the cheese, controls the empire!  The cheese must flow.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bob.  &quot;I've heard that some people say the Erudin's brainpower...and overdeveloped heads,&quot; Bob muttered, &quot;are the result of their high intake of cheese.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, many believe that.&quot; Pyra said quietly.  &quot;We don't know the cause, we just know we love cheese.  Anyway, my parents were cheesemakers.  I, of course, delighted in setting things on fire.  It was because of this that I accidentally set the cheese factory ablaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;To make a long story short, melted cheese three feet deep covered the entire town of Erudin for a while.  My parents sent me to go see a therapist about controlling my firestarting ways.  But, I instead chose to play hookie.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is when I met you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da group looked at each udder nervously after hearing dis tale; except for Bash, of course.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we're so glad you're here, Pyra!&quot; said Treehugger very quickly.  Da ranger's eyes darted around frantically as he wrung his hands.  He den decided to try and shift da uneasiness everyone was feeling onto someone else.  He turned to Medsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about you, hot stuff?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Why does everyone want to know about me?&quot; demanded Medsa hotly.  Da High Elf cleric became rather defensive when Lilting prodded about her past.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's your turn!&quot; said da halfling excitedly.  &quot;We all agreed to talk about our pasts.  We were going in a counter-clockwise circle, so now it's fallen on you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn't agree to it!&quot; Medsa said wit a scowl.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just leave me alone!  I don't want to talk about anything!  Ask me one more time and you'll see just how mean I can get!&quot;  Da cleric's eyes shone down on Lilting like daggers.  Lilting  immediately shut up and looked genuinely afraid.<br />
<br />
Treehugger spoke up and broke da tension.  &quot;If the lady doesn't want to talk about her past, then let's respect it.  Ok, guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa's frown and scowl turned towards da ranger.  She looked at Treehugger and for a second it seemed like her iron face softened a little bit, but den she turned around and sat in one of da cell corners.  She folded her arms and looked away from da group, staring at nothing in particular.<br />
<br />
After da long silence, Sir Yessir slammed his hands together and began rubbing them in eager  anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it my turn, good sir halfling?&quot; da knight asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!  If you want it to be!&quot; said Lilting, perking up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, great is my joy!&quot; da paladin said delightfully wit a smile.  Da knight stood up, armor creaking and squeaking as he did so, and assumed a public speaking stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you all know, I am a professional dragonslayer.  I was not born this way, though!  Oh no.  Ye see, dragonslayers are rare in this world.  They are chosen people at birth by the gods and are endowed with the gift of being able to single-handedly destroy the reptilian beasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard of lots of people taking out dragons,&quot; said Pyra.  &quot;Does this mean they were all born dragonslayers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh heavens no!  Ye've heard of dragon raids, I am sure.  These always consist of an insane amount of people, many of which are killed quickly.  What they never tell you is.... that all the dragons they are able to kill are the weakest and sickliest of the dragon species!  Sure, they don't look weak or sick but dragons aren't people, ye know?<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I was not a born dragonslayer.  As a young boy, I was playing outside of our tiny little shack.  While doing so, a mean, nasty, baby dragon scurried across the yard and bit me in the leg.  It hurt.  A lot!  I was so upset, that I chased that dragon.  I chased it for three days.  Finally I caught up to it and an epic battle ensued!  After another four days, I came out victorious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old were you?&quot; asked Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two and a half years old.  It was then that I vowed to make sure that no more dragons were to ever live to hurt another human being again!  I also vowed to invent a better diaper, but that one didn't pan out as well as I had planned.  But I digress, I couldn't find my way back home.  I began to wander.<br />
<br />
&quot;I eventually found myself on the doorstep to a paladin's guild.  I still had a hard time reaching doorknobs, so I did the universal action for help for people my age.  I cried.  I screamed my lungs out!<br />
<br />
&quot;After about nine days of that, the paladins eventually broke down and let me in just to shut me up.  My plan had worked!  I trained with those knights, learning everything I could as the years went on.  Not only did I teach myself how to slay dragons, but I made sure that each and every dragon that came into the paladin's garden was destroyed!  Those fellows never had a dragon problem again.<br />
<br />
&quot;After several years, and after I had destroyed half of the guild in a botched dragon experiment, the paladins asked me to leave.  They told me I was becoming.... how did they put it?  'Too powerful, smart, and skillful to learn anything else from them.'  My, those knights were so kind to me!  They even booted me out onto the street with their weakest kicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;I then became a freelance dragonslayer.  I roamed the countryside looking for dragons to slay.  It was a double-bonus for me!  I would gain skill and knowledge how to slay dragons with each fight, and I'd also be ridding the world of the pesky things!  And after many slayings, I finally bump into you guys.  The end!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yessir took a long bow.  His armor squeaked as he bent down, but dere was also a loud *SNAP* dat seemed to come from his back region.  Dere was just silence from everyone as he made his bow.  Lilting began clapping intensely and cheering.  Da halfling loved da story.  Da knight straightened himself back up after much negotiating wit his spine.<br />
<br />
Nobody said much of anyting for several minutes.  Da silence was broken when Bash, still staring blankly, screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me HUUUUUUUUNNNNNNGGGRRYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone was asleep in da dark cell.  Berry, berry loud and deep snoring could be heard coming from Bash's direction, but close inspection showed dat da snoring did not come from da ogre but da druid Lilting.  Da only udder noises heard were da mumblings of a sleeping Bash about starving, and da crackle of da torchlight in da hallway outside of da cell.<br />
<br />
Medsa was still awake sitting in a corner, hugging her knees to her chest and staring at da ground.  Da cleric looked a bit a bit sad while she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still awake?&quot; a voice whispered.<br />
<br />
Medsa looked up to see dat Treehugger had come over to where she sat.  She didn't say a word and den went back to looking at da ground.<br />
<br />
Da ranger sat down next to her.  He didn't say anyting for a few minutes.  Finally da half-elf spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, don't worry about those guys.  They didn't mean to pressure you into anything.  They just want you to be a part of the group.  They didn't mean to make you upset.  They just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that!&quot; da cleric whispered curtly.  &quot;It's...  Oh you wouldn't understand!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try me.&quot; Da ranger looked at da high-elf wit sadness.  He didn't like to see her in pain.<br />
<br />
Medsa made a scowling face as she looked at da ground.  After several more minutes she spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?!  What happened?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a physical pain.  Oh, how I wish it were!  I could cure that instantly.&quot;  Medsa's face became sad.  &quot;All my life I've had problems dealing with people.  I tend to be a bit brash with them and eventually they see me as some ticked-off witch and leave me alone.  I've never even had a real friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger looked at dis lady and couldn't understand how anyone could not be her friend.  Da ranger wanted to say so much, but he was smart enough to be quiet at dis moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a mean person on the inside.  I just don't know how to show that to people.  I try to, but it always seems to come out as insults.  Nobody even looks at me as a person anymore.  All they see is a resource that can heal them up so they can go off fighting again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I met you guys.  You guys have treated me better than anyone in my entire life and look I repay you.  I don't say much and when I do I insult everyone.  I haven't even done anything for this group and yet here I am.  It's only a matter of time before you guys get sick of me too and leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger snapped at dat.  He reached out his arm and pulled her face gently, but sharply towards him so dat she had to look at da ranger as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you say that?!  This group came alive the minute you joined!  Nobody here hates you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I haven't even done anything worthwhile!  I've just been tagging along!&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger gazed into her eyes caringly and den softly spoke.  &quot;You saved my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and that's the only reason why you pay any attention to me.&quot;  Medsa tried to look away but Treehugger made sure she didn't.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you truly believed that, then the pain I would feel would be far greater than anything that demon did to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care what you think others think of you.  I know what I think of you.  I see a wonderful lady.  Maybe one who could work on her social skills a little bit, but a wonderful, beautiful lady nonetheless.  Believe me or don't believe me.  But I know what I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger took his hand away and placed it on da ground.  He turned his head away and started into nothingness in frustration.  Medsa looked downward, deep in thought.<br />
<br />
After several long, silent minutes da cleric's hand found it's way on top of Treehugger's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me,&quot; Medsa began, &quot;what made you decide to become an excellent swordsman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ranger clasped da cleric's hand gently, he turned his head and smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first off, I'm not all that great of a swordsman.  And secondly, it was one man who made me attempt to be good at the blades.  The Geistmeister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a legend amongst us rangers.  He was the greatest swordsman to have ever lived.  It was said that nothing could defeat him!  He was a whirlwind of death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you've met this guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  Not really.  I saw him once when I was very, very young.  He singlehandedly saved Kelethin from the first and last massive orc invasion.  He was amazing to watch.  I knew then that if I could be as good as him, then I would never have to worry about being afraid for my own life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, I never did get that good.  I'm terrible with the swords!  It's only a matter of time before I get killed.  If I were anything like the Geistmeister...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah!&quot; a voice snorted from underneath some nearby hay.  Da cleric and ranger turned towards da sound.  Da hay shifted and up sat deir inmate, Bob.  Pieces of hay stuck out of his scraggly beard and hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Geistmeister!  What a load of hooey.  He wasn't all that great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you know, you unkempt bum?!  He was the better with the blades than any other person!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said he wasn't all that great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is also correct.  You see boy, his skill was indeed unmatched by anybody.  He had the talent, but he lacked focus.  He let his pride cloud his thinking.  He trusted too much in his ability with his steel than his ability with his heart and mind.  That eventually led to his downfall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever!  He's the greatest there ever was, nobody would be able to take him down!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?  Well then, tell me boy, where is this fellow?  Hmmmm?  There was a man who could 'take him down.'  And that man was himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, how could that be for a man who could solo the Avatar of Fear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah, that wussy little avatar wasn't that big a deal.  He was more brawn than brain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or the time he cleared all the giants out of Greater Faydark by himself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't that big a deal, really.  Giants tend to get nasty corns on their feet, you just gotta know where to poke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the time.... whoa, wait a minute..&quot;  Treehugger started putting two and two together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're him, aren't you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob nodded.<br />
<br />
Treehugger's eyes became wide open.  &quot;There's so much I want to ask you...!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Later. You haven't much time left here.  Now listen to me, the both of you.  I've had a lot of time to think in this cell here and reflect on my life.  I've learned that a skill does not make you who you are.  You do.  I look at you both and I see two people lacking confidence in themselves.  You have to learn that it is not what the world thinks of you that makes you important or special, it's what you think of yourself.  The best thing I've learned while in here is: Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't... you're right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try to remember this, young ones.  I will have to see you both again another time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;How is it that you haven't escaped from here?  Surely you could do so!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I could.  But that wouldn't have done me much good.  You can't escape from yourself.  Like I said, I had to figure myself out and this seemed the best place to do so.  Learn from my mistakes, please.  I wish you the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;  Treehugger was cut short by da sound of an iron door slamming shut.  Several armed dwarven guards had entered da hallway outside of da cell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get up, you traitors!&quot; shouted one of da guards as another began opening the cell door.  &quot;It's time for your execution!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hundreds of dwarves sat in the underground arena seats looking down towards da center.  On a huge wooden stand, Bash's entire party were each bent over a chopping block.  Dere was a hooded dwarf to each member, and each dwarf wielded a huge, two-handed axe.  Da dwarven spectators talked excitedly amongst each udder.<br />
<br />
Den King Kazon appeared from out behind one of da main doors.  All da dwarves began to clap and show a little enthusiasm.  Den Queen Nozak and da Royal Seer appeared.  Da hundreds of dwarves stood and cheered so loud dat it made Lilting's ears ring.  Da king held up a hand to silence everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What we have here are big meanie traitors!&quot; Kazon shouted.<br />
<br />
Da crowd began to Boo at da party.  Bash no heard any of it.  Da king had come and stood right next to da big ogre.  Kazon had been eating extra fried food dis morning, so his beard and skin were covered in chicken and onion ring grease.  Da ogre's eyes were so glazed one wondered if he had any pupils at all.  His stomach was vibrating so hard dat it made his platemail ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;These mean meanies sent that other big, black meanie who destroyed most of our city!&quot; da king shouted.  Everyone booed louder.  Da Seer looked over at da Queen sorrowfully, and da Queen just shook her head and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;For this reason,&quot; da king shouted some more, &quot;I order that they be put to death by having their heads cut off in the un-nicest fashion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone roared wit approval and applause.<br />
<br />
Dough dey were tied down, many of da party members could still turn deir head a little bit to see what was going on.  Treehugger looked at Medsa.  To see her da way she was and knowing what was about to happen angered him berry much.  He struggled against his cords wit all his might, but he could not break dem.  Da cleric just looked back at da ranger and shed a single tear.<br />
<br />
Everyone was pretty frightened, well, except for Bash.  Da ogre seemed so distant.  Sir Yessir also didn't show much fear either.  He seemed content just smiling and humming some old tune.<br />
<br />
Pyra tried her best to light the rope or the wooden platform on fire, but for some reason her magic did not seem to work.  Da situation for everyone looked grim.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what say you?&quot; da king yelled.  &quot;Do they live, or die?&quot;<br />
<br />
All da dwarves started stomping deir feet and chanting in unison.  &quot;DIE!  DIE!  DIE!  DIE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought as much!  Besides, I was going to kill them anyway!&quot; All da dwarves laughed and cheered at da comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then!  Guards, kill them!  Kill them now in the meanest way for the big meanies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, all da hooded dwarves raised deir axes high over deir heads.  Treehugger kept his eyes on Medsa.  He saw her executioner tense his muscles, ready to swing da axe home.  Da ranger screamed da most rage-filled scream anyone had ever heard.<br />
<br />
Many of da onlooking dwarves were a little confused, and some scared.  But da king motioned to da guards to continue.<br />
<br />
And dat is when it happened....  All of a sudden, da ground shook slightly.<br />
<br />
Da spectators looked confused once again and began talking amongst demselves nervously.  Kazon, getting upset at interruptions, motioned again.<br />
<br />
Da ground shook again, dis time a bit stronger.   Den it continued to shake until rocks and stalagtites fell from da cavern ceiling.  Da dwarves started to scream in panic.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, from da middle of da arena, rocks exploded apart from da ground sending rubble flying everywhere.  Out smashed a big black form crashing through part of da wooden stage.<br />
<br />
Raising his glowing brown claymore high and shaking in rage, da Black Guardian, Earth, had come back to finish da deed he had been ordered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hundreds of dwarves scattered about as pieces of rock and debris flew everywhere.  Earth concentrated on wiping out as many of da little guys as possible, as well as any buildings dat da Guardian had missed on it's last visit to Kaladim.<br />
<br />
Da Elemental Guardian would kick, punch, and slash da dwarves sending many to deir deaths.  Sometimes a dwarf would escape da knight's blows, but Earth had a way of dealing wit dem.  Da Black Knight would slam it's sword downward and da blade would sink into da hard rock floor as if it were slicing through soft dirt.  When da knight did dis, da rock would reshape and da knight seemed to have limited control of da cavern itself.  A pillar of rock would shoot out of da ground, carrying a dwarf or dwarves skyward until it slammed into da cavern ceiling.  Da pillar would den sink back downward and reshape back to it's original rock form.  Many dwarven bloodstains matted da once beautiful, hand-carved ceiling.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves, though scattering, fought back against da knight.   Dey were dwarves after all, and dwarves are a hardy, stubborn bunch.  Dey hated uninvited guests.  Dey fought valiantly, but none were able to even visibly hurt da seemingly invulnerable knight.  Da more dey fought back, da more powerful da knight seemed to get.  Da battle looked hopeless, but still dey fought on.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Da wooden platform dat da party was on now creaked and shuddered.  Many of da legs dat had held it up had been destroyed or severely damage.  It tilted downward and continued to slowly pitch forward slightly, pointing da party directly into da black hole da knight had exploded from.<br />
<br />
Lilting had noticed a peg dat held one of his cords had been damaged.  Da halfling struggled and flexed his tiny muscles.  Da rope tightened and he felt da peg begin to give.  He pulled harder.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, da peg broke apart and sent da rope flying.  Lilting was able to pull out his tiny, tiny, oh-so tiny dagger and cut away at da udder cords holding him down.   It was slow going, because his dagger was so toothpick-size tiny.<br />
<br />
Da platform began creak and shudder again as it continued to pitch forward, ready to plummet da party to a seemingly bottomless grave.  Treehugger felt da ropes around his chest and da back of his neck tighten as gravity pulled his body forward.  He looked at Medsa.  Da cleric was terrified.<br />
<br />
Da ranger pulled hard to release himself but he could not make his bondaged situation any better.  He looked at Medsa again.  Da half-elf screamed in anger dat he could do nothing.<br />
<br />
Treehugger den felt a small, fast, vibration on da back of his wrist.  He turned his head around as much as he could and saw Lilting sawing away like mad wit his tiny, tiny, sewing needle of a dagger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilting!&quot; Treehugger yelled in delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!  I know!  I'm trying to hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da platform began to pick up speed in tilting forward as da weight of da group had shifted to da forefront.<br />
<br />
Treehugger pulled hard against da frayed part of da rope da halfling had made by his sawing.  Da rope snapped and ranger's hands became free.  He threw da rest of da ropes overhead easily escaping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilting, there's not enough time for you to save everyone!  I need something sharp and I need  it now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Treehugger quickly scanned da room.  Amidst all da fighting, he saw a display table nearby da arena doors.  On it were several items, including...<br />
<br />
&quot;My swords!&quot; da ranger yelled.  &quot;Lilting, go get em quick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting began chanting really fast.  &quot;Spirits of wolf come to me, make my feet as fast as fast can be!&quot;  Da halfling's feet shot out blue sparks and Lilting sped off like a bolt of lightning.<br />
<br />
Da ranger jumped to da back of da tilted platform to try and counter some of da weight.  It was useless, as much of it was from Bash.  Treehugger dropped carefully by Medsa and did his best to undo da knots dat kept her bound.  He strained, but it was no use.  Da knots were too tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Treehugger!&quot; shouted a blur.  Lilting had come by so fast da halfling was next to him before da voice had caught up wit him.  Lilting held out da ranger's swords.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get Pyra!&quot; excalimed da ranger.  Da halfling bolted in a flash over to da wizardess.<br />
<br />
Lilting sawed like mad against da ropes dat held da erudite down.  Once one of her hands was free, she easily set da rest of her ropes on fire.  Pyra easily broke free as da ropes became instantly weak and charred.  Both she and da halfling went to Yessir was right next to dem.<br />
<br />
&quot;How rude!&quot; said da paladin as da halfling and wizardess worked quickly to release him.  &quot;How rude of that big black guy to come and ruin a perfectly good and planned out execution!  I really hate party crashers!  Almost as much as I hate dragons!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da platform now was rapidly tipping forward and da group had but mere seconds to get off of it.  Treehugger slashed three times at da cleric, and da ropes dat tied her down were perfectly cut and Medsa had not even been touched by da ranger's swords.  He pulled her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jump!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked da cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jump off to the ground!  There isn't much time!  I need to rescue Bash!&quot;<br />
<br />
Medsa glanced nervously about, but nodded and ran up to da back of da platform, and jumped to safety.<br />
<br />
Da fire from da ropes dat Pyra had started quickly spread to da rest of da platform.  Lilting, Yessir, and Pyra worked frantically to get Bash free.  Da ogre did not try to help break da cords, but still lay dere staring blankly.<br />
<br />
Treehugger leaped through da flames.  Da platform was fastly approaching da point of no return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jump off!&quot; shouted da ranger.  &quot;Jump off now and I will save him!&quot;  Treehugger pointed one of his swords off to da side of da platform for da three of dem to jump.  Without hesitation, dey did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on big guy, help me out here!&quot; pleaded da ranger.  He sliced da ropes free and da ogre began to slide forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don't!&quot; said da ranger.  He grabbed onto da big ogre's wrist and tried to pull him back.  He slowed down da shaman, but 600 pounds of ogre is not an easy ting to stop.  He pulled wit all his half-elf might to try and get him back up da platform and drag him to safety.<br />
<br />
Medsa watched helplessly as da ranger and shaman teetered at da berry edge of da chasm.  She looked pleadingly to da rest of da party, but dey all looked back at her wit da same bit of helplessness.<br />
<br />
She watched and saw dat da ranger was making some progress sliding bash to da side of da platform.  If he could just get Bash over to da edge...<br />
<br />
Den, da raging fire caused one of da few supporting legs of da platform to crack and shift.  Da whole platform broke apart and tumbled forward, taking da ranger and ogre wit it.  Medsa stared in shock as she watched Treehugger and Bash disappear wit da burning debris into da black abyss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Excellent!&quot; da wizard cheered.  Da goblin had been witnessing everyting around Earth through his magical pool.  &quot;I hadn't known that Bash and his pals had actually made it to Kaladim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da goblin looked up and frowned at da gigantic Black Knight standing over him.  Fire tilted it's head down ashamedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that's right.  You were supposed to stop all oceanic travel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da goblin grinned again and began looking into da pool once more.  &quot;No matter!  The ogre is gone and what little, insignificant chance he had at stopping me has been nullified!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da wizard shook his fists wit glee as he watched da carnage and destruction of da hated dwarves and deir city.  Addressing someting else on his mind, he looked back up to his General of Elemental Guardians.<br />
<br />
&quot;On a somewhat similar note, are my new troops ready and waiting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Da huge black knight nodded it's head and den banged it's fist against it's dark breastplate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most excellent.  Let's have a look at them.  To the terrace!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da goblin walked hurriedly out of da torchlit chamber as Fire followed.  Dey both ascended a spiral staircase dat led dem up da tallest spire and eventually outside to da top of da castle.  Standing on a platform overlooking a spacious, fog-covered field, Smellybreath could see da red glint of thousands of eyes.<br />
<br />
On da ground, goblins, sarnaks, giants, cyclopses, and many other monsters stared high into da sky.  Above dem, about a hundred feet in da air, floated da ebony castle of Smellybreath.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<br />
Da loud ringing of a gigantic bell could barely be heard over da pain-filled screams and hate-filled warcries of hundreds of dwarves.  As da bell rang, many more armed dwarven guards came bursting from tunnels and udder places from da city.  Not only dat, but many other dwarven warriors seemed to appear dat obviously not had been part of da execution's spectators.<br />
<br />
Dwarves from all angles tried to swarm da big knight dat was destroying deir home, but da more dat came, da more dey were thrown like rag dolls when Earth slammed it's arm into da swarm.  Da ones dat evaded him were swallowed up in small chasms created when da knight slammed it's sword into da ground once more.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves dat survived even dat found dat even if dey got close enough, deir weapons had no effect on da knight or it's armor.  It was becoming quickly apparant dat all dey were doing was slowing down da inevitable.  Still, not a single dwarf gave up until he or she stopped breathing.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves had seemed to formulate a plan.  Dey were doing deir best to try and draw da knight back to da abyss it had came from.  It possible dis is what dey had done before, but who knows?  Dwarven bodies piled up, and still da bearded warriors charged on.  Earth moved, but only as an inconvenience.  All da knight needed to do was wait.  It would kill every last dwarf if dat what it took to regain his wizard's trust.  It no would fail him again.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<br />
Medsa, Lilting, Pyra, and Yessir all stared in shock into da empty, bottomless pit.  None of dem said a word.  Dey was too horrified and still unsure of what dey just saw.<br />
<br />
Da cleric den looked up and over to where da Elemental Guardian was laying waste to da tiny tings around it.  Medsa's nostrils flared and her breathing became heavy.  Her look of shock was replaced by one of pure, hate-filled rage.<br />
<br />
Da udders turned and looked as well.  Dey also no looked too happy.<br />
<br />
Medsa den let loose a blood-curdling scream and charged blindly into da direction of da black knight.  Da udders erupted into a scream as well and began running in da same direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<br />
Earth was destroying dwarves left and right.  Decapitating some here, crushing some dere.  If one could tell just by looking at a suit of armor what mood it was in, one could swear dat dis knight seemed to take extreme pleasure from killing dese little guys.<br />
<br />
Earth was in mid-swing of another killing blow when it was slammed by a magical force of red sparks.  Da force had picked it off it's feet and threw da knight a couple yards.  Landing on it's feet, Earth turned to see what it was dat had hit it.<br />
<br />
Da knight was greeted by a fireball to da face.   Helmeted head slamming backwards, da knight  swung it's arms to regain composurem only to find dem ensared by roots dat had instantly grown from da ground.<br />
<br />
Earth pulled it's arms inward as much as it could, bent downwards, and den threw out it's arms with such power dat da roots were shredded and broke away instantly.   Da party now had da knight's full attention.<br />
<br />
Yessir was da first to slam into da knight.  Rusty sword hacking away like crazy, da knight put one hand on his head and threw him to da ground.  Earth was now walking towards da small group of casters dat had angered it.<br />
<br />
Medsa threw her arms out and more red sparks flew from her fingers and slammed into da knight.  It did not throw it nearly as much as it had before.  Da knight seemed prepared for it.<br />
<br />
Pyra also shot anudder fireball at da knight.  Dis time, Earth stopped and thrust his sword into da rock floor beneath his feet.  Anudder pillar shot up from da ground in front of him, deflecting da fireball and sending molten debris everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fall back!&quot; shouted Medsa.<br />
<br />
Da group of casters turned and ran da way dey came.  Earth now broke into a trot after dem.  Dwarves and Yessir on da knight's heels, dey ran at full speed trying to keep up.<br />
<br />
Da knight caught up to da running cleric, grabbed her long braid of hair, and yanked her to a halt.  Da high-elf yelped in pain.  Den she screamed even louder as da knight lifted her up by her hair.<br />
<br />
While one hand holding da cleric several feet off da ground, da udder ****ed it's sword back to deliver da quick slice dat would end her life.  Medsa kicked, flailed and spit at da big knight.  It was no use.<br />
<br />
It was den dat a familiar shout was heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, punk!  Why don't you pick on someone your own size...&quot;<br />
<br />
Da knight's helmet turned slightly in da direction of da sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like my friend here!&quot;<br />
<br />
From da chasm dat da knight had come from, a giant, platinum gauntlet slammed itself down on to da ledge from below and grasped onto da rock floor.  Anudder hand came from below and slammed itself down.<br />
<br />
From da black abyss, up rose Bash Emgood wit Treehugger on his back hanging from da ogre's neck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Treehugger!&quot; Medsa screamed while dangling from Earth's massive hand.<br />
<br />
Da ranger sprang into action immediately.  As da ogre was still pulling himself out of da hole, Treehugger leapt off Bash's shoulders and began running at full speed at da Elemental guardian.<br />
<br />
Earth was a little confused at da whole situation.  All it saw was dis tiny half-elf sprinting towards it wit nostrils flaring and mouth wide open, screaming.<br />
<br />
Treehugger jumped high into da air and tucked his legs close to his body.  Flying wit tremendous speed towards da big knight, da ranger let loose when he was close enough and sent both feet slamming into Earth's helmet in a sideways, flying kick.  Da Black Knight staggered backwards a step and was stunned just long enough to drop Medsa back to da ground.<br />
<br />
Treehugger used da backlash of force from da impact to send himself into a backwards spin and land feet-first on da ground next to da cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; asked da ranger hurriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am now...&quot; Medsa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's regroup with the others.  Run!&quot;  Da ranger grabbed Medsa's hand and da two bolted towards da udders in deir group.<br />
<br />
Earth was clearly not happy.  Da knight began to charge but another onslaught of dwarves slammed into it from behind.  Tiny axes and hammers beat as hard as dey could onto da knight's backside.   It was enough time to give da party a chance for a plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I've got an idear,&quot; said Sir Yessir.  &quot;But it'll take all of us working together!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone huddled around da paladin to listen closely.  Everyone, dat is, except for Bash.  Lilting was da first to notice da big ogre wasn't wit his friends, but still standing at da same spot he was when Treehugger and him had crawled from da chasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash!&quot; shouted Lilting.  &quot;Come over here and help us, please?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ogre still stared blankly in da general direction of King Kazon, who was now running around like a chicken wit his head cut off wit all da commotion going on.<br />
<br />
Everyone from da group looked up from deir huddle to see dat Bash was still in a daze.  Dey sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; said Yessir, &quot;Slight change of plans then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sir Yessir turned to Pyra.  &quot;M'lady, do you know any ice spells?  Something that can slow down that big fella?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pyra frowned in confusion.  &quot;You mean like fire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, something like ice shards, ice blast, ice comet, something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What shards?  I don't understand.  Fire shards?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no.... ice.  You know, the opposite of fire.  Something different than fire!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something different than fire...?  You mean like green fire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean.... forget it.  Just do what you do best!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok everybody... here's what we're going to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Trollkilla was one of da best dwarven fighters dat he'd ever known.  While he never had any real evidence to support his theory, he was relatively sure he was da best in all of Kaladim.  When he heard dat a big meanhead had shown up and was killing all his friends, he knew what he had to do.  He knew dat if anyone could stop dis big dummy, it was him.<br />
<br />
He pulled a box from out of under his bed and opened it.  Inside gleamed two one-handed axes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya've never let me down before, lassies!  Today we shall be remembered in song!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trollkilla grabbed his two trusted axes in each hand and bolted to da main part of Kaladim where da black knight was.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing da Guardian, Trollkilla filled wit rage.  &quot;Ya shall die this day, scumbag!  Taste the wrath of Trollkilla!   Arrrrrrggggghhhhhh!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Earth heard another annoying little scream from dese tiny tings dat he was ordered to exterminate.  Da knight turned to see a dorf wit an axe in each hand charging at it at a blinding speed.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, da knight slammed it's sword into ground like it had done so many times before.  Da dorf was skyrocketed upward by a pillar of rock and was instantly squished into da ceiling.  Da pillar came downward as quickly as it went up, and up above was another bloody goo pile of dorf along wit all da udders.  Two axes dropped to da ground and on da handle of each said &quot;Propertee of Trollkilla.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before da knight had any real time to ponder da meaning of da axes' inscriptions, it felt someting slam into da side of it's head.  Shaking it off quickly, Earth saw da annoying half-elf was back and had bolted away.  Da knight raised it's sword high to slam into da ground, but was struck from da opposite side by an old paladin's head butt.<br />
<br />
Earth swung it's huge claymore at da paladin, but Yessir was backing off as quickly has he had come.    Den Earth was hit from da opposite side again by two kicks and some sword slaps.  It was da half-elf again.<br />
<br />
Shaking intensely in what only could be silent rage, da knight threw both it's arms high into da air and began charging da half-elf.  It decided it would not be distracted again. <br />
<br />
Treehugger ran as fast as he could to keep ahead of da knight.   He zipped around one of da cavern corners. <br />
<br />
Shaking da ground when each of his feet landed, da knight closed da gap between it and da ranger.  When Earth came around da corner, all he was a tiny halfling wit an evil grin on his face and a whole bunch of mushrooms growing on da rock walls.<br />
<br />
Lilting began waving his hands and blue sparks showered over all da mushrooms around him.  All of a sudden da mushrooms began growing bigger.  Dey looked like dey was filling up wit someting, like water filling up a deerskin flask.  And den it happened....<br />
<br />
Da mushrooms released millions of spores into da air.  Earth was blinded in da thick haze of mushroom seed.  Da knight began swinging wildly.  All it could hit was da walls of da cavern.  It den felt da slam of many dwarves and what could only be da annoying  paladin and ranger into his back.<br />
<br />
Sir Yessir howled in glee.  His plan was going pretty well so far.  He den signaled to Medsa who was waiting off in da distance.  &quot;Now, my dear!!!!&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
Medsa had stayed close to da king and when she heard Yessir's signal she cast a spell.  Da king lifted slowly into da air as da levitate spell was cast upon him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the?  What's going on?  Put me down now!  Now now now!&quot; da king demanded.<br />
<br />
Medsa ran towards da king and den slammed her shoulder into him.  Da king sped across da cavern floor like an air-hockey puck.  Wit no friction to slow him down, he zoomed berry far and at a decent speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that?!&quot; da king shouted angrily.  &quot;Where am I going?!&quot;  Da king turned in da direction to see exactly where was going.  At da end of his trajectory was a berry dazed, berry happy Bash ready to greet him wit open arms.<br />
<br />
Da ogre picked up da chicken-greased soaked king.  Two ogre chomps and he was safely inside Bash's tummy.  Immediately Bash's eyes became unglazed.  He looked around as if he had woke up from a nap.<br />
<br />
&quot;What going on?&quot; da ogre said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash!&quot; shouted Lilting.  &quot;Help us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok den!&quot; shouted Bash.<br />
<br />
Just den a very loud noise shook da entire cavern, like indoor thunder.  Dwarves and party members alike flew in different directions from da impact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh.&quot; da ogre said.  &quot;Dis no look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Earth had apparently had enough wit playing around.  Standing up from a crouch, da knight had become twice da size it was before, and black, jagged pieces of rock jutted out from all over it's armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earth slammed it's fist into corner of da cave wall he stood next to.  It's newly spiked fist exploded through it like da rock was made of paper.  Hundreds of shards of splintered rock were sent flying everywhere.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves took most of da shrapnel, especially da ones closest to da knight.  Da most unfortunate were da ones right next to da knight who either caught Earth's fist's follow through or received da rock shards at point blank range.  Dese dwarves were instantly killed.  Many udder dwarves dropped to da ground, howling in pain as jagged rock bits protruded from deir legs, arms, abdomens, or in da worst of cases, skulls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charge him!&quot; shouted Treehugger, who had landed from a side-jump dat avoided da explosion.<br />
<br />
Amongst da dwarves, an old man in squeaky armor arose.  Sir Yessir lifted his sword and shield, screamed a warcry, and did as Treehugger suggested.  Da ranger joined in.  Da dwarves dat were uninjured or could still move, moved as one along wit da two warriors.<br />
<br />
Da massive group slammed into da Guardian, but it almost had no effect.  Earth did move backwards slightly, but da big knight charged as well shortly afterwards.  Da group had no choice but to move wit da massive figure.<br />
<br />
Treehugger slapped his swords against da now-covered-wit-sharp-rock-tings armor.  Earth, once again, slammed it's sword into da ground.<br />
<br />
Da ground beneath da ranger's feet began to shift and da half-elf was shooting skyward on a fast moving pillar.  Da ranger quickly crouched and leapt off.<br />
<br />
Earth expected dis and was sending anudder pillar upwards underneath da ranger.  Da ranger landed on it, and jumped off in kind.  Anudder pillar raced up.<br />
<br />
Da ranger leapt from new pillar to new pillar, but each one he landed on was coming closer and closer to da cave ceiling.  Da ranger landed on one and rolled off just as it slammed into da ceiling.  Da  thundering crack made da ranger's ears ring in pain.<br />
<br />
But dis was not nearly as painful as when da ranger landed on da ground.  Treehugger had landed on his side, and his knee had been da first ting to hit.  His left thigh bone gave a lound *SNAP!*<br />
<br />
Treehugger screamed.<br />
<br />
Lilting watched da whole ting.  Da halfling became  angry.  He shot a mean face at Earth and yelled, &quot;You stupid mean guy!  Face the wrath of a druid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da little halfling, his speed spell still in effect,  zoomed past all da dwarved and ran right up to da  knight.  Standing next to it's calf, Lilting pulled out his tiny, tiny, oh so tiny dagger.  Lilting den began stabbing wit all his might into da black armor.  Tiny *tink tink tink*s could be heard.<br />
<br />
Dey had no effect.<br />
<br />
Da black knight looked down and saw da halfling dat was part of da group dat had annoyed it since it's arrival.  Wit it's free hand Earth palmed Lilting's head, closed it's fingers around his skull, and lifted da halfling up.  Da black knight den began to squeeze slowly.<br />
<br />
Lilting wailed in pain.  Da pressure around his head was intense.  He knew dis was far worse dan a migraine, and it got progressively worse.  His vision started to go black.<br />
<br />
Earth looked downward at da pathetic ting it had in it's hand.  Soon to be one down, and several more to go.  Dis would prove to Smellybreath dat it was capable of following orders.  Dis would prove dat...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dumbhead!&quot; said a voice.<br />
<br />
Earth looked up to see a big ogre standing before it.<br />
<br />
&quot;If anyone gonna squish dat druid, it gonna be me!&quot; da ogre said berry, berry angrily.<br />
<br />
Bash quickly swung his hammer wit both hands to his far right, and once ****ed, let it fly home towards da knight.  Having to aim slightly upward since da knight had grown bigger, da ogre still could easily reach da knight's head.<br />
<br />
Da hammer connected wit such force dat it made da knight spin in a complete circle.  Lilting flew from his grip and slammed into one of da cave walls.  Earth stumbled to one knee as it regained it's balance.  Bash let da swing take his hammer to da udder side of his body.  Once in position, he swung upward in a great arc, uppercutting da knight.<br />
<br />
Earth's head snapped upward as da hammer hit it squarely.  It's whole body was lifted slightly off da ground from da force and he flew backwards a few feet.  It landed on it's armor plated bum, and  it's arms outstretched behind it to stable itself on da ground.<br />
<br />
Bash stomped towards da knight and raised his hammer high above his head for a downward smash.  Da ogre felt his hammer glow warm for a split second.  He den, for some reason, felt his armor do sa same ting along wit da hammer.  Da glow was gone as quickly as it had come.  Bash tensed his muscles and den swung his hammer towards da knight's head.<br />
<br />
Earth swung it's sword upward and it collided wit da hammer.  It did not slice through da wondrous ogre weapon, but it did deflect it.  Da vibrating shock caused Bash to momentarily lose focus.<br />
<br />
Earth saw it's chance.  It quickly lurched forward and slammed it's fist into da ogre's stomach.  Bash was sent flying backwards at a tremendous speed.  Da ogre slammed into da rock wall.  Da impact sent cracks racing along da side of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; screamed an overly Smellybreath dat was also jumping up and down excitedly while gazing into his magic pool.  Da goblin was watching da massacre his Elemental Guardian Knight of Earth was producing to da goodie goodie race of da dwarves.  He was even more pleased to see dat da Knight was about to kill two birds wit one stone, having witnessed da surprising appearance of da one party he wanted most dead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kill him!  Finish him!&quot; da goblin screamed as if Earth could hear him as if Smellybreath were right beside him.  &quot;Finish that meddlesome ogre and his friends!  Destroy him and then shatter his heart to pieces!  I command you!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Earth suddenly bolted upright as if someting had startled him, and den without hesitation headed straight for da prone ogre.  Bash's eyes could see da massive form coming towards him, but as he blinked dazedly at it, he saw a lot of sparkles too ever since he impacted wit da rock wall.<br />
<br />
Da ogre attempted to prop himself up and his arm shook violently from da effort.  Bash was beginning to realize if he would be able to defend himself in time.  Earth stomped over top of him and lifted it's huge claymore once again, preparing to drive da killing blow home.<br />
<br />
Da Knight swung hard and sent da blade careening down towards da ogre.  Bash could not lift his hammer quick enough, his limbs were not responding properly.  Da ogre closed his eyes tightly and silently waited for his inevitable fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me sorry mudder, fadder, and Smash.&quot; thought da ogre.  &quot;Me sorry me failed yous.&quot;<br />
<br />
**CLANG!!!!!**<br />
<br />
Dat was not a sound Bash was expecting.  Bash was also not expecting to have continued thoughts like dis, as death should have ceased dem.  Da ogre opened his eyes and to his surprise he saw three swords holding up da giant Claymore, blocking it from completing it's intended kill.<br />
<br />
Treehugger on one leg (his other dangling limply) and Yessir were holding up da giant sword wit strained effort.  Den immediately Pyra popped up in front of Bash and said some arcane words.  Bash felt heat being drawn from all da air around him, it rushed past him and seemed to converge into a tiny, bright point in front of da wizardess.  Pyra den made motioned her hands forward and da tiny ball erupted and sent a gigantic blast of searing air towards da Knight.  Da Guardian shot backward like a canonball and after a couple hundred feet slammed into da opposite rock wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you move, Bash?&quot; asked Medsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me.... me no sure.&quot; da ogre wheezed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, this might help,&quot; da cleric said and den quickly cast a spell dat illuminated Bash's entire body for a split second.<br />
<br />
Bash felt invigorated and almost totally refreshed.  He still felt berry sore, but he found he could at least move once more.  Da ogre stood up, grabbed his hammer off da ground, and den focused his gaze on da Knight who was getting back up.  Bash thought about what was happening around him.  He thought about all da pain and suffering dis ting had caused.  All da pain and suffering Smellybreath had caused.  All da death.  Rage den began to fill him.<br />
<br />
Bash's hammer started to glow and pulse as he stomped towards da gigantic Knight.  His face was contorted in fury.  Da Knight sent it's sword into da ground like it had done before and sent a pillar of rock upwards.  Bash sidestepped it and smashed his hammer through da pillar of rock like it was made of glass sending rock shards flying everywhere, never once taking his eyes off da knight.<br />
<br />
Earth seemed a little confused at dis change of events.  It sent two more pillars at da ogre, but both were demolished by da ogre's hammer as well.<br />
<br />
Bash reached da Black Knight.  Earth swung it's sword at Bash and da ogre parried it without a thought.  It swung again and again, and Bash deflected dem both as if he were batting away Lilting's Tiny, Tiny, Oh-So-Tiny dagger.  Da ogre thrust his hammer forward and jabbedda  top of it right into da Knight's midsection.  Da Knight doubled over in what appeared to be pain, but made no sound of it's own.  Only da sound of stone slamming into metal was heard.<br />
<br />
Bash den began to beat da knight wit it's hammer.  Da knight attempted to block, but each was too slow and da ogre was gaining more power and speed.  Each successive blow of da hammer was causing da knight to wobble and double over in pain.  It took steps backward wit each hit and was having a harder and harder time to remain standing.<br />
<br />
Earth swung it's claymore a final time wit all it's might and Bash swung his hammer to meet it.  Da hammer, now pulsating violently, met da sword, and with a thundering clap, shattered into hundreds of pieces.  Da ogre den immediately changed direction of da hammer and slammed it down into da Knight.<br />
<br />
Earth was at a loss. It didn't know what to do.  It's sword was gone, it was feeling pain, it was losing.  It did da only ting it could do.  It pulled out it's teleportation stone and began to trace da runic symbol on it's face.<br />
<br />
Bash saw da knight pull out da stone and begin to trace.  He remembered anudder Knight doing dis exact same ting.  Pure anger flooded him.  And if someone watched closely, one could swear his eyes began to burn bright orange like a raging fire. <br />
<br />
Bash twisted his entire torso and brought his hammer down close to da ground behind him.  Earth was almost finished tracing da symbol on da stone.  Da ogre den spun around and wit a windmill-like maneuver, sent his hammer into da &quot;chin&quot; of da Knight's helmet in a powerful uppercut.  Da impact from da hammer sent a visible shockwave outward as da hammer transferred it's energy into da blow.  Da Knight's head violently snapped back and da knight flew backwards and landed on it's back.<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Smellybreath watched as da ogre smashed his Guardian to pieces.  He gripped da sides of his pool in frustration, anger, shock, and tension.  Den da ogre delivered a final uppercutting blow to da knight and at da moment of impact, da goblin's pool went immediately pitch black.  Smellybreath no longer could see what was happening around da Knight, and da goblin knew all too well what dat meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOOOO!!!!!&quot; he screamed.  &quot;That wasn't supposed to happen!!!!!&quot;  Smellybreath roared a growl and den ran out of da room and to da top of his floating castle.<br />
<br />
Looking over da thousands and thousands of evil creatures who have come to serve him, he began to speak.  All dose around for miles seemed to be able to hear him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next phase of my plan will begin sooner than expected.  You all know your duties.  GO!  NOW!!!!  I COMMAND IT!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da thousands of creatures all turned in different directions and began to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll show that stupid ogre what pain truly is, if I have to do it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
<br />
Earth twitched for a couple seconds and den stopped.  Everyone stood over it, gazing down at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think is inside that armor?&quot; asked Lilting.<br />
<br />
Da halfling's question was quickly answered.  Da knight's helmet rolled off it's body to reveal what lay inside.  Everyone gasped as they saw someting dey weren't expecting.<br />
<br />
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing had been inside da empty suit of armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird.&quot; said Bash.  And den da ogre collapsed from exhaustion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pain.  It a weird ting.  It is a form of touch in it's most extreme fashion, derefore it is rooted in pleasure.  Pain is what Bash was feeling as his world was dark.  It was not a fun feeling, but it also was welcomed.  For yous see, as long as da ogre knew he was feeling pain he knew he was alive.<br />
<br />
Bash thought he heard someone calling his name somewhere off in da distance, but he no could see anyting.  It was just a black void around him.  Da person calling his name seemed to get louder and louder as da seconds wore on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Who was it?  Who was calling him?<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da voice sounded almost melodic.  Almost.... pretty, somehow.  As da voice grew louder in da black expanse, da shaman began to envision a face dat belonged to dat voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da image of a beautiful scantily clad ogress appeared.  She floated towards da ogre and lovingly caressed his face and whispered into his ear....<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash, wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da beautiful ogress made Bash feel good.  He felt compelled to do as she said.  He wanted so much to meet her.  Bash opened his eyes as she spoke once more while playfully tapping his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash, get up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bash slowly opened his eyes expecting to see da beautiful vision he just imagined.  Instead, he found Lilting jumping on his chest and occasionally smacking his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bash, wake up Bash!&quot; da Halfling kept saying while jumping up and down on da big ogre's chest.  &quot;Oh good, you're awake!   We were worried about you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ogre would have probably eaten da tiny druid at dis point, but he was too tired and sore to even care at dis point.  In fact, he may even admitted to a slight sense of gladness at seeing his tiny friend again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happen?&quot; da ogre whispered hoarsely while da halfling jumped down and called for da udders to come in.  Da ogre noticed he was a tiny, but very ornately decorated room.  Da tiny bed, or beds (as dere were at least 8 of dem next to each udder under him to support his huge frame) were berry comfortable.<br />
<br />
Lilting came in wit all of Bash's  friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're awake!&quot; said Treehugger.  &quot;Rock on, big guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's one fine healing job these little bearded fellows' priests did on ya!&quot; da old paladin Sir Yessir said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention help from one fine looking high elf cleric!&quot; said da ranger as he winked Medsa's way.  Da cleric just gave him a scowl back, but no could hide her red cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to cauterize all your wounds with fire,&quot; Pyra said.  &quot;But they wouldn't let me near you!  Fire can heal!  I know it can!  Fire is the cure-all for everything!  In fact, maybe there's some wounds left on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Medsa put a stop to Pyra's looking Bash over.  &quot;We're glad you're all right Bash.  You've been out for almost two days!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes yes!&quot; said Lilting excitedly.  &quot;But now you're awake!  Everyone's been waiting!  The queen said we can't have the meeting until the hero has awakened!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurmph!&quot; da old paladin said.  &quot;I thought we were all heroes here!  Even though there was no dragon to slay, I'd say saving a town full of gnarly munchkins is worth hero status to them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course,&quot; said Pyra.  &quot;We all helped.  But Bash is the one who finally killed that.... that... thing. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it really dead?&quot; asked Bash as he sat up a little in bed.  It hurt, but he was glad to do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep yep yep!&quot; said Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead as a doornail,&quot; da ranger said with a grin.  &quot;The Royal Seer wanted to put the hollow armor up in the main square as a testament to the dwarves hardiness, and also as a warning to all baddies that think about trying something like that again here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why didn't he?&quot; da ogre asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Medsa chimed in, &quot;as they were about to go for the armor, a bunch of dwarves dressed all in black, form-fitting clothes with black cowls over their faces covering everything but their eyes, rushed in and grabbed the all the pieces of armor before anyone else could get near it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frickin' ninjas!&quot; Sir Yessir spat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
<br />
Da courtyard was completely packed wit dwarves.  Each of dem stomping, cheering, hooting, and howling madly wit joy.  Da six friends stood alongside each udder before da dwarf Queen Nozak while she stood beside her new king and former Royal Seer.  Several others stood beside dem, including Bob da Geistmeister, swordsman of legend.<br />
<br />
Da dwarves continued to shake da berry rock walls wit deir cheering until da queen held up her hand.  Dey instantly shut up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have gathered here to honor ones whom were wrongly accused by my late ex husband.&quot; da queen said aloud loudly.  Bash's stomach still had a little indigestion from dat particular meal, and shamefully shifted his eyes from side to side.  &quot;A loss, I doubt we will surely miss.  I know I won't.  For these beings who were sought to be executed ended up saving us all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da cheering erupted again and went on for several minutes.  Da queen again silenced dem and continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;For their bravery in defending a city that which had seemed to betray them, I offer not only my gratitude but the pledge of the entire dwarf nation should they ever need our help.  If there is any one among us who still holds ill-will towards this group, let him speak now and be forever outcast by me.&quot;<br />
<br />
No dwarf made a peep.  None dared to, but none also bore any hatred towarda da group.  Before, dey were just going along wit da king's promptings.  Now dey had been freed from his iron fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then so it let it be.  From this day forward, I decree these six to be.... honorary dwarves!&quot;<br />
<br />
When da party thought da dwarves couldn't have gotten any louder, dey did.  Dey roared and cheered, stomped and flailed about.  Dwarves dat were standing behind dem slapped deir backs.  Pyra and Medsa got a few more slaps dan most and, oddly enough, so did Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; thought Bash.  &quot;Honorary dorf?  Me never gonna live dis one down back at Oggok!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you, brother and sister dwarves,&quot; da queen said to da party.  And den she and da king bowed to dem.  And as dey did, so did da entire clan of Kaladim.  After several seconds da queen and everyone else stood back up straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some more pieces of business to attend to before you friends depart on your way.  The last of which is some information which may be able to aid you on your quest.  But the first...&quot; da queen motioned to Bob.<br />
<br />
Da swordsman stepped forward and approached Treehugger.  He pulled out his gleaming swords, an held da hilts towards da ranger.  Treehugger just looked down in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the best swordsman I have met yet!&quot; da Geistmeister said loudly.<br />
<br />
Treehugger just stammered.  &quot;But I, I....I haven't done nearly the amazing things you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob just rolled his eyes and smiled.  He leaned in towards da ranger and said quietly so only Treehugger could hear, &quot;There is a lot more to being a great swordsman than just swinging around hunks of metal, my boy.  You take care of these babies, ok?&quot;  And den pulled back and winked.<br />
<br />
Everyone cheered.<br />
<br />
An old dwarf wizard den stepped forward.  &quot;I have something for the young lady with the fire in her eyes and ....er.... fire in her hair.&quot;  Pyra quickly pinched out a small ember in her hair.   &quot;A scroll that unlocks many mysteries the flames of the earth, but also many other elements.  Use them well!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone cheered again.<br />
<br />
A dwarven cleric stepped forward.  For the other young lady, we offer a robe like the ones we high-dwarven clerics wear.  Recently made slightly larger, of course.  Da dwarf held up a beautiful white robe wit light blue flowing lines throughout it.  A golden symbol of da dwarf cleric's guild was embroidered on da back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Medsa said bashfully.<br />
<br />
Everyone cheered yet again.<br />
<br />
Another dwarf stepped forward.  &quot;For the brave knight, we borrowed your mighty shield and bathed it in a precious mineral and imbued it with more strength than it previously had!&quot;  Da dwarf den held up da trashcan lid and everyone noticed it was now plated in gold.<br />
<br />
Everyone cheered, yet again of course.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the ogre &quot; the queen said, &quot;We will give you information on all that you seek.  We have been informed about your plight and may know some information.  It is not much, but it is what we have to give.&quot;<br />
<br />
Voices were getting hoarse from cheering, yet dey still did.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; said Lilting jumping up and down excitedly. &quot;What do I get?!  What do I get?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another old dwarf stepped forward. &quot;Since we have seen your prowess in battle, it is only fitting that we give you.... this.&quot;  Da dwarf pulled out a tiny, tiny, oh-so-so tiny scabbard wit da halfling's name printed on it in fine letters.  Unfortunately it was misspelled &quot;Loltang.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone else in da group winced at such a lousy gift compared to da udders.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I get this little sheath?&quot; da Halfling looked up at da queen questioningly wit a raised eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;COOL!&quot; da halfling said wit a huge grin and put his tiny blade into it's new home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash rolled da smooth stone in his hand examining it thoroughly as he and da group trudged through da mountains.  Dis stone was found at da site where he had killed da Black Knight. He had seen a stone similar to dis before when he was in da barbarian town, and it was used by a similar knight.  Bash looked at da rune carved deeply into da stone.<br />
<br />
Da party had been marching for over a day through da mountains of Butcherblock.  Smoke was visible in da horizon coming from da other side of one of da mountain ranges, and da group was beelining directly for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, does it work?&quot; asked a highly inquisitive Lilting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; said a startled Bash as he was brought of his concentration.  &quot;Oh.  No, me no tink so.  It have a large crack in it.  See?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most likely caused during the fight by an overzealous swordsman,&quot; said Medsa sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh whatever, babe!&quot; began Treehugger.  &quot;Besides, the only thing I like to crack-up around here is you!&quot;  Da ranger winked at da high elf.<br />
<br />
Medsa tried to her best to maintain her scowl, but could fight da growing grin on her face no longer.  She gave in and let it spread across her face.  It was a good feeling for her, one she was not used to.<br />
<br />
Bash turned back to da erudite wizardess.  &quot;What do you make of dis, Pyra?  Do yous tink it could be fixed, or maybe teach us how to make one of our own?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pyra examined da stone.  &quot;Hmmm.  There is a very powerful magic about this stone, and that is even after much of it has faded!  I do not recognize the enchantment placed upon it and a rune such as this needs to be fully in tact for the magic to work.  A broken seal forever disrupts the magic placed upon it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da ogre growled in frustration. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dere has to be someting dat we can do to make use of dis ting!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; said Pyra while contemplating about it.  &quot;Though the stone itself can never be repaired or used to teleport us, it may be possible for a powerful enchanter to use what is left of the fading magic about this stone  to point us in the direction of similarly enchanted items.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So dat would mean...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yessir bounded up and exclaimed with excitement, &quot;That we could find the legendary teleporting dragon, PortMePlz!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone turned around to look da paladin in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; the paladin stammered and corrected himself.  &quot;I mean we could track down the location of one of these other stones and therefore....&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilting chimed in, &quot;Find another one of those big meanheads with the big swords!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So where is an enchanter, den?&quot; Bash asked.  &quot;Da queen told us we needed to head to some elf city where dey all get stoned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;High Elf.&quot; said Medsa after making a  correcting, coughing noise.  &quot;And it just so happens, that the best enchanters in the entire land reside in that city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Bash.  &quot;Dat's extremely convenient!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
<br />
Da city of Felwithe was not as bustling as it once was.  It was obvious it was still trying to repair itself after da attack dey suffered at da hands of da Black Knight. Though hundreds of high elves were salughtered, many still survived.  Including da city's Prime Minister, Minister Snobson.  Da Minister paced back and forth among da rubble dat used to be his office building.<br />
<br />
A High Elf ran into what was left of da Prime Minister's office, panting and wheezing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Report.&quot; said da Minister calmly and with authority.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been sorting through the mess for days.  The council is completely obliterated.  They were all in the same building when the attack hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the Building of Law has been destroyed!  I swear....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Minister.  The Building of Law still stands.  The council all happened to be attending a rather diferent meeting of sorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's just say that 'The Lap-Dancing Elf' bar is now a pile of ash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Curse their old bones!&quot; da minister said angrily while spitting on da floor.  &quot;Well it's not like I didn't see that coming.  What of the people?  The clerics?  The enchanters?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Casualties are still coming in.  Things don't look good.  Some clerics survived and have been working around the clock to help those who didn't outright perish.  But the enchanter's guild, well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get on with it.  I am beyond shock at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the enchanter's guild was completely oblierated as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da Prime Minister's eyes snapped open in shock.  He den turned around and stared solemnly out into da city, looking at nothing in particular.<br />
<br />
Sir, if I may,&quot; da other high elf began, &quot;Perhaps we should seek help from our neighbors the wood elves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; da Minister turned around to face da elf once again.  &quot;Those bumbling fools?  They'd likely all fall flat on their faces at the same time and destroy what's left of this city!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I think that they might be willing to... if we just but asked nicely....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just den another high elf ran into what was left of Minister Snobson's office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Minister!  One is alive! An enchanter still lives!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; da Minister asked in disbelief. &quot;Where? How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's in the clerical ward.  His chances do not look good though.  It is said he may not live through the night, despite our clerics best efforts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Da Prime Minister sighed.  &quot;Of course.  I have yet to hear any good news, why was I expecting this to be any different.  Tell me, which enchanter is this that we may have to carve a tombstone for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the best enchanters we had, sir.  Mr. Mezzer.&quot;</div></div><hr />
