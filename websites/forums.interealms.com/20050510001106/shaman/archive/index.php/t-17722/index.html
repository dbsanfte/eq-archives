<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zamiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How exactly does migitation work?<br />
<br />
For instance, if you use Turgur's Insects on a mob that migitates 50%, will he be slowed 37.5%? Or 50%?<br />
<br />
If the second is the case, then would it be more mana efficiant to just use lower level slows if all the mobs you are fighting will be migitating? (Like in a Plane of Earth ring.)<br />
<br />
A fellow shaman asked me if this was the case. If we used lower level slows, not only would we be saving mana (which isn't an issue at all, lol) but would be generating less aggro and could be slowing faster.<br />
<br />
However, if the first situation is the case, where it migitates the percentage of the slow you are using, then obviously you would just use the most powerful slow.<br />
<br />
So which is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I seem to recall casting Grummus on trash mobs in my first 'hard' adventure and getting no mitigation message.  That would indicate that 'maximum slow' is a set number rather than a scaling percentage (trash mobs mitigate 'slightly' in hard adventures).  I could be imagining it though.<br />
<br />
FWIW, debuffs seem to be assigned X amount of aggro based on what family of spells they come from, rather than how strong the specific spell you're casting is.  Cripple generates the same hate as Weaken, Turgurs generates the same hate as Tagars, Festering Darkness generates the same hate as Clinging Darkness, etc, so you probably won't wind up getting less aggro by using a lower level slow spell.  Still, there's a lot to be said for using a faster casting, lower mana spell if the net effect is going to be the same anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, always use your best slow. It's a scaling percentage, not a set number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mob_01 is Partially effected means your spell did approximately 30% of it's total ability (ie 30% of 75% for tugurs or ~26%)<br />
<br />
Mob_02 is Somewhat effected means 50% of 75% (37.5%)<br />
<br />
Mob_03 is Moslty effected means 70% of 75% (~49%)<br />
<br />
using a lower lvl spell will only make the slow less.  It's all a percentage game.<br />
<br />
the mitigation messages not exact as are the percentages.  It's just a basic rundown of how the system works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL Migitation.  My GL's name is Migatol and this just struck me as very funny.<br />
<br />
I think you meant Mitigation, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yup, I was wrong.  Tested it tonight in HoH, got 'Mostly' for Grummus and Tugurs on the same mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not really worth casting ya lower slows ...<br />
<br />
Turgurs is 3 sec (or less with Spell Haste)cast and saves versus MR, lasts for 6+ mins and slows 75% for 250 mana ...<br />
<br />
Togors is 5 sec (or less with Spell Haste) cast and saves versus MR+15, lasts for 3 mins and only slows 70% for 175 mana...  (so it cast slower, resists more, has a lower % slow and don't last as long) ...<br />
<br />
So for the extra 75 mana, its worth the longer duration, less resists and better % slow )<br />
<br />
As far as mitigation goes, it scales with the % slow ... meaning, no matter what mitigation message you get, Shaman will still have the most effective slow ...<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
