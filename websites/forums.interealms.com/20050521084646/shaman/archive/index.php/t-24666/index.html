<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I'm currently at the New Orleans Fan Faire. The server BOTB competition is going on and it's pretty fun. I'm typing on a non ergonomic keyboard and it blows, so apologies for any typos.<br />
<br />
1. Pet Dual Wield<br />
Our pet is going to be changed to innately dual wield! This came straight from Rytan during the spells/AA panel discussion. He also said our pet should have around 4200 hitpoints. Very good news!!<br />
<br />
2. Pure Spirit<br />
Rytan said it had come to his attention that Pure Spirit is not acting as intended. It should remove a detrimental effect without requiring 5-6 casts. Expect this spell to be fixed shortly!<br />
<br />
3. Spirit of Might/Champion stacking<br />
Should be fixed soon.<br />
<br />
4. Dot aggro<br />
I brought this up at the Guild Summit and I brought it up again at Fan Faire - Rytan says he's done a bunch of research and can't figure out why we are getting such terrible dot aggro. He said he has tried numerous scenarios to try to duplicate the aggro. <br />
<br />
5. HOT/DOT crit messages<br />
Rytan said he wasn't opposed to the concept of crit messages, but he said it would be difficult to implement. He said it would be really difficult to return the message to the caster, but it might be possible to have the crit messages displayed to the recipient. <br />
<br />
6. Out of group shrink confirmation box<br />
Rytan isn't opposed to the concept, but he says it's really difficult to implement.<br />
<br />
7. Nadox not working out of group<br />
By design, no group cures work out of group.<br />
<br />
8. Endurance Regen<br />
Shaman aren't likely to get any spell/AA to regen endurance, by design. Rytan said he didn't want melees to be dependent on a buff, so he built endurance regen into melee characters.<br />
<br />
9. Pet melee range<br />
Improved! Someone at the panel said that pet melee range had been tied to the &quot;art&quot; previously (and their tiny paws). <br />
<br />
10. Group haste to match our single target haste<br />
Rytan's only comment was &quot;no comment&quot; :(<br />
<br />
11. Spiritual Channeling <br />
I talked to Rashere and he says that SC shouldn't check to see if the shaman has mana and he's going to try to get that fixed.<br />
<br />
12. Call of the Wild<br />
Rashere also said that Call of the Wild is not supposed to return a player to their corpse without rez effects - expect that to be changed.<br />
<br />
I want to be clear here, it was a very good conversation. We were in a room full of tons of people, so I was lucky to pester Rytan and Rashere about so many questions. There's still one more night of the Fan Faire, so I hope to still get a chance to ask Rytan about slow mitigation and improved healing. <br />
<br />
Expect another update on Monday! (I get in super late on Sunday night).<br />

<br />
...... /boogle.... serious /boogle.  At this point, I pretty much give up even attempting debate if Rytan can't even duplicate poison dot aggro.  On the other hand... with the plethra of good aggro weapons now, I find it hard to pull aggro on raid targets.  I used to be able to say... &quot;Hey, you guys see the wizards critting for 8k... watch this, bet I can get summoned in under 45 seconds.  Raid group is like, no way man.  Load up the poison dots, bam, dead&quot;.  But now, especially against hybrids, I can pretty much chain cast poison dots and not pull aggro.  Course these are pretty pimped out tanks.  Normal exp groups are still hell.<br />

Toss'd our dog a bone.  Should have happened ages ago.<br />
<br />
10. Group haste to match our single target haste<br />
Rytan's only comment was &quot;no comment&quot; <br />
<br />
Why is this even a issue?  <br />
Enc slow 70%.  Enc haste 70% + melee crit.  = 140% of adjustment<br />
Shaman slow 75%, Shaman haste 50% + nothing = 125% of adjustment.  I really don't understand why there's a discrepancy.  <br />
<br />
I don't know any casters that will step foot in PG without crack.  I've grouped there about 15 times now, and I have yet to see a cleric that can function without C.  Clarity + CC is still very, very useful.  Its not like this is a game breaking thing to give us 10% more haste to match our single target.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Tell Rytan, thanks for looking into fixing the things that were obviously not tested to begin with.  You can also say for me, thanks for making our dog able to stand two rounds of mob dmg rather than one soon.  You can also thank him for letting our pet duel wield, effectively emptying one bag that was otherwise filled with rusty weapons.  <br />
<br />
Out of group shrink, dot aggro, group haste PLUS a modifier equivalent to enc's, combine some of our buffs, increase our blast heal, then I'll say its a good day:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">4. Dot aggro<br />

<br />
Forgive me, as it's 4am (well, technically 3, but I havent changed my clocks yet..), but doesn't Rytan have a 50 some odd shaman?<br />
I recall my 50's.. my aggro in groups wasn't terribly awful, coulda just been me slacking though, as I recall folks telling me that turgurs was mad crazy aggro, yet i hardly ever had an issue when i got it. poison dots werent that bad either. once I got saryrn... Oye! that was some aggro there.. Bane of nife was pretty rough. I can still usually gank aggro if I choose to, and we definately have the tools to gank it if we want to (often want to or not).<br />
<br />
On raids, I make sure I hardly ever get aggro, I don't wanna see my name in the HOTT window, esp on the raid target. (not that I'd live long if it's quadding for 2k).  But, a 50 shaman trying to get similar aggro issues we have at 65-70? meh... doesn't add up to me.. but im half awake too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It makes sense that FD hasn't been nerfed for necros now. If Developers realized how much aggro DoTs generated, FD would have never cleared DoT aggro.<br />
I still can't see what's so hard about researching DoT aggro. Copy paste a Shaman and a warrior to your beta server and go at a mob, Rytan.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well he didn't say he cant duplicate it.<br />
He said he cant figure out what is causing it.<br />
<br />
I had written a post that was much debated awhile back that I think the counters are the cause and they are being appilied (aggro from counters)every tick.<br />
There are other theroies out there though.<br />
<br />
I can say that SCS and other aggro reducers do not seem to effect DoTs past the initial casts. Therefore the only possibility is there a problem somewhere past the initial aggro check, and quite possibly a check statement missing that should be reducing aggro on ticks in the DoT code.<br />
<br />
Basically though somebody needs to go through the fight code where DoT damage is applied.<br />
There is some sort of aggro multiplier adding into our spells from SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
I think the first thing we need to straighten out with Rytan is a pretty simple question. Do counters add aggro?<br />
<br />
My next question would be did he make beta versions of all our DoTs without counters to test aggro with and without the counters to confirm his above answer ;)<br />
<br />
If it isnt the counters there still has to be something in where or how our damage is applied. It is obviously a different section of code than nuke damage. A comparion of the 2 sections of code and their placement could prove enlightening.<br />
IE Somebody has suggested our DoTs could be generating aggro as melee damage rather than non-melee.<br />
<br />
In any case there is no excuses not to have an answer even if they have to recode DoT completely.<br />
<br />
Maybe I can manage Vegas in the spring and corner Rytan ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">- 5 will supposedly lead to a positive change<br />
- 2 are difficult to implement<br />
- 2 either get &quot;no comment&quot; or a &quot;no idea why things are as they are&quot;<br />
- 2 get a straight no<br />
- 1 is a &quot;nerf&quot;<br />
<br />
While 5 is better than nothing we have no guarrantee that it will be implemented. With SOE's trackrecord I am not getting my hopes up too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">5. HOT/DOT crit messages <br />
<br />
Having the crit HOT message only go to the recipient of the spell would be cool by me and if it was a choice of going to the caster or going to the recipient, I would rather it go to the recipient.<br />
<br />
Point is we want for folks to see what we are doing for them.  We want thosed being healed to know that they are getting good service by grouping with us.  We can always test/judge how the skill is working by casting it on our self while soloing or after a Canni5 cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well as to MGB shrink being difficult to implement thats simple hogwash.<br />
Cut and paste MGB TL change text in popup box.<br />
Change effect from TL to shrink.<br />
Done.<br />
<br />
*** kinda code problem is that?<br />
The code is already there in another class' spell.<br />
It is mainly a spell database change and a change to the pop up box file.<br />
<br />
Crit messages being generated to the caster on DoTs...<br />
Also hogwash if it knows how much damage I did and reports that to me then it already KNOWS I critted and its simply adding a message that I did so ;)<br />
It would be a simple send_to_char type message when it adds the crit damage in. Not overly complicated.<br />
<br />
The HoT message might be slightly more complicated.<br />
Real easy to let the person its cast know a crit heal happened on a tick, but unless HoT spells track who casted it it would be harder to implement.<br />
However its still not super difficult.<br />
Basically if HoT doesnt track who cast it they need to change the spell structure to track who cast the HoT. Then the reporting back is simple from that point forward (and no damn reason every duration spell should nto track who cast it as I KNOW it stores level of caster).<br />
If HoT_crit = TRUE send message to char x and y.<br />
Again simply adding a send to character message in where it checks the crits. It would also be easy from that point to return to both caster and castee the amount per tick of each HoT as well as well as a wear off message to the caster (which would be damn nice)<br />
<br />
Sorry to those of us that have actually done this type of work before we actually know that either a) We are being fed a line of BS or b) The code in EQ is rediculously poorly coded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My understanding was Poison counters were given high aggro because of at the time, Tash was the only irresistable spell.  Aggro was a big deal for SOE back then, so enchanters had lots of aggro with tash and their nukes.  <br />
<br />
Our dots inherited some of that through use of the poison counters that were designed to make enchanters more likely to get aggro.  <br />
<br />
I dunno how true that is anymore, but that's my recollection of how it started.<br />
<br />
The pet changes sound spectacular.  I think that is just awesome.  A 4200 hp dual wielding pet will really round us out nicely.  <br />
<br />
I still think we could get a travel spell upgrade, but all in good time I guess.<br />
<br />
I'd pay so much plat and/AA to travel like a bard does...<br />
<br />
And I'd pay 100 AA for tracking...  I know it will never happen, but it would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, if you test agro generated against melee abilities which generate set amounts of hate, such as the warrior incite line, its very soon apparent that you get an initial blob of hate when the dot lands (which appears to be counter dependent in some non-obvious way - not all counters generate the same amount of hate, or in a manner directly related to the magnitude of the counter), and then increments with each tick that correspond to the damage being done. If I recall from some of the other people who have tested this stuff, aa or focus abilities which increase DoT damage increase hate by a corresponding amount. This is different from DD spells, which generate a fixed amount of hate. I expect the problem lies deep in old, poorly documented code, which is probably why they are having difficulties finding the actual cause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An alternative explanation would be that the database structure for beneficial spells is different from detrimental ones, so there might be fields that allow you to do this for the latter, but not for the former. In the grand scheme of things its a question of how they spend their time. HoT reports to the caster is completely trivial in its usefullness, and if it would require a major database change to implement, then that time would be better spent elsewhere on more pressing problems (dot agro for example). That is probably what he means by &quot;difficult to implement&quot;, he's not saying it cant be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could see this happening but whats the betting we're also going to get single target 65% haste spell so we'll be back at the same old place.<br />
Looking through our buffs every group buff is a copy of the single buff (60 plus) so why not ToA.<br />
Before everyone starts some Rytan loving id say only one of these points is actually an upgrade(Although it should have been in from the start but has never been stated so not technically a fix) and thats the DW dogdog all the others are fixes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Rytan says he's done a bunch of research and can't figure out why we are getting such terrible dot aggro. He said he has tried numerous scenarios to try to duplicate the aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is some wonderful BS speak.<br />
Does he mean he knows we are getting aggro as in  &quot;can't figure out why we are getting such terrible dot aggro.&quot;.<br />
Then comes this bit &quot;He said he has tried numerous scenarios to try to duplicate the aggro.&quot; which to me reads as we're not getting DoT aggro and can we all go away and ****.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I talked to Rashere and he says that SC shouldn't check to see if the shaman has mana and he's going to try to get that fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Just 1 thing.Why is the word TRY in this sentence at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tugela the question would be would the counters have an aggro multipler which is pretty certain they do when you think about tash and are they applied to each tick not just the cast.<br />
<br />
In which case if you crit the damage your critting the already multiplied aggro. Something has to multiply our aggro at some point.<br />
Counters would seem to be the logical choice.<br />
<br />
The simple test on the test server is make test spells without the counters. If the amount of aggro generated on ticks is less then you have a pretty solid case of the cause and where to look in the code.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't DoT aggro is likely the result of poor tagging in the type of damage its dealing or placement in how the damage is being applied.<br />
<br />
Well the spell database isnt really that huge especially if they have it broken into beneficial and detrimental as you suggest.<br />
However I would think that the database change is not huge.<br />
It is fairly simple to add a new field in most databases...<br />
Basically if its already in place for DoT HoT is just the positive reverse of that the code should be pretty darn close to the same thing.<br />
Seriously not a problem for a compentant coder that knows the code to do in a few hours unless like I said they have serious code issues ;)<br />
<br />
Honestly even they needed to spend more time on our aggro problem with DoTs there is a SIMPLE patch they could apply.<br />
Warriors have aggro over time no reason in the universe that DoTs cant not have a deaggro over time applied to them if they absolutely had to for other reasons.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is its BS ;)<br />
The real problem is likely the way it is in any other company.<br />
You got the guys that know how to fix it not being allowed to fix it by a bunch of folks at the top that cant figure out why it needs to be done....<br />
That is likely the difficult part.<br />
<br />
The changes themselves pretty much have to be fairly trivial.<br />
It is getting the right people to agree it needs doing that is hard.</div></div><hr />

I am sure its on &quot;a list&quot; somewhere, along with lots and lots of other things. The big question is how far up &quot;the list&quot; things are. I kinda doubt DOT aggro is really high, since its been around forever and never gets any attention.</div></div><hr />

Shaman aren't likely to get any spell/AA to regen endurance, by design. Rytan said he didn't want melees to be dependent on a buff, so he built endurance regen into melee characters.<br />

<br />
Mages don't need another triviality to do on raids.  There is already code in the game to check whether two raid IDs match.  When you kill anything in PoP and hail a Projection it knows whether you are in the raid that killed the boss that spawned it.  They could do a similar check for raid shrink.  If you cast shrink on someone and their raid ID matches your raid ID, then it should shrink them (and you).  Currently it only works by checking the group ID.<br />
<br />
Giving a confirmation box, like TL or rez, is also an easy option, but more of a hassle, since people would have to click 2 boxes and if they didn't click the first one, does the second one work, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You should have seen Gloriana chasing after Rytan with her list.  She cornered him again at dinner.  (grins)  Hopefully she got around to talking about slow resists/mitigation and drop rates for slugworms, treanic flies, and such.<br />
<br />
Rytan really did say that he wasn't able to duplicate DoT aggro problem.  Too bad we didn't have a laptop there or we would have showed him.  He said in another panel that aggro management is something that shamans have to learn and take into account.  I agree but I shouldn't be able to pull aggro from a level 70 paladin who has aggro increasing aug, aggro increasing weapon, and stuns with one poison dot.  Yeah, I have DoT crit and I understand that counters stack but I also have aggro reducing AA (does that really work?) and know like most shamans not to sit or cast too early. <br />
<br />
Rashere said in another forum that they will be lowering cost of Gates AAs and refunding balance soon.  Yay!<br />
<br />
I was really happy to hear about pet upgrade too.<br />
<br />
I was a little miffed about shamans not getting endurance regen but I understand that they don't want melees depending on acumen like casters do with clarity.  Devs didn't completely rule it out so perhaps they will consider a reduced version available to several classes in the future.  More likely it will end up as melee AA though.<br />
<br />
Not sure who said it... think it was Rytan... but devs see shaman as a debuffer/buffer then healer then a little of everything else.  We were never meant to be DPS class.  Therefore we will not see significant upgrades to nukes and DoTs.<br />
<br />
Top ten list was mentioned a couple times so devs really do look at it.  They didn't promise to change anything but at least they review it.  In another panel in which class balance (they call it tuning) was mentioned, devs said that they are more aware now of how content has to be flexible enough to allow different groups to succeed.  They realize that we are concerned about our continued desireability in groups and having a useful role in raids.  Not sure what that means as far as changes go but at least they hear us chanting in the background.<br />
<br />
Expect epic 1.5 to get harder.  Don't know when or how but it is easier than ones for other classes now.  Sony may also change effects to some epics slightly.  Ours wasn't mentioned specifically though.<br />
<br />
Anyway... three cheers for Gloriana.  She got message to folks who needed to hear it and it was great to meet you in person after lurking on boards for a while.<br />

Seriously Diabalein, if your raid leader can't get his/her raid force to shrink then they have larger issues at hand. If you have people that actively grow just to piss off the raid leader you have a ****ed up raid force. Raid disband, guildremove, succor to zi or whatever that command is are all more powerful tools your raid leader can use than MGB shrink.<br />

Raid leaders tend to not care anymore because they have more serious issues. <br />
Also after a couple of nasty adds, rezzed people forget to shrink and it would be nice to just make em short. No discussions, no popup box, just if you are in the raid then shrink sticks. /mgb is not really necessary, but /tgb would be great (and probably include /mgb)<br />
<br />
But mostly many thanks to Gloriana and Juror, nail that sucker good. He does not seem to be able to code his way out of a paperback but maybe he will finally do something. Even if its just the pet DW which has been a PITA for like 3 years. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'm pretty sure that the dot aggro issue is actually a couple different factors or levels so to speak and not just 1 single thing.<br />
<br />
1) Counter aggro. Primarily poison which hit shaman worst since we have few other options. Those that have been playing long enough know counters have aggro from when they added disease counters to slows and subsequently went in and changed disease counters to be less/no aggro. <br />
<br />
Thats actually where tigir's got it's neg aggro mod from. If we assume that the neg hate added to it as accurate it's 200 aggro for 16 counters or about 12.5 aggro per counter. Not huge but still a source of a couple hundred points of initial aggro aggro.<br />
<br />
Disease and curse counters are little to no aggro as far as I can tell. Many other dots for other classes are counterless. As I said this issue seems to be really only with poison dots.<br />
<br />
2) Debuff aggro. This is one that doesn't effect shaman but does effect other classes. Things like druids flame lick line have ac debuff component which from what I can tell seems to generate a fair amount of aggro. Cripple seems to get it's aggro from the ac debuff and weapons like frostbringer and jagged onyx staff seem to generate aggro from there ac debuff proc. <br />
<br />
3) Dmg delt. From testing performed by one member with an sk they found that the aggro generated was based on the dmg dealt and that Dot focus and crits generated additional aggro.<br />
<br />
Initially this doesn't start off too bad compared to nukes. Both seem to generate about 75-80% of the spells dmg in aggro. Problem is that nukes aggro is constant. Resist, full dmg, focus or even critted for double dmg and it's all the same amount of aggro. Focus's and crits for dots on the other hand seem to increase aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I've pulled aggro off my roommate who's a well equiped warrior with just bane and blood of yoppa. He has a very solid aggro setup with a darkblade of the warlord and either a jagged onyx staff or a double augged epic 1.5 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Curse counters don't seem to be no agro, I've pulled agro by landing bane before it's done damage plenty of times. It's nowhere near as bad as Blood, but it's definitely there.</div></div><hr />

Firstly, good job Glori on getting some answers.  I wished some sort of light could have shined about DoT agro.  But good to hear some needed fixes on some spells and AA's, and even the pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Devs see shaman as a debuffer/buffer...&quot; This comment would have been OK, if our debuffing abilities were much stronger than other classes.  We're not really that ahead strength wise compared to other classes.  Resist debuffs, slows, cripples are all equal to or marginally ahead compared to other classes.  It has bothered me for a very long time, we are unable to acquire debuffs (or true curses if you will that affect mob abilities to some degree) that soley pertain to our class and nobody else. <br />
<br />
Have they looked into Epic 2.0 as well?  I've only started the preliminary steps to 2.0, as my guild won't work on 2.0's for members yet until more have their epic 1.5.  Just curious if the challenges are difficult enough (which seems so reading up on the events) and will remain unaltered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">As a debuffer the only advantage we have is More resist debuffs. And 5% better slow. Over an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Doesnt seem like much. And a druid can lower attk by a heck of alot more than we can. (Sigh)<br />
<br />
I still think our disease dots should have a full on Cripple effect added to them Above and beyond and stackable with the cripple line. Make our debuffs have some teeth especially when dealing with Slow mitagating or Slow immune mobs. Like a massive reduction in proc and Quad/flurry abilites from mobs. <br />

I brought this up at the Guild Summit and I brought it up again at Fan Faire - Rytan says he's done a bunch of research and can't figure out why we are getting such terrible dot aggro. He said he has tried numerous scenarios to try to duplicate the aggro. <br />
I have a proposal.<br />
<br />
Need a few shaman volunteers, to set up various scenarios where you are going to take aggro from the tank.  Several servers; different types of mobs; duos, single groups, and raids; warrior and knight tanks, with varying levels of equipment.<br />
<br />
Invite Rytan to log on in as a GM, and watch.<br />
<br />
Demonstrate a wizard nuking three times for total damage of 16 k and not getting aggro; while a shaman drops 2 poison dots, total possible damage with crits might approach 6 k, and gets summoned.<br />
<br />
If he cannot duplicate it, can we duplicate it for him?  And would he be willing to watch such a demonstration?  Only way to find would be to ask him.</div></div><hr />
