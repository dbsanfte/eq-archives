<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 6:00 pm PST on Wednesday, January 28th, the signup period for the World of Warcraft Beta Test will officially begin. We will provide a link to the beta-test application right here in the news section at that time. Testers are not going to be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, so you will be able to submit an application and receive equal consideration anytime during the signup period, which will end on Wednesday, February 4th at 6:00 pm PST. Please note that multiple submissions from the same household will result in complete disqualification.<br />
<br />
For this initial phase of the World of Warcraft beta test, we will only be able to accept applications from Canada, Korea, and the US. The test for Europe and other countries around the world will happen later this year. Please do not contact us for further information regarding the beta test; we will be posting a FAQ in the days ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just a sucker for a beta test.  I'll test anything - I love it.  I dont know if i'll go over to WoW when it actually releases, but i'll gladly test. :)  <br />

heck, I was in the beta for Shadowbane even, so there is obviously no lower limit to the standards I have in this. :)<br />

Ive only got to play it at e3. Shaman there was nukes  and heals. Now they added the healing wards serpent wards and probably stun wards.<br />
<br />
Anyways if SoE won fix the shaman.. Blizzard will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, Blizzard does have one thing going for it - and it's similar to what Ultima Online had going for it, too, when UO was first released.<br />
<br />
A fully fleshed storyline spanning a VERY long time.  Even back in the first Warcraft game, there was a great amount of story to it.  This was one of the big reasons UO was such a hit - that, and the fact that it was the first. :)  But honestly, I dont think the idea of a MMORPG was that great at first (This was before my forum trolling days).<br />
<br />
Blizzard does have a lot to live up to, but they also have a pretty good track record with their other games.<br />
<br />
I dont know if i'd play a Shaman on WoW.. theres a lot I would &quot;expect&quot; a shaman to be able to do, from my experience here, and I think it would be actually make it difficult to cross over as one.  The druid sounds interesting, with all the shapeshifting they can do.  <br />
<br />
But then again, maybe i'll be a Shaman after all.  Chain Lightning :):) (it's on the info page about Shaman as one of the spells they get).. they actually look to be a fair damage dealer.  <br />

So I've just bought Horizons which has potential to develop in the direction that I wanted EQ to go (rather than EverRaid: a game developed for roughly 10% of the people who actually play it).<br />
They've stated that any PvP is consensual- mandatory PvP means no one I know would touch this game w/ a 10' pole as well.<br />
<br />
I believe they've also stated (misplaced the link to gamespy articles) that any character can solo and that the majority of the content is aimed towards single groups, but there will be raids as well. It's the latter clause that concerns me- if time spent raiding results in the same ridiculous disparity of rewards for the exact same amount of time spent a la EQ, WoW won't be the next casual MMORPG either.  <br />
<br />
If nothing else, EQ has taught me not to subsidize others' enjoyment at my own expense.<br />

Its always nice to find someone who thinks the same way.  <br />
<br />
Your post has lead me to rethink on WoW - if Horizons doesn't live up to expectations its nice to think there's another option available.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Three things to say.<br />
1)  THANK GOD<br />
2)  Zorshaaka, that's really disgusting and funny.  Thank you!<br />
3)  Here's a bit of info on the topic... http://www.gamespy.com/landing/wow/<br />
<br />
This interview/review might have ruined EQ for me.  At one point, the Blizzard fellow says (paraphrase) &quot;the designers play-test what they've made, and ask themselves, at every step:  Am I having fun NOW?  If they're not, it gets changed&quot;.  When I play EQ and ask myself that question, the answer is - at least half the time - &quot;No&quot;.  I spend so much time getting from place to place, waiting for something, recovering from something....<br />
<br />
I have such high hopes for a game whose &quot;Vision&quot; is that it should be.... fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The game should be about &quot;playing&quot;, not spending so long getting your character equipped so you can then play the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
All RPG's are about equipping and upgrading your character.  You are fooling yourself if you think otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I read somewhere that some of the best items are from quests. You also get to see what the rewards are before you start the quest. A very nice feature if true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The thing that caught my attention in the preview was when doing a quest every person in the group that is currently on the quest will get the quest item when you kill the guy. That will be awesome. Camping Ssra and VT keys wouldn't have been the hell it is if a comm spawn dropped one for everyone. <br />
<br />
My only disappointment right now is only one app allowed per household. Everyone in my house is dying to play this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think WoW looks promising, as does EQ2, and maybe Dark and Light (www.darknlight.com or www.darknlight.net - amazing screenshots and a hugely ambitious design - and currently entering phase 2 of beta).<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of PvP and I seriously doubt WoW will have mandatory PvP, because that's not fun.  Actually, most people that want PvP are thinking that PvP in WoW will be weak since it's been designed as a PvE game and PvP is more of an afterthought for it (ala EQ).<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying EQ but I think EQ has some flaws.  It's fun to start a new MMORPG that's worth playing (most recent releases don't fit that critical criteria) since everything is fresh, everyone is on even footing, and the game isn't ridden with exploits and online sales of game property.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Usually, if a game has mandatory PVP, EVERYONE knows about it.  The fact that there is ambiguity on the issue means it probably doesn't. :)<br />
<br />
I also like the quest item idea... that is the way DAoC did it.  If you had a quest, and you killed the monster, the item automatically got put into your bag.  Anyone else in the group got the item, too.  It wasn't even loot - just an automatic placement.<br />
<br />
And seeing (and being able to pick your rewards in some cases) for quests sounds very promising as well.<br />
<br />
WoW will have people selling things online... No matter how much you hate it, you can't think otherwise, really.  It may take a while to start up, but eventually..<br />
<br />
A game that might not have that much of a problem with that is City of Heroes. (www.cityofheroes.com) There is no &quot;loot&quot; in the traditional sense.  Powerups and enhancements are the dropped items.  Powerups are like potions,  enhancements are like augments (once you use them, the only way to get rid of it is destroying it).    Just those two things, and accounts, means any kind of online market is going to be really slim :)<br />
<br />
Back to WoW, though.. there was a good point made.  They are hyping it up very much.  It has enough to live up to without it being made out as the MMORPG to end all MMORPGs and fix everyones woes. :)  I just like saying woe... woe woe soe... er...typo...honest... spookily accurate typo, but nonetheless...<br />
<br />
Only one signup per household does give some advantages, though.  If I get in, I can brag about it to the rest of my family. :)  Yeah, they would love to get ahold of it, too.  But if I get it,  nyaa nyaa.  <br />
<br />
And lastly, before I shut up, yes.. all MMORPGs are about equipping your character to hunt.  But the equipping process shouldn't be as painful as it is.  The way i'm understanding, Blizzard is trying to eliminate a lot of the &quot;camping&quot; for items, equipment, etc with all of their quests...<br />
<br />
And dear gods, have you read about their quest system? It's amazing in concept (Dont know about design yet).  Check out the WoW webpage and articles.<br />
<br />
I'm done now.  I'll do a lot of things to waste time while set up in the bazaar, desperately trying to make a few thousand more platinum to upgrade a ring.  <br />

Please tell me. Even though I m pissed they kicked us euros out of beta, well thats live. Where did Blizzard get this good rep in MMOG, I can t find a reason for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Morrighan-VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Because a client-server game (like WoW, EQ, etc) has a totally different setup than a peer-to-peer game (like, say Diablo 2), maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, it's not really a good rep with MMORPGs, per say.  They have a good rep for completed games. <br />
<br />
If you ignore the online aspect of Diablo II, the game is pretty fun, as-is.  <br />
<br />
That, and as poster above said:  MMORPGs have their own, huge, dedicated servers.  And they are going to have people staff it consistantly for support.  This isn't going to run on a Battle.net server. :)  At least, I hope not... hehe.<br />
<br />
People were able to cheat easily on Diablo/II because the client handled almost all of all the data processing. (It's been years since i've played, it may be full client-to-client, correct me if i'm wrong).  <br />
<br />
Yes, there are going to be people who cheat in WoW... there are people that cheat, abuse bugs, etc. on every game.  Time will tell if there are going to be more here or not.  <br />
<br />
As long as they dont release WoW too early to get it on the shelf, it'll turn out well.  SWG was kicked out far too early, and led to things like resource duping that hurt everyone a LOT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">WoW will have people selling things online<br />
<br />
That will be probably true to an extent.  But Blizzard have stated that WoW is designed around group play and not raiding.  So if Blizzard aren't using the bizarre SoE concept of making virtually all worthwhile loot only accessible to a small percentage of players, then the ebayers will not have the massive market that they have in EQ.<br />
<br />
That means that items in WoW will not have anything near the same $ value as items in EQ: any ebayer would be well advised to stick with EQ where he can get far greater rewards for his effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">what I don t understand, Blizzard games are mostly known for people cheating on the servers and grievers. The multiplayer stuff I mean. Why do you think they will do better with WoW?<br />
<br />
I think largely because its PvE so most hacking/cheating goes unnoticed by legitimate players.  If you think SoE has a better record then this post (about the Discord server), which has been bouncing around the forums might make you think again:<br />
<br />
For someone who didn't play on the server to understand the true nature of it they would have to be informed about the alliances: <br />
<br />
The Ogre Alliance - amazingly, mostly all Ogres. I was never part of this alliance, but I was good friends with many of them. They were not cheaters at all, and were constantly out to kill the hackers. Unlike DarkenBane (DB) and the hackers, they didn't farm noobie zones for low level people. They almost strictly PKed those around their level. <br />
<br />
DarkenBane - Quite competant EQ players with no ****ing honor at all. I would put them in the same catagory as the &quot;hacker alliance&quot; if it weren't for the fact that they were a different group of people with a different alliance name. They did many cheesy things to win. First of all, they all used ShowEQ - a program which will tell you the location of every player and NPC on your map. Many of them used memory leaks, which made it so they were unblindable, unsnarable, unrootable, could instantly gate, could instantly teleport on top of any PC or NPC in their zone, and could instantly lose agroe from any NPC (this was actually the teleport hack - whenever they did it they lost all agroe). On top of hacking, they farmed noobies in the noobie zones. That is, they'd have their druids port them to a noobie zone and kill everyone there. I had quite a number of experiences of this in Everfrost, as they would port in and kill everyone in minutes. Whenever someone showed up, everyone in the zone would shout it for everyone else - giving them time to gate or start camping. All you could do was begin casting gate and hope they didn't target you first, since they'd teleport on top of you and interupt the gate before you could even finish it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Teh 1337 h4xx0rz - Highlanderr and Landrover were probably the most famous of these people. To my understanding, they were a group of family/friends all based in Atlanta who used memory-leak software to change information stored locally. They acted virtually like Darkenbane except had no problem showing off their hacks to everyone. Darkenbane was very discrete about them, but the hackers weren't. They were probably the most skilled EQ players I met on Discord - they ran around as level 24's killing level 30 hackers. At level 14 they were wiping whole groups of level 12s before anyone could run or gate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone Else - just more points for the above three to farm. <br />
<br />
<br />
Before I go on I'd like to point out that all 6 of the top 6 were DarkenBane people. <br />
<br />
After about two weeks of noobie slaughter the highest level people were around 35. Highlanderr and Landrover were still 24, but by this time no level 35 stood a chance against them. DB formed an alliance with the hackers (excuse me if any of this information is incorrect - it all took place after I went to sleep) to kill the Ogres, who were all higher level then the DBs. The hackers decided to go with it, most likely because they figured they could kill the DBs afterwards. As it happened, the hackers slaughtered 80% of the Ogre alliance that night. This left only the hackers and DB as major players. <br />
The next afternoon I took a break from playing in the morning. When I came back about an hour later all of the hackers had logged off (I kept them on my friends list - so I always knew if they were a few zones away from me). I joined my alliance channel and found out that GMs were coming through and sweeping all the hackers. A true pity, as all the ogres were dead by then. I noticed that only one or two DBs had been banned as a result, so I talked to a GM and gave them my list of hackers. The GM actually thanked me and went around for a couple more bannings (apparently ignoring someone from my alliance I told them was a hacker...sorry Soul!). But still, very few DarkenBane bannings. <br />
It turns out DarkenBane knew the GMs were coming the next day and knew they had to get the Ogres killed. Because of this they enlisted the hackers - who were all going away the next day and didn't know it - to kill the Ogres. That night they avoided hacking, so the GMs around never caught them doing it. Of course, the hackers were busy slaughtering Ogres with their hacks and were blatantly caught by the GMs. DarkenBane had set up the hackers and now had the server to themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm stoked about WoW, especially in light of SoE's treatment of the shaman class.  Blizzard has a community relationship manager that actually tries to comunicate with the community, surely that alone is an improvement over SoE.<br />
<br />
My only misgiving at this stage is the lack of an SK class.  A friend of mine wants to be an SK and is hesitant to come over when the rest of the guild jumps ship.<br />
<br />
PvP is consentual, same as the blue servers where I play on EQ, so no worries there.  The look power gamers get and that the casual gamers get isn't very different, but the powergamers get better visual effect options, same sword, just looks cooler.  This and the fact that there doesn't appear to be &quot;restricted content&quot; in the same sense of pop flags is a HUGE sell point for me.  I have almost equal footing with other more dedicated players, but they get cooler looking effects.  I like the new ideas on classes and the graphics from SSs I've seen lately.  I'm there already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is very true.  It was mentioned in one of the dev interviews that a lot of the *best* items are gained through questing, rather then drops.  I dont know if this means tradable or not,  but it was also said that quests are &quot;one time&quot; deals, so you wont have anyone farming the sword quest.<br />
<br />
I have higher hopes then I should for a new game coming out (considering a lot of companies track records). . I hope i'm not disappointed by this one.  <br />

Then here is the perfect opportunity for you to save money: WoW will have raid content that so-called  casual players will not be able to obtain. This has been explicitly stated by the developers numerous times.</div></div><hr />

This is a very similar set up to DAoC in Realm vs Realm warfare.<br />

Depends on how many of those zones there are and, more importantly, what is in them.  If EQ was PvP- in the old world, but PvP+ in Kunark-PoP, it would be essentially a forced PvP game, because you'd have to go PvP to get anything good.

For me - and I've seen a fair number of other posters say the same - its the conversion of Everquest into EverRaid.  In designing a good MMORPG you strive for diversity of play.  If you want to be 'Massively Multiplayer' you want to cater for as many different playing styles as possible.<br />
<br />
But now in EQ one choice rules all: join the most powerful guild you can. When you log on just go to the zone where that guild is raiding.  Stand where the man tells you, perform whatever monotonous and monotone role you are assigned.<br />
<br />
I don't see the excitement in doing that.  From where I stand it seems ideal only for the mindless drone who doesnt want to make his/her own choices.<br />
<br />
Sure, raiding is just one option.  But every other option in EQ carries the label 'for third rate citizens only' because the loot from raiding makes all other loot pale by comparison, and loot from uber guild raiding makes it look tragically bad.<br />
<br />
Yes its the Devteam at the end of the day who are responsible.  But Furor stands there as the pampered, ungrateful player who got everything he asked for and still isn't satisfied.</div></div><hr />

Actually, raids in PoP are frequently a lot more complex than that, and your party needs to work as a team to achieve the goal. Thats where the real thrill of the raid comes in. I've allways thought it unfortunate that they never implemented single group &quot;raids&quot;. Obviously that wasn't possible pre-LDoN, since any target designed for one group would be tackled by 3 or 4, rendering it trivial and forcing limitations on the qualitiy of the rewards. That is the real reason why raid rewards are so much better than regular rewards. People are lazy and greedy - presented with the choice of facing a challenge with one group or getting easy loot with three groups, the vast majority will go with 3 groups. In the days of kunark, OT/DL/KT were allways full, and Chardok deserted. Why? Because chardok was hard and the other zones easy. Its human nature.<br />
<br />
I get tired of all these dumb arguments putting raiders down as stupid and greedy. If you think that raiders are monotonous drones while casual players are skilled adventurers you are seriously mistaken. Since LDoN has come out I've had the chance to play with a wide range of players, guilded and unguilded, ubers and casuals, and trust me, 95%+ of the players with decent skill (I'm not talking about equipment here) are in active raiding guilds. The simple fact is that you learn how to play the game in a raiding guild in ways that most people not in those guilds couldn't even contemplate. Raiders dont worry about what the other guy is doing, they know the other guy knows his job. Non raiders, you got to watch them like a hawk because usually they are clueless or inexperienced.<br />
<br />
If Sony implemented a scaled series of single group raids in an LDoN setting with the degree of difficulty faced by the average raiding guild, I'd say its a pretty safe bet that 99% of the people who who do those would allready be in a raiding guild, while those in other guilds or guildless would stick to the regular stuff. Needless to say they would continue to complain about Sony catering to the &quot;ubers&quot; and bitch about the fact that hard stuff gives good rewards (duh!).</div></div><hr />

Funnily enough casual players see this differently. My group - of casual players - found that a fair proportion of raiders were pretty poor. Casual players were on average more skilled because they weren't being carried by their guilds, but raiders were able to compensate for this by their Monty Haul gear.<br />
<br />
The assertion that raiders are more skilled is often found on this board.  But then again the same people who say that also complain that there is little for a 3rd or 4th shaman on a raid to do.  Quite how the people in that position become elite players is perhaps something you might explain to me.</div></div><hr />

Lol, raiders were once casual players too you know. Do you think they suddenly lose their skills when joining a raiding guild?<br />
<br />
The guild I'm in is a fairly large one, and we get a fairly steady stream of hopefulls coming through the app process. Some of them are from uber guilds looking for a more relaxed style of raiding, others are from less advanced raiding guilds looking to do more advanced encounters. A third group are friends of members who have never been in a real raiding guild. What you see with these people are skill levels that clearly decline as their level of raid experience decreases. In many cases the non-raiders basically have to be taught how to play the game. On the member section of our boards we have a section where apps performance can be discussed, their weak points identified and suggestions for areas of improvement made. The apps champions are then supposed to go back to them and give feedback on ways to improve their playing skills. That includes discussion on what equipment is appropriate for the class. As long as an app hasn't pissed off too many people they usually get in if the are patient enough to endure the lengthy process (it can take as long as 6 months). We try to provide a mechanism and environment whereby they can become a valuable part of the team.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that all raiders are skilled, there are some who are not. Most, however, are. Usually those who are not all that good struggle to find guild groups, so they have to look for pickups. That might explain why you have had a disproportionately bad experience with them in the past. In my guild (and I expect in most guilds) most members do not group with ANYONE outside of the guild or a few friends in comparable guilds at all. They simply refuse to, casual pickup groups have such a bad rep. <br />
<br />
Remember, these are people who for the most part play a LOT, and usually try to push the envelope. When they are not raiding they are grouping like everyone else. Trying to suggest that somehow they are less skilled than a casual player is kinda amusing ;)</div></div><hr />

Vis-a-Vis &quot;Ubers&quot; vs &quot;Casuals&quot; I'll add this personal anecdote.<br />
<br />
I am 118-4 in LDON. Two of my losses were because of &quot;Ubers&quot; stupidity. Granted - I was stupid to go along with their stupidity - but it was their intial stupidity that caused the loss. Note said stupidity occurred LONG after the initial release of LDON so the parameters for success, as well as do's and don'ts were well known.<br />
<br />
Ubers have better gear. That gives them a (sometimes miniscule) margin of safety or better chance at avoiding a wipe or other catastrophe.<br />
<br />
Never confuse your superior equipment with superior playing skills.</div></div><hr />

Real &quot;Ubers&quot; wouldn't group with you in the first place. You are probably got some of the folk I mentioned above. If you have ever grouped with really high end players on easy setting adventures, the most efficient style of play is to have a healer with 5 tanks. The strategy basically is to kill things very quickly, and if you get a bunch of adds, have one of the tanks either root park or tank them off. A group like that doesn't require much healing, and usually things die so fast that slowing is not really required most of the time. The people who play like that are usually very experienced and used to having lots of mobs in camp. Now its possible that you may have got some newer guild member who had been in some of these groups, and doesn't fully appreciate the role equipment and experience play when you fight like that. That might lead them to do what you would percieve as &quot;stupid&quot;. And it is stupid, but the reason is that they are trying to play the high level game but have not yet cast off the casual gamer &quot;inexperience&quot;, hence the mistakes ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">To reiterate.<br />
<br />
I have grouped with Ubers who knew what they were doing. The Monk with 9k health in MM who said slowing was optional. (I did anyway).<br />
<br />
The group in LGUK who routinely had 3-4 in camp and didn't care whether they were mezzed or not. (and at the end complimented me on my mezzing (/e boggle)).<br />
<br />
The two cases I speak of were stupidity. Utter. And sheer.  As I said - I was stupid for agreeing to their stupidity.<br />

<br />
Horizons has a lot to offer the casual player.  The thing I've really liked is that when you die you lose no exp and don't have to do a CR.  That means you can explore somewhere without needing to read up on it first - there's no danger of being dropped by a trap into an inaccessble room.  I'm intending to play Horizons without reading spoilers before doing anything - something that in EQ would be very foolish unless you have access to a res and summon corpse.  That alone adds a whole new level of interest.</div></div><hr />

I gots to ask - what's the point?  I mean I grant you EQ is not a MMORPG but an electronic sport (great line, not mine, but still great).<br />
<br />
What you're describing is a chat room with graphics and no challenge. Or in-game danger. Or (at least to me) the suspense of knowing &quot;Man, I could get hammered if this MOB breaks charm&quot; or &quot;If I don't get this MOB slowed - we're toast.&quot;<br />

Personally I get a 15 second adrenaline rush when my charmed MOB breaks just as the Bard comes back with 3 of his own.</div></div><hr />

What it means is that the level of risk is the same as for a raider who has a guaranteed clicky res and mates to summon his corpse if he can't get back to it.<br />
<br />
If you die then you fail - just like when a raid wipes.  But you don't spend the next few hours bored out of your mind waiting to find a necro or a cleric if there isn't one in your group.</div></div><hr />

Why not? Friendships cross guild boundaries.  Two of my good friends are in the top guild on my server and went out of their way to help us when they weren't in Time.  Another friend of ours is in another Time guild on our server and when he's not raiding he hangs out with us.
