could you post your ini file with all the window positions too? :) <br />
<br />
Window are hard coded to certain positions. You can move them to different locations if you wish.<br />
<br />
Only caveat... 1024 x 768.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How come no ammo slot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look over at the spell gems.<br />
<br />
I use a bridle and put it where I don't have to open inventory to click it.<br />
<br />
I may move it over to the clickables window though.<br />
<br />
I am thinking about putting the AA/Normal EXP division selector somewhere... Spell Gems might be a good spot for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh that makes sense, I used a spell bar from someplace else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aruman not sure if this is a UI bug or just me.  Late Sat nite I finally maxxed lvl 60 exp and the exp bar said 100% with the green running all the way through the exp bubble.  Sunday I log back in, friend was using my char to powerlvl and died once.  Thinking no problem, I head to FG and solo about 12 shrooms with all exp going to 60 again.  The exp bar says 99% and that last green dash wont appear in the line.  Now I know I killed more then enough shrooms to reach 100% regular exp eheh for I then put 100% exp to AA and was getting 1% exp in AA per kill.  Anybody else run into this?  Its no biggie but was just wondering.  All in all I love the UI but was also wondering where the pet commands were?  Dont know the commant to bring them back up for I might have closed the window if there was one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That exp thing I have seen before... Kinda like one of those glitches where I am a brown bear to someone who zones in after I have cast bear form.<br />
<br />
Pet commands? That window is useless to me. I use two hotkeyed socials for my pet...<br />
<br />
Attack and back off.<br />
<br />
Hot key 1<br />
<br />
/pet kill<br />
<br />
Hot key 2<br />
<br />
/pet back off<br />
/pet back off<br />
/pet back off<br />
<br />
This UI isn't meant for every class. I think each class should have a UI specifically designed for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does this one have the new Target name that shows the real name and not the default. Im still tryin to get the Froglok_hunter_02 instead of a froglok hunter.<br />
<br />
I downloaded a target.xmi that was supposed to heve it but it didnt work.<br />
<br />
And how do we change what items come up in the clickables boxes. You use almost exactly the oposite setup for bags that I do, and I havent got hardly any clicks in slots you are usin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Alania and Grimbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">MOST EXCELLENT!  Thank you for all your hard work.  However...  can I get a step by step idiots guide for changing the clickables box?<br />
Alania<br />
PS  I found a shadow of the downloaded file where it shouldn't have been.  I deleted it and the file (where it was suppose to be) redownloaded and haven't locked up but once and I think it was a heat issue as my pc was at 95 degrees :(   LOVE LOVE LOVE this skin! Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will try to find a reference to that new target name you are talking about... I personally don;t see a need for the _02 but if thats what you want I will see if I can find something.<br />
<br />
For the clickables window:<br />
<br />
Open the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml in your custom directory (where my UI files were placed) with notepad.<br />
<br />
In the file EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml you will see each of the inventory spots I put in the Clickables box.<br />
<br />
To change which one is which all you have to do is:<br />
<br />
1. Find the slot you want to change<br />
2. Look for a reference called EQ Type&gt;#&lt;<br />
<br />
Change the number in ## to one of the below... depending on which slot you want it to be:<br />
<br />
Inventory Slots<br />
1 = Left Ear<br />
2 = Head<br />
3 = Face<br />
4 = Right Ear<br />
5 = Neck<br />
6 = Shoulders<br />
7 = Arms<br />
8 = Back<br />
9 = Left Wrist<br />
10 = Right Wrist<br />
11 = Range<br />
12 = Hands<br />
13 = Primary<br />
14 = Secondary<br />
15 = Left Fingers<br />
16 = Right Fingers<br />
17 = Chest<br />
18 = Legs<br />
19 = Feet<br />
20 = Waist<br />
21 = Ammo<br />
22 = General Inventory Slot 1<br />
23 = General Inventory Slot 2<br />
24 = General Inventory Slot 3<br />
25 = General Inventory Slot 4<br />
26 = General Inventory Slot 5<br />
27 = General Inventory Slot 6<br />
28 = General Inventory Slot 7<br />
29 = General Inventory Slot 8<br />
<br />
The background image will have to be changed also, but I don;t have a list of the references. You can find the one you need for each slot by looking in EQUI_Inventory.xml. Look for a reference to background in that file.<br />
<br />
If you still have a problem reply here and I will see if I can help.<br />
<br />
If any of you use WindowsXP I can even do this directly for you from home while you watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK I'll try to explain this as best I can.<br />
<br />
When you do the gage for hps it automatically adds the name as part of the gauge but there is also a Label tag for {EQType}28{/EQType} that gives the target name. That label is what he uses and what gives mob_01.<br />
<br />
The trick comes in at getting the name that shows up by default not to show. To do that you have to monkey with the guage properties.<br />
<br />
What I did was set {font}0{/font} to set the font size to as small as possible. You then need to set the location to something like {x}3{/x} {y}-20{/y}. This puts the gauge starting to display outside of the bounds of the window. Then use{GaugeOffsetY}36{/GaugeOffsetY} to slide the gauge down back into the same spot. Don't forget to change the {size}{{Size}CX}408{/CX}{CY}44{/CY}{/Size}<br />
y value to account for the fact that the gauge now starts 20 pixels off screen.<br />
<br />
In short change the loc line so that it's -20 of it's current value, change the gauge ofset so it pushes it back down 20 and change the size so the guage is 20 bigger. You now have you target gauge with the name of the mob being displayed off window so just use a standard label with the eqtype 28 and boom you've got your numbers.<br />
<br />
Obviously all the {} should be replaced with greater than and less thans int he xml file just didn't feel like taking the time to code it so it showed properly in the post =)<br />
<br />
Copied and pasted from the last time i posted it. If you want a mod that actually uses it check mine at www.cohort.cc/~taraddar/TaraddarUI.zip<br />
<br />
I've found that mod to be amazingly useful when you get 2+ mobs with the same name in camp. It's so easy to know you slowed mob_01 and mob_02 but not mob_03.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That is wonderfully useful Taraddar, thanks!  I was wondering if there was a way to get the game to broadcast the true name (with the number) when you have a %t macro rather than just the generic name?<br />
<br />
I would guess not, but hope springs eternal.</div></div><hr />

Here you are... Might be a bit different than previous version but essentially the same. I am tweaking it as I play to better suit me.<br />

It's not going to be quite that easy in your case. Due to a few issues with the Pet Window I had to get a little creative with the use of the windows.<br />
<br />
Put it this way... a few windows were changed around to make the clickables work. I will get the old version out and leet you know which file I initially used for that clickables window.<br />
<br />
My UI is a bit different from what I posted before since I cleaned up things a bit.<br />
<br />
I plan on using a few mods from other people also to improve the UI for my use, such as that help file mod I saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">thanks for the response.  I had loaded up your skin and found that the one I was using was too hard to forget.  Perhaps, if I was playing for longer stretches (like I was when I loaded the other ui) I would be able to adjust to it.  <br />
<br />
No need to put too much effort into obtaining that file for me.  I can deal with using the hotkeys for clickables, especially since I only have sow boots at the moment.</div></div><hr />

If this was directed at me... I never bothered with that mod. I never needed it.<br />

I remember mobs by position and type. I don't remember which is which by name with the _01 etc...</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately all indications are this was fixed and there is no way to do it any longer. Not surprising to me really there are alot of little things like a # before the name indications a Ph for a named or a trigger mob that verant doesn't really want you seeing that easily. It was nice while it lasted but i wasn't surprised that it's gone.</div></div><hr />

My player stat window keeps disappearing, I've tried every button combination I thought it could be to get it back and then some.  But I end up having to /loadskin and recustomize.

I am indeed workign on a somewhat improved version of my UI.<br />
<br />
I am taking more time with this one and it should be much more user friendly than the previous.<br />
<br />
Will take me some time thoug... there are a few aspects to the UI that are annoying me. I need to track down why certain things are happening.</div></div><hr />
