<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just thought this would be interesting, as I dont seem to know anyone who uses the first one, most people seem to use the one with see through boxes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's pretty ghetto to be using old-school mode. You miss a ton of information that way, you can't use hitsmode, channel colors suck against that background, your ability to see and target properly is restricted, your inventory view blocks everything in sight, etc.<br />
<br />
Only justification for oldschool mode is if your computer just isn't up to the task of full-screen display.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I cant honestly see how anyone might consider using the first one over the second. Unless you are going to go back and crawl through lguk and want some of that oldschool feeling back that is :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Full screen, with the transparent boxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For the new folks here most of us used the 640x480 windowed view for the first year or so.. Hey EQ ran on a P200 MMX with a Voodoo2-8M and 32M RAM. Sometimes we even went to the full screen for a &quot;thrill&quot; when running through nearly empty zones.<br />
<br />
It actually wasn't as bad as it seemed, just like when watching a small TV after awhile you didn't notice the small window as much.<br />
<br />
Of course now it's full screen with interface at max res.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still use the windowed view if I have a second char on my (slow) laptop, or if I'm in a raid situation and graphical lag gets to be a problem.  And in areas with too damn many trees, like BW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">pre-new vid card (Geforce tnt 32) &amp; 256mb ram<br />
<br />
now<br />
<br />
Geforce 2 Ultra 500 with 64mb DDR &amp; 512 mb ram<br />
<br />
Max res and full screen...damn it looks good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My boyfriend used the &quot;small screen&quot; view and played in the view where he looked from behind his avatar.  I could NEVER understand it!<br />
<br />
With my first character, I did use the view where I was behind my avatar, but she was a tiny little wood elf.  When I started Gloriana, I had to switch to first person view because I couldn't see over her head!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know some clerics who play in windowed mode during raids, most normally during times when cheal chains are needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I switch between windowed and full screen all the time since I'm completely used to playing the game either way.  Play in 1st person or 3rd person views as well.<br />
<br />
It simply depends on what zone, situation, and circumstances I'm in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">While I use the full-screen first-person mode, the window'd screen has a special purpose:<br />
<br />
As a lizard for some reason I run slower and sink faster with Levitate than even my ogre friends.  With the window'd mode ON I can 'fly' all the way from the lost valley tunnel in DL to Karnor's..in the full screen mode I hit the ground right after the giant fort.<br />
<br />
I have tried this both looking straight ahead and with my view tilted up, there is a serious difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do people really use full screen?<br />
<br />
I use it for ocassional screen shots, but how can you use it for everyday use when it does not contain a chat window or a target?  This means you cannot even tell if you've landed your spells.<br />
I use the screen with the moveable, sizable, transparent boxes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Full screen with transparency here.<br />
<br />
Boxed-in mode cuts out too much the action for me, as well as distracts me from what's going on in the world with all the command buttons and such.<br />
<br />
And I have no clue how anyone could play in FULL full screen mode.  Your chat window and keyboard commands are hidden.  Think it was meant for screenshots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Full screen, transparent/opaque boxes.  I normally like &quot;vanity&quot; mode (F9 x2) as well.  Just adjust it with Alt +arrows / pg up/down to get from looking at your shoulderblades to the back of your head.  Though I flip out of it when I am ML or need to target mobs / people not in the group quickly.<br />
<br />
On raids as a cleric, I find myself either staring at a floor or ceiling or becoming ONE with the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Full screen with transparent windows. I don't see how anyone could play in the old school mode. :)<br />
<br />
I rarely go to &quot;true&quot; full screen, as at high res the windows are small and unobtrusive.<br />
<br />
What I do wish I could have is a more intelligent 3rd person view. While it's fairly easy to use during a fight, when you're running through a complex zone 3rd person can be distracting as you change direction and have to change the view angle. In AO and DAoC the 3rd person view could be set to follow you like a camera floating behind your head. You get less of a feeling of being &quot;in&quot; the game, but it's very useful in large melees or when running for your life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No offense but this is a pretty bad poll question.  I think its pretty obvious what people use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I still use the old boxed in view... partly because my comp is too slow.  Since I always have to switch from my spellbook, my comp would be way to slow to switch between spellbook screen (640x480) to whatever transparent resolution, so i've just learned to play that way.  <br />
Plus it's a lot quicker to cast a spell right after you mem it from spell book if you stay in windowed mode; you click to unmem then mem a spell in that gem, and keep your mouse cursor there, then when you press your stand hotkey you can cast right when you stand up... makes switching spells easy:)  Love it when you switch your spells out while you are tanking and people wonder what the hell you are doing :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah, Walruss, lighten up :) <br />
Ya never know, people in EQ never cease to amaze me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The VI term is Full Screen with Overlays and just Full Screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Still use the windowed mode. I play on a laptop and it just does so much better in the old windowed mode than fullscreen that the hit in performance for eyecandy just isn't worth it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just got a slick new video card.<br />
<br />
Before it, I used FS with Overlays for most things, and windowed mode for big events with frighteningly high video lag... and Luclin.<br />
<br />
Now I no longer use the windowed mode... well, other than when I'm moving my spells around (be fixin' that any time, soon, Verant?)</div></div><hr />
