<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lucy had an update today, revealing a bunch of new AA's and stuff coming out with Gates of Dischord.<br />
<br />
Wizards get familiars which increase DD damage by 30%!<br />
<br />
Beastlords get instaclick ferocity, no need to mem, has illusion too. They also get clicky pet procs which include effects like snare, mana drain, and Dmg over time!<br />
<br />
Clerics get avatar!<br />
<br />
Shaman get spirit call 5!!! **** YES!!! 2 MORE PETS!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well sony, you've succeeded at overpowering the already overpowered yet again. I'm hoping there is some pretty damn good stuff on the pages I can't see on Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wizards also get hastened teleportation, which lets them cast TL to bind at twice the normal rate.<br />
<br />
My point?  Not every class is getting nothing but good stuff.  I'm pretty sure that spirit call 5 is not the best thing we get, so your post is a little misleading.  What else do we get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While Lucy is uselly pretty good. I would still take anything on there with a grain of salt. Becuse nothing for GoD is set in stone yet.</div></div><hr />

Given what you said about beastlords getting an instaclick ferocity with an illusion, what on earth make you think that Divine Avatar (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4549&amp;source=Live&quot;) is not the exact same thing for shamans?  The word &quot;divine&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it goes along with it being one of the abilities that was not a shaman ability when it came to able to activate it using the alt activate method that some have been playing around with.  Though if it is cleric I would assume that it is self only, in which case I could really care less about it.  Cleric melee is like polishing a terd, no matter how much you polish, it will still be a terd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why they don't just give clerics Malos and slow too, and let's erase the shaman class, it will finally balance it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why don't you go make a cleric then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Compare the list of beta AAs posted along with the pre-beta AA lists that have been bouncing around and see the disparity between the two...  To me, that says that these are still very much in development. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do think its most productive to complain when the spells are still being decided though. Protesting something that doesn't stay hurts nobody, but not protesting a crappy spell that does stay might hurt everyone. Since we can't tell the future, it's better to be safe than sorry :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Symbah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would have to agree. Might as well complain now so the AAs are not implimented instead of more complaining when they ARE.  But I guess we will have to see what happens in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but when we complain, we should give reasons and/or alternatives.  Usually it's just idle bitching.</div></div><hr />
