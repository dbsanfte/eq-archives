<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the Tradeskills/Lore forum the developer said that they were removing the negative stats to the stat potions, and also removing the level cap on alchemy.<br />
<br />
Now, I know the level cap is still in place, and I guess I need to make some stat potions to check their effects.  Anyone see any signs of this, or is it still &quot;Legends only&quot; or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might go in with the patch today, might not.  This will be the first big patch since the statements were made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No mention of it in the patch message, though some of the OTHER changes I heard about there like adding a forge to the Coldain Town in Crystal Caverns, is there.<br />
<br />
I tested a stat potion last night, sure enough, it still has negative stats. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they did infact lift the lvl cap..I have a 190 skill now in alchemy.  The completed potions still have a really bad sell back value and to advance the potions are not cheap<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, I'm lvl 54, and I haven't been able to get my skill level over 150, even though I have had a LOT of sucesses at non-trivial potions with VERY high Wis....maybe it's just really slow, or does it mean that there's still a 5pts per lvl limit, it's just now the max level is 65?  What level are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont think they have removed the level restriction yet. Formula I believe is (level - 24)x5=possible skill so at 54 150 is maxed for your level, there is no message about reaching cap <br />
<br />
I know of several people who wasted a lot of plat because they forgot about the cap. Max possible level would be 205 based on fromula,<br />
<br />
I think the overall Cap is 200 so max possible skill level is attainable at level 64 and a skill of 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So then the level cap restriction, and the negative potion effects, have not been removed yet.<br />
<br />
I assume then that potions such as &quot;Greater Elixer of Conentration&quot; have a trivial higher that 200?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the Tradeskills/Lore forum the developer said that they were removing the negative stats to the stat potions, and also removing the level cap on alchemy.  <br />
<br />
:mad: Yeah, they said that in Boston too. :confused: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">bloody bastards!  I guess I won't hold my breath then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They talk about this everytime someone raises the question. <br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />
<br />
I really would like to see the cap removed and some additional useful potions added.<br />
<br />
Right now, aside form special orders from guildies, the only potions I bother with are Titan, Ant, Blood of Wolf and Unlife Awareness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phace Paintt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What is the benefit of removing the level cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If the level cap is removed, then you can skill up to SOW potions earlier (or skill up to gate potions/whatever earlier).<br />
<br />
Assuming you have money and time of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The &quot;benefit&quot; is that those of us who have spent hours and hours getting to high level so we could make the high level potions will no longer have the market to ourselves, instead having level 1 alchemy mules competing with us.  It would be, in my opinion, a slap in the face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think should still have to be level 25 to start the skill as before just no 5 skillpoints per level. Dont matter though Sony has abandoned us on this so we get the same old tired response, &quot;Working as intended&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The cap and the level restrictions are two different things.<br />
<br />
I agree with the restrictions, but the cap should be lifted so you dont max at 180.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, who cares, why be tempted to get it to 200, when the potions still suck?</div></div><hr />
