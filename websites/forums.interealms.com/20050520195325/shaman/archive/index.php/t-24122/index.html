<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A little confused.  I was gone for a while and now I'm hearing that you can turn in bought LDON gear for the points?  Is this true and do they still have the silly rule about needing points per camp?  I want to get the extended torment aug but don't feel like grinding through another 1k in points in BBM..any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, you can turn it in to any LDON adventure merchant (you only get a percentage of the point total back, although it's a good percentage). The silly rule is still in place.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.  I think I might have enough ldon points banked to get it..but just not enough earned at BBM.  Guess I'll try and get a group together for there..that should be like pulling teeth.  Can you go in with lower numbers yet?  Like can I 2box it with my monk?</div></div><hr />
