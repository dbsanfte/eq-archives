<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xenonym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there:  <br />
<br />
I went back a few pages to look for a similar post, but didn't see one.  If I'm asking the same old question, I'm sorry.  <br />
<br />
Just wondering if there are certain target wisdom levels.  I just dinged 34 and am just below 190 with bear form (187 I believe).  I swapped out some ac on my wrists to put two PBB/6 wis on.  Does this make sense?  The AC loss was maybe 12 for both wrists, but I justified it with the fact that I would have my pet up to compensate.  <br />
<br />
(Not a gear check, just a general stat check).  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That seems a little high.  At 52 I regularly run around with 130-140 WIS, and it doesn't cause any problems.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might try a search on the phrase &quot;AC/HP&quot; and see what that comes up with.  My view, as always, is that Wis is crap.  Gear yourself like a melee; it's cheaper, more fun, and far less frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had 156 Wisdom at level 56 and had had no problems surviving as a shaman through that point at least. Since then I have progressed fairly well and have about 202 wisdom and 2475 unbuffed hp (thanks to the 22 point decline I took in wisdom changing from a fairy hide mantle to barbed rubicite coif). The good thing is that even losing that 22 wisdom, I only lost about 100 mana total, so all is good. Anyhow, if you are looking at your wisdom for your level, you should probably be looking at it as how high is your wisdom in relation to your hit points and ac. It is very easy for a shaman to get to 255 wisdom, regardless of race. However, doing that while keeping a reasonable AC and HP is more difficult. Good luck though whatever you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lv 53 ,116 wis.<br />
<br />
just a little trouble when you want to cast 4 hos in a row.<br />
otherwise go back to ac vs. wis statments.----mana regen &gt; mana pool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BAH !!<br />
<br />
one point of WIS = level/5 points of mana.<br />
<br />
at 34, you get about 7 points of mana per WIS.<br />
<br />
you don't show all your gear - you may have great ac and hp for your level, but with that /WIs and your comment on the wrists, my guess is you have WAY too much WIs and not nearly enough ac/hp.<br />
<br />
please note my qualifications of my comments!!  To answer your question requires knowledge of your style and all of your gear/stats (and resistance to the urge to make you over in my own image, of course lol).  many shadruids can be found in Norrath, carrying books in their hands and root rotting their way through the levels.  There is certainly more than one way to play your shaman.<br />
<br />
but I believe that you will not be a very good healer for much longer gheal is good for you now, but sup heal is a long way off!  you will not be able to melee much longer without good ac.  you need good hp to support your canni and take a few hits, etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
i think you have a lot of room to drop WIS, and I bet you have places you can really pick up stats I consider more valuable .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Somehow I'm betting that plat-jasper and plat-ruby come into this equation.  I had 135-ish wisdom through my 50's.  It's like 230 now, but I never once intentionally tried to increase it.  I don't even look at or notice wis on items.  It's not important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This has been beat to death already. But balance is the way I went. <br />
<br />
55 and lower I tried to keep around 150 wis min while maxing ac/hp and it worked fine. I was able so solo quite well. <br />
<br />
At 60 I find I am dumping wis gear for hp gear and I still have 201 wis unbuffed. <br />
<br />
My advise would be swap out some gear to up ac/hp until you get wis down to around 150-160.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah use the PBB when your attempting tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xenonym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol, looks like this has become an AC/HP thread.  *Definitely* not my intention.  /cringe<br />
<br />
That said, I just checked my stats and I'm at 900hps self buffed, ac is around 600 (I have a bunch of cavalier buffs atm that I don't want to click off), defense is 169, offense 165, and I keep piercing/1hb maxed.  So in terms of the AC/HP threads, it seems I'm doing ok at 34, even with my attempt to max wisdom.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the ton of feedback and advice.  I didn't post a magelo link b/c I can't get the page to load (errors on page) so 1) I think it would similarly affect other folks and 2) I can't even get into my account to post the url.  <br />

Neck:  ivory imbued<br />

Head:  othmir fur<br />
<br />
Fingers:  velium jasper<br />
Wrists:  PBBs, have Bracers of Battle and Scavenging (which I swapped out) edit:  typed JBBs on accident.  omg I wish<br />
Arms:  blackened alloy<br />
Shoulder:  Krode's shawl<br />
Chest:  bloodstained (I usually have ry`gorr, but thought the wis useful.  Also like the red chain).  <br />
Legs:  Blackened alloy<br />
Feet:  dwarven workboots<br />
<br />
Prim:  Spine chill or centi hammer<br />
Held:  CGS<br />
Range:  slime coated<br />
Range:  fishing bait :/<br />
<br />
As for play style, I pretty much just solo, even more now that I have a pet.  So I tank quite a bit (hence melee skills are pretty near max).  But having mana enough for that killing nuke is key to my style.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to ramble on, but the questions were asked...  )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 53 my wis is about 160 unbuffed I believe.  Only time i am LoM is on raids when I am buffing or have a bunch of resists or when I am in a melee heavy (4 melee or more) group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your ac is low for your level- you'll need some upgrades if you still intend to tank for more than 2-3 levels past where you are now.</div></div><hr />

There isnt a chart that an accuratly reflect your target wisdom as you level.  To many factors.  But if you just HAVE to have one, here you go:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1-10 = 120<br />
11-20 = 130<br />
21-30 = 140<br />
31-40 = 150<br />
41-46 = 160<br />
47-51 = 170<br />
51-55 = 180<br />
56=59 = 190<br />
60 = 200-255</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At your level I was focused on Wisdom items, and I was around 175.  Once I decided to switch to AC/HP my wis dropped to the 150's.  I set a personal target of 150 - 160 for my wis, but currently it hovers around 145 - 147 (at level 46).  But I have several +mana items, so I'm happy with my mana pool.<br />
<br />
My ac is 902 self buffed, with 1520ish hps at 46.</div></div><hr />
