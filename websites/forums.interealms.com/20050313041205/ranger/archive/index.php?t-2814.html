I petitioned, and the GM couldn't really tell me anything. She said she would add it to the petition. Friday, it's still not proc'ing, so I petition again and get a different GM. He tells me if it's one of the drained items, it'll try to proc but I'll get a message saying it's out of charges. He suggests that maybe I need a DEX buff. My DEX is 112 and while it may not proc every battle, I've had it proc up to 3 times a battle. I'm hoping that maybe someone here has some insight on this. I'm thinking they may have changed the proc level (I'm 39) or just totally nerfed it.<br />

GMs or Guides?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the patch message was about items that now say they are out of charges, because they got their charges somehow reduced from inifinite.<br />
<br />
If you are not getting procs on a DHY and its not complaining about being out of charges, its proably not the same thing the patch was talking about.<br />
<br />
What level are you? Maybe they raised the level, but then you would be getting the &quot;Your Will&quot; messages.<br />
<br />
Maybe just yours is bust and you can get a swap out.<br />
<br />
Kinda weird story: I had a GM restore some stuff once, and he messed up one of the items. He replaced two seemling identical Velium Fire Wedding Rings, but one of them had no HP/AC on it. I went to a npc vendor and priced both rings as exactly the same, so the game engine recognized them as being identical value, but the one ring wouldn't supply the stats.</div></div><hr />

Ever since I looted the thing last December, it has given the message: Item is out of Charges. <br />
<br />
I have been petitioning, bug reporting, feedbacking, emailing the developers and testers, posting in the Ester the Tester part of the eqlive site once a month to no avail. I even offered to send them screenshots showing the stats and the message. One guide put in a bug report on it and still nothing happened.<br />
<br />
You think I could get a GM to trade me for one that has the effect REALLY working? The whip is No Drop and has another stat on it that I like, but in 7 of my levels, (I do try it for about a week at a crack in my primary hand) it has never gone off, just told me it is out of charges.</div></div><hr />

Will it show the message out of charge/will too weak both? Cuz I have one but not quite high enough for the proc yet</div></div><hr />

Never had a weapon skip more than a battle or so before....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skinn</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Jenrai, I had this tail a few weeks ago too. Of course I started whacking anything on sight. It works quickly... on me. Message was: &quot;You feel mites crawling into your wounds&quot;. Arrgh!! Effects remains for ages. <br />
According to another site effect is diseased-based. Remember the stats on tail? Dex+7 (nice!) sv dis -10 (argh again!).<br />
Spell description:<br />
- +5 to disease counter<br />
- 15 DD<br />
- 4 dmg/tick for 600 ticks<br />
I wouldn t complain if it doesn t proc ;) <br />
<br />
Still no clue on removing the curse. I keep it in bank at the moment, in case there s some quest I missed...<br />
<br />
Be safe all, and don t use any crap you find on dead opponents <br />
<br />
;) <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

What I notice is that there is no evidence that the proc is going off.  Sometimes I see some sparkles but the only sure thing is &quot;Mob yawns&quot;.  On one and only one occaision in over a hundred fights did i see &quot;Mob resisted Tagars Insects (or whatever they are called)&quot;.<br />
<br />
My point is if the proc doesnt tell me it is going off it may not tell you, you are too low for the proc to go off.</div></div><hr />
