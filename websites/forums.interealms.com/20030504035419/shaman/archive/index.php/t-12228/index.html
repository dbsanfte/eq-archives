<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Other than the Ancient spells, does anyone know of any other class that has a No Drop spell that only drops somewhere requiring a difficult key, as Primal Avatar does?  One that is completely unreachable without an uberguild?<br />
<br />
I realize it's hardly our most important spell, but if no other class has a spell like this, it may be worth a crusade to get this spell made more accessible.<br />
<br />
I loathe missing spells....</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
Perhaps we can at least research it someday when they fix the apparently broken recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't see any other non-ancient dropped spells that are no drop. The closest I can find are these quested spells:<br />
Porlos' Fury (dragon bane), Wiz/60, no drop<br />
Hsagra's Wrath (giant bane), Wiz/60, no drop<br />
<br />
But at 65, Ferine Avatar negates any need for the Primal version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's no different than a melee who has to get the same zone access and kill the same mobs to get a primal weapon.  Just because a spell exists in the game, it's not your birthright to scribe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Of course it's not my birthright, this is a game. :p  But if no other classes are required to be in uberguilds (or uberalliances, etc) in order to get one of their equivalent spells (meaning non-Ancients) then I'm going to push to make PA somehow accessible to people who aren't keyed for ST.  Not necessarily easy to get, but at least a remote possibility would be nice.  Even just making the copies that do drop Droppable would be great, they'll trickle down here and there and give me something to look for.  As the research recipe for it has been removed from the in-game books, I think it's probably a good bet that it was a mistake and never will work.  <br />
<br />
I don't want to start yet another version of the Whether Spells Should Be Drops argument.  I've been around long enough to know better hehe.  My personal opinion is that it's not right that only shamans are required to be in an uberguild in order to get one of their non-Ancient spells.  There are lots of folks here who know a lot about other classes across all levels, so it seemed like a good place to ask in preparation to doing something about it.  That is all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">getting into sleepers tomb can be done by nonuber guilds. the zone isn't really that hard and with the addition of lvls it is triv for 4+ groups...<br />
their is no reason that just because the spell exists you should have an easy chance of getting it.  i lived without torpor for 65 lvls till i got it, i still don't have componentless avatar (not that i would ever cast it anyway), and to be honest 90% of shaman will never see ancient spells.  I have seen ancient bane drop once and lost the roll.<br />
also at the time this zone came out this spell was ment only for the uber, no getting a key is not that hard if you camp the key mobs (some key mobs being easier than others).<br />
if your guild can't get ST keys i would be more worried about the fact that you'll never see a spectral or a rune drop.  time is better spent makeing money since on my server fo7 goes for 100k.<br />
i don't mean to rant, but to be honest i don't think you want to scribe this spell anyway (or you will be sorry you did and told people about it)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You might also ask whether any other class gets an optional bonus spell like this at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya, you might ask how many people don't have spells from 4 expansions ago because they only drop from a few mobs at a rare rate.  You can ask how many spells you can't get, because you can't mobilize a raid force to kill a mob and kill it within 10 minutes of popping.<br />
<br />
You can ask alot of silly things.  But it doesn't explain why spells from 3-4 expansions ago are so rare or difficult to get to.  Why are the dropable shaman spells Malo and Torpor two of the most expensive spells in the game to buy from players still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if your guild can't get ST keys i would be more worried about the fact that you'll never see a spectral or a rune drop.<br />
<br />
This makes no sense.  A guild may be capable of getting spectral and rune drops, and have decided to spend time elsewhere.  Newer guilds do not put much priority on farming keys for ST with PoP out now.  There are too many other things to do in the game.  With each expansion it just adds more.<br />
<br />
ST is from Velious - Since then, SoL, PoP and LoY have been released.  Its 4 expansions ago.  Heck, Kunark is 5 expansions ago, and people still have a difficult time getting Torpor and Malo.  Why?  Because people don't go farm them for it, because they often hunt elsewhere.  And when they are farmed, its not to sell the spells usually, its for someone that needs.  Thats why these spells don't make it to the market often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wizards have some nice ones - <br />
<br />
Ancient Destruction of Ice and Ancient Greater Concussion - VT and Vulk Ring in NTOV<br />
<br />
GSS and EER - One is Emperor  and one is THO only (actually I think EER is now available off of 4 mobs of at least THO level in Luclin)<br />
<br />
Parlo's Fury and Hsagra's Wrath are quested and not too bad to get with one to two groups.<br />
<br />
Sunstrike and Flaming sword of Xzul are Kunark content and rarer that Malo/Torpor - before you flame I've never seen Xzul for sale, SS i've seen 4 times and I've seen Malo/Torpor for sale every day for weeks - heck I see multiple copies of each for as little as 17k on prexus but damn if I can get my level 60 spells for my wiz.<br />

  Funny, I've seen the flaming sword drop more than torpor and malo :P Don't see it for sale very often though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Beliael :)<br />
<br />
I can't say as I've ever seen either of those 4 drop but I know (if I had the cash) I would have malo/torpor/bane for my 52 shammy but even with the cash I won't see SS/Xzul anytime soon - Prexus has it's first GSS/ERR's for sale recently - they run about 140k if/when they go on the market.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Primal Weapons (and us Shaman be justifably annoyed at one of our nicest buffs being given out as a proc on them) are the only reason this spell even exists. Given that fact, it is perfectly reasonable to restrict the spell to being available only in the same manner as the weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fayclopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was lucky enough to get Primal Avatar during my uber-guild days. After one of my RL friends quit the game, I joined a smaller guild since I didn't care to spend ALL of my time raiding. This is handy for small groups of 2-3 people or even regular groups. I'd never use regular avatar but since I have the componentless one, I keep it on my pally friend all the time. Or if he's not in the group, then it either goes to the highest level monk/rogue/ranger (if tank has no problem keeping agro) or to the tank (if the tank has trouble keeping agro). Whoever you cast this on will keep agro better, do considerably more damage, proc more often and require less healing. It's not the +str that does the damage, it's the +100ATK. My pally friend has a Jeldorin now and with avatar I can sometimes go hours without healing him. I've taken to botting a monk on 2nd computer and basically shaman just slows mobs and casts avatar then I go over to the monk.<br />
<br />
On raids it's not terribly useful. It does take up a spell slot full-time. Occasionally I'll mem it and just cast it on random melees, usually one of the tanks that does'nt have primal weapon.<br />
