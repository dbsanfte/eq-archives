Prologue<br />
<br />
The sun shone brightly on the fresh snow as it climbed toward its low peak in the northern sky.  The air was cool and crisp to the natives of the land, although those from milder climes might have referred to it as cold. There was almost no breeze to disturb the snow and cause the powdery substance to obscure vision or form drifts.  For the ice covered Everfrost Peaks in winter, it was mild: only slightly below freezing.<br />
 <br />
The quiet calm of the day was broken by the sound of children's voices as they shrieked in joy as they played in the trees and rocks.  Two small forms scurried back and forth, throwing snowballs and laughing at each other.  They had no cares at all as they roughhoused about, for what danger could lurk this close to their village?  The blades and spears of the warriors of the North and the spells and bludgeons of their Holy Ones kept hostile beasts of all type at bay be they goblin, gnoll, bear or wolf.  The hunters of the village were wary and alert, and no evil could easily evade them or the magicks of the village's shamen.<br />
<br />
Yet there are always exceptions.<br />
<br />
A pair of cold eyes glinted as he watched the children cavort in the snow.A low growl rose in his throat as he thought of the tenderness of the youths that played below him, how their young flesh would taste, roasted over the fires of his tribe.  He caught himself as he raised his axe for a toss at the nearest of the youngsters: he was not here to hunt but to scout.  His mission was to gather information, not rouse the village by stealing off with their young.  He lowered himself behind a rock and<br />
waited for the children to pass him by, and their noise to fade before he resumed his mission.<br />
<br />
* * * * ** * * <br />
 <br />
&quot;Wulfie!  Come back here!  We're gonna get ourselves into trouble an' we get too far from home.  M' Ma dinna have much patience, an' I be late for supper!  M' Da either, if his dinner be made t' wait on me!&quot;   The first youngster looked to be about 9 or 10 years of age, and his brow was creased with worry as he and his friend trudged forward.  They'd be warned not to wander too far from home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ach Drewell!  We'll back in plenty o' time!  I just want t' look around th' side o' this bluff here.  I heard Rolulf say somewhat about wolf sign bein' out here.  Can ye imagine what they'd say an' we brought back a wolf pelt?&quot;   The second child was slightly taller than the first, and his hair was a dark red color.  Excitement gave his green eyes a glow that added with his smile, broke down the resistance in his golden haired friend. Drewell smiled a bit but the worry didn't leave his blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye!  The Mighty Wulfran!  And what do ye think t' be slaying th' beastie wi'?  We've naught but our belt knives and whatever sticks or rocks we find.  Truly weapons fit for heroes!  We can go hae a quick look but as soon as we've done, we head back OK?  An' it only'll be a quick look.  Ye dinna risk facing the wrath of m' Ma!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Alright then spoilsport, only a quick look and then we be heading for home.  I do need to find mysel' braver sword brothers though!  Ye canna be a champion, an' ye be afraid o' yer Ma's wrath all yer li- &quot;  The rest of the words were lost as Drewell lunged and dragged Wulfran into a snow bank and started to pummel him with his fists.  The boys wrestled a bit until Wulfran managed to throw Drewell off him and scramble back while his smaller friend caught his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peace Drewell!  I've had enough!  Ye've proven yer point!  Lets just go hae a wee peak around back o' this bluff, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Alright, but dinna be mocking the wrath o' m' Ma.  Even Aelle dinna be daring to do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye!  Too true.  An' the clan champion dinna be doin' it, far be it from me to dare it mysel'.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the two youths trudged up the hill in question and started snooping about for signs of wolves, ice cats or any other creatures they could think of.  They searched for a short time until Drewell noticed the sun starting to dip behind one of the mountains and gestured his friend that it was time to go.  Wulfran trotted over to his friend and was starting to make some comment when Drewell held up a finger and gave his head a small shake.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Dinna look behind ye Wulfie, but there be something on yon hillock t' th' south.&quot;  Wulfran started to turn for a look but Drewell stopped him. &quot;Don't turn Wulf.  I think it be watching us.  Let us head out and ye can hae a glimpse as we go... it dinna look to be coming closer but...&quot;<br />
 <br />
The lads both turned and made as if to head to their village and young Wulfran cast a glimpse over his shoulder in the direction his friend had indicated.  The shape was starting to move towards them.<br />
 <br />
&quot;It's coming Drewell!  Run!&quot;<br />
 <br />
The two broke into a run and a distance behind them, the shape started to run as well.  The boys ran at a panicked speed until they made it within sight of their village and then they turned to look for their pursuer, of which they saw no sign.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some heroes we be!  Runnin' from shadows.&quot;  Wulfran spoke with disgust.<br />
<br />
Drewell would have none of it though.<br />
 <br />
&quot;That thing, whate'er it was, wasna friendly.  It did chase th' best part o' the way home.  Do ye know what it was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay, I dinna.  It looked almost to have been a man wi' th' head o' a dog or somethin' similar, but it coulda a man wi' a mask, laughing at the foolish bairns.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Aye, that be true, but I dinna think so.  It doesna feel right.  Let us head home and we can speak of this later.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the two boys began the final leg of the journey to their<br />
respective homes and families, lost in a thoughtful silence, trying to puzzle out what could have chased them.<br />
<br />
* * * * ** * * <br />
 <br />
On a ridge a short distance away the scout cursed quietly.  How could he have been so careless as to first let himself be spotted by the whelps and then to let them get away.  If his chief found out, there would be trouble for him, indeed.  But, then again, they were only whelps, and probably not likely to be heeded in the event they did say anything.  Perhaps nothing need be said to his chief after all.  Just keep an eye out and see if the barbarian fools below increased any of their security precautions...<br />
 <br />
With his silent debate settled, the scout retreated back his perch, where he could observe the village and gather more information.<br />
<br />
* * * * ** * * <br />
 <br />
Wulfran was seated at the table awaiting his dinner, lost in thoughts about his earlier escape, when the cries from outside roused him from his reverie.  Upon hearing the noise, his father, Dolran, quickly got to his feet and grabbed his axe.  He then opened the door and headed over to the small crowd a short distance from his home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dolran!  Come see what yer eldest hath brought in!  A gnoll!  A live one at that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wulfran on hearing the shout ran out the door to see the creature his elder brother had brought to the village.  In the commotion he was all but funnoticed as he made his way through the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ach ye young dolt!  Ye should have just slit th' damned thing's throat an' left it in the drifts where ye found it!  No good'll come of this ye can be sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; A gnoll?  Where'd ye find it lad!  Was it alone or was there more?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Gnolls?  What do they be doing close in t' us?  Take up arms!&quot;<br />
 <br />
A large man, in his late prime walked forward and silenced the crowd with a few gestures.  Aelle, chieftain of the Moondancer clan was not a man to anger quickly, but he had little patience for fools either, and his temper was not something most men cared to dare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hunh!  A gnoll, eh?  Speak up lad!  An' where did ye be finding this beastie, young Wulfhaar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; 'Twas about 3 leagues t' th' so'west, Kinsman.  'Twas him and 3 others. Looked to be a hunting and foraging party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An' what makes ye so sure of this, lad?  We canna abide the jackal-kin coming so close to our village and poaching our lands. An' where do th' rest o' 'em be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The others, they be laying in the now where m' arrows and blade cut them down.  Four jackals dinna much o' a challenge t' one of the Clans! An' I judged 'em hunters by their gear: light armor and bows, not heavier gear for raiding.  Found a half-gnawed joint of venison on one o' 'em too. I brought this one an' we could lay the irons to him an' be finding out where he and his kin be comin' from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Ach but yer lad be having a good head on his shoulders, as well as stout arm, Dolran!  Well Beast: do ye understand our speech?  I'd warrant nay, but one never knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gnoll didn't answer in the speech of the clansmen but it barked back in it's own tongue a curse and challenge,<br />
<br />
&quot;Murderous barbarians!  You may have killed me and my kin but others from our tribe will feast on your bones!&quot;<br />
<br />
Many of the northerners understood the tongue of their old foe and laughed at its bravado, as it faced certain death.  In these lands, men and gnolls knew no peace, unless one side or the other was dead.  This time, it appeared the men would have the last laugh.  The villagers soon began to question the prisoner in earnest, and its howls echoed through the night.<br />
<br />
Two young sets of eyes watched the torture with more than average interest, but neither one spoke out about their recent scare.<br />
<br />
And from a tree, looking down on the village, another gnoll cursed the men for what they did to his comrade and prayed that he was able to hold his tongue.  If he did, then the men would pay dearly in the hours to come...<br />
<br />
* * * ** * * * <br />
<br />
&quot;Drewell, are ye there?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Aye Wulfie.   Did ye be seein' that?  Could it ha' been one o' the<br />
creature chasing us? It or one o' its kin?&quot;  Drewell's voice was quiet. He had witnessed death before, as this land was a harsh one to those who lived within it, but usually that death was quick or treated with respect, not the frenzied, almost joyous anticipation as the gnoll's was.  The men of the village had mercilessly questioned and tortured the beast, until they could get no more information out of it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm thinkin' 'twas it or one o' its band that was behind us.  But Wulfhaar killed the' rest o' 'em, so there's naught to be worryin' about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wulfran's eyes lost focus as he thought of his elder brother attacking and slaying the hated enemy.  He promised himself that soon it would be he, not his brother, bringing glory to his family's name!  Well, he could share a little with Wulfhaar.  Ah, but what a force they would make, the Sons of Dolran, bright blades flashing in the sun, spilling the blood of their enemies in a crimson tide upon the snow...<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm nay so sure about that.  Yer brother did be coming in from the sou'west, while we was off to the' sou'east.  An' 'twas our beast that he brought in, 'twould have had a long run in front o' it t' fin find yer brother.  An' then he had to march it in to the' village.  I'm thinking-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah!  That' be yer problem!  Ye be too long on thinkin'!  An' the one that chased us wasna' part of Wulfhaar's fun, an' it be stayin' close, then one o' the other warriors'll be taking it's life soon enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if it's nay alone?  What if it be part o' a raiding party comin' to attack the village?  What if they get one o' the' wee bairns, as be wandering a bit too far from it's ma?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ach!  But sometimes I dinna know where ye get all these notions in yer head!  Ye be talking and chattering like a shaman, instead o' a warrior, with all these thoughts!  But enough!  An' we be talkin' to our Da's, we'll be getting whupped for goin' out in the peaks like we did.  In the morn I'll talk t' Wulfhaar an' we can see what he has to say about it, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Aye, that puts me more at ease.  Yer brother will know an' anything is in need of bein' done.&quot;  Both of the younger lads idolized the elder son of Dolran, whose young reputation was just starting to grow.  At 18 summers, Wulfhaar was already a respected warrior amongst the villagers, and his judgement, while sometimes questioned because of his age by elders, was often proven to be sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I should be off to bed now, afore m' Ma or Da be noticin'...&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Aye.   Me too.  I'll be seein' you in the morn, then Drewell.&quot;<br />
 <br />
With that the two young would-be heroes, their hearts secure with their plan, headed off to their respective homes and beds.<br />
<br />
* * * ** * * * <br />
 <br />
Fehrdahl, known as the Fearless was making his rounds, as the moon started its descent.  His breath turned into small clouds in the frosty night air. His boots made small crunching sounds as he feet fell on the compacted snow and ice crystals around the village.  It wasn't a bad night, though a tad cooler than a sentry might have wished for.  One advantage to the brisk chill, however, was that the village guards were not likely to be caught sleeping at their posts.  Fehrdahl chuckled as he remembered the<br />
last time he had caught a sentry dozing at his post.  Old Ganir still had not forgiven him for the scare he had caused the veteran, but he'd not been found sleeping on watch since.<br />
<br />
As he rounded a corner of his path, heading towards the post that Angull and Gwalach manned, the chuckle died as he saw some shadows stealing quietly into the village.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ho!  Who be there?  Answer me quick, lest ye be getting the business end o' m' blade t' answer for yer tardiness!&quot;   But naught but a quiet snarl answered him until he took a step forward.  His torch cast light into the shadows, to reveal several gnolls, just starting to rush at him.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ach!  T' arms!  Gnolls in th' village!  Gnolls in th' village!&quot;  And with that shout he rushed forward into battle.   He heard some noise behind him, and could only hope it was friends and not foes that came, as he engaged the three in front of him.  His charge bowled the first of its feet, and a quick slash of his sword cut deep into the neck and shoulder of the second.  The third rushed in with a blow that he parried with his torch.  Fehrdahl wrenched his blade free and spun to attack the next gnoll, but as his blade thrust out, he felt a cold burning in his stomach, as an enemy thrust a spear into him, from behind.  He never felt the flurry of blows that descended on him as he stumbled to his knees and then into the snow.<br />
<br />
 * * ** * * *<br />
 <br />
The shouts of Fehrdahl echoed throughout the village and the inhabitants grabbed whatever weapons were closest and rushed to aid in the defense.<br />
<br />
Their surprise taken away from them, the raiders were outnumbered, even though they were better armored than their enemies, who had been roused from their beds.  It wasn't an uncommon sight to see a naked man or woman throwing themselves into the attack, with just their weapon and fury to protect them.  This resulted in several casualties, but as the attack subsided, it was evident that whoever these raiders were, they were no match for the fury of the Moondancer Clan.<br />
<br />
 Aelle strode forth into the village circle and called to his sub-chieftains,<br />
<br />
&quot;Rolulf, Dolran, Martag!  Attend me!  I want t' know who is hurt, who is dead and how many of the jackal-kin are slain!  An' I want t' know where, in name of the Tribunal, they came from!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Save yer breath callin' for Dolran, Chieftain.  He lies o'er by his cabin door, with half a score o' the vermin around him.  The buggers took him down, his wife Layena, and young Wulfhaar is sorely wounded as well.  The Holy Ones aren't sure if he'll live or nay. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the Hammers!  Tell ye true, Rolulf?  Tell me its not so!&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I wish I could, but 'twould be lies an' I did.  There's o'er a score of dead gnolls around his cabin, so ye know that his family took a heavy toll.  His younger son, young Wulfran looks to be in a bad way too.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ach!  Ye mean they went after a youngster like that?  The cowardly beasts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay, Aelle, he looks to be fine in body, save for a scrape or two.  He was there, with a fallen blade though, an' we found him, hacking the dead gnolls to pieces.  He appears to be crazed with grief, at what's befallen his family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor lad.  We best see if we can calm him down.  What about others?  How many others did we lose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like Fehrdahl, though I think it was him that raised the alarm. Three or four others as well, not many considering.  About half a score wounded though only four of those appear to be of any serious nature.  We can't see where they came from nor fled to, but we'll track them back to their lair come the dawn.  There may have been as many as five score in the attack.  They left better than two score on the ground here.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Only two score of them dead, to answer for almost a score of casualties of our own?  Come the dawn I want half the able bodied warriors of the village to seek these cowards and take our bloody vengeance from them!  I want blood!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the chieftain finished his cry for vengeance, a feral howl split the night. <br />
<br />
&quot;What in the name of the Gods was that?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Young Wulfran he did see the healers trying to save his brother.  He did loose that howl and he ran out into the night!  We'll nay find him in thisdark!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it all to the Hells!  Farstag! Ulli! Mantak!  Come daylight, I want ye to try and find the lad.  Tie him an' ye must, just bring him back safe an' ye can.  It's a great crime what happened to his family, but I don't want it any worse than it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
*******<br />
 <br />
The following dawn, nearly three score warriors of the Moondancer Clan and a handful of their shamen set out from the village.  The trackers found that the young Wulfran appeared to be following the same prey as the hunters, so all the trackers remained in one main group.  The trail of the gnolls was easy for the experienced hunters to follow, as the raiders appeared to have several wounded with them in their flight.  More than once, the hunting party found a dead gnoll at the side of the trail, where its kin had killed and left it, once it became too much of a burden to carry on.   <br />
<br />
Around noon, the scouts of the Clan came back to Aelle that the main body of the enemy was just ahead and appeared to be stopping for a time, but that there was no sign of the young Wulfran.    The chieftain called his warriors together and outlined his plan of attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martag, take ten warriors around to the left and wait.  Rolulf, I want ye take another ten around them to the right.  I will lead the main body in a straight charge and I want ye to time your charges into their flanks, so ye blindside them and turn their flanks.  First Martag then Rolulf.  Do you understand?  An' we e doing this right, there should be few losses to us and much hurt to them.  By the look, I'd say they outnumber us by about 3 to 2 but since when are jackal-kin equal to the men of the North in a stand up fight?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two subchieftains quickly assembled their groups and with as much stealth as could be mustered, made their way to their positions.  <br />
<br />
Ill fortune befell Martag's group, though when Gwalach slipped on an icy rock and fell.  This was spotted by the gnoll sentries, and soon the encampment was boiling up the rise at the small party.  Aelle, spotting this, urged his men forward, to save their brethren.<br />
<br />
&quot;For Dolran and our Kin! Death to the jackals!&quot;<br />
 <br />
The cry rang out from the throats of close to 50 warriors as the battle was joined. Rolulf, being a cagey veteran, held his force back and circled until they were in the direct rear of the fray.  Just as he was about lead his troop in, a shrill, feral howl broke the air and young Wulfran sped into battle at the head of a half dozen wolves, waving a sword he had picked up, presumably from the raid on the village.  Ranulf's troop watched in amazement as the wolves followed the stripling Northman into the fight and tore into the gnolls.  The youngster swung his stolen sword with reckless abandon and appeared not to care whether the gnolls harmed him or not.  The superstitious gnolls reeled from the attacked on their rear and tried to disengage.<br />
<br />
Rolulf broke from the amazed trance he was in and urged his comrades forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon!  Let's go!  We canna let the lad be doin' all the fightin' for<br />
us! Onwards! lest we be thought dwarfs an' nay Men o' th' North that we let others be doin' our fightin' fer us! &quot;<br />
<br />
The fight quickly degenerated into a rout and slaughter.  Rolulf's attack was straight into the main path of retreat for the gnolls, and as a result, few made it free of the general melee, and they were quickly overtaken and pulled down by the wolves.  Soon there was a silence of the battlefield, broken only by a few moans from wounded Northmen and the snarls of the wolves around Wulfran.  Suddenly he and all the wolves let loose a series of howls and ran back into the forest.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Damn me, but that was a strange sight indeed!&quot;  Aelle muttered as he watched the boy and his companions fade into the bushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye witnessed the Will of the Gods, Chieftain.  Do not tempt them o'ermuch by calling damnation upon thyself: on this day, They be listening all too well t' th' words of their children. And send not thy hunters after th' lad: he be touched by Them and will be protected an' They wish it.&quot;  The shaman Valgrim turned her stern look from the stunned Aelle to the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;One does have t' wonder though, which Gods did chose th' lad and what they will o' him.  'Tis only natural for us, but do not interfere.&quot;<br />
<br />
*******<br />
 <br />
For several years, the stories abounded of a feral youth hunting with a pack of wolves.  Evidence would be found of encounters with orcs or gnolls, with the bloodied bodies of the monsters and wolf-prints in the snow, as the main evidence of what happened.  Small groups or lone travelers would bring tales of glimpsing a red haired youth, running across the heights with a pack of wolves.  There were rare tales of travelers being beset by monsters, and then being rescued by an incursion of wolves, led by a youth, clad in skins and wielding a sword.  As time passed the stories continued and the legend grew.<br />
<br />
As he heard more of the tales, a young shaman by the name of Wulfhaar wept for his lost brother and prayed that the Gods would be kind to him.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
 <br />
The fire crackled softly as the young shaman chanted by the flames.  The smoke from the fire gently wafted skyward as her soft droning voice carried for some distance, beseeching aid from the Powers.  Her blue eyes were locked at a point deep in the embers of the fire, and a bead of perspiration formed on her forehead.  Her brow was slightly creased as she concentrated on the chant, willing the Spirits to play their part in this ritual.<br />
<br />
Across the fire, an older figure set and watched impassively.  He wasn't sure that his apprentice was ready for this, but he could not forbid her the trying.  Every shamanic apprentice had the right to attempt the Summoning, but few succeeded at her age.  It often took many years of practice with lesser rituals and purification of the soul, but his pupil was very promising.  She was incredibly adept at the healing arts and performed the ceremonies of her people and Gods flawlessly.  Even as he felt trepidation at her attempting this spell, he watched her with pride.<br />
<br />
She would be great one, would young Vhela.  He only hoped that if she didn't succeed this night, that the disappointment wouldn't ruin her, as had happened in the past.  The Clans would lose if that happened.<br />
 <br />
Vhela stood tall and her voice slowly raised its pitch as the incantation drew to a climax.  In the distance a wolf howled.  Tarloff felt a thrill as he heard it: would his young protégé actually summon her spirit guide and companion?  He carefully maintained the passive mask of his face, not wanting to give Vhela false confidence.  There would be time enough for pride later, or a need for bolstering confidence, whatever the case may be.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a howl broke the air from very close and as Vhela completed the last of her chant a figure burst from the forest and leapt to the center of the small clearing, just across the fire from the young apprentice and stared hard at her.  The figure straightened from its crouch to reveal an unkempt young man, with long, shaggy reddish brown hair and green eyes staring raptly at the shamaness.  A hand wavered for a second, wanting to go to the hilt over his shoulder, but he restrained himself and glanced cautiously around, and took in his surroundings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why have ye brought me here?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Who are ye?  Why did ye interrupt my ritual?  This be an important test of my ability you intrude upon!  Off with you!  Th' night all but gone and my herbs spent!  Great oaf!  Who are ye t' be traipsing about in th' dark like this an' have disturbed my spell?<br />
Answer me quick, lest I use my magic to curse you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tarloff was still recovering from the shock of the young man's appearance, but he spoke up, &quot;Patience Vhela.  Something very strange hath taken place on this eve.  Methinks thy magic was not interrupted, just that it has been answered in a strange manner.  The Gods may be playing tricks or no, but that will yet be revealed.  Curb thy anger, child.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Curb my anger?  This oaf hath undone the work o' weeks!  T' try again for this shall require me t' gather many ingredients, some of which won't be found again until next autumn!&quot;  She turned on the youth again.  &quot;I ask you again: who are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...&quot; The youth struggled with the words, his lips moving silently, giving testimony to his battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Master Tarloff?  He knows not his own name!  He- &quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;My name be Wulfran... why have ye brought me here?  What be this place? Who are ye?  Where are m'Kin? Everything is so... hazy...&quot; The youth spoke slowly and hesitantly, as though unused to speech.  <br />

Vhela was silent for a minute and then spoke quietly, &quot;You're in the wilds near the village of Dunlarn.  I am Vhela and this is Master Tarloff.  We are servants of the Gods, and I was attempting to Summon my companion spirit.  Where did you come from?  Who are your Kin?  You dress so strangely, with those furs and skins, as though you live off the wilds, yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My village be... Killarth.  My kin be the Moondancer clan.&quot;  The words slowly gathered speed as he spoke, confidence in his ability to speak returning with each word that passed his lips.  &quot;I... Dunlarn ye say?  By the Gods that be farther than I've e'er been from Killarth. M' Ma and Da'll...&quot;  As his memory of speech returned, so too did the memories of the night the gnolls raided his village.  Images of jackal-like faces, swords flashing and his parents and brother being struck down, all crashed into him.  With a wordless cry he collapsed to his knees and wept.  His head hung low and tears streamed from eyes that were locked in the horror of the past.<br />
<br />
Vhela ran to him and hugged him to her &quot; Easy Wulfran.  Let it out.  Let your grief flow.  It will heal you, just let it flow.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the minutes passed, young Wulfran, a youth of 18 or 19 summers wept like as a stricken child. Vhela just knelt with him and held him.<br />
<br />
Thus, as one legend of the North died.  And thus another was born.<br />

<br />
The youth stared wide-eyed at the crowds, taken aback by the mass of people and the noise that accompanied them.  Everywhere he looked, people were selling, buying, stealing, eating, drinking, gambling and pursuing other activities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ach!  I've not seen so many people in all m' life, ne'er mind all in one place!  How do they live like this?  The noise is enough to make a man go mad!&quot;  His posture showed the tension of a man expecting an attack at any second: his stance defensive and wide legged, his hand at his sword's hilt and he was quickly looking around him, as if searching for a warning of the enemy that would jump out at him.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Rest easy, Tall One!  You've seen more people than this, just not this many all at once.   It takes a little getting used to, but you'll be OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bard had some difficulty suppressing a chuckle, but did so, lest the young warrior decide he was the enemy he was looking for.  &quot;Vhela has been here before and she's never been harmed by it.  You'll survive too. Cities like this can be a lot of fun once you get used to 'em.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The bard known as Musiclaw grinned at the barbarian youth, trying to put him at ease, but it didn't appear to be working.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell ya what, Wulfie, what say you and I go get a drink and some lunch to help you relax?  You must be starving by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye Master Musiclaw!  I be famished!   I've had naught t' eat all day and scant fare yesterday as well!  My rations ran out th' night before last and th' trail was bare o' creatures t' hunt.  I was loathe t' spend extra time on th' trail, foraging, so I made all possible speed.&quot;<br />
