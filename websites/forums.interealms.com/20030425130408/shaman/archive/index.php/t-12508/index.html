<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lucent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why does the level 55 pet cant proc any of the mage summoned weapons. I have tried  the wind blade(its called something else but it has the wind DD proc) and the hands of ixiblat and it keeps saying his will is insufficent to command these weapons. However what makes no sense at all is that my 49 pet will proc with the hands of ixiblat!<br />
Why is this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my experience 55 pet will proc fists of ixiblat but not the mage summoned blades you are talking about. If you had given him one of each(like I did the first time) then you will see the fists proc but the insufficient will message for blade. It wasn't until I went back and studied fight messages that I determined that fists procced and blade didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ixi fists proc starting at level 10 i think... the 55 pet can definately proc them. The blades wont work until you get the 61 pet.</div></div><hr />
