<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.... I was wondering some questions on PLing a shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Which would be better to PL my shaman?. My 47 monk ( all his HP stuff is on the shaman... all he gots is acrylia crap with no HP, IFS and FBSS ) or my 29 druid?. <br />
<br />
<br />
2) What are the best zones to PL him in?. He is currently 12. I dont have luclin on the Shaman's account so thats out.<br />
<br />
3) Do I really need to buy all my spells?. Some of them are a tad expensive when you add it all up. I mean whats the point of buying a 56 point DoT when you've got conjuration maxed and the toon standing behind you EITHER can chainnuke for 171 OR double for 150+ on greenies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TYVM for your advice guys. Im also going to post this on the shaman board to get their input. I really want to duo with my shaman but I feel im getting nowhere only getting maybe 2 or 3 levels in 2 or 3 hours. Also in oasis 1 of 2 kills is KS'd. Yes even by high levels passing buy. They seem to think a ghoul is too hard for a level 11 with a 29 druid or 47 monk standing behind him... the stupidity of some people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">FBSS plus DS will send your shammy from level 1 to 20 in couple of hours. Shamans have a heart of a warrior and can tank just about as well till about level 20. If you intend to use the JBB then don't play Iksar. I was level 45ish when I started reading the message boards and by then I was way too attached to my Iksar, I cry at the fact I can't use JBB, it makes a tough race a JOKE to play especially without an Epic (Try flame me here, I dare you).<br />
<br />
Main problem is you'll get to level 20 and your spells will be pure fizzle so you will have to make sure you use them all the time.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 20 bring over the monk, slap the mobs around till they barely alive and then FD and let the shaman finish off for full experience (good spell practice and defence build-up here). Will take a little practice as the monk can do just a little too much and KS your shaman.<br />
<br />
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TRYING TO PL YOUR SHAMAN PAST 30, you will need to learn all the tricks of the trade at this point and 30 to 34 (few levels before pet) is the primary character building stage for a shaman (IMHO). If your spell skills are not up to scratch here you're going to spends hours or days just practicing them. If you PL the shaman in Lake of Ill Omen then the plat and gold looted will easily pay for your spells. Only player sold spells are expensive and the expensive ones are the 56+ spells which is a very long way off. At this point put 1 point in each specialise field. I figure if your alteration does not get to 100 by the time the any of the others get to 20 then you are not playing the shaman properly (for an Alteration specilised shaman like myelf. What area does Canni fall under you ask yourself ? And then you know why).<br />
<br />
At 34 you can group with your monk and this is where you need your shaman spells most. The monk/shaman combo is so sweet. You'll shaman will catch up levels very fast here and will be like PL even though your not PLing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had the opposite problem with a shaman PLing a taxi (druid). Was only able to melee effectively till high teens with full shaman buffs and druid self DS. Shaman is by far the easiest caster to PL.<br />
<br />
Well it doesn't matter what anyone on the boards thinks about PLing just as long you enjoy the game. If you enjoy yourself then that's 50% what counts. The other 50% is not screwing it up for others by being a bad shaman (group downtime from oom , group death from bad spell choice or lack of skill, and many other reasons that should follow this post). <br />
<br />
HAVE FUN,<br />
