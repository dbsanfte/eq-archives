Of course you meant South Karana...  ;)  I spent 10 levels or so in South K, and am very familiar with Moel, Moell, Mooel, or whichever alt he happens to have logged in at any given time. Fortunately, Moel isn't out there 24/7 (even though it sure seems like it), so I have seen uncontested spawns of Quillmane. And I know of a fellow ranger who has the cloak....  :cool:</div></div><hr />

So I asked for a PC a few times on Sol Ro... answers vary between 5 and 20 K pretty consistently, so I suppose that depends pretty much who you ask  and what he has to gain from giving a high or low price... or there really is such a latitude in the range :)</div></div><hr />

I gave the cloak to my wife after locating Quill on track (had her loot him), and we are considering what, if anything, we want to do with it.  On the one hand, she is finding it very useful, as a class that does not get Levi, and on the other, she is very concerned that our guild will not be able to get me my epic (she wavers between despair and futility with respects to getting her Water Sprinkler, unfortunately :().  We do not wish to exploit or gouge anyone, but by the same token we do not want to pass up an admittedly rare opportunity.<br />
<br />
Were it just me, I would like to say that there would be no contest, but I am just as tempted as her to MQ this thing.  Its compounded by the fact that we really don't know any mage friends, other than a near-dormant account owned by a guildmate that has not even started on the epic component.<br />
<br />
In any event, thank you all for the input.  We're not going to make a decision about the cloak for a while yet, as she's still finding some good use out of it and when all is said and done, having her happy is a bit more important than my epics to me, or the goodwill of any mage.  At least, should we decide to MQ it, we know how much NOT to charge, and have a better idea of a &quot;fair&quot; price, so to speak.</div></div><hr />

and i'd give it up but all my mage buddies have em already, plus like everyone in my guild has two or more (lol yeah) so ... i bet an earnest ranger could get a reaver or a hate stone for cloak (some pp with the cloak) ... i'd prolly sell it cheap tho, i just want a horsie and some IGS =)</div></div><hr />

Not worried about anything except the sky stone and the hate stone, frankly, Tal.  Those two are rough to get, from all accounts, however :\<br />

<br />
I was just soloing at the Spires in SK when this white-pegasus-thing literally flew across the screen right in front of me.<br />
<br />
Having never seen one in game before I figured I would get a closer look, take a screenshot,.....then kill it!     :D <br />
<br />
If I would've known how rare a spawn he was and that he dropped a component for the Mage epic I definately would have given a /shout out across the zone.<br />
<br />
As it was, I didn't even really want the cloak at first.  It didn't have much AC and LEV was something I had been without up to that point and didn't really care if I had it.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, I am never without the thing.   Can't beat a mana-free LEV that can be cast from a general inventory slot!  <br />
<br />
It's actually one of my most prized possesions.<br />
<br />
So, the least I could let it go for is 15kpp.   LOL     ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Element of Air, sub quest for mage epic<br />
1) quillmane cloak<br />
2)elemental binder<br />
3) Crown of elemental mastery<br />
<br />
now im not sure how often guilds go to plane of sky on your server, on mine it might happen once every 6 months, on avg 0 to 6 crowns can drop from island SEVEN in plane of sky,  how often do guilds go to island 7?<br />
<br />
so expect that once a quater at best 0 to 7 mages might be able to get epic and you might have 0 to 7 potential customers to MQ the cloak with.</div></div><hr />

/pfffft to his RL brother that gave him attitude over leveling and was offering to buy MQ from 'other' peeps instead of being friendly <br />
<br />
/rant on  this damned cloak SHOULD be castable on the move, (aka mage lev rings)  and SHOULD be able to be cast on others.. <br />
<br />
for it's rarity  what friggin harm would it be to be 'slightly' more useful????? <br />
<br />
ohh and when i first got it  was one of the most grand moments in my rangers life.   solo'd the horse totally unprepared for the fight, tough blue con   and on recieving my cloak couldn't figureout why i couldn't equip it..<br />
<br />
wouldn't go on the back slot.. tried tried tried  and checked stats..<br />
/petitioned..  and 'just' as the GM responded read, 'shoulder' <br />
/sigh...  apologize to Gm and say thanks for prompt service.. <br />

<br />
I had one chance but was low on health and mana.  I just chased it giving loc updates in OOC hoping a friendly mage would get there, but a druid got there first.<br />
<br />
I guess I could have rooted it and held it for the mage but I had literally one bubble of health and 1/3 of 1 bubble mana at the time and didn't want to risk root breaking and getting my butt handed to me waiting for snare and /or root to re-take.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have decided to keep it for personal use, seeing as we know of no mages who need it.  Yumi likes being able to levi up at will, and it saves me batwings :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">decairn</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well its an epic item for mages, so 5-15k depending upon the level of desperation of the mage.<br />
<br />
However, if you have one, keep it and use for batwing-less levitations.  The convenience outweighs most cash gain you could get from selling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I don't have a problem with discussion--and we kept ours in tells.  But this anonymous unguilded person raked me and the intermediate guild I am in across the coals for &quot;taking advantage of poor mages&quot; etc.  He also claimed that several high level guild mages on TT would &quot;sanction&quot; me if they knew of my actions.  (Does that mean I won't be able to join them--I'm not sure) But I only play a few hours a week so I may never make 55+ anyway--I just made 40 this week : ) !<br />
<br />
BTW our guild has no mages above level 30--we're definitely not a raid guild. <br />
<br />
Can any high level rangers on Terris Thule (or other servers)comment about this?  I've seen MQ for other epics auctioned in Bazaar, and it seems generally to be an accepted practice among rangers.  Is there a different expectation among the higher-level guilds on our server?<br />

You remember that when you see those Wizards and Mages selling Jade Reavers for 15-20K.  I've lost all sympathy for other classes and the selling of their epic pieces.<br />

I stumble across Quillmane often, and have found 3 cloaks in the last year.<br />

One I'm holding for someone on my server, he's only 2 pieces off from being ready to use it.  We haven't set a price, but I figured I'd let his conscience speak for him.<br />
