<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all, <br />
<br />
We wanted to pass along an update on our work on EverQuest classes. We are still gathering data from many of the logs that we have now enabled, however discussions are still occurring and progress is being made. We wanted to answer a couple of questions in the meantime to keep you all up to date. <br />
<br />
Why do you need all this new data, don't you log everything anyway? <br />
<br />
While many things in EQ have always been logged, others have not. When we decided to begin the process of evaluating class roles in groups, we found that some of the data we wanted was not available, so in our last update we added many new logging features. We found that some of the logs had to be adjusted to get us better information and we have made the necessary changes and plan to push them live with our next scheduled update. At the loggings completion, we will have mountains of accurate, server gathered data that will need to be digested and organized. <br />
<br />
The EQ team stated that they wanted to evaluate group roles, what does that mean? <br />
<br />
We hear from some classes in the EQ community that in a group situation, they are less desirable than other classes. That's not a fun position to be caught in when you are playing a game that relies upon groups for most encounters. This prompted the team to sit down and took a hard look at what roles there are in a typical group (Tank, DPS, Healing, Debuff, Crowd Control, Pulling, Buffing are some examples but there are others) *Note that these can be broken down into sub groups and debated endlessly, however for the sake of this discussion let's settle on these for now*. We then identified which classes filled which roles and numerically identified how well they filled that particular role. After this exercise, it was plain to see that some classes filled several roles well and others performed in a secondary or tertiary role only. This came as no surprise to us, but we felt it was an important first step to formally identify where we felt classes are today so we could get a better perspective on how much each class would need to change to help bring it in line with the other classes in EverQuest. <br />
<br />
Does SOE consider every role to be of equal value to a group? <br />
<br />
As the game has changed and evolved, the roles have shifted in their value. For example, the advent of longer buff timers means that a buffer might not be as needed in a pick up group as a DPS class is because the buffs can be acquired by players in a safe zone long in advance of actually reaching the content that requires them. This is another tricky part of this puzzle that we are sorting out. We are looking at the group roles and intend to make sure that each role is necessary. <br />
<br />
When do you plan to release your conclusions and make changes? <br />
<br />
When we have conclusions, we will release them. The end result of all this may be a few minor tweaks, or it may be some vast sweeping changes. We are far too early in the process to state what will be changing. We will make any changes slowly and with your full awareness. We will put things on test for you to mull over and consider and gather your feedback as we do. This is very much a cooperative effort between our community and our development team. <br />

If they go to short duration buffs or buffs that are only in effect while the player is grouped a la EQ 2, I don't know what I'll do (not that they might do that, I'm just paranoid)</div></div><hr />

As in, we're looking at shortening buff duration to make sure buff classes are &quot;necessary&quot; in groups. I share Glori's initial paranoia. I'm not interested in short duration crap. At all.<br />

<br />
I think this is more from the chanter community and the 3-4 hr KEI prob, where people buy a KEI in pok which they believe makes them unwanted in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is the first thing I thought of when I read it too Gloriana. That would definitely make us a busy group and not having c3 all the time would suxxor. <br />
<br />
It's a pretty tricky thing to fix if you think about it. I honestly think they should work on warriors and clerics the most to make them more managable in a group. Clerics get the best healing ability in the game but they can't really hold their own if they get hit too much (obviously there are exceptions to the rule) but I'm talking about from the ground up a cleric has a rough life (similar to a warrior)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, if there are two classes who really need help in regards to desirability it's certainly Clerics and Warriors...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make all buffs uniformally 1 hour duration. Conviction, Steeloak Skin, KEI, VoQ, Brells, Regen, Haste, Etc.  Scale mana cost from what they are now to what they would be if extended or reduced. Obviously 15k mana champion is a bit over the top, but since it's a special buff, just leave it the way it is.<br />
<br />
I really don't see why one class needs 5 different lines of spells that all have different durations. Focus is 1h 20 min, all the stat buffs are 1h 3 min, Regen is 20.5 min, Haste is 16 min (or 36 for ToA), Champion is 6 min. it's ridiculous. I want to be able to get this crap done so I can exp, raid, or whatever. Having things falling off all at different times is just a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
1 hour duration (plus any extension) is a reasonable duration, because it limits buff botting (at least in PoK), so that groups will either group with that class, trade buffs with another group in that zone, or go without. None of this &quot;grab KEI and Viction and you're good for 4 hours&quot; nonsense.<br />
<br />
There has to be a happy medium, where buffs aren't too long so as they can just be bought, and you are set, and they aren't too short where the person will likely either dedicate a spell gem to it because it wears off so quickly, or refuse to cast the spell at all due to frustration.<br />
<br />
Please work on re-evaluating what each buff does, its impact on the group, and scale mana cost, duration, and possibly strength based upon what is adequate. The idea is for buffs enhancing the group in addition to what combat abilities a class provides. when playing a class becomes a chore of maintaining buffs so that it actually interrupts normal exp/raid procedure, not only is it not fun, it's aggravating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of scares me if they think you should get a group because of your buffs.<br />
Like Glorianna said if they go to short duration buffing etc its gonna be **** out there.<br />

<br />
Yeah, if they decrease any of our buff durations, I'll quit.  Buffing should be a side role.  If SOE can't figure out an active role for each class in group encounters, that's their fault.  <br />
<br />
Another thing that worries me:<br />

We then identified which classes filled which roles and numerically identified how well they filled that particular role. After this exercise, it was plain to see that some classes filled several roles well and others performed in a secondary or tertiary role only.<br />
<br />
I hope by that, they don't intend to INCREASE the roles that each class can play in a group...  What SOE should be working on is very clearly defined primary roles and secondary roles for each class.  The single biggest problem with the shaman today is that we can do so many things, but we do them all poorly.  <br />
<br />
The jack of all trades concept does not work in cutting edge content. I can see how classes like the wizard feel they need a valuable secondary role, as any number of classes can serve the dps role just fine.  But for the shaman who can already server as ok buffers, best slowers, poor healers, poor cc, poor dps, etc... more roles in not the answer.  If anything, they need to remove a couple of our roles and boost our remaining ones.<br />
<br />
But that brings me to another point:  the content that has been designed so far, has been designed with the current class abilities in mind.  Just how is SOE going to radically redesign classes without changing the content to match?  Oh wait... they aren't.  My prediction, when all is said and done, is that a few classes with limited roles (like wizard) will gain some utility, while jack of all trade classes (like shaman) will see little in the way of meaningful changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention the concept of rebuffing entire raid forces with key buffs over and over for those long encounters.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey, they could nerf the duration of SCRM and then add some high price AA's in the new expansion to bring it back up to the same effect!<br />

<br />
I definitely don't think I would enjoy the game/class as much standing around with 7 buffs in my spell gems and one slow/disease slow or a heal. I like the fact that I can nuke something every so often, DoT the mob, or back up heal the clerics/other members of my group (especially in raids) If they make the duration so minimal that this has to happen then they best make ONE shaman buff spell that does it all and is MGBable at all times. Otherwise we will have no other use than to buff all the time with the occasional slow. Plus who has the mana to do that for a durration of a raid. It's already rough enough on my guild having 4 shaman on a raid and (since we aren't able to get glowing and greater runes as easily yet) have single cast fort and wunshi. <br />
<br />
And I agree that wizards are a bit shafted as well, I think in the past when they decided hey, lets make a beastlord, hey lets make a zerker, hey.... why don't you make the classes you currently have work initially then add new ones as things even out. Add more races if you want to add more flare, not classes. You have enough as it is LOL. Perhaps class mergers should be done :) Then I could have a a lvl 70 Shaman Lord or a Warmonk to play with :). A Cleripal, Necroknight, Rangezerker, Barogue, Magizard, or Chantermonk.<br />

Amen.<br />
<br />
1 hour buffs are fine (or 50 mins or 80 mins or whatever). If this is meant to adress the &quot;lasts one RL day&quot; buffs that is fine. If it is meant as a &quot;all buffs are going to have their durations cut inhalf&quot; deal it is beyond idiocy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
soe has been pushing the game to where they want you to group and not solo.  We especially see than in the patch where solo xp was nerfed, and in the patch where bonus grouping xp was added (i am not saying i agree with their outlook on soloing btw, i was just pointing out the facts.) <br />
also in referance to your statement, we could debate what soloing actually means, and we could debate it forever... you get kei and conviction before you solo? i don't call that &quot;soloing&quot;...<br />

<br />
i find it encouraging that they are actually telling us what they are doing to help to define class roles... this is the first time i can think of where we have actually heard anything of the sort (outside of, we are talking about it...)  personally i would like to see a breakdown of where they think all the classes stand.  a spread sheet version would be nice =)  at anyrate, i think this is a small step in the right direction.<br />
<br />

<br />
IF they change buff duration I think that is mostly aimed at 4 hour clarity and Virtue/Conviction. I do agree though that having one class with multiple timers on different buffs is stupid and that is one thing I would like to see them fix.<br />
<br />
Wizards already have a secondary role. Translocate and travel is what they got and it is not a bad role at that. Is it valuable enough to be really considered a secondary role? I guess we will find out that as well.<br />
<br />
Yeah, if there are two classes who really need help in regards to desirability it's certainly Clerics and Warriors... /feels the sarcasam   :) <br />
<br />
When it comes to desirability take a look at berserkers. I personally think this should be the biggest DPS class. I mean what else are you going to do besides foam at the mouth and hit mobs with stuff that takes two hands to hold. Rogues got thier secondary utility so they can live with being second on the parsing charts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wizards are savage super killing machines.  They're not suffering at all.  They have a limited role, but damn, they do it excellently.  Oh, and just for kicks, they get Succor.  The specialist classes, that only do one thing, are really easy to balance, and pretty much are.  Warriors, Clerics, Rogues, Wizards, just fine.  When you start getting wishy washy about taking away from a core power to give another ability, then balance is an issue.  How much nuking power is it right to give up, for a pet and some disposable toys? How much healing power is it right to give up, to gain the nuking power of a magician?  And (this is where we come in) how much of everything do you forego based on the power of three four-year-old spells?<br />

This is the place to be all doom-and-gloom-y, it seems.  Thus that last sentence.  But shamans aren't doin' so bad, seems to me.  I can be main healer in groups all the way into Riftseeker's, and when I don't have to be, I get to toss in my 250dps, all without losing mana.  My groups are much better because I'm there instead of someone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is very true, people that enjoy soloing as their primary play style have been nerfed and discouraged to the extreme.  I just meant that a theoretical buff-length nerf would take it one step further and pretty much ensure that you must be able to handle whatever with your own buffs, potions, clickies, whatever.  Many are capable of this, many more are not.  Also depends on your personal ability and experience at this.<br />
<br />
Soloing with someone else's buffs is soloing....with padding.  If gives an extra margin of safety OR convenience.  <br />
<br />
But in the end, it's not going to be possible to make &lt;b&gt;everyone&lt;/b&gt; happy, no matter how hard they try to be fair.  That is the reality.</div></div><hr />

Actually, wizards still lag behind rogues in the burst and long term DPS dept which is wrong.  The end game itemazation really sucks for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You're talking about rogues who have one of three mainhand weapons, 60 or higher worn backstab bonus, maximum atk, high accuracy, etcetera.<br />
<br />
For the effort that's required to play a rogue up to the DPS capacity where they out burst a wizard, it's fair for them to do so when a wizard merely needs some AAs into quick damage, a direct damage focus, a spell, and mana preservation.<br />
<br />
Wizards can afk on raids, sit back and nuke from a distance, and all sorts of nonsense, rogues can't. They actually have to be in there stabbing away constantly working for thier damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I wouldn't mess with the duration at all.<br />
<br />
What I would do is to change how buffs work as far as the benefit a person receives.<br />
<br />
Full effectiveness if you are grouped (raid or single group) with the person who casted the buff on you.<br />
<br />
Reduced effectiveness if you aren't grouped (raid or single group) with the person that casted the buff. (say 40% as effective just as a number to throw out)<br />
<br />
I think it would go a long way toward eliminating the people who sit in PoK etc... selling buffs which does hurt group desireability for several classes.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this idea could be developed more, but it's an interesting thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The genie is out of the bottle on buff durations.  If SoE shortens any of them there will be a stampede to other games.  They help for both soloing and groups.  It's not like groups don't take clerics or chanters if they get a chance.  Lol.  Let's be honest.  Shammy buffs are all dispensible in this game mainly because they are short duration as well as being insignificant compared to the others.<br />
<br />
How many people do we all know who left for other games after discovering how ugly the grind to 70 was going to be?  It wasn't just that there were new games it was that they didn't involve horrendous grinds.  Shortening buff durations takes us back to the old days when it would take a couple weeks to make a level.  Do any of you want to go to trying to get 1 AA in a day of grinding?  I sure don't.  But that's what is going to happen if my group in MPG can't find KEI ahead of time and there are not enough chanters to go around in the zone.<br />
<br />
Let's be clear:  There is absolutely NO class whose primary function should be buffing because there is absolutely NO ONE who will play that class.<br />
<br />
As a shaman I do more buffing than any other class.  I do more than I want to now.  I do not live to buff.  It is not an enjoyable part of the class.  It is part of playing a shaman well but it is not the fun part.  Buffs should be added features offered by different classes and never be essential alone.  Focus and all the other shaman buffs should run 4 hours like KEI and I should have something useful and fun to do until those buffs run out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense intended, but I don't want a 4 hour duration on Focus and other Shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
If SoE wants to help 'normalize' class desirability in groups, buff durations need to be equalized across the board, and surely not a 4 hour duration. I would bring other class buffs down to the Shaman buff durations and adjust the spells accordingly. This should happen along with some other adjustment along the lines of my earlier suggestion.<br />
<br />
Longer buff durations on Focus and stat buffs will only make matters worse for the Shaman overall as far as being desired in groups.</div></div><hr />

IN my own words:<br />
I dont play EQ any more, l just wanted to comment on this topic. This topic of class balancing has been on the table for 5 years now, its just a smoke screen, for something else there going to do; changing classes to fit a mold willnot bring people backto everquest.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Overall, shamans have it good to great.  Don't undertand all the whining when it comes to group desirability, ability to solo, secondary group utility, balance heal, balance DPS, balance buff usefulness, balance this, balance that...<br />
<br />
A good shaman should never have a problem getting a group, and usually is turning down group offers.  In fact, the shaman can solo effectively, duo great w/ several classes, does fine in small groups or multi-boxing, and at the very least can put his own group together as he is the core, having healing, CC, and magnetic appeal for many classes out there.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for the above 58 crowd when it comes to classes like rangers, wizards, paladins.  Rangers indoors don't have great DPS until EQ/AM3, and wizards are over-rated when you factor in the resists they often get.  For DPS class roles you're much better off with a variety of classes before wizards -- mage, BST, necro, rogue, monk...  Wizards got it bad until they make endgame, and look at how few endgame wizards there are.  As for pallies, we all know their DPS sucks, and are desirable only if they have decent HP, have their group heals, AND know how to play well by holding aggro with stuns (talk about a class that NEEDS KEI).  Heck I've run across a few shammies that are better tanks/DPS/aggro holders/pullers than pallies.<br />
<br />
Shammies got it good to great.  So another slower is in group... well if they wanna be main slower, then by all means go ahead (ok, i'll throw Malo in first).  It's refreshing not to slow, to be puller or DPS in a group -- shammies have the luxury of switching up.  Two-shammy groups rock.<br />
<br />
Shaman can main heal many zones.  That alone makes it good to great for the shaman.  It is because you can slow that you can do that.  All the other plusses, like our pet, buffs, fair to decent to good DPS, group haste, are just that -- plusses.<br />
<br />
Group buffs needing to be refreshed an hour later are not that bad, given everything else we get.  Buffing is not a role in a group, it's a padded plus.  Pulling, CC, DPS, tanking, healing are roles.  Okay maybe buffing falls under utility, but thats also an added plus to a group, like necro twitching, mage toys, evac, shroud of strealth, corpse summoning, etc.  In a raid, these utilities become more important as the other roles are more abundant.<br />
<br />
Shammies are in the top echelon in many roles.  Top 3 when it comes to healing.  Top half when it comes to pulling.  Top half when it comes to tanking.  Top 5 when it comes to Crowd Control.  Top 4 when it comes to utility.  Even when it comes to constant DPS, the shammy beats out many classes in the 58 + crowd... better than clerics, pallies, gimped rangers, average dr00ds... Heck, if I'm putting together a group indoors and have a tank but needing a puller, a bit more CC, and some more DPS, guess which class I'm gonna pick over that tag-along, always resisted, boring to play wizzy.  A second shammy.  Not a ranger, not a dr00d, and not a pally.<br />
<br />
Wizards are shafted.  Not when they reach that rare position where they are burst DPS kings.  It's the gruel before that when many give up the class.  Give them some sort of Malo line.  How about more CC like a quick casting unresistable snare?  Or fixed duration group invis.  A knockback spell.  A long refresh, quick-casting 3 tic rune they can use to save theirs, a cleric's, or even a group's life.  Rangers get fixed later with EQ/AM3.  Druids aren't hurting.  Pallies could use an alternate snap aggro tool, or maybe higher level paci's.  Monks could use a little bit of loving, but certainly are no slackers.<br />
<br />
Imagine an EQ without wizards.  Not missing much.  But shammies?  When it comes to group desirability, ability to solo, versatility, and overall FUN FACTOR, shammies rule.  Like I said, shammies got it good to great.  Go fix another class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Shamans do ok in OoW. Not good and certainly not great, but ok. This is nearly 100% due to content, not due to actually balanced classes. MOB DPS is generally right in the tiny area between &quot;one slow resist spells trouble&quot; and &quot;why bother slowing&quot; and MOB HPs are high enough that you can sometimes get a DoT to run it's full duration.<br />
<br />
If the next expansion features slightly faster fights, slightly more resistant MOBs and slightly higher MOB DPS shamans will be at the bottom of the barrel as far as group usefulness is concerned. Of course it will take about 3 expansions for that fact to become recognized by the masses, but still, I would rather play a balanced class then have my usefulness to a group depend entirely on SOE's ability to squeeze MOB HPs and DPS in the small area where shaman do ok.<br />
<br />
As for your comments about other classes they seem FAR off the mark. Rangers do more damage with melee then with bows nowadays. Wizards do better at the low end then at the high end. In fact I am not sure what you mean by high end, given that you say you know shamans that outtank paladins - the last time I noticed anything similar to that was back in PoP, with a couple levels of difference and a massive gear and AA difference.<br />
<br />
It may sound a little harsh but I do not think you know what you are talking about and certainly not when you talk about &quot;the high end game&quot;. I do not consider myself the greatest authority when it comes to class balancing and other classes abilities but I do know that fixed spells + focus items vs tons of tiny upgrades will always end up with wizards doing good DPS at the start of an expansion (the low end) and melee classes pulling ahead of them as they upgrade their weapons (the high end). I also know that you can not fix a DPS disparity with weird utility (group invis?) or completely overpowered abilities (unresistable snare?).<br />
<br />
The classes certainly are not balanced. Something should certainly be done. But we should not attempt to fix a disparity with power via utility (or for that matter, annoyance). And yes, shaman need fixing too. Not necessarily a straight upgrade. A fix. At the moment shaman power depends to a large part on the content they play in to a far far larger degree then any other class. Either this needs to be fixed or every expansion will need to be designed for shaman first and all other classes second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
By top 3 healer I think you mean 3rd - out of 3 :)<br />
<br />
By top half puller I think you mean, better than most int casters, clerics and a couple of melee. Personally clerics with pacify make much better pullers than us and several other classes do even better. I would not invite a shaman to pull for a group, although we can do the job several classes do it MUCH better than us.<br />
<br />
By top 5 I guess you mean a long way behind Enchanters and bards and also behind any class that can snare and root. Similarly, almost no-one is going to invite a shaman to do CC, we have a root spell and a root aa - I wouldn't invite a shaman in to CC in a dodgy area and I am one.<br />
<br />
Top half when it comes to tanking, please, every melee in the game can tank better than us so we are marginally superior to other casting classes. That is not a class benefit, no-one is going to invite a shaman in to tank.<br />
<br />
Utility - granted we have that, does that get you a group, nope. The only utility that gets shaman groups is the ability to cast slow and haste.<br />
<br />
Woaah, we can outdps clerics and pallies, go us, if you are going to compare dps compare to same level gear and aa's - any ranger will blow us out of the water for dps given equivalent gear and aa's.<br />
<br />
Personally I think inviting a shaman for dps over a wiz or shaman, especially if group already has a shaman is an........................... interesting choice, shall I say :) , Hands up how many shaman here got invited to a group and told &quot; OK, glad we got you, you are on DPS&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem imo with your lists is that unless the group NEEDS the shaman utility i.e no-one to slow and/or haste they will almost always go for the specialist role. <br />
<br />
Being 3rd, 4th or 5th best at anything means you struggle with the way EQ has changed at the high end game because &quot;most&quot; people want the best, not 4th best. :)</div></div><hr />

You do understand that 350dps is 2100 damage every tic from the moment the fight starts don't you...not from when YOU start doing damage.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Ok, so I made a few exaggerations to stress the point that shammies are much more balanced and fun to play than say wizards.  I never suggested fixing a DPS disparity by giving wizzies more utilty spells.  The point was group usefulness and fun-to-play factor.<br />
One of the other main points was that mid-game is still very viable for shammies, alot moreso than a few other classes.   Yes, that means PoP.  Yes, that means family guild raiding. Yes, that means getting a pick-up group going for the 2 hours you have to play. And yes that means still getting your Epic 1, helping other classes on their epic 1, or power-levelling a friend's new alt.<br />
<br />
Ok, so rangers can have excellent DPS.  I was going a bit extreme about the shammy out-tanking the pally thing, but in my days I have tanked quite often, for heavy caster groups, when MT is waiting to be filled, for rogues, and side-by-side with rangers in guildie mini-missions.  This of course is non-GoD, non-MPG sessions.  I've bazaar+ equipped, yet I can fill in tanking in Expos.  But to be safe, I retract all these exaggerations.<br />
<br />
The points are, many shammies claim they can main heal just fine.  Many shammies claim they can DPS good.  Quite a few shammies do the jack-of-all-trades thing quite well, being group puller, MH, debuffer, extra DPS.  The class is a generalist one, and a damn good one.  If you want to specialize, invest the AAs, gears, and determination, and you can step into that one role.  Shammies have a lot more CC tools than just snaring or mezzing, and a good deal of survivability to boot.  Sure, you'll have to break the discrimination and stereotyped mindset that many, including shammies, have, and you'll need a reputation gotten by proven action to back you up.  But the tools are there.  <br />
<br />
You want pure DPS...go roll a beastlord or a mage.<br />
You want to main heal....go roll a cleric.<br />
You want to tank?...Level up that shadowknight.<br />
In fact, if you want to do ONE thing really well, and compete for the slot in any given group (DPS/tank/pulling), then go roll just about any other class other than a shaman.  But an EQ without any shaman is a very narrow EQ.<br />
<br />
Shaman need some tuning so they can be uber useful and convenient to play everywhere.  Right.  I'm just attempting to do a little &quot;balancing&quot; here myself by offsetting all the requests and dire needs of this broken, unwanted, and useless class that shaman really are by reminding all of us of all the very shiny moments we've each had that play our class well....<br />

not to mention- i box a 69 pally, 70 wizard, and 70 shaman. <br />
the 70 wizard has his 68 magic nuke thundaka and is a dps machine! i have yet to find anyone that groups a ranger or rogue over him (the wizard is under 200 AAs, yet crits 8k+ consistantly without a bard in group).  my shaman has a harder time getting groups than the wizard if they are lfg independantly.<br />
<br />
at least you admited you were full of it when talking about shaman out tanking pallies...cuz like, my shaman is a higher level and in better gear than my pally.  the pally out tanks the shaman every time...<br />
if you want to talk about paladins, we can discuse how imo they are the forsaken tanks... i wished i rolled an SK instead... stun, for which a pally has his tanking ability based around (healing as well, but stun more-so,) doesn't even work in high end content because the mobs are to high of level (only the AA stun works...which doesn't cut it generally.)  you are correct that their DPS blows, even fully AAed (outside of undead... where are their high end undead to xp on?)  ALL of their discs suck, holyforge being the biggies of suck as it is broken...  paladins need a tuneing way more than shaman do imo...<br />
<br />
if we look at the shaman class overall, we are not horibly broken beyond repare (as say, zerkers are)...maybe not even broken so to speak...<br />
however, there are a lot of little tweaks that would go a long way for us in terms of increasing the fun-factor of playing a shaman and class balancing (btw, these issues have been beaten to death on this thread and other threads..) these little tweaks would add up to a relitively large fix for us.<br />

We especially see than in the patch where solo xp was nerfed, and in the patch where bonus grouping xp was added (i am not saying i agree with their outlook on soloing btw, i was just pointing out the facts.) <br />
also in referance to your statement, we could debate what soloing actually means, and we could debate it forever... you get kei and conviction before you solo? i don't call that &quot;soloing&quot;...<br />
<br />
<br />
Solo XP was only nerfed in PoP zones, &amp; it's still far higher there than anywhere outside of them. What SOE did with group bonus was increase group XP so it was easier for people who had trouble LFG to get groups. If some random lowbie ooc'd LFG &amp; we had a spare slot, I'd say sure, make his day, he won't take any XP off us.<br />
<br />
In case you hadn't noticed, SOE has actually encoraged soloing by adding the task stystem. Although post 60 it's mostly too damn hard to be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
As for your definition of soloing, I'm pretty sure you'd be in a tiny minority.<br />

Anyway, assuming a mob lived 1 minute(low DPS group), your group is pumping out a DPS of 667. A Shaman doing 15k over this time is doing 250 DPS(this is what *I* consider the absolute max constant DPS a Shaman can do in Omens). <br />
If the same mob lived for 45 seconds and the Shaman did 15k damage in this time, he'd be pumping out 333 of the collective 889 DPS(This is what *I* consider the average DPS group). <br />
In any case the Shaman would be doing 37.5% of the group's DPS, which means that the other 5 people are doing 62.5% of the combined DPS or you could say that the Shaman is doing 60% of the damage the other 5 are doing *combined*.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that I have never seen such a group. If I had used 16k instead of 15k the Shaman would have clocked at 267 and 356 DPS respectively, thus doing 40% of the combined group DPS or 66.6% of the combined DPS of the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I dunno, 40k hp for MPG trash sounds pretty low.<br />
<br />
Was me, Monk (with Ink'Tuta 2hb), SK (GBoC), some random Bard, Druid, Cleric. Not the greatest DPS group, so I got to pick up the slack. SK is powa, didn't have any agro issues.<br />
<br />
Really it's the spell haste. Quickening of Solusek/Druzzil and Affliction haste 5 is Jesusly if you're trying to DPS. Maxed crits is really nice also. Hell, just keeping Sisslak and Bane in is like 170dps with no focus and crits, throw in pox pants and you're a little under 200, then liberal rains and spears. It's very easy to rack up the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">That is in a low DPS group, with no aggro issues at all, in one of the few places where you do not get many resists. Even in a lowish DPS guild group when I malos on incoming, then slow the MOB will usually be at 80% when my first damage spell lands. Less if I got a slow resist. If I then take another 15 seconds to layer in 3 DoTs (MOB is at best at 50% now) I may be doing 200 DPS now, but I did maybe an average of 80 DPS for the first half of the fight. Again, that is assuming that I do not get a single resist. Realistically speaking I will get one resist and the MOB will be 10% lower in health.<br />
<br />
So that is 80, maybe 100 DPS for the first 60% of the fight. 200 DPS for  the other 40%, plus whatever you can squeeze in with nukes and rains. And the aggro you put out is not exactly trivial either. I do not doubt that you can get to 200 overall DPS that way, but it sure seems like an inefficient way to do it, unless your fights last for over 90 seconds. Just casting a Curse and then chainnuking will probably get you there with less aggro and a similar amount of mana (again, unless you have really long fights).<br />
<br />
Of course if you are outside of RS with a high DPS group you will be lucky to squeeze in 2 nukes after malos and slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Why are you using 3 DoTs? just Sisslak and Bane, then nuke. Blood of yoppa is way too much agro to be worthwhile, and since it's L70 its the least affected by focii.<br />
<br />
Edit: and you have a TA, Malos should be hitting the mob before it's in camp (stand right behind the tank) then immediately click your TA, Bam the mob is usually slowed 3 seconds later, before the rest of the melee are even on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Uh, Grizlor, I was using your example as to the 3 DoTs. And yes, if you fight in a large free area you can Malos a couple seconds earlier. Of course casters get to nuke a couple seconds earlier too and rangers get to fire a couple of arrows so the difference is not all that big anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Heh, interesting thread, for sure. <br />
<br />
I know I dont put out more than 200-ish DPS on average. Malos, sic pet, TA, Siss, Bane, 1 nuke or 1 rain, depending where I am. <br />
<br />
In RSS, I skip Bane and use the new Cripple. Not sure if we have any parses on this spell yet, but it SEEMS like it helps. I will also use the new Cripple in PG if the tank is &quot;sub-par&quot;, and given the shortage of tanks we seem to have on my server for off-hour XP groups, this situation is beoming the norm.<br />
<br />
I do think our group contribution is fairly decent in OoW, and even in KT now, since I can easily be primary/sole healer there with the new spells and buffs. The new Mage pet-weapons make dog-dog a bit nicer DPS as well. I will go out of my way to get some, and keep FA up on him full-time. I also keep FA up on any melee in the group (no Champ yet, kinda sucks, but I dont have Pet Affinity either, so my pet and the other group members pets get to have FA). <br />
<br />
I really dont go by any concrete DPS numbers. I am just not a min-max type of player. If I feel like I am contributing then I am satisfied. I like my current role in most groups of &quot;2nd healer, debuffer, some DPSer&quot;. Malos helps the group nuke. FA helps the melee do damage. Pet is like a no-mana DOT, probably equal to Sissack with new mage toys. Cripple seems to help prevent those quad-max hit rounds you tend to see on low-end tanks. /shrug. <br />
<br />
As far as the buff duration thing goes, I think some need adjusting. I am not really a fan of making them all the same, since that would kinda suck on raids if they ALL dropped at the same time, but lowering the duration of some buffs to make those classes a bit more desirable might help. But then, it might not. I never bother looking for a BL to SA me, nor do I invite them to my groups because of the buff. If KEI duration was cut in half, that wouldnt make Enchanters more popular in my groups. If anything, they would be taking group slots from US. But seeing as I rarely have trouble getting, or building, a group, I wouldnt mind so much.<br />
<br />
Perception is a pretty important factor though. Most people dont understand that with the mitigation of OoW mobs, all 3 slowing classes are equalized. People dont see that Necros have become one of the best group classes there is, with their mana and hp leech spells. Its like having c6 and double regen on all the time, I swear. But still, necros get skipped over for groups. <br />
<br />
Balance at this point, to me, is tweaks and little tiny things, and its also heavily dependant on content. Without OoW buffs and spells, Shaman are not that high on the list in a zone like KT, where the damage comes so fast and the mobs dont live very long. Not saying we cant fucntion there, even without the OOW stuff, but its much more &quot;work&quot; for us than a druid or cleric. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, classes are a lot harder to balance than many people seem to understand, especially the people at SOE who are DOING the balancing. But they try, I give em credit. We were WAY down, now we are back up a bit. Not to the TOP, but a good bit. But its not an easy task, especially with classes like Shaman, Enchanter, Necro, Paladin, etc, the non-&quot;specialty&quot; classes. This thread alone should demonstrate that. 20 shaman could theoritically have 20 different balance issues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Solo XP was only nerfed in PoP zones, &amp; it's still far higher there than anywhere outside of them. What SOE did with group bonus was increase group XP so it was easier for people who had trouble LFG to get groups. If some random lowbie ooc'd LFG &amp; we had a spare slot, I'd say sure, make his day, he won't take any XP off us.<br />
<br />
In case you hadn't noticed, SOE has actually encoraged soloing by adding the task stystem. Although post 60 it's mostly too damn hard to be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
As for your definition of soloing, I'm pretty sure you'd be in a tiny minority.<br />
<br />
With SOE's new pragmatic approach, I'm fairly sure that they will want to cater for people who want to solo - their money is as good as anyone elses...<br />
<br />
ok so they increased group xp to encourage grouping, like i said =p<br />
the task system was added as a solo item in the game, but it is a **** system that doesn't work very well (i think everyone can agree on that.)  if you look at zone layouts since pop, spells from pop+ (especially most shaman spells,) and the actual expansion content since pop, we see a huge move away from the soloing possablilities from say, velious.  LDoN is a huge example as it is an entire expansion made for grouping...  even OoW is an expansion for people in groups of 3+ generally...  To be honest, i can't see any evidance outside the task system (and long duration dots) that show the promotion of soloing.<br />
<br />
i am sure, as soloers money is as good as anyone elses, sony will most likely make more solo content with upcoming expansions.  especially with the current trend to exodus to other online games, sony will make an extra effort to please everyone.  this being said, i don't see the game getting TO solo friendly as everquest has always been about social communication and interaction (these are innate qualities engrained in the game.)<br />
<br />
when we examine the definition i gave for soloing i think you are going to find it is about a 50/50 ratio of people agreeing and disagreeing...  there is a thread that was just started called &quot;the next yeldima&quot; or something like that.  when the shaman community talks about tough solo encounter that have been won, generally we are not talking about people who have gotten 2.5K+ in HP buffs from other classes presolo engage, as well as the mana regen from c6...  when we talk about solo wins, we are talking about self buffed shaman who beat the **** out of mobs with only the tools that shaman has!<br />
when i go solo for xp sure i'll get a kei so i can be lazy and not hit the canni key so much, but is it a true solo session? maybe, maybe not...  people who are saying they would be mad because they can't solo without kei and conviction are soloing in the wrong place then.  they are taking on content that is to tough for them.  the whole idea of soloing is not haveing to rely on anyone but yourself...i fail to see how spending time searching for Kei and conviction in pok persontifies that.  so if you can't find these buffs you can't go solo?  it makes no sense.<br />
<br />
that being said, i enjoy being able to log on a chanter bot to kei my xp group.  we don't need CC in most zones anymore so the bot with a 3+ hour kei duration does just fine for us...we can slot in another dps instead of a chanter...  is this right? <br />
no.  <br />
would changing spell durations make some classes more group friendly?  most likely, in the case of enchanters at least...imho.  especially seeing as EQs primary healers, meaning cleric/druid, are kei whores generally...<br />
would changed spell durations actually take group slots away from shaman?<br />
maybe, seeing as enchanters becoming more group friendly would mean groups would already have a slower so why invite a shaman.<br />
i got a little bit off the intended topic of my post... <br />
<br />
anyway, if you want to argue that Sony has actually been encouraging soloing i'll site some specific examples of why this isn't so...</div></div><hr />

Frankly, if I wanted to play a class that provided DPS I wouldn't play a Shaman. The Shaman isn't meant to be a DPS class so it doesn't really apply to us, which means that DPS IS off topic.<br />
<br />
Sure, Shaman can provide DPS in some form, just like any other class. Be realistic though, we are not Rogues, Wizards, Mages, or Rangers.<br />
<br />

Knowing that, it's really hard for me to not give my input when I am seeing certain DPS numbers flying around in this thread, which, imo, do not coincide with reality.<br />
<br />
I have actually been refraining from doing much in depth analysis to rebut some of the statements about Shaman DPS for the sake of not turning this into a too heated &quot;discussion&quot;, but people need to realize that part of the info developers will be gathering and using in this class rebalancing act, will be consisting of what the community is posting here. <br />
If several people are *falsely* stating that they are pumping out up to  350 constant DPS in groups, that will certainly have repercussions on what changes the class will be seeing in that particular area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nor are we Druids, Clerics and so can't heal as effectively on tough content.<br />
<br />
Nor are we Warriors, Paladins, ShadowKnights and so can't tank all that well.<br />
<br />
Nor are we Necromancers and so can't dot the hell outta the mob, send in a good pet, have passive mana regen and FD off any aggro we may draw.<br />
<br />
Nor are we Enchanters, Bards and so can't provide mana to the groups or do a decent job of CC.<br />
<br />
Nor are we Beastlords and so don't have a pet that is more than a speed bump and don't do near the melee dmg.<br />

Nor are we Monks and so can't lull-pull singles or FD off aggro.<br />

But, we are Shaman!  So we can Malos and Slow and Cripple......  But so can Beastlords, Bards, Mages, Enchanters in some form.  And they ALL bring something else to the table.  <br />
<br />
I don't think asking to be able to do more dps is such a bad thing, myself.  They AREN'T going to give us more healing than we have now, so forget that one.  And, they AREN'T going to make slow as powerful as it used to be.  That leaves CC, which sorta ties into slow for us and also encroaches on the Enchanters and Bards, so that's a no go.  Or, we can try to tank.  Hahaha.  Okay, so forget that.  All that's left is DPS.  If we could get malo* and dot cast/re-cast times down, halved?, and have them do more dmg, and give some sort of resist modifier (just plain stupid to have dot resists AFTER it's been debuffed 7 ways from Sunday), not to mention get rid of the damn over-aggro they cause, we'd be sitting pretty.<br />
<br />
And, far as the over-aggro is concerned, was thinking........  Maybe if they can't code it out, could they give us a 60-second recycle, instant cast FD?  You use it, severely (neg 400ish hate or bottom of the list?) reduces aggro, and you stand back up.  No choice on the stand back up part, or it'd be overpowered.</div></div><hr />

To me, DoT agro is the biggest problem for our DPS.  We actually could do a little more DPS if it wasn't for the retarded DoT agro.  I could throw on a couple of dots and then rain like mad and do some decent (not great, not horrible) DPS.  However, I will get summoned almost surely if I do that.  These aren't all horrible tanks I'm talking about.  Some really good tanks just can't keep agro all the time if we pump out mroe than one DoT.  This is absurd.  <br />

Because DoT agro influences our DPS.<br />

My major pet peeve with SoE is that they fix it then package it in an expansion for $20 and market it as an &quot;upgrade&quot;.   So, if you WANT that fix, which they call an &quot;upgrade&quot;, you have to pay for it.  <br />
<br />
Think on it.  The last true expansion which did not entail fixes as &quot;upgrades&quot; was LoY. That one had maps, more bank space, etc.  LDoN was designed to fix a content (as in not enough of it) design flaw.  Didn't work, but that's what it was for.  GoD was supposed to also fix that problem and increase group desirability for the trinity because they were losing their grip on it.  Well, it did that in spades.  Guild groups were made up of Cleric, Cleric, Warrior, Warrior, Enchanter, DPS class for a long while there till they toned some stuff down.  Even after it was toned down, it wasn't exactly easy to get groups in those trials as a Shaman or Bard.  OoW was supposed to provide an alternate source of gear for the casuals, supply said casuals with some of the spells that were tagged as Ancient in GoD or give something better (/sigh and just why hasn't SoE changed the GoD Ancient to something different than Pained Memory?) and close the gaps in group balance.  Okay, that worked a bit, yes.  Obviously not completely, or they wouldn't be &quot;looking at the class balance issues&quot;.<br />
<br />
But, why did we have to pay for all those fixes?  It just plain annoys me to pay for a fix to something that they broke in previous content.  If I had a customer bring something back to me that I had done wrong and I told them I could fix it, but they'd have to pay for the item all over again, I'd have no customers.  <br />
<br />
And yes, I COULD chose to not pay for that fix and quit EQ.  But.....  I don't wish to do that.  So maybe that makes me stupid to keep paying for it.  But, there will come a point where it's going to surpass my ability to ignore it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my major problem with SoE.  And, here's hoping that DoN isn't more of the same.  At the risk of being viewed as cynical, I say....  Hah.<br />
<br />
Edit: You know, I was reading back over this and I realized I DID know of one other company that treats it's customers this way.  And, I guess that since Bill Gates has an almost solid lock on the majority of computers running the Windows OS, that he is still in the position that SoE was in.  I say &quot;was in&quot; because now there is WoW and a few other games in the pipelines.  I have WoW, and I enjoy it.  BUT, it is not the same as EQ.  It doesn't have that intense end game feel to it, for me.  It does have the history and lore, but it's not as.......  immersive?  Plus, I have a lot of personal history tied up in EQ after so long playing it.  So, for now I keep plugging along in EQ savoring that feeling.  The adrenaline rush, if you will.  But eventually some other company is going to produce something that will match the rush EQ provides.  And, maybe it IS WoW and I just haven't gotten far enough into it to discover this.  We'll see, I guess.  When it happens, I'll have a decision to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Works nicely most of the time, although I think they need to add some alternate means of getting to PoSky like they did for PoHate. I get so tired of trying to find a wizard to port me there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">OK a lot of you are missing a point that Necromancers require high agro from their DoT's to agro kite like they do since fear doesn't work on NPC's over level 55 forcing them to agro kite rather than fear kite.<br />
<br />
So, now if we fix the problem of DoT agro, we mess up another class in the process.<br />
<br />
That is why I offered that SOE create a quest for an augment that will reduce the agro on the poison type spells similar to Innoruuk's Sarcasm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3549&amp;source=Test) that we can use on a piece of equipment to help reduce the agro when we choose, and not mess up the way that agro works..... I guess that would be way to easy.  By the way, Innoruuk's Sarcasm is an effect found on a few items for enchanters only.   :rolleyes:  what it does is reduces agro on poison type spells(Tash has poison counters...).  Our disease dots don't do as much damage, but stack on a few of them and then sit down... they have no where near as much agro as from poison DoT's.<br />
<br />
I can't undestand why it is the view of some that other classes need nerfing instead of bringing up the DPS / usefullness of the classes that are in needing.<br />
<br />
I agree that content has a lot to do with 'Class Balance', most enchanters are a little miffed about not being the chosen ones, next to clerics of course.<br />
<br />
So, in the class invisioning, the talk about DPS in general is worth talking about.  We need DPS as it helps merit our place in a group.  <br />
<br />
Our primary role in a group is slower.  However, slow has been nerfed.  This is not news to any of us.  So, what are we?<br />
<br />
Off the wall Example<br />
If a group has an encounter where the NPC deals very little damage to the members of the group, then <br />
A. we can have just about any metal wearing class tank.  <br />
and / or <br />
b. we can have just about any priest class to heal.<br />
<br />
The above example is 'off the wall' because it is not going to happen... the damage that the NPC's deal to us are all part of the risk and SOE isn't going to change that way of doing things.<br />
<br />
It seems off the point, but how we contibute to a group is part of the we that Shaman have to be redifined as our role of slower has been subsiquently nerfed.  DPS is the most directly noticable way to measure contribution and is totally understandable that people would want to see this improve.<br />
<br />
Frankly, if I wanted to play a class that provided DPS I wouldn't play a Shaman. The Shaman isn't meant to be a DPS class so it doesn't really apply to us, which means that DPS IS off topic.<br />
<br />
Sure, Shaman can provide DPS in some form, just like any other class. Be realistic though, we are not Rogues, Wizards, Mages, or Rangers.<br />
<br />
BTW, this thread is rapidly approaching the rapid fire neg rep bump stage.<br />
OK... first off dude, get over yourself.  These guys aren't asking to nuke like wizards &amp; mages nor melee like rogues and rangers.  What they are asking for is reliable damage to contibute to a group without the need of an ubertank to hold agro so that they will not mess up the flow of the group.  Is that too much to ask?<br />
<br />
Second, you rep bump means nothing to me... nor does it mean a lot to many of the people responding to your thread.  Threatening to rep bump me will hardly budge my rep points and whenever I have wrongly been rep bumped, a member with a reputation that means something has always brought me back up.  I expect to get negative rep bumps for being rude, tossing insults and behaviour like that.  Once again get over yourself and keep on track, what does that have to do with class balance / reinvisioning?<br />
<br />
Back on track, OoW was great content for Shaman and I can only hope that the new class balance / reinvisioning will bring the ones in need up instead of nerfing the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">It really is simple, Sony. We've laid out our demands.<br />
Puppy gets duel wield and sow innately, and a few more hitpoints.<br />
Our DoTs cause less aggro, enuff to stack 2 or 3 every battle.  They also cast a bit quicker, and they do a bit more damage.<br />
Our HoTs are just a little stronger healing, and last just a little bit longer.  Quick heals are a bit faster casting, and heal 20% more.<br />
Slow is resisted less, malo less needed and faster casting and refreshed.<br />
Group buffs last a little longer, and either are consolidated or more buffs slots added to compensate.<br />
Shaman get more hitpoints and AC, enabling them to off-tank in a pinch.<br />
Nukes do a bit more damage for a bit less mana, and cast quicker.<br />
For crowd control issues, maybe we could get an extra tool to help in this department.<br />
Shammies, as priests, get a resurrection.<br />
Content should be accessible so that shammies are desirable in groups, while remaining challenging and non-trivial.<br />
Finally, give us a means to have enough constant mana to perform all these duties effortlessly.  For the love of Discord, we need endless mana.<br />
Nevermind that we can actually achieve each and everyone of these currently.  We are tired of being generalists.  We need fixing NOW.  We ought to be  #2 healer, have a pet and DoT like a necro, #3 CC, off-tank like a RNG/ROG/SHM/BER, be #1 slower, and have less but more uber buffs to cast -- in fact, Champion should last an hour, and extend to our alpha dog.  Is this really asking too much Sony?<br />
Those shammies that reach 10k HP, that have all the good focus items, and have all the AAs for better healing, cheaper and faster casting, extra healing, better defense, uber pets, extra CC, and rezzes, they are all but pipe dream fantasies never to be attained.  We demand instant gratification.<br />
Give us 100% so we may reclaim our rightful place  as Shaman kings again, as in the legendary days of Kunark. Is this really asking too much Sony?  When will we get ours, Sony?  When? When oh, when?</div></div><hr />

*ding ding ding, we have a winner*<br />
<br />
The problem with Shaman is that we can heal in SOME places and SOME shaman with all AA's and gear that most will never see can heal in MOST places.  However, for those of us that don't have the gear, we are left not being able to do much in those zones that we can't MH in.  That leaves us with DPS.  <br />
<br />
The problem with our DPS is that if you look at the spells, we have POTENTIAL to do decent DPS.  However, there are some things that I'm not sure the programmers have any freaking clue about that keep us from doing this.  <br />
<br />
DoT agro.  If I could pile on a couple or 3 dots on a mob, even if it didn't run full length, I could do decent DPS.  DoTs aren't efficient if they don't run full duration, but atleast you can do decent damage while they are running.  The problem is that if I pile on enough DoTs to do decent damage, I get summoned and smashed or end up wasting the Cleric mana or my own.  Not so good.  Fix DoT agro and my DPS would go up probably 10-20%.<br />
<br />
Rain Resists. I know it was kicked around a while back that rains have an almost inherent resist of 1 in 3 or something like that.  I'm not sure, but quite rarely do I get all three waves to hit.  If all three rains were to hit, especially with crits, we could do some decent damage by alternating our rains.  You can pretty much keep a constant rain of 500-890+ on the mob.  The problem is when you get strings of resists that 'rain' on your parade.  Rains look good, but count on one resist out of the 3.<br />
<br />
*dog dog*.  Small thing, but in those times you can use dog dog and have no weapons for it, you are missing out on something like 20dps right there.  That is not a tiny number for a class with dps like ours.  Add in more HP's so we can keep it alive more and you are talking about even more dps added.  Everyone scoffs at dog dog dual wield, but I get caught without a mage/weapons more than I should and lose out on those DPS because of it.  The pithy reply of 'you should carry rusty weapons then' seems somewhat out of date for a level 70 shaman doesn't it....?<br />
<br />
These are 3 things they could 'tweak' and add probably a good 20-30% to my DPS.  That isn't a balance shifting thing for some people, but sure would make me more happy and more of a contributer to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">The funny thing is, I am not even sure I want improvements to the class as much as I want improvements to the game structure.<br />
<br />
If, instead of the cookie-cutter-one-MOB-type-per-zone yard trash we instead had a mix of 10 to 20 distinct MOB types in every zone (possibly weighted towards one or a few types in certain areas but always a mix) then most class balancing problems could just evaporate.<br />
<br />
As is paladins are expected to make up for worse tanking and DPS with heals and stun, the usefulness of which in theory varies depending on the MOBs - but there is no such variation in a zone (and sometimes not even in an expansion). Shaman are expected to make up for lesser heals with slow - the usefulness of which depends on the MOB you are fighting, which again, is fixed per zone. This pattern repeats itself endlessly. All these tradeoffs can be examined before you even enter the zone and you can nearly always say which class will be better for the group, for the entire zone or even expansion.<br />
<br />
If instead you knew you will be facing both the 5K-nuking zombies and the /defensive-reduces-my-DPS-by-50% hard hitting high HP level 75 giant at some point then the group with the warrior will head to the giant-heavy areas and the group with the paladin will head to the zombies. Both will still have to face their unfavorable matchup some time, both will feel like their class rocks and any minor problems in class balancing can be adjusted by controlling how much of which MOBs spawn, leaving SOE free to work only on the most glaring problems.<br />
<br />
Similarly groups with shamans can try to fight mostly high HP fully slowable MOBs and groups with clerics can fight the stuff that has extremely spiky damage output and mitigates slow. As long as MOBs give experience in proportion to the amount of time they take to die everyone will make the same experience per hour, the shaman will run himself out of mana on the odd spiky-damage-MOB that appears in his camp, the cleric will run himself out of mana on the odd high-HP MOB that he faces but both will feel good about their class.<br />
<br />
With the current zone design you will never end up with the shaman feeling the pain of his lesser heals in luclin-style-content but you will also never end up with the shaman feeling good about his endless mana in pre-rebalancing-GoD-style-content. Wouldn't it be nice to feel good or bad about or advantages and disadvantages on an hourly basis instead of yearly one? Wouldn't it be nice to actually get to use our disease DoTs some time? To sometimes get to feel like we are back in Kunark again? To see rangers use bows again, to see clerics switch from CHs to groups heals depending on the MOB, to see paladins use their stuns for interrupting spells?<br />
<br />
We are currently playing only a quarter of the game we are paying for. The exact quarter may change per expansion but I for one would like to play the whole game, every expansion. And we get easier class balancing on top of that for free.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I'd be happy if Sony would adjust rain spells so they could hit up to 4 waves, thus we wouldn't lose 1 of the 4 potential hits when we're trying to land rains on a single mob.  If they did that, I could live with the resists, since we'd still have 33% more chances to hit a single mob, while not impacting the number of attempts on 2+ mobs.</div></div><hr />

gleefully ripping a fully written post from Innoruuk.com<br />
<br />
I'd like it if spell haste foci were somewhat easier to come by. Two items per expansion really isn't enough.<br />
<br />
I'd like aa ripostes, similar to bard/beastlord getting aa doubleattack, but there's no game balance issue there, I just like being able to take a hit and wanna deal a little incedental cool damage back  <br />
<br />
Hmm, oh! A new friggin' SoW. We get the buff first of any class in the game, and get the most variety on that buff line up to level 60. And then nothing. Druids get two upgrades, both faster, and rangers get one of those from them. My best SoW is a level 39 buff, Bih'Li, and it's no faster than the level 9! Did Billy die? Was he lost at sea? Why is there no follow-on? I think this oversight &amp; slight to shamanage could be remedied along with another issue...<br />
<br />
Utility buffing is no longer the realm of shaman. It was, but no more, and for no good reason. Spell:Faerune should have been scribable for shaman at level 64, but now I have a new dream:<br />
<br />
Spell:Talisman of Bih'Li (cause I like having all my buffs be Talismans, I think it's cool) +65% movement (same as Flight of Eagles), Ultravision, Water Breathing, +25atk (10 more than Spirit of Bih'Li), and See Invisible(2)(the kind that Acumen has, that somehow includes End regen)<br />
<br />
I will gladly throw back any individual stat buff from any level, or any combo, or all of them, cause I never cast individual buffs anyway, except, rarely, Focus.<br />
<br />
The only real balance issue that I'd like to see addressed is how useless I am to casters. Something to do to help casters out, besides a little hp that trades off with thier ac &amp; mr, would be good. Enchanters, Necros, Beastlords, Druids, Clerics, Bards, Magicians all have buffs for melee and caster both, but Shaman only have melee buffs. It's nearly amazing how much my presence adds to melee around me, but wizards gain nothin'. <br />

However, I don't believe that it is quite that simple.  It would have been 100% true if gear and AA's hadn't gotten so extreme.  Because that is really where the core abilities of some classes breakdown:  in the extreme endgame zones.  <br />
<br />
The amount of mob dps required to make encounters trivial with 13-14k hp warriors, is... well.. absurd.  The FACT is, that tuning these encounters with dps reducing buffs (slow, cripple, etc..) is a major pain.<br />
<br />
Just think of how much, numerically, 75% slow would save in terms of player hitpoints, on an endgame (riftseekers, etc..) mob.  The higher the number game goes, the more ANY debuff that reduces mob dps, becomes a huge, almost overpowering factor in game design.  <br />
<br />
Thats why I think SOE needs to do 3 things in order to redefine the classes (radically).  <br />
<br />
1.  Remove ALL dps reducing debuffs from the game.<br />
2.  Increase the other roles of the classes that just got nerfed. (Shaman, healing and dps increased.  Enc,  un-nerf charm somewhat, increase player buffs in some way, dunno hehe.  Beast, increase dps, increase buffs/heals some.  Bard, dunno).<br />
3.  Redesign ALL old and new content around this major gameplay change.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, that is the only way to get the game 100% balanced again.  Anything else will be small nudges this way or that, but won't touch on core problems.  <br />
<br />
Like I posted on page 1 of this thread, I'm almost certain, when all is said and done, that nothing major will change.  Limited role folks, like wizards, will get a few more functions, but jack of all trades, like shaman, will see very little change.  <br />
<br />
SOE probably thinks that increasing our healing 10% and lower our nuke cast time is all we need.  Sure, won't hurt to have those things.....  But guess what happens 3 expansions from now.. when mob dps is even higher, and wizard nukes are way, way past our nuke, and cleric heals are way, way past our heals again..  <br />
<br />
What will happen then you ask?  We, as shaman, will back to the same place as before (I can't slow, I need more heal and dps to match other classes).  <br />
<br />
Things will never be fixed as long as our class defining ability (slow), is marginalized in all new content, AND, used as an execuse for keeping our other abilities low.</div></div><hr />

If instead you knew you will be facing both the 5K-nuking zombies and the /defensive-reduces-my-DPS-by-50% hard hitting high HP level 75 giant at some point then the group with the warrior will head to the giant-heavy areas and the group with the paladin will head to the zombies. Both will still have to face their unfavorable matchup some time, both will feel like their class rocks and any minor problems in class balancing can be adjusted by controlling how much of which MOBs spawn, leaving SOE free to work only on the most glaring problems.<br />
<br />
Similarly groups with shamans can try to fight mostly high HP fully slowable MOBs and groups with clerics can fight the stuff that has extremely spiky damage output and mitigates slow. As long as MOBs give experience in proportion to the amount of time they take to die everyone will make the same experience per hour, the shaman will run himself out of mana on the odd spiky-damage-MOB that appears in his camp, the cleric will run himself out of mana on the odd high-HP MOB that he faces but both will feel good about their class.<br />
<br />
Snip&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And therein lies the rub.<br />
The group with the cleric will, in all probability, NOT go to the high DPS spiky mobs.<br />
<br />
They will grab a slowing class(Any of the three wiht mana regen in all probability) And head to the high HP/Fully slowable mobs that don't do spiky damage.<br />
<br />
Changing the mobs to give exp in proportion to the legnth of time they live for engagement isn't somehtign most people would be happy wiht, but it would be a very nice balancing feature.<br />
in some ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, it would be very intersting to see the solution you suggest implemented.<br />

The fundamental flaw in this thinking (which I believe you aren't even remotely being alone in beliving) Is that take that same high HP mob, and a cleric and a Beastlord, or Chanter will be more desired every time.  A moderate slow (65, 70%) coupled with better buffs than ours and more DPS, while allowing the Cleric the heal will always be superior.  Even if we can crank out the DoTs a Beastlord will out DPS us.  And an enchanters buffs will always create more DPS along with their (admitedly not amazing) nukes.  If the high HP mob gives more XP, and is fully slowable, than a cleric can heal after its slowed and still put out good DPS, allowing more DPS classes (like a Beastlord) to join and kill it even faster.<br />
<br />
It's not that we CANT do it.  Its just that you can't balance a Shaman and a Cleric or Druids healing.  I believe that's the fundamental flaw.  If you make the mob slowable, Clerics are still more desireable because they heal more efficiently, can rez quickly with xp gain if someone dies, and have great HP buffs.  And you can't balance slow between the classes as it is, because you don't want a Shaman to be needed in every group, however, given shamans make-up as priests, Enchanters and Beastlords are going to out DPS us while fullfilling the slowing role.  Enchanters even assist with debuffing.<br />
<br />
If a Shaman is slowing and healing in content that requires a slow for a shaman to heal, typically, you don't have *time* for DoTs, or else you don't have time to make up the mana that you are spending in DoTs (granted all things are possible given the right gear of you and/or your tank)  Short fights are DoT restrictive, and longer fights hurt more on the mana side of things as well as playing catch up from damage spikes.  On top of that for a fight to be long enough it has to at least last 1.5 mins for you to be able to slow/debuff and get the most out of DoTs while throwing a heal around.<br />
<br />
If you create &quot;Shaman specific&quot; mobs, then you are just basically making mobs that a group with a beastlord and a cleric will be able to AA faster on safer.<br />
<br />
In my opinion if they are unwilling to make our heals combined with slow be able to seriously compete with those of the cleric and another class who can slow, then they need to do something else, and something new to our class to give us that desireability.<br />
<br />
*and a quick side note*I realize that 2 classes to fullfill our roll does seem rediculous and tends to lend credence to the opposing side of my argument, however, in the capacity of replacing a shaman, the cleric will be working far less to heal someone that if it weren't slowed, leaving the cleric to melee, or nuke, as well as giving a margin of error in case something goes wrong, as well as having rez ability in case something went extremely wrong.  As well as having an enchanter or beastlord would give you near equal slowing (despite all the math that shows what ever you want it to about implied and actual percentages) while also adding, either saftey, potential huge DPS (charm), and buffs in the case of the chanter, or extra tanking, good DPS and nice buffs in the case of the Beastlord.  While additionally not being redundant.<br />
<br />
But as for something new being brought to our class, it would actually be just as good if you were able to tweak a few things about our class.  The problem with landing DoTs is generally agro, and time.  The worst thing about a damage over time spell is that it takes additional TIME to cast it.  Time we don't really have much of in the fast paced world of EQ.  Also, there isn't a *very* compelling reason to have a shaman slow.  Sure its a faster slow, and sure with Balance we are able to slow more reliably, but neither of those are *very* compelling reasons.  If a group needs a slower, and a chanter, beastlord and shaman were all lfg, it wouldn't be as simple as &quot;grab the shaman&quot;.  Especially when many people don't have Balance.<br />
<br />
In my opinion if you want to increase our desireability, its as simple as 3 things.  <br />
1.) Give our slow an edge, not in numbers wise however, in Debuff wise, I perfectly think that its right and good that we need to Malos things, and it can keep its cast time, however, give slow a damage reduction mod, or increase the mobs miss chance.  Don't make slow *just* about slow.  Give us a 65% slow that gives the mob a chance to proc a heal on whatever it hits.  Something above and beyond the slows of Chanters, Bards and Beastlords.  I'm not saying increase the %, just make there be a few different ones that are situationally more usefull than Balance or Turgurs.  DoT slows, Cripple slows (but like serious cripple not just meh cripple) Decrease chance to block slows.  On differing mobs each could be made more usefull, as well as giving more interesting things to do on a raid.<br />
2.) Give each tick of a DoT a agro reducing component.  So that Bane does 512 a tick and -100 hate.  If they can't remove the agro generation out of the DoT code agro reduction into it.  Make it so we can stack our DoTs like 3 or 4 without grabbing agro, 1500 damage a tick would give us over 200dps - especially if number 3 happened<br />
3.) Reduce casting time of DoTs to 1 or 1.5 seconds.  There is no reason why you shouldn't be able to just drop a DoT on something.  DoTs aren't burst DPS, they are slow acting, the shorter a fight it the worse they are.  However they still have long cast times.  if DoTs were fast casting, then you could up your DPS considerably without making huge consessions on the actual spells.  <br />
<br />
If DoTs had agro reduction (not eliminating it, just reducing it) and you could cast 3 or 4 in 6 seconds, we could be contributing our DPS and get back to heals or slowing or Debuffing whatever was needed.  Our DPS would be high enough, as well as utility, our slows would be the best not because of numbers but because of certain specific slows being better than anyone elses because of additional factors.  Our buffs are desired already, but were aren't the buffing class anymore.  Keep our current mana inefficiency as a penalty, we have to fight like mad to keep up with being able to do more in less time, but at least we'd be able to use all our mana regen.</div></div><hr />

The pithy reply of 'you should carry rusty weapons then' seems somewhat out of date for a level 70 shaman doesn't it....?<br />
<br />
yes you should lose out on dps because of it.  no it isn't outdated. it is one of the things that gives me the edge over lazy shaman.  <br />
i want to see the pet duel wield and i was it to be innately sowed and i want it to have more HP, but this topic has been beaten to death.  sony said they are going to do it (even though they haven't yet. some codeing issues if i remember correctly...)  let it go for god sakes...<br />
<br />
I want us to be able to MH where a mob is slowable which is what Sony say we should be able to do.<br />
Yes i know all you end game players with various foci etc can do this already but it shouldnt be a requirement.<br />
I cant MH in MPG but according to SoE as mob is slowable i should be able to.<br />
The problem with Shaman is that we can heal in SOME places and SOME shaman with all AA's and gear that most will never see can heal in MOST places. However, for those of us that don't have the gear, we are left not being able to do much in those zones that we can't MH in. That leaves us with DPS.<br />
if you guys are going to talk about top gear top AAed shaman being so much better than you who don't have it, post magelo profiles so those of us in the middle have something to compare to.<br />
also, if you complain about healing power you also need to discuss what kind of tanks you are healing (hp/ac.)  the tank you are healing is the biggest factor in you being able to keep him up through an encounter...  the hot and quickheal you are useing is also something that should be stated...  are you slowing too? do you have balance? ect...<br />
<br />
i worked hard for my levels and AAs, i am in elementalish equivalent gear, as i haven't gotten a raid upgrade in several years...  i do have a ****load of AAs, i didn't always have this many...i can main heal a 12k/2400ac SK in mpg and RS.  Have an easier time with a pally in MPG, harder time with him in RS.  i can main heal warriors of the same caliber.  any tanks lesser than that in RS i can't keep up, i can't keep anyone but warriors up on RS named mobs, and if i get behind on my healing because of slow resists the tank may die.  sometimes, i need downtime to canni mana back if i am the slower and healer... btw, the tanks i am talking about are in the top 5-10ish on xegony so common tanks have no chance of me healing them in RS or mpg.<br />
<br />
imo heals could use a little boost (when i say a boost i don't mean by puting in another ancient spell). it would give a little larger margin for error, which i think is needed, and it wouldn't encroach on druid/cleric healing.<br />
<br />
i have said it before and i'll say it again, i think our burst DPS ability need improved.  i am not talking about dots, as dots are not burst dps...however it happens, i think it needs done =p<br />
<br />
someone was talking about how reducing DoT agro would break necros (i am lazy and can't find the post to quote it.)  don't think you know what you are talking about =p  they still have snare, which if cast 1 time on a short to mid duration fights, is enough to keep agro off their pets.  cast a few times and it is going to be REALY hard to take agro off the necro... ask some of the seasoned necros on your server if they would like dot agro reduced... ALL the necros i know think dot agro is horribly broken and want it fixed /shrug.  this is a fix, not class balancing but i felt the post needed replied to anyway.</div></div><hr />

Everyone claiming he's doing over 250 DPS(including pet that does 50-60 dps) &quot;constantly&quot; as a Shaman just doesn't know what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
ooooo.  A challenge.  I accept.  Now, I just have to worry about getting a group in a place where I can test it.  When I mentioned 300 - 350dps I wasn't including the pet either hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I mentioned what I use to normally get a pretty decent dps rating... sisslak, both rains, and yoppa spear when I can.  Having max crit nuke AAs and almost all of the dot AAs I get crits a lot.  Especially when raining.<br />
<br />
I did post a thread on here a while ago that showed a keledrix fight of ours where I did something like 350dps on the fight and was in the top 5 overall for my guild in total dmg.  Last time we fought him though that bastard banished me about 50% through the fight and the guild wouldn't coh me so I didn't get a good read (was at 360 not counting spirit pets before that though).<br />
<br />
Yes, I do agree that overall dmg is a much better factor in knowing how good you are doing.  <br />
<br />
Here is a point that I thought someone brought up that made a lot of sense though:<br />
<br />
If all three rains were to hit, especially with crits, we could do some decent damage by alternating our rains. You can pretty much keep a constant rain of 500-890+ on the mob.  <br />
<br />
anyways, sorry to get off the topic, I forgot about the thread for a week or so.  I will have to find some nice log files (i usually delete my logs every few weeks and since I don't exp much if at all, I don't have the old ones)<br />
<br />
oh, can gladly show the parse file where I did 298dps not including two spirit pets and reg pet on Askr in a 13 minute fight if you really want me to.  Would have been higher but I didn't use poison dots until around the 18th tick :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Was Giac referring to sustained dps, like grouping 2-3 hours.  Not a raid where you basically burn all your mana in 10 minutes or so....<br />
<br />
Sure, if I ignore healing anyone, don't slow except for a refresh every 5 minutes on the raid mob, I can keep curse, poison dot, rain, and a spear going usually until most raid mobs are dead.  <br />
<br />
However, I cannot do that in a group situation.  Slowing each mob, possibly malos, perhaps backup healing, and mobs dying in 1 minute or less, makes 250 + dps, constantly, absolutely impossible in a group.  At least for me.  <br />
<br />
I doubt anyone would argue that we do ~ ok dps ~ on raid mobs, rather, its grouping that we're much more gimp at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When &quot;re-envisioning&quot; the class roles for each class, everyone needs to remember that soloing isn't part of the equation.   If you look at what SOE has said recently, the goal is to make EACH class desirable, in group/raiding situations so that all players may experience such content as the designers envisioned.  <br />
<br />
In addition, everyone needs to remember that for a long time, classes were 'balanced' around spells AND gear.  Both were random and dropped by raid level encounters.  And also, originally the excuse given for the grossly inferior gear given to spellcasters was that their spells were meant to be 'their loot' from these encounters.  ie: during kunark, you could only get your highest level spells (60) from the dragons or other 60th level monsters. <br />
<br />
Re-envisioning also does not mean fixing what is broken, it means basically reinventing each class from the ground up and balancing them against each other in terms of desirability so that if a choice is given between a Warrior and an Enchanter, you'll take either because neither is critical to success.  <br />
<br />
However it remains to be seen whether SOE will actually go THAT far.  It is more likely that SOE will go with each archetype (Fighter/Mage/Priest/Thief) and balance classes according to that.  If so, what we are all likely to see is that all priests will be able to heal and ressurect somewhat equally and the dividing lines will be what utility in each situation is given.  To take priests as a further example, clerics be given the best HP buffs, magic damage (DD and DOT), and specialized spells against undead.  Druids be given the best overall AC/HP/Mana regen buff, fire and cold damage (DD and DOT), and specialized spells against beasts/animals.  Shaman be given the best overall combat buffs, poison and disease damage (DD and DOT), and specialized spells against spirits.<br />
<br />
It is likely that niches and specialized roles will be over (which many people don't realize) and that the dominance one class has in a &quot;VITAL&quot; area will be spread out to all the other classes in the archetype.<br />
<br />
If SOE does have the balls to go through with it, in the end, players will find that Warriors, Paladins, and Shadowknights will have the same tanking abilities and Paladin/SK spell abilities will either be brought down or Warriors will be given additional abilities to compensate for example.  The key would be to give a raid/group no compelling reason to choose one tank over another OR the alternative would be to adjust content to make Warriors, Paladins, and SK's each desirable in specialized circumstances but equally across the board.  (ie: construct raid encounters where a warrior is the best for the situation but any other tank may work, then in the next wave but same encounter, a paladin is best, etc.) <br />
<br />
Personally, I'm feeling mostly negative over the entire thing, I still feel SOE owes it's player base for many unaddressed grievances but am currently waiting to see what they will do in the weeks/months to come.  <br />
<br />
My faith in SOE is pretty much non-existant at this point and I'm waiting to see if SOE is going to force people to buy yet another expansion for class balance to occur.  <br />

The group with the cleric will, in all probability, NOT go to the high DPS spiky mobs.<br />
<br />
They will grab a slowing class(Any of the three wiht mana regen in all probability) And head to the high HP/Fully slowable mobs that don't do spiky damage.<br />
Let them. Clerics were a bad class to group with in Luclin and that would hold true for these MOBs as well. When a shaman can already keep the group alive and do some damage on top of it why would you want to replace him with two classes that do worse damage? (remember, these are MOBs we could use our entire DoT array on)<br />
<br />
These are also MOBs that our 10% slowing advantage over beastlords would be noticeable on. A beastlord slowed fully slowable MOB does 50% more damage then a shaman slowed one.<br />
<br />
So when the cleric groups grabs a beastlord and heads back in time to Luclin all that happens is that the group will very very safe. But they will still kill slower then the group with a shaman.<br />
<br />
This is not like easy LDoN where stuff may be fully slowable but still dies in 10 seconds. I am talking about 5 minute fights here, where everyone better add some decent damage. If you want to skew things even further towards the shaman add in a nice cureable AE and some mez-immune adds. And now you have a 20 minute nonstop fight where you have to rootpark or offtank 3 MOBs. And keep curing your group. And keep healing. And keep doing some damage, or it will be a 30 minute fight. A cleric + beastlord group would probably be able to handle that. But after the fight the cleric will yell &quot;out of mana&quot; while the shaman will still be full and ready for more.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. beastlrod DPS, Cleric DPSing too.<br />
If the mob is so easy to heal versus that a shaman can drop his entire line of dots on it... hmm.<br />

Slot 1 Shaman's Mending(wichever you have)<br />
Slot 2 Slow<br />
Slot 3 Malos<br />
Slot 4 Cripple<br />
Slot 5 Heal Over time<br />
Slot 6 Canni<br />
<br />
That leaves 3 slots for dots.<br />
Rememebr, you've already stated that shaman debuffing is a must, so I've included all of shaman's debuffs except putrid decay(damned waste of a rune, but I digress) And I am not inlcuding our incomplete heal here &gt;_&gt;<br />

No clickies allowed. We're assuming the cleric doesn't have any clickies either. <br />

Murtak,, I think you're going off the deepend here trying to create an increasingly difficult encounter that favors shaman. And that only barely.<br />
<br />
I think you have created an encounter that favors high end raiding shaman, not your normal shaman.<br />
<br />
Please, show me what lineup the shaman is going to use for this encounter, because I am at a loss to see a shaman able to DPS and cure and heal and drop all these dots.<br />
<br />
I only ask you to leave clickies and Ancient spells out of it. Only work with the Spells and AAs that Joe_Average_Shaman_001 can get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, I aprecciate it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Slot 1 Shaman's Mending(wichever you have)<br />
Slot 2 Slow<br />
Slot 3 Malos<br />
Slot 4 Cripple<br />
Slot 5 Heal Over time<br />
Slot 6 Canni<br />
<br />
That leaves 3 slots for dots.Murtak can certainly speak for himself on this, but I will show you how to keep about a dozen spells available, from my typical lineup.<br />
<br />
Slot 1 Heal over time<br />
Slot 2 Mending<br />
Slot 3 Slow<br />
Slot 4 Root <br />
Slot 5 FA<br />
Slot 6 Bane<br />
<br />
Slots 5 and 6 can't be swapped out conveniently because of the long refresh times on those two spells.  Slots 1 through 4 can't be swapped out safely because if something bad happens you want all four of those available Right Now.<br />
<br />
Slots 7 through 9 are handled by spellsets.<br />
<br />
Press hotkey 9 (1-line macro: /mem debuff)<br />
Slot 7 Malos<br />
Slot 8 Decay<br />
Slot 9 [left blank]<br />
<br />
Press hotkey 0 (1-line macro:  /mem dots) <br />
Slot 7 Dot<br />
Slot 8 Dot<br />
Slot 9 Dot or [left blank]<br />
<br />
It takes a noticeable amount of work to prepare this.  The dots selected need to be specific to the situation:  which means you have to reconfigure the dots spellset for the specific occasion.  To do that correctly, you must de-mem all your spells, load only the two or three dots you want for the situation you are facing, and then save that spellset.  Then you need to re-mem the rest of your spells.<br />
<br />
Once you put in the time for the preparatory work, though, execution time is amazingly fast.  One key and you have memmed the debuffs.  One key and you have memmed the dots.<br />
<br />
On horseback you draw zero aggro doing this.  Grouping indoors when there are adds, or soloing, you need to lock down the mob(s) first, but you would do that anyway.  All you need is one tick of successful crowd control, and you hit the hotkey and you have switched to dps.<br />
<br />
When you need to recast one buff, it goes into slot 9.  After you have cast it, it gets auto-dememmed and replaced with a dot, if you are using four dots; or it gets ignored if you are using just three dots.<br />
<br />
When you need to recast three buffs, they go in slots 7, 8, and 9 (with a spellset, of course :))  You cast those buffs, and then hit hotkey 9 or 0, depending on what you need to do next.<br />
<br />
Once you are habituated to this pattern, it becomes quite natural to tap the hotkey for debuffs at the beginning of each round, swap in the dots, rebuff as needed, and repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">2 classes that do WORSE damage? *blinks*<br />
When did Beastlords lose their melee oriented DPS position?<br />
And I humbly submit that a cleric who wields his hammer is somethign of DPS, even if it's not as much DPS as a shaman.<br />
I should have clarified that I meant that substituting a beastlord and a cleric for a shaman + any even moderately damaging class will decrease group DPS. As to cleric DPS, it still sucks. Cleric's have pretty decent burst DPS, but sustained damage (such as in a 20 minute fight, while still healing) is negligible.<br />
<br />
I will humbly submit to teh fact that I started playing EQ after LDON came out, so I don't have the value of Luclin experience.<br />
Well, let me put it like this: Back in Luclin clerics had rez, druids could solo and shaman were far and away the best healers for non-AE groups. Unless your group already had a slower replacing the cleric with a shaman would usually double your kill rate, more if you had a lot of melees. Even if the group already had an enchanter you were still better of with a shaman instead of a cleric. It was more then a little ridiculous, probably as skewed as the single group Ikkinz trials before the changes, except the other way around.<br />
<br />
(on slow comparison) Mmm, I'd like to see some proof to back that up. It's not that I disbeleive, but I've never heard this figure spoken about.<br />
Unslowed MOB DPS: 100 DPS<br />
shaman slowed: 25 DPS<br />
Beastlord slowed: 35 DPS<br />
35/25 = 1.4, which means the beastlord slowed MOB does 40% more damage then the shaman slowed one.<br />
<br />
Slot 1 Shaman's Mending(wichever you have)<br />
Slot 2 Slow<br />
Slot 3 Malos<br />
Slot 4 Cripple<br />
Slot 5 Heal Over time<br />
Slot 6 Canni<br />
<br />
That leaves 3 slots for dots.<br />
Rememebr, you've already stated that shaman debuffing is a must, so I've included all of shaman's debuffs except putrid decay(damned waste of a rune, but I digress) And I am not inlcuding our incomplete heal here &gt;_&gt;<br />
Cripple is crappy as far as debuffing DPS goes anyways, other then reducing proc rate. Go with this lineup:<br />
Spot heal, Canna, HoT, Malos, Slow, Root, Poison, Bane, Disease<br />
<br />
DoTs for 3 resists, Rootparking, Debuffs, healing. If you need curing you can drop the disease DoT and still layer in some decent damage with the two DoTs. If you still have leftover mana after healing, debuffing, rootparking and keeping 2 DoTs running you are free to actually switch spells around too. Also having a slow, root or DoT item will give you another slot to play with.<br />
<br />
No clickies allowed. We're assuming the cleric doesn't have any clickies either. <br />
I do not know what you are assuming but I can not remember stating that no gear is allowed.<br />
<br />
Hmm,, sec, *goes to look up cleric spells*<br />
Ok, clerics and shaman have all the same basic curing spells.<br />
Shaman have one advantage in the cure deptartment, and that is Blood of Nadox.<br />
Clerics get PureBlood, and they get Word of Replenishment. Wich would get quite expensive, but they could always single target PB. Word of Vivication let's not forget this gem too. Beefy grp heals + cures during AEs wich I assume either DoT or DD.<br />
Clerics have to cast heals more frequently when MOBs are not slowed, that means less time for cures. If they do have a slower in the group they are pretty much on par with shamans. And if a clerics wants to use group heals vs DoTs he will only run himself out of mana on long fights.<br />
<br />
Woah, Mez immune adds? I think the cleric and the shaman are both in trouble on Mez Immune adds. Odd side note,,, the cleric stands a much better chance of healing an off tank through it while said offtank root parks.<br />
Slow? You know, it does help a lot when it is not mitigated. Back in Kunark and Luclin I used to play in small groups of 2 and 3 a lot. We would frequently take on 6+ not-quite-even cons without a mezzer and do just fine. Do that with a cleric and you have one out of mana cleric at best.<br />
<br />
Murtak,, I think you're going off the deepend here trying to create an increasingly difficult encounter that favors shaman.<br />
Uh, that is the whole point you know. To have individual MOBs favor individual classes, as opposed to entire expansions as is currently the case.<br />
<br />
And that only barely.<br />
If you are incapable of realizing the power of a full 75% slow on a high HP melee MOB coupled with lots of mana regeneration and a spellset geared for long fights then I guess you would feel that way. I can only tell you that back in Kunark to Luclin shaman used to be one of the most powerful classes precisely because of this combination of factors. Feel free to ask clerics and shamans how powerful a shaman with a full spellset was in Kunark, Velious and Luclin if you do not believe me however.<br />
<br />
I think you have created an encounter that favors high end raiding shaman, not your normal shaman.<br />
The  basic components stay the same. High mana regen + slow + DoTs + haste vs fast heals, CH and HP buffs. On a fully slowable high HP melee MOB that does moderate DPS the shaman will always vastly outperform the cleric. Just because I use the words &quot;mez immune adds&quot; there is no reason to think &quot;2500 quadding raid MOB&quot;. You can scale the basic encounter type all the way from hill giants to Anguish yard trash and the basic principle (shaman &gt; cleric on these types of MOBs) will hold true.<br />
<br />
I realize that if you have never played prior to PoP the style of encounter I describe is hard to understand. Basically the difference is that in GoD stype encounters (most of PoP, GoD, OoW, LDoN hards) you die because of overwhelming DPS - not being able to keep up with even a single MOB. Adds usually mean you need a mez right now or the group wipes. In Luclin style content (Kunark, Velious, Luclin, parts of the original game) you wipe because of adds and respawns.<br />
<br />
As long as you can reliably pull singles you pretty much can not wipe. A slow and then a heal every minute will keep your tank alive indefinitely against a single MOB. In that kind of situation you need staying power foremost. Being able to just keep casting, keep rerooting, keep healing, keep tanking an add and keep doing damage all the time is far far more valuable then being able to overheal by 200000% but not being able to keep going or for that matter to keep doing damage. Clerics have gotten some better tools for this type of encounter since Kunark but then again we got some decent direct heals too - and we are still FAR ahead in the endurance territory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">I also want some of what you've been smoking to come up with non-mitigating mobs,,,, or better still. Send it on to the Deve team. They'd put it to better use then I could.<br />
Well, the basic concept is really simple in my opinion. Imagine a zone in the next expansion. It has the usual 10 new MOB models per expansion. In past expansions the basics for all MOBs were pretty much the same for the entire expansion. Sure, DPS and HPs depend on the zone and the level of the MOB but generally speaking most OoW MOBs mitigate slow, deal pretty high DPS and have moderate to low HPs.<br />
<br />
Instead of this imagine some golem type MOB actually having 10 times the HPs of your average trash MOB. He deals a lot less damage though and is fully slowable. Then you have, say, some lizardfolk MOB with a flaming sword. He does a lot more DPS then the golem and has a nasty DD proc but he has few HPs. He mitigates slow but can be snared and rooted and does not summon. Then you might have a caster MOB that nukes for 6K a shot every, oh, say 7 seconds, 4 of which are casting time and he can be interrupted with stuns. And finally add a healer MOB that has 4 pets which are not all that tough but are unrootable and of course he heals and cures them. There should be more distinct MOB types but these 4 should suffice to illustrate what I mean.<br />
<br />
Each of these MOBs favors certain classes. Each of them can be easily defeated using a specific tactic (or one of several that work) but is a hard fight if you do not or can not use said tactic. The golem favors slowers and endurance classes. The lizard requires burst healing or snare + nukes or root + DoTs. The casters is pretty weak if you can debuff his MR and stun him. And the healer with his pets can be AEd, mezzed or taken out in one shot by a Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
Now you mix all these MOBs. The zone would have areas where you find mostly golems or mostly nukers but not exclusively. Say you have a castle in which you found 60% of the nukers, 20% golems and 10% each lizards and healers. The area right outside the castle features 40% golems, 40$ healers and 10% each nukers and lizards.<br />
<br />
You could go with a cleric, warrior, enchanter and 3 random DPS classes. You would do fine on the nukers with your 2 stunners, be good against the lizards and healers and possibly suffer somewhat on the golems. Or you could go with a shaman, paladin, druid and again 3 random other classes, say a magician, beastlord and wizard. You would still be able to kill each of the MOB types but you would have some problems with the nukers with only one stunner and each of the lizards would probably cost you a lot of mana for heals. Where group 1 mezzes the 4 pets of healer you just AE all of them so you probably do a little better and you do fine against the golems. Overall though you would probably be better off outside the castle so you get more golems and healers.<br />
<br />
If you do this with more and more varied types of MOBs you end up with a lore more variance during a single experience session, you end up actually rewarding groups that have 6 different classes and you also enhance the immersiveness of the game. A golem should have more HPs then an imp. A wizard NPC should do more damage nuking then meleeing. And you should have to do different things in different encounters. Why do only raids get interesting encounters, yet in experience groups you get to kill each MOB in the exact same way?<br />
<br />
Now all you have to do is to be consistent in regards to what MOB does what over zone boundaries. Then over the course of an expansion you introduce more and more MOB types. In OoW you could have 90% of the current MOBs in Dranic's Scar. In the castle structures however you could add some of the golems and maybe a single nuker. People would wonder, then figure out a way to beat them efficiently. In Noble's Causeway you also have some of the healers with 4 pets roaming around. And in the Bloodfields you introduce the lizardfolk.<br />
<br />
All it takes is a little work and creativeness on the part of SOE. And what they get in return is more immersiveness, more variety, easier class balance and probably more fun for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Make it more of a challenge to beat these mobs (have them work as a team against your group) and at the same time increase the experience modifier on them so even though it takes a lot longer to kill this group of mobs, you get the same experience as if you sat down bored out of your mind exping now.<br />

3 Ticks will be long enough for the Slow to stay on the mob most of the fight, I am sure. A defensive buff that slows a mob upon being hit - Sounds very Shaman-esque, doesn't it?<br />

Buff timers are like 30 minutes max in WoW.  Though WoW has a similar &quot;trinity&quot; problem that EQ does, though it's mostly a &quot;duality&quot; because warriors (or sometimes paladins) and priests are needed in instance groups at level 55+.  The same effect is felt though, because you can only have 5 members in a group.<br />
<br />
This does sound a little reactive to the massive numbers lost to WoW, so I wouldn't be surprised to see them stealing and copying successful ideas from WoW and incorporating them into EQ.  Just pray they don't make you start paying to travel, die, use the bazaar, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">er i just read this... i know i may be a bit late on it but didnt we as a class come up with it..<br />
<br />
&quot;Druids<br />
<br />
Druids are a unique challenge in that the class is divided evenly between you offensive druids who enjoy doing damage, and you defensive druids who prefer to play the role of healer.  We want to support both play styles, but if we were to increase both halves of the druid equally the class would quickly become overpowered.  Our plan is to introduce a new option where a druid can enter into a particular mode or stance where they become better at one part at the expense of the other.  Our preferred solution for this is to add an innate ability for druids. The ability would get its own button similar to abilities such as backstab or track.  You will be able to be in one of three states and can switch between them once every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
a.       Normal  Their healing and offensive abilities are in balance.  This is the state they exist in today.<br />
<br />
b.      Offensive  Their offensive power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their healing spells.<br />
<br />
c.       Defensive  Their healing power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their offensive spells.<br />
<br />
Another of our goals is to broaden the core grouping roles to allow all classes to more easily put together groups.  Similar to how any of the 3 main tanks should be able to perform that role in a group, we want any of the 3 healers to be able to perform the role of a main healer in a group.  The changes mentioned above for druids will allow you to fill a healing role and perform at about 80% of the effectiveness of a cleric.<br />

does this in anyway sound like<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">How can they give us AA's to make our durations longer, (classes in general) just to turn around and nerf them to shorter durations? Clerics convict/whatever other buffs, chanters kei, I will admitt 3-4 hours is a bit extreme. But they put in those those AA's/time/effort to get those AA just have longer durations.<br />
<br />
We had those AA's at one point, but I think and noticed, with the new spells I've noticed a decrease in durations as it is. I don't know, thats just how I see it. I do agree with one earlier post about how it's a pain in the ass to have so many buffs all at different durations. Gotta stop doing what your doing, mem spell, cast, a few mins mem another one, rinse and repeat. It's just easier to redo all the buffs at the same time. <br />
<br />
Anyway..... I made the sham for the diversity they provide. (the jack of all trades) Not just for the heals. I've said before how I don't want to be just a healer. But whatever.... I didn't read each post, so can't say much as to whats been said already. This is just how I felt about the durations/change they implied, whats the point of AA's that extended the durations just to have it all nerfed.. /sigh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">Thats all well and good Grim, but the shaman class is far too diverse to EVER become the healer some seem to want. /shrug. But again, I like my niche, I like my class, I like my abilities. <br />
<br />
Just the other day, had one of those &quot;situations&quot;. Was in Stillmoon, farming some faction crap, with a &quot;Twink&quot; SK (Time+ stuff but low level/AAs), a Rogue, and myself. One mob got away, pulled 10-15 more (mostly d.blue to a 70, some l.blue, all d.blue to the 66 SK). They said &quot;Should we just zone?&quot; and I said &quot;Nah, I got this easy&quot;. A few roots, a VP or 2, doggy, dog-army, some clicky-slows, HoTs, etc etc and the CY was riddled with about 30 corpses. And there we were. I was full mana and health, BTW (channeling was down, of course). <br />

<br />
You are my hero!  I 2box with my BL and have never had a mob get far enough away to get 10-15 adds.  Stillmoon mobs should be cake for time folks, they are for me and my BL, both of us are non-elemental.<br />
<br />
Using this example of why we don't problems just irritates the crap out of me since..the same group with a cleric coudl have done the same, with no problem.</div></div><hr />
