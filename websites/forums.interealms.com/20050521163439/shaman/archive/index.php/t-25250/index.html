Does anyone know what is the maximum amount of time you can have an unpaid account before they erase my wonderful Level 58 Shaman?<br />
<br />
I think poor Vildeor Ogg has finally ded never to return again because I lost my job back in July and I haven't paid my account in that long, though I think the 6 month billing cycle ended way back in May.</div></div><hr />

Warnings about character deletion exist solely for litigation purposes so that if a rare circumstance does arise, they're legally covered and don't have to reimburse you for anything just in case.</div></div><hr />
