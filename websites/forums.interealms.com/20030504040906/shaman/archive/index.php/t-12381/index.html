<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wololo696</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Forgive me, as I assume this has been asked before....<br />
<br />
What and where do I have to go to start Research (is there a skill needed to make a spell?), and where do I find quills and patchments?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />

To do research, you get the drops you need for the spell, and then ask your favorite int caster to combine them for you. ;)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info.....and thank the Tribunal that we do not need to work on a research skill (lol).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would've been nice to have a really great use for the alchemy skill since I hardly ever have cause to use it now, except to keep my skill maxed out.  There certainly isn't much money to be made with it at any rate.</div></div><hr />
