<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys I am new to the forum. I have a 22 Barbarian Shaman on the Terris-Thule Server named Bonethug. He ins in Lake of Ill Omen at the moment. Anyways does anybody know some good quests I can do at this level? I would really like to do one. Also does anybody know how much all the level 24 spells cost? Thanx guys see ya later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are not twinked (and I'd guess you aren't, as you care about low/mid-level quests), you might want to look at the Totemic Armor quests. I soloed for the Boots at Level 22, though you'll need to wait a few levels, or find a small group (duoing with a Ranger is perfect, as they have a similar set of quests, Ivy Etched, and you can help each other out) to go for the other pieces. Check out http://www.eqshaman.com/equipment/totemicinfo.html or Allakhazam's (look for quests in Lake Rathetear) for info on them. Unfortunately, each piece requires Dufrenite, which runs about 150-175pp, depending on your Charisma. For some of the armor pieces, you could probably buy Ry'Gorr for the same price when you also add in the time spent traveling the world and looking for the necessary spawns. But the quests are a lot of fun, and the armor is good enough that I'm still wearing the Helm, Breastplate, and Boots at Level 55 (yeah, I know my gear stinks). And, if you choose to do all the quests, they can provide you some focus until around Level 30, plus they require you to hunt in new zones you've probably never been to before.<br />
<br />
As for spell prices, I think most of the Level 24 spells (or at least the good ones) run about 15pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tazliin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are the parts collected for totemic armor droppable?  Just wondering if my druid buddy could run around and collect them then just give them to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the necessary pieces (except for the Banded and Dufrenite, of course) are NO DROP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The quest pieces for totemic are all NO DROP...BUT.......any class can do the quest as long as you have not ruined faction with the Barb. quest givers in Lake Rathe.<br />
<br />
My shaman quested everything but the Helm pieces.  Quite frankly I did not want to spend time hanging out in Everfrost with him when he could be getting exp. elsewhere (need to be 34+ to solo the Glacier bear, by then, not much exp. available in EF).  <br />
<br />
So I camped my druid (lv. 42) in the Glacier bear cave in EF and whenever I logged on and just before logged off for the night, I'd pull up my druid and check for the Glacier Bear and/or kill the Skellies (same spawn table).  So my druid quested for the totemic Helm and transfered it to my shaman via a guildmate.<br />
<br />
If your druid friend is willing to get the no drop pieces, you can just give him the Dufrenite needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rissell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a note.  I solo'd the Glacier Bear at lvl 30.  My heart was pounding the entire time, but I killed him easily enough.  Just don't waste your mana nuking with cold based spells - he will resist.  Keep him rooted and double-dot'd and you'll be fine.  Only hits for around 34 or so if memory serves me right.<br />
<br />
Also, beware the Lich of Miragul who follows a similar path as the bear.  After I killed the bear, I suppose I spent a little too much time reveling in his defeat (and taking screenies), and the Lich sneaked up behind me and killed me with about four swings of his boney fist (100+ dmg).  Luckily I'd already looted the bear... had just sat down to memorize Gate.  D'oh. =)<br />
<br />
Glacier bear pelt is for the Totemic Helm 12ac 5wis, in case it wasn't stated above.<br />
<br />
The Totemic Boots (10ac 5str) quest is also fairly easy to do.  Just need a terror spine from Najena (can be found not far from the zone entrance) and a orc chief's tongue from Lesser Faydark.  Only thing dangerous about the Orc Chief part is to watch out for Brownies and that mean unicorn in Lfay.  Also, be sure not to wander into the shadowed man camp... they hit pretty hard for their level.  Think I was still lvl 30 when I killed the Orc Chief (could be wrong, tho).  He was green, just like all the other orc's at the camp, and I single pulled him without agro'ing the other orcs.  Also made a fool mistake here, too (I'm good at that, sometimes).  After I killed the chief and looted him, I sat down to med up, and must've sat too close to the camp because all the other orcs agro'd on me as soon as my butt hit the dirt.  Oh well, at least they didn't hit as hard as the Lich, I survived that fowl up.<br />
<br />
As far as the other Totemic quests, I have no idea.  The Helm is the only thing with wis on it, so I did it and the boots (because I was wearing ringmail boots at the time) and decided I'd buy some wis gear in EC instead of dufrenites for the other pieces.<br />
<br />
Also, you should do the Testament of Vanear quest if you haven't already (which I recommend to all wis casters).  It's a nice 10wis 10mana item for your off hand.  Look it up on eqshaman.com.  Quest is easy, just can be a pain waiting for Dyllin Starsine to pop.  Think he's on an 8hr timer, tho some people say it's closer to 6hr.  You should have no problem at all with it at level 24, as I did it at lvl 16.<br />
<br />
That's the extent of the quests I've done in EQ, as they were the only ones that seemed worthwhile.  Now that I'm a bit higher level, I have plans of doing the Coldain Prayer Shawl quests and eventually try for some Thurg or Skyshrine armor, and of course the Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some, and highly recommend Testament of Vanear and Totemic Helm.  They will serve you well for many levels.</div></div><hr />

DONT do Testament of Vanear Quest<br />
<br />
It's EVIL! <br />
<br />
NO!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only Barbarian Druids carry the Testament of Vanear.  Best way to get laughed at on my server by other shamans. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who cares what other people think?  Testament of Vanear (at least on my server) is used by druids, shamans, and clerics alike.  I'd rather have the 10wis 10mana from Testament than use a lame charred guardian shield.  I'm level 40 and still using Testament of Vanear, and will continue to use it until I get a Lodizal Shell Sheild or something of that calibur. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd rather have the 10wis 10mana from Testament than use a lame charred guardian shield.<br />
<br />
So you would trade away AC 10 for Wis +1, Mana +10? The Charred Guardian Shield is pretty bad for a Shaman, when you consider how much it costs, but at least it's better than the Testament of Vanear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You remind me  of the 55shaman that was flamed so bad sometime ago because of the similar druid mentality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">this is an opinion, but the testament of vanear is poo. if you use a cgs, youre only gonna lose like 20 mana, and 10 ac is alot.....besides shamans get back mana easily with cann/regen etc. go for hps/ac items! most shamans dont even have the faction to get the testament...not to mention the 6 hours that you could be getting xp instead of waiting for some-dumb-guy in HH to spawn.<br />
lvls&gt;items anyways...<br />
theres much better stuff later in tha game!</div></div><hr />
