<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I am about 40% to 65 and will be starting AA's.  I have read over the guide on AA's here and pretty much have a map of what I am going to go after.  I have one questions though:  Do you guys find it better to get level 1 in each and move on to another or mash all the way to level 3 on each before going on to the next one?  Seems like getting to level 3 on some would be the way to go but I am not exactly sure.  Thanks for any input.<br />
<br />
*Edit* After Canni 5 of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It depends. (Don't you hate that?)<br />
<br />
I am at just over 130 AAs, and the only thing I have at less than max is RC(2) and SCS(1) - and the healing stuff I'm currently plodding through.<br />
EDIT: Whoops, and planar power, because I'm not hitting the ceiling yet.<br />
<br />
I'd say, whatever you do, get one level in RC and at least one level in VP (they're cheap at level one) before you pick an ability to take to level three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on the aa.  I got spirit call I months ago and where 3 dogs is worth 2 points, is it worth another 2 (or more, I can't remember) points for EACH of the last 2 dogs?  I didn't think so.  Other AA, though, you get very little benefit for the first purchase - I think it's crit heals that you get 2%, then 5% and 10%...  For that one, I thought if I was going to buy it, I might as well see it through to the end, or it wasn't really worth the points.<br />
<br />
So for stuff like virulent paralysis, spirit call, radiant cure - those are handy enough to just buy one level asap, just to HAVE it in case you need it.  The rest, I preferred to max out before moving on.  But that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are some abilities which give you completely new functionality (Spirit Call, Radient Cure, Virulent Paralysis), but the majority of your abilities are merely percentage improvements to your character (all archetype abilities, etc...).<br />
<br />
For the former, it is usually enough to just train the first rank of an ability and wait until later to finish it out.  I got Spirit Call 1 at around 50aa, but I didn't train ranks two and three until I had over 250aa, for example.  I did the same thing with Radient Cure, because although the initial rank for these abilities are great buys, the successive ranks are not as worthwhile.<br />
<br />
For other abilities (namely archetype abilities and the PoP improvements on them) you are going to want to finish out an entire line before you move on to the next one. I feel you get more returns and sooner if you do it this way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As people have said it depends. In general if it adds a new ability like, VP, RC, SC etc then even just buying the first level is pretty good and I can see buying the first level off all those. On the other hand I find maxing out other skills to be much more useful. 2% more hps wasn't that significant, 10% more hps was. Same for heals, or crits etc. Quick buff is probably the only exception IMO since you run into the haste cap of 50% pretty quickly. QB + pretty much any haste item + cleric buff = max. With the right benificial spell haste items you can even hit it with out cleric buff. I know there are people who will say that QB allows you more flexability in your gear but I don't personally agree with that. If you where wearing a enhancment haste item like emp ring I could see how qb 3 would allow you to replace it with out lossing out but thats not what people are using now a days. It's benificial haste items, or just flat out spell haste items and those both cover so many other things, heals, gates, debuffs nukes etc that your still loosing out majorly if you loose that focus effect so why spend 9 aa's so that Q can not loose out cause thats really the only thing that it matters on.</div></div><hr />
