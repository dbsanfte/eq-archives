<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have a question regarding root. I am a 59 shaman and usually have root up for crowd control on adds. I am currently memming the lowest level root because it seems to work the best. I am having huge trouble with Paralyzing Earth and I wondered if anyone else was having this.<br />
<br />
Examples: <br />
<br />
On Dandolak in LoY (Sub 50 level mobs) I root when they turn to run. Usually Paralyzing Earth breaks twice in the 20 seconds it takes to kill them off. Root only breaks if I dd.<br />
<br />
POS Desert:<br />
Cactoren (Level 58 mob), I couldn't hold them for love or money. A couple of times we had an add and I tried to root them off. By the time I had announced that root was in (Paralyzing Earth) it would wear off. Our ranger rooted them and laughed at my efforts. Even after Malo was in the duration sucked.<br />
<br />
So, should I be using Enstill, Root, or just conserve mana do something different. Crowd control is not usually my role, but it never hurts to get the first root in on an add. It is just embarassing that it breaks immediately.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help/advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Until you get Greater Immobilize and/or Petrifying Earth, good ol' &quot;Root&quot; is the only one you need.  I've yet to see any of the others reliably hold any better to merit the extra mana costs and in some cases longer casting times.<br />
<br />
Greater Immoblize casts FAST and has a resist mod which means it is less likely to be resisted and does seem more reliable than any previous root.<br />
<br />
Petrifying Earth is basically the same as Greater Immoblize with a slightly longer cast time and mana cost to pay for a potentially longer duration, and it does indeed seem to last quite a while if you leave the mob alone.<br />
<br />
You're doing the right thing using the first &quot;Root&quot; spell for crowd control at 59.  When you get Greater Immbolize you might wanna switch to that though.  It is more reliable IMO.  PE I use for root/rotting, GI for quick crowd control functions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zzang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even at 65, only root spell I use it the good old root.<br />
Only time I use petrifying earth is when I am soloing which is rare.<br />
Other root spells are rotting in my spell book for inefficient mana cost vs reliability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I sometimes switch to GI on raids (where mana is coming out of my ears) or in groups where I don't expect to actually USE root.  If I'm soloing and using root a lot, Just Plain Root still works better manawise.<br />
<br />
No, I can't see spending 150 mana for a 30 mana root when odds are it's not going to hold any longer.  I'll take the extra round from the mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The root/immobilize line is for quicker cast and low(er) resist rooting. The paralysing/petrifying line is for long durations (up to 3 mins). Personally, for crowd control I use the long duration line and it works excellent - just debuff first. With malosini/malosinia and the petrifying root, I can root just about any mob and they usually stay parked as long as needed (if nobody is messing with it of course).</div></div><hr />
