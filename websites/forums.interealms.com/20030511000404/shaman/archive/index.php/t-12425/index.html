<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay just dinged 56, and while I can still get decent xp + loot in Dulak doing either shady treasure sorters or the Oceancrasher (though it's tough to do well on the boat, I don't seem to kill mobs fast enough).  I tried doing Katta for xp and it seems even slower than Dulak (9-10 mobs for 1% duoing with a SK in my guild). I've realized that 3-4 or 5 kills per 1% of xp is rather slow.  It took most of 3 hours to get 2 blues of xp after I hit 56.<br />
<br />
I have JBB and a Drogmor, and fairly decent equipment (I think) but haven't got my Epic yet (damn iksar child's tear is holding me up).  Do have Stoicism though and usually keep KEI just to make more efficient use of my time.  Also have run3 and regen3 already.<br />
<br />
Anyone got suggestions of where I can solo in PoP for better xp (I'd love to see 1% a kill again..or even 1% per 2 kills) and some tactics for doing it successfully?  I do try to get PoP groups, but my time has gotten limited recently and I usually can't groups as a result..<br />
<br />
Edit: I linked my Magelo profile in my sig so you can assess my gear if you'd like.</div></div><hr />

yard trash in PoN generaly gives me 1% a kill at 57. its slow going though and you have to watch out for add/trains/quadders. just pull with malise to your camp root/slow and dot it up. as I said it slow( but when I got bane it made things MUCH quicker ) taking about 3 rounds of ebolt/bane and 1 plague and a nuke here and there to finish off the mob, with JBB it would probably help out a bit ( if the roots hold hehe ). and please, if you get an add and need to zone call it out first and come from the east side of the zone out. it just makes things easier =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if ur good u can pull the cells in poj entrance- requires u to be WELL awake as u need good timing to avoid adds from rats and sentrys.<br />
<br />
tbh i got bored of trying to avoid the adds and gave up....but its is doable.<br />
<br />
if u got 1k+ ac unbuffed epic and horse and jbb  then u can solo POI entrance, youll need crack and aegolism and have to be there off peak. <br />
tbh its slow work but damn its not half fun!!<br />
<br />
small tip-  dont pull the archaic models *chukle*</div></div><hr />
