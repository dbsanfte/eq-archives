<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i'm getting divorced in a couple of weeks and i am so farking broke i don't know what to do, so i thought i'd turn to my shammy buds and ask for assistance in this dire time of my need. <br />
<br />
I've put countless hours of largely drunken time into providing these boards with endless streams of useless info, like how to raid fear with only 47 peeps, why druids are superior in EVEREY WAAY to shammies, how to raid PoJ trials with only 8 NTOV equipped mages and on and on and on. The knowledge don't stop.<br />
<br />
So, it comes a time in every shammies life when they say, hell if Wildaar can get pillaged for it and Sunny get away like a bandit, then i wanna be in that crowd.<br />
<br />
This is the deal: my 14 children borne to a devout mormon flock of 21 women need to eat. I can't do it all by myself. So if you click on the link below and send me a few bucks, you know you are doing the right thing for a shammy bro, a EQ wastoid, and bottomless source of amusement for u and ur leet pals. Never mind the kids, its about kissing my a$$. You know that is the be all and all of Crucibikle life so hit that paypal now!<br />
<br />
And for all the new folks who think shammies is the bestest and can solo sheet and make $$ plat and necros don't know crap, and beasties need tha nerf, and oh i don't know, enchanters should be taken out in front of Basra and paraded before the cameras in robes with &quot;i love saddam give it to me&quot; slogans and such, well hats off to you boys, you know what's what.<br />
<br />
Goodbye Crucibabblers. Mung the mighty would have loved you all. (in a s-t-f-u ghey fag kind of a way). New mods&gt;posters!<br />
<br />
In the words of those guys from a Nameless uber guild who ninja looted the xalgoz fangs that time after i soloed them all the way down to the church: Peace Out!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take care sir~  <br />
<br />
I'd put a fun &quot;can i have your stuff&quot; in, but someone already beat me to it =)  At least I'm on the right server~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Links broken bud.<br />
<br />
take care</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aren't you bitter?  Since you already hate me, I'll cement the deal and send this post off to your favorite forum, the grey, where it belongs!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your contributions in the past!  I don't really know what caused your abrupt attitude change a few months back, but I used to look forward to reading your posts.<br />

<br />
and btw, he wasn't banned from the boards.  <br />
<br />
There was a problem with board and passwords were reset, if your original email that you signed up with is no longer active you won't be able to recover that password.  If you need that password reset for you, just PM that horrid Sunmoon to do that for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heh, that post reminds of that Random &quot;I Quit EQ&quot; post generator someone posted a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Henora: heh, no hate, no bitterness, maybe a cup too much of sour grapes, but the way the Crucible is now, well someone's gotta... ;)<br />
<br />
Had lots of fun wasting too much work time reading these boards for 3 years. Thanks for your efforts and all the others that put in the time, particularly Thantu for minding the flock.<br />
