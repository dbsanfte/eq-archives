<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dienx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sup all ...tis my first post in the glade, love this place.....ok  to the meat and potatoes of the post.....need help on some deulin tactics, freakin 53 bst in guild keeps kickin all the rangers arse. i am 52 Rng baron........nightmarecompound bow....2 lammy's......and swarmcaller....with various armor (got tolans bracer) all good.......what should i do to take him out......u guys no we're bad losers so helpa ranga out............one more question can someone explain trueshot disck tome plz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't give much pvp advice :(.. I'd say try to snare/root the beastlords pet if possible, and try to melee the bl down. At 52 you can shoot for double damage on non rooted, non moving mobs, so the beastlord should be dented a bit, if you decided to shoot arrows. I would recommend that you sell the 2nd lammy and upgrade it to a jagged blade of mourning or centi ls. They'll do more damage as there is no damage bonus in the offhand, rendering the 2nd lammy sorta useless. <br />
<br />
The trueshot discipline is a skill activated by /disc trueshot at level 55, which increases archery damage for 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm curious, since I do play on a PvP server - what works against a BL's pet?  Panic Animal, or something like Ward Summoned?  If you knew you'd be fighting him an advance, I'd just chain-cast Panic Animal (if it worked).  Root might be of more use, given that you could use it on the BL, too.  But if he has high resists, just Panic the pet repeatedly and start working on the BL with your bow.  <br />
<br />
I think you could stand toe-to-toe with him, rather than jousting (using a big, mean 20hander, standing out of range, and running by with a timed swing when it refreshes).<br />
<br />
If you do go toe-to-toe, have some damage shields up, since he'll be hitting you quickly with H2H weapons, etc. <br />
<br />
But lemme know about the Panic Animal or Ward Summoned thing. Just curious what they consider the pet to be.<br />
<br />
/bonk! Welcome to the Glade.  (I really do have to go get a Shovel some day.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Firion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not a huge dueler, but it seems to me that with the BL having haste and slow, and better buffs, meleeing with him is a bad idea.  What he doesn't have is snare or root, so snare him and root him, and you have the initiative.  BL pets have a fair number of HP, so don't try to kill the pet if you don't have to.  I'd try staying away from him and shooting/nuking him to death.  Magic damage is pretty much a tossup, but he can't match your arrow damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have dueled a 63 beastlord while I am a 60 ranger. Mainly they are fast hitters with their haste , which for them can be a down side. Mainly what I did was use archery to take him down to 1/2 life and then cast up your damage shields and go straight at him. I had like a 20 some damage shield. As for the pet just snare it and and root it away. I had around a 60% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dienx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm under the influence, that the pets can't be rooted, only snared........with both of us unbuffed besides our own ........should i lead with swarmcaller and and try to slow...........or snare, and nuke pet.............or  just snare pet and run around pluggin bl with arrows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With any pet class, you either focus on the caster while the pet beats on you, or you get rid of the pet and then focus on the caster.  Do not actually stand there and melee the pet though, that's about the worst thing you could do.  <br />
<br />
Agro the pet, run him off into the middle of timbuktoo, snare and root.  Go find the caster, and let the beat down commence.  If he's intelligent, he'll be using a 2 hander to avoid your damage shield.  I'd recommend you using one too, although I don't know how much more damaging your swarmcaller would be over your two lammies.<br />
<br />
Basically, once his pet is gone, he should be cake no matter what you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TrackinU</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Quick word of caution,  not sure what level they get it but I duel'd a BL and he kept blinding me, wasnt really prepped for the fight so I didnt have the right spells up. He kept me blind, I kept him rooted (/hug hotkeys) and plinked him down with the bow.  Something to watch for at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dienx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok the results of my 0 and 3 bout with the 54 BL.......<br />
Resisted just about evething about 99% of the time...............snare landed...........................root landed......................and panic animal landed ( which really F****** him up cause he didnt know what to do ) .............but with all the resist's i took about 1k hp just taken hits while tryin to cast ( was runnin in wolf flrom to get away midnd u )..........warder was surprisingly fast.......and kept up while i ran away to cast spells.................i mangae to take him down to 40% when i realized panic and root worked by that time i ws down to 10% .......................the 3rd fight was gonna try all my recent newfound appifany(spellin) and commence to the beatfdown....only to be buged and not have mine or his nukes land.....................he log and so did i ....were both tired...........in all....................i can take a 54 BL ( a excellant player btw) out using this.................snare pet ...........run away to cast  root or panic(which everone happens to land the best for u ) and then concentrate on caster (althought i havent fought him again yet) ..............but with stunning pet out of the way we can melee and ds' caster to DEATH!!!!.................after pet is out of the way u can melee .................use arrows.......or nukes.....the choice is urs.....................also excersice extreme caution...............BL's pets hit hard and fast wile stunning...........and there fast so snare plz for the love of god snare )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ah, thanks for the update.  Nice to know that Panic Animal will work on the thing; wonder if that goes for the Iksar's beast, whatever that thing is.  I'm likely to face one of those some day.  But thanks, this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dienx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">was fighting a iksar's bst )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Neat....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hehe, goes back to what i said before.  break out your 2 hander, lead pet away.  snare and root pet, then track back to beastlord and he's an easy kill.<br />
<br />
problem with using wolf form, and i know you're not on a pk server, but when you zone out, you're suddenly left without any form of movement buff once you zone in.  that's a problem.  just a thought for others :)<br />
<br />
grats though on the succesful duel.  fighting and dieing, trying over and over again till you learn new strategies to win, that's what it's about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Saltydawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well I can shed a little light here.<br />
<br />
 I have a 60 Beastlord and a 53 Ranger....Beastlord on blue server and Ranger on zek server so I have pretty intimate knowledge of what both classes are capable of.<br />
<br />
 Beastlord vs Ranger can become a long drawn out fight....it really depends on player skill in pvp environment.<br />
<br />
 Things the Beastlord has in his favor......<br />
<br />
 Flash of Light.....blind people often get confused and are extremely limited in their ability to attack.<br />
It is also easy to break los on someone when they're blinded so that ranged attacks will not go off even if they're spamming hot keys.<br />
<br />
 The Beastlord and Pet will outdamage a ranger in straight melee fighting. A Ranger will not win if he simply runs up and starts to melee a beastlord and pet.<br />
<br />
 The Beastlord has slow spells...up to 65 percent slow depending on level.<br />
<br />
 Things the Ranger has in his favor.......<br />
<br />
 Snare......this is the single most valuable tool a ranger has in pvp style fighting. If you land a snare the fight is yours 90 percent of the time....provided you dont do stupid stuff :).<br />
<br />
 The bow.....ranger bows have longer range than most spells and with a snared opponent its easy to bow kite them.<br />
<br />
 Things that even out..............<br />
<br />
 Both classes have nukes and get them at about the same level and they hit almost exactly as hard...its a draw here.<br />
<br />
 Both classes have dots....again they are very similar in damage power...another draw.<br />
<br />
 Both classes have about the same ammount of hp's/tanking ability........another draw.<br />
<br />
<br />
 These fights mostly come down to equipment and pvp exp.<br />
<br />
 Magic resist will be a key factor...the beastlord needs to avoid being snared and the ranger needs to avoid being blinded/slowed.........this is probably the biggest factor....who can land their &quot;good&quot; stuff.<br />
 The dots and nukes dont really have much bearing on these fights....they just dont do enough damage to significantly hurt the enemy.<br />
<br />
 If your trying to win as a ranger then pump your magic resist up as high as you can get it........snare the beastlord and use your bow....avoid direct melee combat because your bow damage will be greater than a beastlord's ranged damage. (save your mana for snares and healing yourself when needed from his dots and nukes)<br />
 If you dont get the pet snared you will lose(beastlord pets are nasty)....snare the pet and then kite him around.<br />
<br />
 When both the beastlord and the ranger have extremely high magic resist this becomes a long drawn out fight(neither will land their &quot;good&quot; stuff)....an endurance contest (fungi tunics are really nice for these type fights).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey, Saltydawg.  /bonk, and thanks for the insights. <br />
<br />
Have I seen your name somewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Okay the blinding thing is kinda of useless if you just being the fight with a bind sight. You look out from his eyes!!! I mean it's not like he is going to blind himself. Works for me and I belive it will work for you if you ever face a opponet that blinds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BTW bind sight has yet to be resisted by any mobs I have casted it on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You know, I think I tried to cast it once on an opponent on Sullon, but got the &quot;This spell cannot affect the target PC,&quot; or whatever the wording is.  Lucy lists it as a beneficial spell, and on Sullon, we can't cast beneficial spells on folks on the other team.  Will have to try it in the bazaar, see if I can annoy someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lady Charlotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hi ... first post, but couldn't resist  :D<br />
<br />
I don't duel much, I have this obnoxious pally friend who dared me to fight him.  At that time, he was 5 levels higher and oooh sooo proud of his new &quot;uber&quot; weapon.  <br />
<br />
I knew I was going to die.  Regardless, I buffed up, put 'Disarm' in my hotkey line-up, and accepted the challenge.<br />
<br />
I actually disarmed him!  Better still, he didn't realise it at first.<br />
<br />
Although we are capped at 55, I still would recommend having it up ... every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
/hugs Kavlor ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>victoriatana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">***WARNING!!!  SNEAKY TACTIC AHEAD!!!***<br />
<br />
CoE (or I think it's SoN) overwrites a BL's pet haste.  Since you can't buff his/her pet during a duel, try to sneak it in before hand (He sends you the duel, cast CoE on pet, then accept).   So either he/she has to call up a new pet, or live with a non hasted pet.<br />
<br />
I know it's not very classy or honest, but do you want to live or die?  I've tried it twice, and apart from the BL calling fowl, it works fine, except that I always casted CoE before invite (to duel that is), so I don't know if you can do it with the invite pending.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't work, snare/root both of them and work on the BL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Winker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">well... i wasn't going to post here ever again..but i had to ask help on info for leveling at 49..so i might as well answer this.. For me..this is what i would do..and have been doing.. 1. buy crystal pumices(nullify magic, 2 sec cast time i think).  2. When you buff up..you need to put around 3 crap buffs before all your buffs..and SoW comes last. After you're done buffing click off 3 crap buffs.. that way when he slows, or whatever spells he uses gets put in your first 3 slots.. so when you nullify magic you cancel those out and not your beneficial buffs.  3.  Always keep up your DS, most important thing.  <br />
<br />
Then once the duel begins run the pet away root and snare.  then snare the beastlord..if you can't snare him.. stay on him and right click your mouse.. and turn around him in circles.  Or you can use the method that Howlur was talking about.. which is called jousting on our server.  Swarmcaller isn't really effective post 50 for slowing people or so i hear... if you have the money and its probably cheap on your server..get a wrapped entropy serpent spine.. procs blinding III poison.. a 200 dot and blind... very hard to resist because its poison based.  But melee wise if you can't take out a beastlord then plz quit right now.  Its the pet that is so dangerous..and the blind.. oh the blind..</div></div><hr />
