<br />
You are kidding right?  This is a true test of role playing - Will someone roleplay over loot?<br />
<br />
The answer is no.  This quest does not discourage roleplaying, it actually promotes it.  But human nature kicks in and people go for the loot.  If role playing to you is getting gear then you are not really a role player.</div></div><hr />

Kagan, roleplaying doesn't mean being a goody-two shoes, but I was under the impression that the people here play rangers, a decidedly &quot;good&quot; class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly my point Arkus, the loot orientation (among other things) discourages role playing in EQ.  Of course going after loot or levels is not role playing, and that's all anyone ever does in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that depends. Roleplaying does not mean that your character is automatically of what D&amp;D/AD&amp;D would classify as &quot;Lawful Good&quot; alignment.<br />
<br />
Heck, I consider Crydee's alignment to be of &quot;Neutral Good&quot; by the D&amp;D/AD&amp;D alignment standards meaning that he generally acts in what he considers to be the best interests of Good, but that doesn't always means following all the rules.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would giving this pirate back his eyepatch help the greater good? Probably not, as he most likely would run off to sacking villages and hijack boats with travelers just to plunder their loot. It seems to me that greater good would be better served by having the pirate remain focused on recovering his eyepatch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said, Good doesn't necessarily mean law abiding. One of the thief character's in Baldur's Gate is classified as good for example.<br />
<br />
If good meant always following the rules 100%, no paladin would get Soulfire (much less Firey Avenger or Firey Defender) because they won't organize a hit on a local government official.</div></div><hr />

If a Paladin believes something is right and it holds to his standards and you disagree with him, you are &quot;evil&quot; and are in need of conversion, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Depending on the god, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; can also be completely different things from one to the next.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't really want the eyepatch. The extra haste is very little and I always go everywhere with my Significant other who is a bard. The haste doesn't do that much for me so I opt to use a Mask that gives a lot of Dex for Trueshot instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Captain Nalots Quickening stacks with bard haste... Just make sure you keep it up before the bard song starts or it wont take hold.  Otherwise you are good with it.  <br />

And +10Dex is pretty damn good in my book.</div></div><hr />

Captain Nalot squints and then knocks hard on the metal half of his face to get his eye back in adjustment.. 'Arrr. This is perfect. Har! Now we can be plannin' our pillagin' and plunderin' all proper like. Good work, Antilzah!' Captain Nalot slaps you on the back and accidently drops his eyepatch.

Theft is absolutely ESSENTIAL to the natural order.  Theft is what makes the pretty flowers grow.  It's what makes lions and tigers and bears so healthy and strong.  Do you really think the bear pays for his honey?  Does the deer offer its throat to the wolf?  Bristlebane's lot steals for leisure, for fortune; my people steal for life.<br />
<br />
The assignment of a moral absolute to nature is a folly I blame on humans who live isolated from it.  Nature isn't merciful, or kind, or just or considerate.  Nature doesn't reward honor or honesty, nor does she favor any law but her own.<br />
<br />
Nature is brutal.<br />
<br />
Nature is merciless.<br />
<br />
Nature is neither good nor evil; it is nature.  These are my tenets and my charge, and by them I live and die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would have to agree with Crydee upto a point.  The thing people don't get about paladins is that while they do follow the law and are good, the laws they do follow are their god's law. Not man's.  <br />
<br />
For a Paladin the laws of their god are greater than the laws of man thus they follow their gods law to the letter.  If that means they have to take out the local government official because they are evil and corrupt you bet they would organize and take down that govenment IF its the will of their god to do so.<br />
<br />
Well thats my take on the subject now back to your poll...<br />
<br />
Would I give it back?<br />
I might but then again maybe not... would have to get it first to think about it and from everything I've read about what you go thru to get this item.... I might not LOL<br />
<br />
Is that a muddy enough answer for ya? &lt;G&gt;</div></div><hr />
