<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a 1-2group affair in NC. He drops Greater Muramite Runes (level 69 spells) and commonly drops two of them.<br />
That alone is enough reason for you to be interested in this mob :)<br />
<br />
Allakazham's Page (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16081) <br />
<br />
Mob Info:<br />
<br />
Ok, location is near the WoS zoneline in NC. From the main path there, he is on the other side of the trench, and and be easily seen from the main path, just before the bridge that spans the trench.<br />
<br />
The AEs:<br />
He has two AEs, one is a massive self debuff (link (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3230&amp;source=Live)) and the other is a 500hp, 100mana/endurance DoT (link (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5728&amp;source=Live)) that does 500damage when initially cast.<br />
<br />
The DoT AE is prismantic, with a neg150 to resists, so chance of resisting this without a bard is low. The AE has 30 poison counters, so requires a fair bit to remove it.<br />
<br />
He hits for around 800 on a defensive(?) warrior.<br />
<br />
He is surrounded by smaller murkgliders. These can be limited to one add by watching the pathing, and pulling when they are furthest away from the School Leader.<br />
<br />
Strategy<br />
<br />
If using 1 group, this is a 10min fight so mana will be tight.<br />
If using one group, a TMer will be needed as well, for any Nurse mobs that add.<br />
<br />
Because of the self dispell, no debuffs are needed to be used, because they will be removed by the Murkglider quickly.<br />
The AE DoT requires two casts of Blood of Nadox to remove, and has a recast time of 45seconds, so the shaman will be mainly on this duty.<br />
<br />
This is an easy, long fight. Key points are:<br />
* TM any adds and kill them. They heal the main mob (rumored, I did not observe)<br />
* Do not use any DoTs on the main mob that are not curse based. It is essentially a waste of mana because of the self debuff's strength and the amount of times it is cast.<br />
* Remove the DoT it casts fast. It is what will kill you.<br />
<br />
<br />
And now go hand in your level 69 runes :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">edit: <br />
The self debuff removes everything but curse based Dots and effects.  <br />
Added to strat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have duod'd this mob with a warrior. Took 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what kind of buffed HP/AC did the warrior have and how did you manage not to get adds...i did this with 2 groups and we always managed to get no less than 2 adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't remember his stats when we did this, but he's sitting at close to 12.5k and 2400 AC.<br />
However, I had no problem doing this with a self buffed paladin a few days later, except that it took 10 minutes to get him down to 50% and my tank went LD right when the school leader blurred himself.<br />
The Paladin, who wasn't a guild mate, must have been sitting at 12k HPs and 2350ish AC buffed.<br />
<br />
I can't disclose how to do it, but it's not exactly hard to figure out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">gonna give it a shot /shrug =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So whats the respawn time on this mob? <br />
<br />
<br />
About 36 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Giac. That could work out well if i remember to look at the right time heh. Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The AE DoT is directional, try to keep everyone behind the mob. Only when it memblurs, turns and casts DoT before MT gets aggro back should you be needing to dispell it from your party. If you have more than one group, keep Disinfecting Aura memmed as well since group cures are not TGB'able.<br />
<br />
Pull it to gnome NPC at end of ravine, safe spot for fighting.<br />
<br />
Keep someone besides MT attacking mob at ALL times (any melee class), even if it's just a pet. If the MT dies just as the mob casts the memblur on itself and there's no one there aggroing it, it will often warp to spawnpoint and start the fast health regen (as if the party wiped/zoned).</div></div><hr />
