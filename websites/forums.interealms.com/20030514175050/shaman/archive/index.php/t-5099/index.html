<br />
I have just received my strainer and a &quot;Supply Voucher&quot; from Amat luziq in the Shar Vahl library.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, shortly after I completed this part of the quest, I had one of the post-patch disconnects that seemed to be getting people today.  I did not recognize the NPC to whom I was to give this supply voucher, and didn't have a chance to write it down.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know the name and/or location of the person to whom I should give this Supply Voucher?  Amat also mentioned that I need to see Qua about some books.  Unfortunately, I can't either Amat or Qua to tell me about the voucher, and I can't seem to find this information on the web either.<br />
<br />
Any spoilers appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<br />
Thank you, but that information is either incorrect, or the quest was bugged for me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amat will give you a spear shaft and ask you to speak with Qua. &quot;<br />
<br />
Amat did NOT give me a spear shaft.  He gave me a &quot;Supply Voucher&quot;.   I must give this voucher to another NPC, who I suspect will give me the spear shaft.<br />
<br />
I did petition, but don't know if I will get a response.  Does anyone know?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
