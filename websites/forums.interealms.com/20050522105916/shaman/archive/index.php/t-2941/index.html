<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone seems to have their favourite places for 50+ but where does a 41 shaman and monk duo go for excellent exp?<br />
From 33 we have lived in solA and B almost exclusively and reaped the massive experience given plus the nice goodies that yeild from gnome punting.<br />
So far we've tried eastern waste CC DL and pretty much anything that seems to be blue on the way but nothing compares to the slowed down exp given still by kolbolds.<br />
Starting to think that gnomes /kobolds are the best it's ever going to be and it's a grind from now on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would think that the 2 of you would do just fine in Echo Caverns (regular entrance, not hidden).  I found this place at 47 last night, and was getting a yellow per hour and a half of soloing.  A 40 Warrior friend of mine from the guild was passing through and decided to group with me and the XP rate jumped up to about a yellow per 45 minutes or so.  Nothing in there that we couldn't take, even took the Taskmaster in there (Lvl 42) and one of his slave adds (high 30's).  The Taskmaster might be a tad much for the both of you, but anything else in there should be doable.  Most mobs in there range from 35-39, so a monk/shaman duo should have loads of fun and xp in there.  Not so great loot tho, Underbulk claws sell for around 3pp (also usable by monk to pull 10/15 range 150) and the Stonegrabbers drop a few pp on occasion.  The Underbulk also drop a norent bile that you can drink so no silvers wasted on water :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Fireclaw is a large underbulk that spawns occasionally in place of an Underbulk, is level 40 and can drop Fireclaw's Talons (8/26, BST/MNK, 75DD Proc) or a back slot item (can't remember stats).  Most likely you will see druids go running by you full speed with Fireclaw on them as he is unsnareable, unrootable and supposedly unstunnable, but me and my warrior saved numerous druid behinds last night.  We even had them /tell us when he was up and would pull him to us for disposal :eek:  Nothing like having a druid ask for help doing something they can't.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this zone highly, but if you're on Vallon Zek, ummmm, forget I said anything :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this dont make sense-  the regular ent is the one goin to fungus grove.  the hidden ent from shaven ha the mobs u mention above?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Fungus Grove entrance is the hidden entrance by the zone to Nexus.  The obvious zone to Echo Caverns is down the left before you get to the pool for Nexus.  The obvious entrance to Echo Caverns will take you to the Deep if you go straight thru Echo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's always bloodgills.  I still can't believe how good those were for experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Non-Luclin preferrably because he doesn't have it yet. Old world rocks too because everything there hits like a chump and has less AC than your local Enchanter. Plus it's not full of gits like Kunark. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Duoing the Kobolds is still pretty nice but we run out of spawns too easy and I don't think we've quite got what it takes to hold KPC yet (provided it's open)... leaving us stuck with the Pool Room and trash surrounds.<br />
<br />
I guess we're just in withdrawl from making up to 3 levels a day without PLing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i did DL abit w/ my monk friend...if youdont mind the punks and idiots there, its prettygood exp.<br />
<br />
Solb is still better exp though(in general, but if you get lucky in a group in DL, it can be sweeeet), stick there for awhile, until you can move up to higher dungeons.<br />
<br />
i did SOLb w/ my monk friend 36-41, currently soloing abit in DL and other places<br />
<br />
sure, the guys in DL are annoying, and mostly products of the kunark cycle, but its good exp, and easy kills anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Somewhere no one has mentioned that was great for me around that level is City of Mist.<br />
<br />
Kedge is a nice spot and is rarely occupied if you don't mind fighting underwater.<br />
<br />
You also might want to try Droga for the exp modifier there.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've just recently gone from 40 to 46, and here are a few of the places I've hunted:<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns (Velious):<br />
I'm a tradeskiller, and this place is a tradeskiller's dream (velium peices drop of miners, and crystal silk drops of spiders)<br />
<br />
Eastern Wastes (Velious):<br />
Two places I found were good to hunt here.  One was at the zone to Great Divide, where I pulled giants, animals, manticores, etc. and the other was along the ocean (kind of near the great bridge) where I hunted Ulthorks and walruses.  Ulthorks occaisionally drop tusks, and if you collect four and give them to the othmir chief in Cobalt Scar (easy to get to if you have a druid port you) you get a chance at a valuable gem such as a black saphire or blue diamond.  Also a lot of people like to do the Ry'Gorr fort here as well.<br />
<br />
Great Divide (Velious):<br />
The kodiaks here should be great for you at 41, but by 46 they've become light blue mostly for me.  You can wander around hunting shardwurms here as well, or you can set-up near the East Wastes zone or near the giant fort and hunt giants.  Exp is a little slower with giants (they have too many HP) but they give you valuable dwarf and dragon faction.<br />
<br />
Temple of Drooga (Kunark):<br />
Lots of goblins close together make this place a little hard to solo, but keep your pet buffed and gate memmed (bind nearby in Frontier Mountains) and you will be fine.  Most parts of this dungeon are filled with light blue goblins to me at 46, but some parts have clusters of dark blues, and even the light blues can give good exp because they can be killed quickly.  Beware the casters though, and always kill them first.  This zone is great for faction with chardok BTW, if you ever plan on doing those quests (http://how.to/chardok).  Also there are a few rare items that drop here, like the stone of morid which is a +30 cold and fire saves ranged slot item.<br />
<br />
Overthere:<br />
Exp in this zone at this level is slower, but still decent.  I have the best luck in southwest corner, as no dragoons path through there and I am a barbarian.<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie (Kunark): The giant camp in the north east corner is awesome.  Do this, do it often.  Good drops (forest giant loops) and good exp.  Great solo spot, but the spawns might be too slow for a duo, you will have to try it out.<br />
<br />
Dreadlands (Kunark):  Do yeti caves if they still give you exp at this level (I think they should at 41).  If not, try camping the little giant hut on the south end of wear the ice meets the desert.<br />
<br />
City of Mist (Kunark):  I hunted here for shaman epic quest peices and the Cann2 quest peice and gained about a level overall.  Just use root to seperate mobs, and stay near the entrance, and you should do fine.<br />
<br />
Nagafen's Lair (Sol B) (Antonica):  Too cramped for my tastes, but lots of fine steel drops and good exp.  Incredible exp for powerleveling if you have a 60 warrior who can run through getting 10+ kobolds per pull, but that is another story....<br />
<br />
Tenebrous Mountains (Luclin):  Grimlings, grimlings, and more grimlings.  I hear there are vampires and other mobs in this zone (I may even have killed a sonic wolf once, I can't remember) but since I am a tradeskiller, I just hunt the grimlings for acrylia.<br />
<br />
Hollowshade Moor:  Same thing as above, except with a bank and a merchant.  I bound myslef in the mini-town, then alternated between the two zones depending on which one was more heavily camped already.<br />
<br />
That's all I can remember at the moment.  As you can see, I like to travel (and having druid friends helps with this a lot), but even if you don't there are probably several good hunting spots on whatever continent you are on.  Good luck, and happy hunting.</div></div><hr />
