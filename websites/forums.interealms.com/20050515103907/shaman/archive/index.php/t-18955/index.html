<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There's a 25 to 1 ratio on average of lurkers to posters. Just wanted to get an opinion poll going on how much people are affected by fear of flames when posting a new thread. Sorry for deleting earlier thread... there was an error getting poll options up =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you make intelligent posts, you have nothing to worry about.  If you make stupid posts, then, well, may God have mercy on your soul, because I certainly won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And the idiot post of the week award goes to. ENARCHEOS!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">New faces arguing old concepts.<br />
<br />
I've read &quot;SLAP IN THE FACE!&quot; threads since the Kunark days.  Don't assume that we never argued before you came along.<br />
<br />
Be clear, research, don't flame, don't look for flames in the words of others, and don't expect all shaman to play the same EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have alot of questions since I played EQ about 3 years ago, then quit. Now I'm back, and they changed EVERYTHING! So, when I find something that I couldn't figure out, A. Ask the guild, B. Ask ooc in PoK(like i would accually get results  :rolleyes: ), then come here. Haven't gotten flamed on any of the thread I've posted yet, and hope I never do. Maybe it's because I try to be polite and clear and what-not.<br />
<br />
PS. noob  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've read &quot;SLAP IN THE FACE!&quot; threads since the Kunark days.<br />
<br />
And no matter how many times I see it, it still strikes me as one of the stupidest phrases ever invented.  I just get this image of a hobbit going around slapping random shaman.  Hilarity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everytime I post, I get a strange feeling of intense fear. I can't sleep well. I have spasms in my muscles. I have a bad headache, too much stress I guess. I have this intense phobia if people are going to flame me, especially that I am shielded by 110% internet anonymity. <br />
<br />
So to answer short, yes I am very afraid of being flamed, infact I was thinking about a few times of ending my own life because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No choice for boxer-briefs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I remember about a year ago moderators were really strict.  Then many complained and they slowed down with the deleting and moving of posts.  Ive seen alot of posts this week that should have just been instantly sent to The Grey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry. Henora has stepped down as moderator and I had a ton of real life trauma last week that kept me off line.<br />
<br />
PS Locking this thread. Dial back the drama, please.</div></div><hr />
