<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Levels 1 through 10 are usually going to be spent in your Race's newbie yard.  The newbie yard is just a wide open area where a ton of level 1-5 mobs roam.  Most of the time these monsters are not social, meaning they will not gang up on you.  Sometimes there are a few types that will so be careful running out into the open attacking anything in sight.  Remember it's always important to Con, or consider (hit C while it's targeted) before attacking.  From levels 1 - 10 you want to attack anything that is Dark blue, White, or Yellow.  The colors refer to the color of the message when you consider the monster.  Since you start out with no gear, Yellow might be alittle hard at first so be careful.  Although dying has little consequences at these levels it's a good idea to go ahead and form good playing habits and try your best to manage your life and judge your abilities and skills.  There is also normally a set of guards available somewhere in the general area to run to if you have problems or end up with alittle too much to handle. Just be careful as guard's can get a bit trigger happy and steal your kills if you fight to close to them.<br />
<br />
Offering advice on where to hunt for your first 10 levels is really just preference.  Although the newbie yard you start in should be the obvious choice, some people have other favorite spots elsewhere.  I personally prefer steamfont, because it has a set of 4 kobold tents which are amazing experience for that level and it also offers you your first &quot;camp&quot; if you are brand new to the game.  Learning to single pull and manage agro from static spawn spots is important for later levels.  They also drop bags most of the time, which once again if you are brand new to the game they come in handy.<br />
<br />
So I guess ultimately your choice of where to hunt from levels 1 through 10 is going to be based on if you are a vetern to the game or a true new comer.  True new comers will be happy in basic newbie yards since they have little equipment and frankly are not sure where else to go.  Veterns will tend to immediately leave the newbie area in search of harder places since their gear and beneficial buffs from friends or bots (bots are additional accounts a person owns which they run side by side with their current account - basically controlling two characters at once) will provide a boost.  New comers need to learn while veterns want to get through the first 10 levels as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
So if you are truely a new comer and you are visiting this site looking for advice, do not be wary that there are so few posts in this section.  Levels 1 through 10 are your learning levels and often travel is restricted if you are unfamiliar with the layout of the world and the normal travel patterns.  Hang in there! Once you get past level 10 the game changes quite a bit. :)</div></div><hr />
