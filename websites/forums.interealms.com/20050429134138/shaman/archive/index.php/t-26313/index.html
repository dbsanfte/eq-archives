<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The upgrades this patch are pretty brutal.  I'm afraid it is the straw that will break the proverbial camel's back.  The upgrade to tremor totem just devastates any hope a priest or warlock has at defeating us.  That leaves no classes except possibly a rogue (maybe druid after patch, haven't fought any yet, just seen some duels) that has even a decent chance at beating us 1v1.  Even the rogue can be easily defeated if hes missing some of his cooldowns, preparation and sprint notably.   Honestly I hope this gets fixed because it's not too fun anymore when I'm guarantueed a victory unless I'm outnumbered.<br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
Fixes should include IMO:<br />
Cooldown to tremor totem<br />
Cooldown to purge, increase mana<br />
Decrease frost shock duration to 3 seconds.  Decrease damage by 100 on highest ranked FS.<br />
Put in rez sickness at 3-5 minutes.  This is needed to balance PvP deaths but still makes it useful to use for instance wipes.<br />
Lesser Healing Wave mana use should be increased.  It doesn't make sense that it is just as efficient to cast as Healing Wave.  I should pay something to have a faster cast heal.</div></div><hr />

I think things are fine as is. I still lose my share of duels in pvp and I consider myself average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are tradeoffs and the idea is that the game is balanced for group pvp, not 1 on 1. Toss down Tremor and you lose binding - plus you have to wait for it to pulse which means you can be feared out of range of it (happened to me today). <br />
<br />
Ressurection brings you back with very little health and mana, basically guarenteeing you are going to get stomped if you pop back into the middle of a battle. <br />
<br />
Lesser healing wave - it's a much smaller heal. I use it for emergencys but for main healing I just make sure to time healing wave. <br />
<br />
Purge - maybe. I use it but it doesn't seem to be all that. <br />
<br />
Frost Shock - Eh, it's seems like this is overblown. Yea the snare is evil but there are ways around it.<br />
<br />
My shaman just hit 36 so take what I say with a grain of salt. I'm also full restoration right now so I might be experiencing the pure joy/abuse that is an elemental spec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pulse frequency was increased dramatically in the patch from the previous 5 seconds as well as the effect range.  Losing grounding totem isn't a big deal with frost shock.  <br />
<br />
Ressurection gives you 20% mana/health, plenty of mana to heal to full.  Weapon buffs like windfury do not go away after death.<br />
<br />
Lesser healing wave heals just as much as hp/second as healing wave for the same cost ratio, and is nearly uninteruptable with restoration talents.  It is also just as good as the best priest flash heal (better if priest is shadow spec'd)<br />
<br />
Purge is all that, it negates like 50% of paladin dps, all healing over time from druids and priests, all caster shields (besides one pally shield), and before this patch, all potions.<br />
<br />
Yes this game isn't totally balanced for 1v1, but everyone keeps saying its a rock/paper/scissors model  .  Well there isn't even one class now that can expect to defeat an equally skilled shaman in an even match, and some have absolutely no shot, ie Hunter/Mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I guess I just suck I get smoked all the time. But then again I don't duel I go in for all out battles. However a warrior was getting damn close to killing me when we were 1 on 1. Luckily I delayed him enough for another warrior on my side to jump in and help me kill him or I might have lost. Maybe you are just so damn good at pvp cause I appear to be missing the I win button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Someone has to be the top class....in EQ shaman were then people like u and the &quot;&quot;nerf shaman&quot; crowd went crazy and turned it into a crusade to get shaman nerfed... see slow mitigation if u dont know what im talking about...<br />
<br />
Then Bards went up to no 1 class...and stayed there for a good bit until every EQ patch screwed up their songs...and they couldnt do half of the stuff they were supposed to be able to do till the next patch... and then that patch messed up the other half that wasnt messed up with the first patch!!<br />
<br />
The point is... someone has to be best in 1v1 PVP if its the shaman.. **** and enjoy it ok? We will be nerfed soon enough with out you begging for it...and to do it on shaman boards..... class act there dude....<br />
<br />
Some people cant enjoy success....10 bucks says when they do nerf us into the black hole you'll be the first one on these boards bitching and whining about how bad we suck now....<br />
<br />
Classic...<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can almost always beat shaman in duels, and they know I am coming, crippling poison, pop AR and BF and kill them dead, pretty straight forward, don't let them have distance. Most people die to shaman for the same reason as any other class, they don't have enough hps.<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I understand all your points Walrus, it's just that it sounds like you are describing dueling more than group pvp. Yea I could use purge to dispell HoTs and such, but more likely than not I'm trying to heal my group, chase down runners etc.<br />
<br />
I do agree Shaman are one of the top PvP classes, but like Mill I've rarely ever lost to one in a duel, and never to one who was lower level. <br />
<br />
Do you play on a pvp server, or is this just taken from your experiences dueling?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Umm .. what the hell? You're a shaman and you are saying your class is overpowered on a shaman boardd ... rofl thats a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm just tired of all the posts by other classes saying why we are overpowered, and then no longer be able to argue we aren't.  I mean seriously,  did tremor totem really need to be increased to 30 range!!!!  It's not like we were being dominated by priests and warlocks before the patch.  Did reincarnation really need to lose its rez sickness outside of dungeons?  <br />
<br />
Think about what other classes need to do to beat us, its pretty ridiculous to expect absolute perfection from our opponents to beat us when most of the time all we need to do is spam frost shock and pound them with windfury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Killed my arch nemesis matchup yesterday, a rogue who popped Will of the Forsaken. Seduced him and blasted with my Gnomish Death Ray, then Death Coil and Shadowburn and he got schooled :D<br />
<br />
As a warlock, we can still beat shamans after the patch but it's much tougher, Basically need to have the felhunter out. Soul link helps tremendously but Demonology spec is so gimped in PVE that unless you're on a pvp server it's not really worth it. Pet should be on totem killing duty. If I spell lock a heal, I get a window of opportunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually, I beg to differ with regards to demonolgy spec being terrible in PvE. Pets become surprisingly much more effective when you get improved torment for voidwalker (holds agro like a charm), and the imp can become a seriously powerful nuker. Improved hps and mana pool makes a noticeable difference to them as well.  With a reasonable investment of points, you can make a real difference to your playstyle.<br />
<br />
Improved imps rock in groups, voidwalker can totally change the way you solo, as he can hold agro over mutliple dot stacking, as opposed to being useless after the second dot goes on.  He still sucks for DPS, don't get me wrong, but you might be surprised at how well he both tanks and holds agro.<br />
<br />
Haven't played much with succubus or Felhunter since respeccing (warlock not a main, and I've been concentrating on sharing the love around my other characters) but it might be worth dropping the 1g to respec and try it out.  The only thing is that you do become a bit more dependant on your pet, although, frankly, the affliction and destruction trees never appealed to me that much short of the instant corruption and a couple others.<br />
<br />
I don't know how well it stacks up at the higher levels, but as a 41 warlock it's pretty potent imo. If you're only using the official forums for warlocks, you might find some posting with more information and less whine at The Warlocks Den (http://www.warlocksden.wowmb.net) on how demon spec stacks up.<br />
<br />
/derail off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's obvious to me that nobody who's posted here has ever played in high end raiding content such as Molten Core or Onyxia. Fear effects are common in these instances. Alliance have a fear ward. The buff to tremor totem absolutely had to be done because the difficulty scaling of PVE encounters was completely off for alliance and horde raids.<br />
<br />
I play a shaman and I will openly admit in 1v1 pvp we decimate any other class at equal or lesser level unless they are exceptionally skillful or the shaman is exceptionally skilless. That being said, 1v1 pvp means absolutely nothing. Once battlegrounds is released, shaman will become one of the most worthless pvp classes, because the only type of PVP encounters will be in groups larger than 10. In a mass warfare pvp encounter shaman have no tools at their disposal for AOE damage, no AOE anti caster abilities like fear or silence.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Overpoweredness&quot; of the shaman class will dissapear with the release of battlegrounds, where mages with improved blizzard and priests spamming psychic scream will always prevail. A snaring frost shock is brutally effective at catching you off guard and snaring you so there is no escape, but is absolutely worthless against a 10 man raid group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Improved imps rock in groups, voidwalker can totally change the way you solo, as he can hold agro over mutliple dot stacking, as opposed to being useless after the second dot goes on.<br />
I've grouped with Demo specced warlocks, and the voidwalker seemed just as crappy. I use the Felhunter or Succubus soloing because they actually do DPS AND have utility, instead of a big blob that hits for 15 damage and can't hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Sure, Demonology has maybe 3 good talents. Improved imp, demonic embrace, and Soul Link. The rest is crap. Soul link takes 31 points in Demonology, and while it's a great skill, you wind up with a bunch of worthless talents working your way up to there.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and what people are saying about mass PVP is 100% right. Most shamans I've seen are Tauren or Trolls, which stick out like a sore thumb. They'll be killed first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sad to hear a shaman asking for a nerf to his own class. You know this place in the sun is temporary, for what it's worth anyway with pvp being rewardless atm.<br />
<br />
That said i don't agree shamans will be worthless in BG.<br />
<br />

<br />
Shaman have some good anti-caster tools, tremor can negate the worst of fear, shocks to interrupt spells, grounding to take away sheep. Also, resistances will play a much bigger role in PVP than they do now -- shaman have some totems that can help there. <br />
<br />
But, we will see what roles/strats develop. I'm expecting i'll be next to my warrior mate on the frontline assist train, keeping him alive, adding dps, and making sure no one gets away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Problem is, if a few people focus on a shaman, they are dead in seconds, and that is why they are not overpowered, if a full group focuses on a paladin, the paladin will last a long long time.<br />
<br />
Couple rogues will waste a shaman in seconds, seen it happen all the time.<br />
