<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On the guild summit forums, there was a complaint about the difficulty zoning into KT. <br />
<br />
Prathun responded:<br />
<br />
&quot;The switch in Natimbi was partially occluded by one of the nearby rocks, which made it hard to click on. This is now fixed on Test.  I moved it slightly and can click anywhere on the obelisk to be teleported to Kodtaz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you, Prathun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear that ... it took me 10 minutes once to zone into Water. I about gave up, lol.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, well KT zone in is nice, but like they said, its PoW that annoys me and I end up almost giving up everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The 20k falling deaths that occurred upon entering KT from Natimbi were perfectly normal though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For me, clicking on the little graphic design in the middle of the 3 that face the floating dragon always works pretty good for zoning to water.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, until the dragon's wings start smacking you in the face, physically moving you from where you were standing and giving you the &quot;you can't reach that from here&quot; message to rub it in. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I click on the water zone while I alternate moving forward and backward ie. step toward/step backward.<br />
 I can't recall waiting more than 10 seconds doing it this way, and normally its only 2 or 3 clicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BurgBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">how about a fix for the 20k deaths from afk people in KT~.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I stand directly under the drake at POW ent and click near the bottom of the fountain thingy and I get in pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that PoFire is easier to zone OUT of now, unless it's just my imagination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you normally only get the &quot;cannot reach that&quot;-message when you stand too close to the trigger. <br />
best look on the pool in the direction poe-zone lies (so look west), go one step back and you should be able to zonein without any problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My issues with the water zone in stopped once I realized that you can't be standing in the water of the &quot;fountain&quot;.<br />
<br />
just stand on the rocks around it and click on the &quot;bowl&quot;.<br />
<br />
What has been annoying me is the new auto duck when you run into the side of a cave or something. I can't tell you how many times I've not been able to cast spells because I got too close to the wall in a Ruj dungeon.<br />
<br />
And the no reason spell interupts.<br />
<br />
Those are my least favorate additions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">there's a way to turn off that autoduck I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hit &quot;u&quot; on your keyboard and it should act as a mouse click, but does it better ;)<br />
<br />
At least it used to open doors and to make me zone through books.</div></div><hr />
