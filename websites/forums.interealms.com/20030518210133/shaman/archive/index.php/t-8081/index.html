<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there is a bunch of topics for soloing and such but I have a couple questions.<br />
<br />
1) Can I handle the Katta Guards(the ones that give good katta faction) at level 51. My ac self buffed is 1050, hp 2K, wis is 252, and i have a JBB. If you need to see my profile it is in my sig. Also I usually have a KEI.<br />
<br />
2) If not can I duo them at 51 with a 51 monk?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

2) yes<br />
<br />
Duo is faster, don't need to stop at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's a sick twink toxox, and I despise you for it.<br />
<br />
=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol, well seeing how I play on FV and we have only one character per account its not a twink. This is the only character I have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been playing since '01, am level 54, and don't even come close to the stuff you have<br />
Friend of mine on Firiona Vie has been playing since the server popped up, level 53 Paladin, and she doesn't even scratch what I have...<br />
<br />
So, mind sharing with us how the bloody heck you got all that stuff? Related to the guildleader of FV's head guild, perchance? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, lets see.<br />
<br />
First you have to understand FV's special rules. Mainly TLC and no No Drop items.<br />
<br />
TLC means that if a mob is green to you or anyone in your party it will not drop any lore or magic items. So that means no farming of stuff green to you.<br />
<br />
The no No Drop means that you can buy any gear except epic related items. (you still can buy jade reavers, pegasus cloak, and such.)<br />
<br />
FV is a younger server. So we dont have people in Vex Thal or doing the top planes yet. Which means that other stuff is hit often by the top guilds and they can sell all the drops if they wanted. But that doesnt happen often. <br />
<br />
Mainly what I did was when I first started I ran a little business. LOL, I had about 20 folks under level 20 collecting silks, pelts, skins, etc for me. I then would sell in bulk to high level trade skillers. Thats how I made pp. <br />
<br />
It takes time but if you are creative you can earn lots of pp. <br />

I'm stationed at the Air Base, and if you have the time sometime, I would love to talk Shaman stuff with you.  Look up my profile if you would like to talk sometime<br />
