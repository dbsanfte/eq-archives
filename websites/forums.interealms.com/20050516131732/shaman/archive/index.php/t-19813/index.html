<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pestario</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I created a second account to level up a Shaman, I am completley new to the Shaman class. The Shaman will eventully duo with my 55 Necro, heard this is a great combo.<br />
<br />
Anyway while leveling up my Shaman the right way I created a second character(Bezerker) to level up with the Shaman. Im still under level 10 at this point, what would be leveling recommendations for such a duo? I'd imagine Kurns is good to 15ish, Paudal to low twenties. Where to go from there? I'm sure there will be better leveling places with this duo then there was when I was soloing my Necro.<br />
<br />
Also I'm at a complete loss as to what gear is good to get for a Shaman, I did do the Antique ring and corset quests for Spell haste 2 and mana pres 2. Also almost completed a solstice erring kit, stats will suck tillthe 40s but flowing thought is awlays nice.<br />
<br />
Advice is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

After that, go on to SolB until (you guessed it) the exp gets bad.  After that City of Mist until the exp gets bad, at which point you'll be level 55.</div></div><hr />
