<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1"># = Number of AA's have changed<br />
(#) = Difference<br />
<br />
Swift Journey - 5<br />
Convalescence - 3<br />
Lasting Breath - 2<br />
Packrat - 3<br />
Secondary Forte - 9 (6)<br />
Persistent Casting - 3<br />
Pet Afinity - 12 (8)<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety - 3<br />
Quickened Curing - 3 (2)<br />
Critical Affliction - 3 (2)<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery - 3 (1)<br />
Advanced Spirit Call - 5<br />
Call of the Ancients - 5 +2****<br />
<br />
I think I got all the differences right - the new numbers are from a SS so pretty sure they are right! I compared to Samanna's AA page! (http://samanna.net/general/aas.shtml)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So it sounds like Critical Affliction got changed to a 3/6/9 instead of a 5/10/15 and we willl be getting a 12 AA refund for having bought rank 3 of this.<br />
<br />
I hope this is the case.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone got an estimate of how many AA will be refunded with all of the above?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A quick calculation resulted in a 64 AA refund for me with all of the GoD AA's. It might not be perfectly accurate, though. Let's see:<br />
<br />
SF: 6<br />
PA: 8<br />
QC: 12 (3/6/9 instead of 5/10/15)<br />
CA: 12 see above<br />
FoMM: 6 (3/6/9 instead of 4/8/12)<br />
CotA: 20(?) (assuming it's 5/5/5/5/5 instead of 3/6/9/12/15)<br />
<br />
There you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WOW and I have zero of any of those! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm getting around 5 back, go me! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm.  I think I'm getting 44 refunded AAs. :p<br />
<br />
Only one I hadn't finished was CoTA!<br />
<br />
If pressed, I SUPPOSE I can manage to find a way to spend them on OoW skills.  Oh, the effort!  :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Too bad there's an unspent AA cap of 30.  HAHAHAHAHAH.  /cry</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good thing refunded AA's can push over top of the 30 cap.  You can't grind past 30, but you won't lose any if they're gained on a refund.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And they removed the whole, you lose them if you zone. Refunded AA's can be over the capped 30 banked AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Delphinae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Any word on the AA cost progression for Spell Casting Subtlety for priests? (was 3/6/9)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No change, 3/6/9 is in line with current OoW AA costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pet affinity is still at least 7 AA's too high give or take. Then I think it should still be a basic ability that all group spells hit pets no matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Pet affinity is still at least 7 AA's too high give or take. Then I think it should still be a basic ability that all group spells hit pets no matter what.<br />
<br />
NO KIDDING!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it is priced for &quot;pet classes&quot; (mages, necros, and BLs).  Their pet is practically an extension of them, and so they (at least the ones I know) are happy to pay whatever price to let their extension get group buffs.  But for us, the AA is certainly overpriced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just out of curiousity anyone know what would happen if you were capped at 30 AAs when the patch with the refund were to go live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just out of curiousity anyone know what would happen if you were capped at 30 AAs when the patch with the refund were to go live?<br />
<br />
You would still get whatever amount of AAs you get back as a result, being it 1 or 50.  Like what was said, you just won't be able to earn anymore from that point on until you get below 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hehe I'm going to have like 80 in reserve on monk and shaman when this goes in hehe can't wait.<br />
<br />
Next patch isn't till december though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wow, I get a whole 2 back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow you didnt buy to many GOD aa's then! Its funny how people think this recalculation of AA's is going to some how make AA's magically appear when they didnt put the work into them in the first place. I should end up with 20 or so.<br />

No one even Implied that... you dont need to be so rude!<br />

Wow, give this man an award for being able to deduce the obvious.  No **** I didn't buy many of the GoD AA's.  For the most part they were over priced pieces of **** for AA choices.  No where did I say that I should be getting back a bunch more and how its unfair. <br />
<br />
Between working a full time job with overtime every week, being part of the top raiding guild on my server, and being the owner of a new home that I live in by myself (meaning I get to fix and redo everything by myself as well), I have little time to work on AA.  So the AA I do get I spend wisely.  GoD AA were not something worth spending points on for me.  The fact that I get 2 back is something I wasn't expecting and a nice bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh sorry! <br />
<br />
My bad. Now get cracking on those AA's.<br />
