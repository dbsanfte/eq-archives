<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taradoni</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a friend in my guild that is a ranger as well. He is spending countless hours and plat on Raising his strength to 200 and ignoring Dex, Sta, and casting skill. What would the Rangers of the glade suggest to this Ranger as he will not listen to me at all, and laughs when I tell him he needs to raise Dex and Sta for melee and archery. his arguement is that STR makes him hit harder, hence doing more DPS - I try to tell him Dex is what causes you to hit and level and weapon damage increses weapons output. From all the parsing info I have read Rangers should concentrate on Dex,Sta, and int or wis - what ever makes Rangers no FIZZLE. Please be brutally honest as all post are going on our guild website. Thanks for everyones time and attention in this matter, to help resolve this arguement... <br />

<br />
not everyone on the other side of your keyboard is created equal and most have differant agendas or avenues of enjoyment out of a game.. <br />
<br />
it's not going to make him soo damn unplayable that he will not be effective..  not all are Uber.. and really Most have no need to be.. <br />
<br />
/shrug.. <br />

thanks for your concern   and Good luck  some people you can't beat any sense into..   even those Pushy types always inspecting you and waveing their 'perfect' uber ideal (to them) gear and opinions around.<br />
<br />
<br />
this of course is all just &quot;my' opinion..   /shrug. <br />

ohh to be 17 again  when the luck of a proc from my PGt would make it all right..</div></div><hr />

If it is &lt;100, fatigue will affect your melee stats.  STA is important for increasing your total HP total, although not as important as pure HP items.  HP are important for raids against monsters with AE attacks, e.g., Temple of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
DEX affects Archery damage output.  However, it doesn't affect melee damage output except to increase marginally the percent chance for procs on your weapons and Call of... proc buffs.<br />
<br />
WIS is the stat that affects a ranger's mana pool and fizzle rates.</div></div><hr />

His arguments are true to a degree but gaining str will more or less get automatic even if u dont look after str items at later lvls. While sta and dex is harder to get.<br />
<br />
I've never seen a parse that proves dex helps in melee hits even tho many tend to belive this if u know where I could get a look at parses concerning dex and melee pls post em or links.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strenght may be nice and all, but I have 190 STR unbuffed (or 220 with epics) without even trying. Strength is the easiest stat to raise alongside AC without even trying.<br />
<br />
Also long as he is raising in AC and HP along with his STR, he should be ok. Loosing AC and HP for STR isn't a good thing, but you really can't tell people how to play their character. Especially when they do not want to listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elwin</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I disagree with boosting Str to the neglect of all else, but Dex does not improve your chance to hit with a melee weapon. Chance to hit is based on your Level, your skill in the weapon you are using, raw ATK buffs, and your target's level and avoidance AC.<br />
<br />
Dex helps raise skills in melee skills and archery, but that's not incredibly useful. Dex does help proc rate, crit rate, and archery damage, but if you're not using archery, a procing weapon, and don't crit, it's dormant, i.e. does absolutely nothing. Again, Dex does not improve chance to hit with a melee weapon. Dex is not much use to a Ranger until you get Call of Sky or get a procing weapon (in fact, before then, it's nearly useless), then it moves up a notch, then it gains a little more respect when you get Jolting Blades. When you get crits, it's again a little more useful. By the time you get Archery Mastery 3 and Endless Quiver, Dex is probably the most important attribute, but that's a long ways off. On the whole though, until/unless you get Archery Mastery 3 and Endless Quiver, you should not be overly concerned about Dex.<br />
<br />
Str does boost your DPS... but not much. Its effect is very small. Boosting Str to the neglect of all other stats is not very wise considering it doesn't really increase DPS much. From what I hear, and I tend to agree, Str is so easy to get most Rangers don't even worry about it and just let it come naturally. I'm at 199 Str self-buffed and I didn't even try.<br />
<br />
Getting to 100 Sta is a milestone. Never worry about the yellow bar again, unless you're jumping. More Sta is nice, more HPs are always needed. There's not much to say about the Stat.. the effects of it are obvious and not open to much debate.<br />
<br />
Int is pointless for a Ranger. Doesn't help fizzle rate, doesn't help our mana pool. It's less useful than Cha for us.<br />
<br />
Wisdom is proven to decrease our fizzle rate and gives us more mana. Mana is very important for us, and if anyone tells you differently, they do not play their Ranger to max potential.<br />
<br />
I hope this cleared things up for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evenshadow</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">....do what he wants.  Its his game.  When  you both start doing AE mobs (if you arent already), or tanking seriously, he will be wondering why he dies so much more.  Then you can laugh, and look smug.<br />
   <br />
 Maybe then he will realize strength shouldn't be his main thrust. LOL it comes anyway, melee gear is built that way.<br />
<br />
    Surprisingly, and despite lots of information to the contrary, there are still lots of &quot;prom queens&quot; out there.  People who wear stat jewelry over AC/hps.   <br />
<br />
It stems from when the game started, and none of us knew what we were doing: people are slow to change, and bad information develops a life of its own.  Its been trial and error, and the process continues...its kinda like evolution:adapt or die.<br />
<br />
Hell, I know a 54 ranger who doesn't realize theres a spell called &quot;jolt&quot; and has an AC around 600, if that, but who just LOVES to pull agro.  He wonders why he dies so often too...<br />
<br />
You can only give so many broad hints, before there arises a burning need to call a person an idiot.  In game, I prefer to keep my trap shut:)<br />

<br />
So many people are hung up on the right class, the right gear and the right starting stats. If he wants to go for STR why stop him. He's paying to play the game let him do whatever the hell he wants.<br />
<br />
And you could try saving the &quot;Major Help Needed&quot; and 3 exclamation marks for something that's actually important. Wouldn't want to be the Ranger who cried wolf now ;)</div></div><hr />

What the heck, if he's having fun, and getting the effect he wants, let him do it. Some Rangers don't us their spells very often, so the fizzle-ness isn't important. Besides, it's only gear, it can be switched out easily if he changes his mind. Let him experiment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JWHIT5402</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sta is 5 hps per 1 point of sta (4.6 actually), why in the hell wouldnt you want to raise it if you can?<br />
<br />
Dex helps archery damage, i have proven this to myself with TS disc mayne times, just do a TS session unbuffed then with shammy buffs, and then you tell  me.<br />
<br />
Str is nice it helps you carry alot of stuff, and do some exrta damage but its not the stat i chase, str will come naturally. <br />
<br />
Agi is key to rangers in the fact of avoiding hits and riptose, again do the non buff to shammy buffs comparsion, even a blind guy can see the difference.<br />
<br />
Wis is nice but not a concern, are spells are buffs, we dont have any power with them, cast your buffs on yourself and use snare thats all the mana you need. Having 200 wis on a ranger is pointless, with a 300hps nuke, it would take you 3 days to kill a mob with our spells, and our good spells are pretty mana cheap considering our mana pool.<br />
<br />
 Everyone knows AC is what your after, but dont forget to look at other things. My goal is to break 1000 ac and all support stats over 150, agi dex and sta. Not sure if its possible but i can try.<br />
<br />
Also one last thing, i went out and decided to raise my sta up since it was under 100, so i got it up to 135 now. I can tell a huge difference, i can take more damage, and inturn use less mana to heal myself. I added 40 sta points overall, so basically i added a 140 hps, and some of the items had straight hps. Total about 300 and i wouldnt sacrifice them now for no other stat other than maybe agi.<br />
<br />
If you think sta doesnt mean anything to a melee go ask some warriors, and they will let you know. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fogel</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is going to seem weird but I am agreeing with your guildmate 100%.<br />
<br />
IF and only if, your guildmate does nothing else but exp, which I have an idea that your friend is below level 50, correct me if I am wrong.<br />
<br />
At that level, resists, hp, ac, ect matter less to a group then the amount of damage you do, but I would suggest to him to focus some on ac/hp too in the case that he may have to tank. Sta wis dex ect are not as useful until you get higher levels, or you have wis for fear kiting.<br />
<br />
When he does get the levels he will quickly find out that stength is on like every piece of his gear in amounts of 10+, along with dex, wis and resists.... But before he reaches that point he will have to focus on hp/resists even to raid those places.<br />
<br />
Your guildmate has the best idea for the pre raiding/non tanking game... do as much damage as he can... this still rings true at the raiding game but its less important then staying alive, not costing your healers mana... ect.<br />
<br />
It is good that damage in the form of atk from str and the mod it does to damage comes with the gear that allows you to last longer in raids. But as I said earlier to reach that point he will have to sacrafice alot of his stength for resists and hp.<br />
<br />
Then if he becomes a am3er he will have to go dex.<br />
<br />
All in all it doesnt' matter too much. stats only make a slight difference. Ratio's are better then str, hp's are better then sta, ac better then agi, you get my point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things to remember is that gear can be changed out.  To simulate ultimate str versus ultimate dex gear stats run some tests.  Get a high level shammie to dedicate an evening to this.  Buff his strength only, up to 255 if possible, turn the log on, fight 20 mobs.  Let the strength buffs go.  Get the shammie to buff his dex up as high as possible, repeat the test.  Log off, parse the results, check the differences.  Then, post the results.<br />
<br />
A real test would be more like 100 fights of the same level mobs, identical gear with different buffs, but lets be practical.<br />
<br />
I think your position will be vindicated.  Its been my experience that the higher dex gives you more hits per fight which more than makes up for the miniscule difference the extra strength gives in making the hits.  <br />
<br />
I could be wrong, wouldn't be the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmace</div><div class="date">06-20-2002, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone knows AC is what your after<br />
<br />
Not everyone.  I don't give a rip about AC :)<br />
<br />
Let him do what he wants.  But i'll give you my take for what it's worth.<br />
<br />
Once STA is &gt;= 100, STR is the next most useful stat to raise.  It raises ATTK, which is IMO the most important stat.  Closely tied with STR is STA, as more hitpoints &gt; more AC.<br />
<br />
Someone once posted that the difference in archery crits from 75 DEX to 255 DEX was like 0.75%.  So I'm not of the mind that DEX is all that crucial.  I do keep mine up, but not at the expense of STR or HPs.<br />
<br />
The old principle is usually right:<br />
<br />
ATTK &gt; HP &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">06-20-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">200 huh? wow, thats pretty good, 55 here and mine goes between 160-170  self buffed depending on weapons, etc.<br />
I agree on letting him play his way. To each his own. I would be interested in a curious sort of way to see what the rest of his stats are, including AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">06-20-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The +ATK you get from strength is of a different 'kind' than the +ATK you get from things like Swifty, CoP, etc, and last I knew had been fairly well shown to be pretty uneffective. There used to be a bunch of threads on this subject over on the shaman's crucible if I recall. <br />
The sad truth is, that in this game melee stats don't really matter too much. HP,resists,regen and inventory AC are FAR FAR more important than any melee stats. The only reason that STA stands out is because there is a penalty with a sharp ( and totally unrealistic ) cutoff at 100, and because it directly impacts HP. Yes, I know, high stats will affect certain things, but its only a marginal difference at best. The swing in damage done between 100 str and 255 str is there, but it isnt huge. The swing in proccing between 100 dex and 255 dex is there, but not huge.<br />
/shrug, I am probably wrong but thats my impression at the moment.</div></div><hr />
