<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been pl a monk I was going to 2 box with, been trying different places. My monk's acount is basic eq, no expansions(I'm waiting for eq evolution). So getting my monk close to a bindable place is important. I was going to paw for awhile.. but too many times I had noobs tryin to fear kite.. ???<br />
So I went to JPF, killen those baslik guys, I like it... fast static spawns exp is ok, there stun spell is annoying. It is outdoors so I can use horse and all that good stuff, I think they are non social too so no adds, unless the aggresive ones pop up near you. Does anyone else know of any other good places? I haven't tried stonebrunt yet, lookin mainly for lots of mobs to kill that's fairly close to a bindable spot. Other places like rath and hhk aren't really on my list because I don't feel like fighting for spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, don't know exactly what level you are but Split Paw is good both in-side and out (not sure when it starts to petter out on experience though).  Upper or Lower Guk in the later 30's early 40's (assuming your Monk is between 30 and 40).  Sol A, Rath Mts, and a few others come to mind.<br />
