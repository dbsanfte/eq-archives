<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a few ideas i was thinking up, nothing that i researched on whether or not its powerful, weak useless, stupid, etc...just ideas.<br />
<br />
While there are Class AAexp values why not some that are more racially attuned.  When relating this to Shaman I'm thinking of Slam.  Give a percentage increase to the amount Slam will land on a mob. Being a good slammer may help in a few occasions at higher levels ex. Complete Healing mobs.<br />
Set it up on a point system ex. 10%, 25% 35%.<br />
<br />
Shaman spell - Group Bearform./Group Greater bearform.<br />
<br />
Size issues of bearform shouldn't be a factor of debate cause indoors we can shrink and outside size doesn't matter.  <br />
<br />
Allow our AC line to be stackable on all things.  Keep it at the same number levels but if even a paladin is around we can't stick an AC buff.  I know we have other buffs in our arsenal and its up to clerics for the true AC buff power, but i seem to use my AC buff about as much as I use Cure Blindness.<br />
<br />
Don't know if it exists, but there should be a Shaman gate potion to Kitty City.  It exists for all other races of shaman, and having a new portal up to Luclin is always welcome.  <br />
Furthermore I wouldn't mind the cost of creation of Porting potions being dropped drastically, making shaman in a way, a 3rd porting class to the 5 zones.  Would make the goal of reaching high end alchemy all the more appealing. <br />
<br />
Change the Scion System, make it so that you ask them for the key, they give it to you and then you click on an obelisk, or the spire itself to activate it (ex. entrance to seb key) and than get ported up, eliminates the whole waiting aspect to get up there.  Make it the same going down.  <br />
<br />
Add to the tribunal symbol quest, i mean a hammer of wraith is nice at level 3, hook us up to near as nicely as the trolls get off. <br />
<br />
I'll prolly think up more, but that seems good enough to get yelled at for now.  Feel free to post why my ideas suck, or some ideas of your own =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Increased chance of slam? I would never waste a point on it tho. Plus I don't want the Verant Employees to use some of their precious time to add that. Last patch they even nerfed the 2 points regen for every aa point spent by Iksars and Trolls. (Makes my choice of Ogre seem even better:))<br />
<br />
A group of bears? Why not. I like the idea of illusions on others. If only chanters could have casted Illusion: Dark Elf  on me (Would make me happy)<br />
<br />
AC buff stackable? Bah I don't want more buffs to have to recast all the time... If they could only make all good shammy buffs into one major buff like Aegolism is for clerics :)<br />
<br />
Focus + Regrowth + Stamina + Agility all into one great group buff that lasted one hour would really rock. But to prevent it from being too useful it should cost like 2000mana and not be stackable with Rage line, stats and regen line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd love it if they changed the Scion system- but that downtime is planned.  It would have been just as easy for ports to happen every 5 minutes (instead of 15), or two minutes, or 30 seconds - they want you to have to wait for a port.<br />
<br />
/rude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup<br />
<br />
More time online sitting about doing nothing (awaiting ports, camping items, etc..) is more cash in their pockets...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">iksar shaman cant slam =-( ,,, DAMN THEM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; damn them all to hell ...<br />
<br />
Yes the scion needs revamped.... but alas ... that will happen ... um like never. <br />
<br />
Ac buff stackable? im laughing at this one... that would make us to uber and then they would nerf iksar shaman more just to please clerics .... its a viscious circle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I would have loved in the AA xp side of things is to not have archetype skills at all, but a middle tier of skills that you can train in up to a maximum of 7 different skills, but YOU get to choose which 7.  I think this would allow for a greater diversity in shaman (they choose thier skills according to what way they play) whilst at the same time not forcing me to choose from the utter crap that we have.  <br />
<br />
I would then choose (in no particular order):<br />
<br />
<br />
 Spell Casting Reinforcement - Increases Duration of Buff Spell<br />
 Channeling Focus -  Improved Channeling Ability <br />
 Combat Agility -  Increase Damage Avoidance <br />
 Combat Stability - Improve Damage Absorption <br />
 Fear Resistance - Increases the Chance to Resist Fear <br />
 Improved Natural Durability - Increase Hitpoints of Player <br />
 Natural Healing - Increase Health Regeneration Rate <br />
 <br />
<br />
I also wouldnt have forced people to choose certain archetypes to get the class specific (therefore allowing me cann5 without mental clarity).<br />
<br />
Probably loads of people disagree, but tis still what I would have liked.  Being forced to choose the same skills as druids and clerics which are pretty different classes to me seems silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea cos all the clerics I know hate me...<br />
<br />
eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always thought we should have zombie pets instead of wolf..... shamanism just always made me think of voodoo and such.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah I see shamans as witchdoctors too<br />
<br />
Way it should have been if u ask me, all voodoo'd up!<br />
<br />
Zombie pets would be cool :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or better yet, make it a percent increase in Slam skill.... /smirk<br />

<br />
No. Bad. Being a bear is a uniquely shaman thing. Not even enchanters can be bears.  <br />
<br />
...i seem to use my AC buff about as much as I use Cure Blindness.<br />
<br />
Shaman AC is the same as enchanter AC: A mostly self buff that you might use on others if it's all you have. Clerics don't need another reason to bitch.<br />
<br />
Don't know if it exists, but there should be a Shaman gate potion to Kitty City.<br />
<br />
It is not known to exist, but they did add over 1000 new tradeskill recipes yesterday.... <br />
<br />
Add to the tribunal symbol quest, i mean a hammer of wraith is nice at level 3, hook us up to near as nicely as the trolls get off.<br />
<br />
Expect the 2nd and 3rd Tribunal symbols to be quests in Plane of Justice that require you to kill the gods of each Plane of Power. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
P.S. Voodoo shamans are just one kind of shaman. Verant chose to base the EQ shaman largely on Native Americans, which I think was a good call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I want a grow spell that will make you as big as a HG.<br />
<br />
That would be cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
agree 100%. Make it stackable with cleric ac buffs.</div></div><hr />

When I first got grow I thought thats what it did... was kinda bummed to see it didn't. Fun being a tiny Ogre with shrink though.<br />
<br />
And it's not just you Barbies that get screwed with the symbol quests. Ogres don't make it past the first step either. In fact, almost ALL the religion symbols suck and haven't been completed. The only ones that go the whole 3 steps are CT and Tunare, which is the lamest thing I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
I want Divine Aura on my 3rd step please. kthxbai~1 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Feh..making shaman AC buffs stack with everything is next to useless end game.<br />
<br />
First of all, buff slots are at a premium.  Secondly, it just isn't needed.</div></div><hr />
