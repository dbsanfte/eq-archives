<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I've noticed several Rangers keep pointing to the JaggedPine Forest as a good source of solo experience until about 54 or 55.<br />
<br />
I play on the fairly new Venril Sathir server [it's been open about 1 month and a bit], and am currently 53.  I attempted fear-kiting, but it is about 1% per 3 kills.  <br />
<br />
If I kill Anacondas, they take about 3-5 minutes to fear-kite [extremely sad, I know], and if I kill Griffons, it is not that much better, but drastically quicker than anacondas.<br />
<br />
What exactly is wrong here?  I keep hearing other Rangers making 1 yellow every half hour or some extreme rate like that.<br />
<br />
Please take into consideration that the server is fairly new, and none of the top levels are that well equipped yet.  My Magelo profile is included.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=489288<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magelo is down atm (or at least, I cannot load up the page that link points to) or I'd have a beter answer than this : what weapons and what haste do you have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah, being a fairly new server, I'm not that well equipped.<br />
<br />
I have no haste items still, [this will all be fixed during raids soon]<br />
<br />
And my weapons are:<br />
1) Sambata War Staff [8/18]<br />
2) Shaded Blade [12/24]<br />
3) Fiercewind [14/32]<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
1) Weighty Polearm [29/34]<br />
<br />
Even with the 22% I will have soon, that won't bump me to a yellow a hour :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its all about the dps, seriously.<br />
<br />
The greater your damage output, the faster you can kill and then you can get more xp per unit time.  Of the weapons you list, I'd go with either the warstaff and the shaded blade, or the two hander, whichever deals more damage.  Unless Fiercewind has a nifty proc (never heard of that weapon before) or some really good stats, I'd ditch it.<br />
<br />
How far along are you to Swiftwind?   (I never knew there was a new Eurpoean server until today lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Welp, <br />
<br />
I just got the Haste Gauntlets from Velketor's, so that's boosted my DPS by 20% or whatever the haste is.<br />
<br />
So far, the 2Hander has parsed out to have the best damage output, but the few &quot;Can't see targets&quot; usually hurt a lot more with 2Handers.<br />
<br />
Swiftwind isn't an option yet, the guild is busy equipping main tanks and powering forward towards Sleeper's Tomb, and Plane of Hate and CoM raids aren't on the agenda.<br />
<br />
What are other Rangers using that could possibly get them a yellow every half hour in Jagged Pine around levels 53-55?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a note, tell yer guild that Swift is REAL easy to get if they are looking at ST. And a ranger with it helps the guild out ALOT by lvling faster and doing more dmg on raids. As for a yellow every 1/2 hour? It aint gonna happen unless you got INSANE DSP, just look at my gear, Frosty + LSoEE and RBG (27% haste), chain killing DBlues in DSP (at 1% per kill) I get a yellow every 40 min at best, also this is tracking down the few DBlues mobs (Zels at lvl 46). As for 53-55? Have you tried getting guild groups to Sebs? Also look at fighting in some zones that offer abit less XP but a chance at some nice gear (Velks for CC armor or Sebs for Tolan's, then again I dunno what you got). In the mean time use the 2hander or Sambata staff + Shaded Blade. Oh, and just grind it out in DSP /  JPF if you want to solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Interesting suggestions.<br />
<br />
Even though Swift is real easy to get and a big help, I don't see either of the main mobs being on the agenda soon.  We're very busy gathering the high level spells, getting haste for all the melee's, and taunt weapons for our main tanks, Cleric Epics.. stuff like that.  Improving everyone as a whole like that is more efficient than Swifty.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for armor right now, just ways to improve DPS.  Whether in raids or groups, I've actually not taken a hit in about 3 levels.  I keep my defensive skills up in my solo time.<br />
<br />
I am guessing some rangers were overboasting about the 1 yellow per 20 minutes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To be perfectly honest......even with pretty nice gear I found xp in JPF to fall off DRASTICALLY at lvl 52 and hense left the place well alone from then.<br />
<br />
Move to the hole for a bit and then PoP :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tromor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been sort of hooked on JPF for the last few levels because of spotty play times. (55 now... ya, I'll change that sig later.)  JPF is highly dependant on how many other people are there.<br />
<br />
At 55, with KEI, and no other hunters in zone, the best I am able to do is 3.5 blue bubbles in 2 hours.  I've spent a little time killing named poachers and gnolls, so my town faction is good, so right now, I kill black panthers and anacondas.  KEI allows me to cast a lot of nukes which cuts the anaconda time down, and with chloroplast up, I pretty much kill non-stop.<br />
<br />
With only one other high level killing in zone, the anaconda's dry up quick, and with two others, I find myself running and sitting too much to do real well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 55 w/ Swiftwind, a LSoEE, KEI, and an empty zone I would get a blue in 30-45 minutes.  I think anyone saying a yellow in 20 minutes may be exaggerating.<br />
