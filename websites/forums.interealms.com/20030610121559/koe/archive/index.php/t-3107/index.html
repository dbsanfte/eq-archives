- Aurum @ 6:38 PM PDT <br />
Kinelti passed us some interesting tidbits about Shadows of Luclin that are found in the next issue of PC Gamer. That hasn't been 100% confirmed, but it seems to be legit. Here's the scoop:<br />
<br />
Since I get it a bit earlier, I thought I would hit up some new details on Shadows for anyone interested. Some of this you may have heard, but some you may have not <br />
<br />
Here goes: <br />
<br />
-Beastlord can and probably will become availible to shamanistic races like Barbs, Trolls, Ogres, and Iksar. They gain armor bonuses by fighting unarmed and seem to gain skills in fighting animal styles in higher levels (Brawling Bear, Striking Snake, Swooping Eagle, etc.) <br />
<br />
-The new Race Vah Shir are like Barbs. Powerful, can fall long distances without taking damage (cats land on their feet) but they need lots of food to sustain metabolism. <br />
<br />
-Horses will start around 9,000 plat to own one up to 15,000 for the fastest ones. The fastest ones will be trained by the elves of felwithe and ponies (not asses as orginally thought) will be for halflings. Darn, there go a slew of jokes <br />
<br />
-Horses are pure eye candy, do not give bonuses and will not take damage. But jousts of sort will be possible for the pvp <br />
<br />
-The expansion will have 25 new zones, 32+ new monsters, and the new tech adding polygons to cities and dungeons. Around 400 npcs will be made availible in each zone thanks to the new tech and Jeff Butler has confirmed that designers are building new zones to make them seem well populated (so zones will likely be smaller than Kunark) <br />
<br />
-How to get to Luclin - the port will be at the half pyramids with spires around them (they are called Al'Kabor spires). One can be seen near the EC druid ring. They seem to be free of charge and teleport every 45 minutes to the new land. <br />
<br />
-Small things <br />
-Looks like most of the MOBS will be getting reactions to getting hit and stuff. <br />
-They showed a picture of what I think is either a Barb female or a wood elf female...whatever she is, she seems...uh...topheavy. <br />
A &quot;topheavy&quot; female character model in EverQuest? Naaah. <br />
<br />
***************************************************<br />
<br />
Some interesting tid-bits, particularly the porting part requiring no Wizzies. <br />
<br />
Horses must be plat plated.. talk about expensive! I wonder if they are no-drop.. :p<br />
<br />
Be very interesting to see I am sure..</div></div><hr />
