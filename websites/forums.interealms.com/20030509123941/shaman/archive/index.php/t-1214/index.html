<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to express my thanks to all the shaman here who have answered my stupid questions. I have been sitting on my tear for a LONG time, and finally got around to going after Rak. <br />
<br />
Although my guild is small, a friend managed to scrounge up 4 mages. So, I'm thinking it will be smooth sailing. It turns out when the Reaver went down, someone slashed Rak (even though I must have told them 10 times not to attack him). After a quick call for camp and some rezzes, things went well.<br />
<br />
As you can see in the pic below, he spawned on top of the ledge. Well, when I handed in my tear, he flew off... needless to say I almost crapped my pants. I thought I lost my tear. It turns out he went around the otherside and snuck up from the back. We lost 5 peeps who thought they were safe in the back of the pack. But in the end, after some quick menuvering by the mages, the fire pets got on him and it was smooth sailing.<br />
<br />
So again, my thanks :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congratulations!<br />
Plan on doing mine on the 1st.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats!  Hehe, I can only imagine the feeling when Rak took off, sheesh.  I saw that happen to a monk once in POA, Gwan took off to another island, had to get a GM to summon him.  As for people attacking him, yeah, I think that happens on EVERY rak fight, because people just don't listen =(  4 Mages rocks, when I did mine, we only had one mage (loooong fight, through which I was dead mind you).  I don't think I had any fingernails afterwards =/  Anyway, grats again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys, and yes, it was a scary felling when he bolted. I was about to give up EQ :) It took less than 5 minutes with the 4 pets.<br />
<br />
As I siad in another post, my guild (more like a group of friends)has about 13 active players... maybe 8 of them above 50, and none of them Mages. So, I was pleasantly surprised at the turnout to say the least ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congratulations :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">grats :)<br />
<br />
I did my fight with just one mage.  I bet it went much faster with 4. <br />
<br />
I did live through the AE though, heh... I guess it could be a benefit of not getting your spear until level 60. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL, level 58 when I got it, and since he hopped over the wall when I gave him the tear, I didn't take one bit of damage.<br />
<br />
Now the poor peeps that were sitting in back of me, thats another story... he came around the wall and leveled em :)<br />
<br />
Had about 2600 HP''s and 159 FR, and a cleric cast Cel Heal on me1 second before I handed it in... so I was ready anyhow... at least I like to think I was :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually torpor'd myself on handin and took 2 rounds of his AE.  I was fully cleric/ranger/shaman buffed.    The stupid mage pet wouldn't get agro off me and rak summoned me back as I backed away slowly.  Since I did not do damage to him, this got me a bit concerned.<br />
<br />
I bet Rak agro'd them because they were sitting.  If you ever go again, make sure people are standing.<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the confusion on yours... that certainly must have added to the excitement for your raid party.  The 9 or so people that came with me were bored as hell.  We expected to have to pull reavers, but we got there and Rak was up and outside the reaver house near where you fought him.   Hand in, 15 minutes later... grats me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your right Henora, they were sitting. Ahh Topor, dare to dream... :)</div></div><hr />
