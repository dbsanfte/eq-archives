<br />
right now i have about 30 in each resist, but with the upgreads i am looking at in the near future i will be losing Most of that. I have always strive for a balance stat aproch when upgreading gear and try not to let any one fall to far behind.  I know that it is not a worth taking a huge hit in HP or AC for it, but the question is how much of a hit should i take (exp. 10Ph hit for 15 in saves or something like that) for is those resist just not inportatin enough to worry about.<br />

Those resists are a real pain to get up, but it's not worth really thinking much about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buy a set of DR/PR resist gear, only use it when you really need it (fighting Grummus etc.).  There's not much armor worth equipping for rangers that has high PR/DR, we're geared much more to MR/FR/CR.  Check the drop table in FG for DR gear (Mushroom Veil, Tarmok Tribal Headband, Gloves of Fungal Flesh, etc.), some of it has good PR too, and it's fairly cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those 3 items are good. Also look for Iksar Hide Cape. Very similar to Heiro except main difference is 15pr 15dr instead of 4 stamina.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There might even be a drink that gives those saves as well, but I haven't really looked that hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/bazaar has an option where you can sort by stats, I think resists are included in the list.  Click on the column heading and it will sort by resistance score, with the best items at the top.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by 'eaten'?<br />
<br />
I think the only time I ever ATE any stat food is when I went swimming in the Shadowhaven Community Swimming Pool to get my skill up overnight and forgot to bank it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Means to have it in the first available slot for food.  Some folks keep buying new stat food rather than force feeding foraged goodies to save that stat food..</div></div><hr />

How do you play a ranger and NOT forage? I hit track and forage religiously and miss them terribly on my alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gotta agree with Hopwin there.  I didn't pay 1.2k for my Hero Sandwiches just so I could go and eat them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kaladim Constitutional adds +5 Stamina and to all saves and is an enduring drink, trivial is &gt;250 brewing and is made from ground spawns in Kaladim, I prefer it on raids and in Seb or when in any zone that has lots of necros and shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You really dont need too much in the way of resists for xp type mobs.  Most of the time resists come into play its a raid type encounter.  The only time your really need dr in xp is if you are fighting a shaman mob that tries to slow you but even then its a simple cure or shrooms in fg(maybe a few others but not many).  So in other words dont worry too much about losing it if the new stuff has better overall stats.  You can always get dr/pr buffs if you need the resist help for xp mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know shaman slows save against magic resist right?  Unless you mean the lower % disease slows?<br />
<br />
Agree tho, DR and PR are really hard to raise for us rangers, I wear my Band of the Arisen Cultist (15 DR PR) instead of some better rings such as Valorium just because I hate seeing those resists go so low.  They arent exactly great even with the ring, as you can see on magelo.  :mad:</div></div><hr />
