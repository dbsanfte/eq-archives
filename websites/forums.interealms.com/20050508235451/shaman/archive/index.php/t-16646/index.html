<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">18 hours, can skip spawns.<br />
<br />
  And in general when seeking info, people know that you want facts and not rumors.  Stating such just leads to smart-alek answers because we think you are being rude :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I hear he hasn't been skipping spawns for about 6 months... and I remember from camping him that his spawn time is 12 hours with a little bit of variance.<br />
<br />
Beliael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lodi = 12 hrs +/- 1 hr.  Spawn skipping was fixed about 6 months ago.  Additionally, after the spawn skipping was fixed, we held down the spawn with several differnt people for about 3 days straight.  Typically, we saw spawn times of 11-12 hrs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">repop is generally 12 hours (he DOES NOT skip spawns) but he spawns up to and maybe exceeding 2.5 hours early; not sure if he pops late. (thats 9.5-12 hours for the non math whiz's).<br />
<br />
I personally witnessed a 2.5 hour early pop..so this isnt some myth--was probably 5 months ago i think; doubt anything has changed...friend and i camped him an entire weekend :)<br />
<br />
and good luck not getting KS'd.. of the six times we killed him we had people breathing down our necks attempting to KS three times...and while you're there you might as well camp stormfeather and make a melee (or yourself) happy~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The first replier is thinking of the Stormfeather spawn, which is in the same zone and is for the eyepatch of plunder quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i can also confirm the 12 hours +/- 2.5 hours guild held his spawn for about 5 days in a row  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lodi is 12 hours +/- a bit<br />
Stormfeather is 19.25 hours +/- a bit, and definately does skip spawns - it ranks as one of the most frustrating camps of all time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darngudlukenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thx for the info =) found him up again and me 60 shaman(no torpor.malo) and a 56 ranger and 56 cleric who just used heal over times on me while i tanked him. no1 in zone but us lol so didnt have to worry bout anything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Swiftfisted, I always thought that both had the same basic timer... explains why I haven't ever seen the big turtle before :)</div></div><hr />
