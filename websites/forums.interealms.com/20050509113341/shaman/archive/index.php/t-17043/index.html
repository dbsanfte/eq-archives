<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grubnuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all...<br />
<br />
I'm interested in creating a step-by-step 'roadmap' that could be used by guilds in EverQuest to eventually reach the Plane of Time.  I know that there are many people who just get to the necessary level and amount of AA points to join an exisiting Time capable guild, but I'd like to help my existing guild get there, or as far as we possibly can.<br />
<br />
My guild is currently doing Halls of Testing raids, and are capable of taking down Cazic Thule in Fear with minimal assistance from an allied guild.<br />
<br />
Assuming that the members of the guild are able to buy necessary droppable spells in the bazaar, what would be the best order of zones/mobs to raid regularly in order to be capable of reaching Time?  (I don't expect anyone to devulge secrets on how to take down mobs.  We're more than willing to put in our time.  We'd just like to know the best path to take...)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok, here's my short version for &quot;fast track&quot; in 2003:<br />
Halls of Testing, Dain, KT<br />
NToV, farm for equipment and to learn tactics<br />
skip ST, takes to long to key <br />
Luclin mobs: Rumblecrush, Doomshade, IV, Rags 1 +2<br />
Ssar mobs: AL, XTC, HP<br />
skip emp, seru, VT huge timesink for bane/keys<br />
PoP: PoJ trails, PoS key to BoT<br />
farm BoT bosses to equip your guild for PoP<br />
<br />
once you're at that stage you have to follow the standard PoP flagging route<br />
Xenamech, Behemoth, Grummus, TT<br />
CoD-Bertox, AD<br />
Agnaar, HoH, VZ, TZ, Saryn<br />
MM, RZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Recruit heavily, Raid a lot.  People like to be a part of an active guild.  You only have 18 people on? DO SOMETHING.  Anything that provides an upgrade.  If you do have to call an off night, give people goals to accomplish outside of raiding.  Give them goals that they can accomplish without a raid force so even when your raid numbers are down they can go and do something productive for the guild.<br />
<br />
As a guild leader, I always push us to the point that we can't pass, then back up to the loot farm right behind us and farm the hell out of it mixing in the &quot;next big kill&quot;.  People like to move forward, they like to know that the time they spend farming pays off with Big Name kills.<br />
<br />
You're in HOT.  Push hard for NTOV.  If you hit a roadblock, get back to HOT and keep gearing up.  Once you break into NTOV, farm it until it's dry or you're bored.<br />
<br />
If you don't push yourselves to the next level.. And challenge your guild to strive and be better, they never will be.  As long as you're content to be in HOT, you will be there.  If you need it to gear up, great. But challenge your people to the next level.<br />
<br />
Don't be content with HOT,  Make a goal to &quot;defeat Velious&quot; and push hard for it including Kael/Icewell/ST.  When you put Velious into farm mode Luclin is waiting.. You can also mix in Luclin lower name kills to get you accustomed to what you're after there.  On off days, working on Emp/VT keys is good as you will need them later if you decide on that route.<br />
<br />
POP is a long way away if HOT is where you raid, but progressing continually to the next level will only get you closer and make your guild members happy <br />
<br />
Not a perfect roadmap by any means.. But if you keep the mindset of &quot;opening content to our members&quot; at the forefront, it seems to work out.  <br />
<br />
Killing Aaryonar &quot;opens NTOV&quot;<br />
Working on First Broods &quot;opens ST&quot;<br />
Working on Emp/VT key &quot;opens VT&quot;<br />
And when you get to POP, the same holds true.. Open content for your members, they can't argue with your direction if your goal is to &quot;Open the game to them and make all zones accessible to them&quot;<br />
<br />
The strategy worked quite nicely for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vindi not to be seen? )<br />
<br />
atm I see it as, KD&lt;HoT&lt;Vindi/RC/DS/horsey in UP/Xanamech(all relatively similar in strength with right tactics, Vindi being hardest)&lt;Ssra(NToV if it isn't on a 9 week rotar like AB with a few guilds)&lt;VT/EP&lt;Boss mobs in EP&lt;PoT.<br />
<br />
Loads of stuff inbetween but thats how i see current guilds progression, atm my guild is owning usual mobs, vindi xanamech etc while farming BoT and trying to equip guild with Ssra emp keys.<br />
<br />
Headache while writing this so its poor grammar spelling etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It sucks trying to get Emp key when you are solo, but when your entire guild goes there and kills everything in sight. They start coming rather quickly.<br />
<br />
Nothing like &quot;Anybody want to help me get com2?&quot; *cringe* but I would still go now if the entire guild was going to kill every mob in the place as it's much more fun/easier to go when so many are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd make the VT decision based on how many guilds on your server regularly raid there and how much you plan to grow in the 6 months or so after starting to kill the Emperor.  If you're going to be getting maybe a quarter of the VT kills (once every 3 weeks or so) and you'll have to go back and re-shard half your people in the meantime, don't bother.<br />
<br />
If you're getting half or more of the VT kills though, and will just have a small influx of people to catch up, it could be extremely lucrative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's my view: <br />
<br />
Getting a guild to Plane of Time is not about the route you take. It's about the attitude of the guild, and the type of players in it. If you want your guild to get there, certain things are needed: <br />
<br />
You need powergamers. Lots of them. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with powergamers, so nobody get offended. In this case, they're a good thing. They're what you need to achieve Plane of Time. You need people with LOTS of playtime. People playing 3 days a week and wanting to raid 1-2 days a week will only hold you back and slow you down. You need people focused on climbing as high and as fast through EQ content as they possibly can. You need people who care about progress in EQ greatly. You need people who want to make that 187th AA pt more than they want to play a L 40 alt. <br />
<br />
So what do you do? You recruit this kind of people. Lots of them. Preferably with a focus on critical raid classes, and definitely with an eye of forming a balanced raid force. You'll eventually need to be able to field 60+ person raids on a daily basis, if you want to progress in PoP. <br />
<br />
Now, you can't get there all in a day. You need to constantly be progressing and improving. My experience has been that guilds are either on the way up, or on the way down. Few guilds hold static for long. Maybe that can be done by the #1 guild on a server (especially if they've &quot;completed&quot; the content), but otherwise guilds are strengthening or weakening. You need to build the impression in your server populace that your guild is the one that's on the rise, so that all the people at your &quot;level&quot; who really want to raid a lot and get to the high end content see your guild as the place to do it. Part of doing this is always progressing, and trying to do some kind of raid every day, as has already been suggested. <br />
<br />
This is getting long, so I'll cut it short. But it's not really about the &quot;path&quot; as it is about the guild mindset. You can do ST, or not.  You can do Emp Ssra and VT, or not. That isn't going to be the definitive factor in whether you can get to the Elemental Planes and beyond. I'm not trying to be discouraging, just to give you an idea what it really takes for a guild to break into the Elemental Planes. It's a very long road from where you are now, and in all probability your guild will look almost nothing like it does now (possibly in guild structure and atmosphere, possibly in people, possibly both), when and if it gets there. You can take that as a good thing or a bad thing, but it's what's in front of you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting an Emp key isnt that hard ... just takes time .. reguardless how many guildies you bring with ya.  Solo .. why do people always have to solo .. get some friends =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like vindi for a number of reasons.  he's practicaly always up due to his 8 hour timer, his breastplate is awsome for any class except a cleric.  he has 2 guards which you have to deal with.  his 700 which isn't nearly as much as it used to be but is still a respectable amount. In my opinion Vindi is a great mob to practice ch chains, pulling, agro control, pinning, alot of raid important tactics that on farmed hot mobs aren't as crucical.  i never remember having to wall anything in hot except doze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If your guild wants to be in Time in 6 months you need to stop Farming HoT and start recruiting level 60+ now. If your Guild wants to be in Time in 1 Year then Farm HoT 1-2 Nights a week and Start Doing Vindi Everyday. Everyday! Rotate MTs Clerics and get use to fighting Vindi with is 2 guards.<br />
<br />
Then Step up and take Statue. If you can do Statue you need to get ready to progress out of HoT and Move into NToV. Many people think NToV is a step backwards but really its the starting point for any Raid guild that wants to be a raid guild for more then 3 months. Gear your people, NToV provides a good round of gear for all slots and class. The AoE fights, tactics, and overall numbers it requires sets the basis for any guild that is serious about progressing. Try Kland, Zland and if you got a ton of people on Sont. These mobs will let you know when your ready for NToV.<br />
<br />
Every week set aside 1 night to look at SoL targets. Start with the Vy'Dyn. He is an easy target is very 1 groupable but for a HoT guild he gives you a good 3+ group encounter to get a feel for SoL type mobs - High AC - Lots of Hps. Some of his drops suck but he does have a nice Sheild and Neck item. From there move onto Zelnithak.<br />
<br />
If you challange your guild every week or 2 with a new encounter it will keep people fresh, grow your membership and keep new and fresh gear on the backs of your people. Once you cross over to the Statue mark and have a solid CH team move on to Doom, Rumble. Once you get those locked Try IV. Make Xanamech your guilds Goal. He's a rough encounter to a guild not use to AoE and a heavy Hitter. CR is easy so use this encounter to test your guild and to keep them motivated and pissed off at a &quot;enemy&quot;. <br />
<br />
Depending on how fast you want your guild to move and the people in it will help you make the VT - PoP choice. But to make a choice you need a guild Ready to do either not thinking about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think the biggest problem you will face is people simply dont want the loot that drops from the mobs you are capable of killing.  So much loot in velious is just pure trash these days.  Its very frustrating too, because the mobs that drop them might still be a challenge for you.  Thats just a product of mudflation. <br />
<br />
Make people focus on getting level 65.  <br />
<br />
If you are in hot now, spend 3 weeks farming it for 2 or 3 hours a night.  Try to clear hot twice a night and you can stop going there after 3 weeks.  FYI, give your clerics bps before your other classes.  They have a much smaller selection of good bps than many others at that stage of the game.  Get this out of the way.  Your faction in velious is holding you back, you need to be able to kill EVERYTHING, because your challenge at this stage of the game is going to be finding a target up that you guys can kill.  You don't want faction limiting your choices.  Get your farming over with asap.<br />
<br />
Start working on Vindicator, he will teach you so much about everything, he is the perfect training mob, and his BP is great loot for alot of classes. <br />
<br />
Statue is arguablly easier than vindi once you slow him, so kill him too, if you can find him up.<br />
<br />
Since your doing hot, i dont see any reason to farm wtov like many people say.  But it would be a good idea to kill telk/goz, because they will again teach you alot and they have some nice drops.  Just be sure most people are ok loosing faction. (get that hot farming finished)<br />
<br />
Start working on haste, get all your melle to 40% haste or better.  Its the easiest dps upgrade you will ever get, and dps is king.  Once you can do Xanamech, do him every day.  His ring own, his hammer owns, his neck item owns.<br />
<br />
Once you can kill vindi, you can work on harder mobs like King tormax, who is just about the most lucrative mob ever put in the game, with the exception of maybe vulak aeer.  If you can do tormax, you can do alot in luclin.  Rhags 1 and 2, rumble, doomshade, iv, tho, Zelnithak.<br />
<br />
Once most of your people are 65, you should be able to handle bot lords, who drop great loot, compared to their difficultly and spawn time. Bot lords are cash cows, and will present a great target.<br />
<br />
At somepoint you are going to need to decide between going for VT, and not going for VT.  Don't listen to the naysayers, the keying isn't all that bad, and it will probably bring your guild closer together.  Its not required, but it will help alot.  Killing emporer for your first time is just about the coolest feeling you will ever have in EQ.<br />
<br />
If you don't decide to do VT, you really need to have good people.  Core people who wont wait on the guild to equip them, people who spend massive hours on their mains, and tons of money getting the best possible items they can out of the bazaar etc.  You can definatly do grumms, terris, ad, behemoth before VT though, so work on keying for <br />
VT and pop gods at the same time, to give people variety.<br />
<br />
Finally, its hard for me to give you a perfect timeline, alot has changed with the new expanisions, and its hard to thing about it from a young guilds perspective.  I'll give you some general advice though that maybe can help you out more than my timeliene.<br />
<br />
-Analayze your raids.  Find out the good and the bad about each raid and make it a goal to perfect it next time.<br />
<br />
-Recruit based on the specific needs you guys have.  IF you already have alot of clerics, dont recruit more.  The less people you have, the less mouths you ahve to feed.  There should be a specific need you fill with every person you add to your roster.<br />
<br />
-recruit at your level.  Don't recruit 65 if you are all 55's, dont recruit 55's if you are all 65.  In both cases you wil end up with frustrated members.<br />
<br />
-get all your melle 40%+ haste. dps is king.<br />
<br />
-Kill everything you possibly can, even if you dont need alot of loot.  it will help you get better at general raiding.<br />
<br />
-teach your people how to play, teach your clerics how to count, your debuffers where to stand, your melle how to position.  If you don't know, find out.  Don't leave it to them to figure out on their own. <br />
<br />
-offer something unique.  Dont try to be, just another level 60+ guild.  Give people a reason to be with you.  If your members share something in common other than just wanting to kill mobs, they are less likely to leave for greaner pastures.<br />
<br />
-spread your loot out.  Don't only equip one MT.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  They will leave, and you will have nothing.<br />
<br />
-Discourage people playing their alts, unless they want to 2box them on raids.  Alts bring a guild down, have them spend their time on their mains.<br />
<br />
-Teach your people how to scout.  Scouting &gt; all.</div></div><hr />

Zelnithak?? you must have meant another mob, my boyfriend and I take him down everytime we see him, both of us 2boxing, so we're a group of 65 sk, shaman, necro, cleric. His drops are bleh as well, the only reason we still go near him is my boyfriends wants the FTII  range item for his mage.<br />
Sorry to hijack hehe just wanted to clarify what mob he meant =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've actually talked this out with my roommate, who was in the position to discuss this very topic with her guild.  We spent quite a while hammering out a progression, even going to far as to have index cards with mob stats on them color-coded to more cards with loot to build a big progression tower in the middle of the living room floor.  It was almost fun.  Yes, we're mentally ill.<br />
<br />
I'll start where they were at, and run up the scale.<br />
<br />
So, you want to build a high-end raiding guild from scratch?<br />
<br />
Starting with a motivated pool of about 25 active players per night, all in the 56-62 range, but with absolutely no raid experience whatsoever, how do you build a guild to rival the giants?<br />
<br />
1. Recruit and Focus.  25 people per night will do for awhile, but eventually that will run dry.  Also, specific class issues (clerics, warriors, enchanters, wizards) are often an issue.  Make sure that your guild has a policy of helping each other, of generosity, and of integrity.  To be a dark horse guild and make it to the top, you need to depend on each other.  If people are in the guild for the personal loot and glory ... now's when they should look elsewhere - this guild stands together as a team.<br />
<br />
2. Destroy Kael Drakkel.  A green guild needs to learn how to raid before it can hit a real target.  Go old school.  Take the Kael Arena.  Drop the named.  Play around with the Protectors of Zek, and the named Clerics.  This isn't about loot, although you'll get some legs and BPs if you are lucky.  Its about learning how to raid, and how to deal with things like pinning and push and aggro control.  It also builds faction, which is valuable.<br />
<br />
3. Levels.  Set aside about a couple nights a week for levels.  Make it an organized thing.  You get bonus points for organized levelling that ALSO gears up the guild.  I recommend Umbral Planes (Moktor armor is passably good, Raldukan BPs are amazing, and Gantru Dralkenr drops nice bracers, even still).  I also recommend Temple of Droga.  There are eight zillion rares in there, and some very solid drops.  Nothing sees invis, so CR is free.  Have the stronger groups farm the big weapons from Droga - the sword off Gamolk and the hammer off Dronan.  Other folks can do camps like the Kingly Boots of Splendor (Japal) and the Enchanted Sash of Wonder (31% haste, Runri).  Make cooperation towards gearing up the guild while you do levels an overarching goal.  Now isn't the time for selfishness.<br />
<br />
4. Questing.  Benevolence is easy once you have the faction and is still easy.  Perform the quest as often as possible.  Put a tracker out in WW for Scout Charisa.  This is monotonous, but it helps build up everyone's gear.  Remember, gear helps morale, and you're going to need it where you're going.  Consider working in at least a few Circlets of the Falinkan as well.  That's a harder quest, but well worth it.  Help the devoted complete their shawls.  Help the OTHER devoted get to at least ring 9.  On many servers, you may be able to partner with other guilds (or announce open support) in order to get folks ring 10.<br />
<br />
5. Selected epics.  If the guild is committed to running for the top, then 80% of the guild is likely to do without.  Clerics, though, are a must.  Make the Chardok Overking fear your coming.  Let Ragefire teach you about dragon casting range, and mobs with an AE.  This will be an ongoing project for awhile, but you'll want at least a cleric epic or 2 before proceeding.  You can also get Shamans, Rogue, and Beastlord epics, because they are trivially easy, and of course complete anyone's who manages to be convienient.  Bard epics are good, too ... but may have to wait, as Trakanon is a tougher cookie.<br />
<br />
5. Halls of Testing.  Don't be like the guilds of yesteryear.  You aren't here to put your guild in solid HoT armor.  You're here to learn about more complicated pulling, dealing with AEs, aggro ranges, and raid encounters that can gate.  At this point, you should be finishing up the last of the Benevolence and Falinkan runs, and say your farewells to the dragons.  Don't bother with Dozekar quests.  They are really good, but he's harder than you're ready for, and, really, you aren't going to be here long.<br />
<br />
6. Derakor the Vindicator.  As you become comfortable in HoT, and start to move towards its close, begin on Derakor.  Kill Derakor daily before you start other events, if you can.  Kill him before you go to HoT.  Kill him before you do a Benevolence run.  Kill him before you send folks off to XP.  If you have a large raid window (weekends perhaps), then come back and kill him again when you're done.  If you aren't sick to death of seeing Derakor, you haven't killed him enough.  Continue this ... until you're done with him, although you can taper off slowly.<br />
<br />
7. Servitor of Luclin.  The int-caster payoff mob to go with Derakor.  While not up as often, she has two drops per spawn.  The common drops are the Wand of Musing, which has 100 mana and FT1 and will be better than int caster epics (except wizards), and the Mask of Pulchritude, which pretty much every enchanter and necromancer in your guild will want, plus a fair number of SKs and other int casters.<br />
<br />
8. Interlude.  Now's the last moment your guild has to turn back.  Finish up recruiting - for now.  Finish the last random quests.  Grab a couple more cleric epics.  Now's a good time for bard epics, too.  Check levels.  If you can get shots at him, work The Va'Dyn into your schedule of kills at this time also.  If you're doing Derakor, you can do Va'Dyn.  He drops a LOT of crap, but his good pieces are worth it.  Post a date that the easy times end and stick with it.  On that day ...<br />
<br />
9. Betray the Dragons.  Put your pulling skills to work with Eashen of the Sky.  Know him, love him.  He's easy to get to, and some of the best loot in Velious.  Try to monopolize him.  Also ... make Aaryonar your enemy.  Your guild WILL hate Aary.  There are lots of guides to him, make sure your members read them.  If you follow directions well, Aary's not that bad, but if you're like most folks at this point, you will wipe, and you'll wipe a lot.  In order to keep morale up during this, hit other targets as well.  More Derakor, of course, but also more Va'Dyn.  Attempt the Statue of Rallos Zek if you can get a shot at it.  Also consider a couple Plane of Nightmare mobs at this point, especially Terror Matriarch and the big croc.  Once you beat Aary, press the advantage.  Hit the easy kills in NToV.  Skip Lord Vyemm.  Skip Lady Nevedaria (at least at first).  Make sure your pull team can split the Triplets.  And fasten your seatbelts.  At the same time, hit anything else you can find in Velious.  First Brood dragons.  Statue.  Maybe even Tormax.  I don't like killing Dain, because of the faction for Ringwars, but your mileage may vary there.<br />
<br />
10. Recruit More.  A successful NToV-raiding guild has more prestige than a wanna-be guild.  Fill in the holes and get the numbers up.  Be more selective about gear and levels, but remember that you will just need more people where you are going.  Help those whose levels aren't towing the line to catch up - if they will be active members.  You're changing the face of the guild, so you should expect some sad goodbyes from those who cannot or do not wish to change.  Don't let it sink the ship.<br />
<br />
11. Xanamech Nexmirthifen.  A lot of people try to put First Brood farming in here, along with a potential run in ST.  Don't bother.  You'll spend forever getting enough keys for everyone (unless you've been VERY lucky in Kael).  It better to make the big jump.  At this point, you are used to big AEs (NToV), and mobs that hit hard (Derakor/Va'Dyn/other stuff in NToV/Statue).  Combine the ideas and work Xana over.  Once you've beaten him, keep on beating him.  His reuse timer is speedy, consider doing him even twice a day.  Every warrior should own a hammer.  Every active melee will need a collar.  Int casters who don't have better will want a Phase Emitter.  Rings should go to wis casters first, then int casters who had better than the Emitter to start with.  This will take a little while, simply becuase of the volume of drops you want, but it does more to speed a guild up faster than anything else in the game.  Only Derakor is close, and he doesn't hold a candle to the robodragon.<br />
<br />
12. Glitz.  Hit some &quot;glitz&quot; targets.  They may not be the best for progress, but they help morale and make you feel useful.  Take Rhag 1/2 if you can get a shot at them.  Do Itraer Vius and Cazic Thule for Flowing Thought.  Consider trying the Burrower Beast (especially later in the Xana farming) and Grieg Veneficus as well as Thought Horror Overfiend (if you can get a copy or 2 of Remove Greater Curse).  On low-turnout days, do other mobs like Rallius Rattican, Vhaksiz the Shade, and the Ring of Slime in CT, to keep momentum going, to add variety, and to help fill in slots that Xanamech doesn't cover.  When you can, take out the Manaetic Prototypes to reward your wis casters (and enchanters) for their hard work.  Make getting a win on The Avatar of War a goal (and hope for at least 1 Blade of Carnage).  Drornok Tok'Vo'Lok in Plane of Storms is another good choice that is often overlooked.<br />
<br />
12. Guild Status Check.  Check your levels, classes, and overall guild health, and address any problems.  By now, you should be fielding a healthy raid force of 35+, and your levels should be in the mid 60s.  You should have a good mix of classes, with plenty of clerics and chanters, dependable tanks, a pull staff, and support.<br />
<br />
13. Decision Making.  Here's when you get to choose.  Do you follow the road to VT, or blaze on past the upper Luclin content?  I recommend skipping VT.  Emperor is easily bottlenecked, as is VT itself.  The rest of this guide will be written under the assumption that you won't be hitting VT, and will give only passing service to Ssra Temple at all.<br />
<br />
14. Encourage a Tradeskill Staff.  If you havent' already, organize the guild tradeskillers.  Show them respect and appreciation.  Components for PoNightmare crafted armors are easily available, PoStorms armor components may be a bit harder to come by but are still out there.  Use these materials, BD cultural, Valor Rings, Nightmare Amulets, whatever else you can get, to fill in the holes in your guild's gear.<br />
<br />
15. Announce the Push.  At this point, you have a practiced, cooperative raid force.  They've lived together, worked together, and equipped each other.  Its time for one of those inspiring leadership posts, where you harkon back to the day you declared Aaryonar your guild's sword enemy (and any other similar mob that gave you trouble, but finally got its just desserts) - but this time, the target isn't just one mob, its a whole chartful.  Get some sort of organized flagging table visible to the member-access section of your board or website. Explain that when the guild starts to deal with each flag, the goal is at least 90% completion - that is, 90% of the active guild mains shouls have the flag.  Start by organizing teams for the Trials.  Its good teamwork, its fairly fast, and it shows folks just how big a commitment 90% really is.  This also gets folks a free AA and some charm stats, so they'll be happy.<br />
<br />
16. XP and AA.  This is the last big chance to rush XP for a bit.  The guild needs to work their way up to 65, and important classes need their key AA.  Work in teams, and target LDoN as a major source of experience, becuase it also provides gear and spells via AP.  At the same time, make sure someone gets a key to Aerin'Dar's lair - before you kill him.  When folks aren't in LDoN, consider focusing on Bastion of Thunder.  Like Droga, its full of great drops that can be passed around to help everyone - including ornate armor that will likely be a much needed upgrade.  And you'll want Tower keys, real soon.<br />
<br />
15. BoT Keys.  Sure you don't need them anymore, really, but its part of progression, a free AA, and more charm stats.  Its also good teamwork.  You're a guild capable of big targets, so don't hesitate to kill the PoS Lords as well as the minis for medallions (and loot) - although the gimmicky Ocean Lord is usually more trouble than he's worth.<br />
<br />
16. Hedge Mazes.  Mix in a few Hedge runs with the BoT keys and the AA push and the Trials and the raid kills of previous steps' mobs.  This flag is an easy one to forget about.<br />
<br />
17. Grummus.  Once you've gotten near 90% on your 3 easy flags (Trial, BoT, Hedge), start actively trying for your shot at Grummus.  Its important to have impressed upon the need for the easy 3 flags first - and keep that table up to date! - or they get forgotten (I'm in an Elemental guild, and its just embarassing when someone's trying to figure out why they STILL need a Visa ... and its the Hedge Maze).  With all the other mobs you've killed, Grummus shouldn't be too big of a challenge.  Put him on farm status, his gear isn't bad.<br />
<br />
18. BoT Towers.  Like Xanamech, Servitor, and Derakor before them, the BoT Tower bosses are farm bait.  You'll need an Agnarr key eventually, but this is mostly for loot.  Plus, the big mobs like Grummus and the stuff still to come won't always be there, and its always about the push.<br />
<br />
19. Terris Thule. Its tempting to want to hit Behemoth early, but he's a much harder target.  TT isn't too tough, but most of all, her encounter is unique.  Unique means less boring, which is good for morale.  She also drops excellent loot for the challenge, including a really amazing mask and bracer - 2 slots that are often crap.  This means, she, too goes on farm mode.<br />
<br />
20. Aerin'Dar.  Get AD out of the way.  AD's loot is the opposite of good.  Use AD to demonstrate how bad backflagging can be and to urge for good attendance.  Don't hesitate to encourage people to get AD flags in pickup raids or flag trading deals, but DO kill him twice or so, he's a &quot;warmup&quot; for Rydda.<br />
<br />
21. Filling in the Chart.  Work on your first &quot;backflagging&quot; as you push for 90%+ completeness on everything to this point.  You'll be trickling new folks in, both to counter attrition, and to build up to the 60+ raid forces you'll want soon.  Make sure no one gets left behind.  Those 2 new clerics, new chanter, and new SK don't do any good sitting outside the zone waiting.  Add the 2 easy HoH Trials to the list of active targets.  You'll want to do Villagers as seldom as possible, but &quot;Virgins&quot; (or whatever you call it) has some decent loot.  Now's a good time to get 2 keys to Saryrn's Tower, too.  You'll only actually NEED one, but I promise you'll want 2.  The key is cursed; if you're guild only has one, that player's computer WILL die, they will get a new job, or they will be hit by a car.  Trust me.<br />
<br />
22. Behemoth.  Name Behemoth as your next guild enemy.  Many do well with this encounter early, other guild fail repeatedly.  You're likely to have some competition, too.  Tactics access is a sweet thing, though.  Its well worth it.  I like farming Behemoth for loot, but your mileage may vary.  Strike for as close to 100% flagging on this one as you can, its too valuable to play around with.<br />
<br />
23. Rapid Progress.  You have lots of targets now.  Make use of them.  Learn Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek and make use of their friendly loot tables.  Hit Saryrn, too, and learn to hate Sorrowsong (unless you have access to someone who has killed Bertox, you'll have to come back for the Keeper of Souls, but its nice to kill Saryrn early for morale).  Don't forget to keep the numbers high on old events, like the (non-Rydda) Honor Trials, and kill stuff like Grummus and Terris Thule for loot when you're out of real flag mobs.<br />
<br />
24. Carprin.  Start doing Carprin runs.  The gear might still have use for a few, but the event is long and dull.  If Ahvi (the mob that spawns adds when players or pets die) is a problem, then use the PoStorms Ocean Lord as a practice dummy (he's harder than Ahvi).  Raex, the unslowable General with the 5k lifetap proc is the first mob that's likely to be a threat of &quot;one-rounding&quot; your tanks.  Get used to dealing with the dangers.  Becuase this is a key and not a flag, you REALLY want near 100% flagging here.<br />
<br />
25. Agnarr.  By now, you should be swimming in loot from the Zeks, BoT Towers, and Tier 1 gods.  Its time for Agnarr.  He's a long, complex event, that's a lot easier than it appears at first.  In my opinion, Agnarr seperates the easy part of PoP flagging from the hard part.<br />
<br />
26. Rydda'Dar.  Work on Rydda next.  For some guilds, Rydda seems easy.  For others, its the hardest thing until Rallos.  You'll just have to find an approach that works for you.  Play up Aaryonar comparisons to the veterans who've been with you the whole time. =)<br />
<br />
27. Guild Check.  Now's a great time for another guild update.  At this point, you're a major player on the server, and one that came out of nowhere, to boot.  Use the reputation that gives you to fill in what you're missing.  You're going to want to be pushing the max raid size of 72 as your raidforce for the steps ahead.  Of course, you'll need to backflag ... but if you're doing it right, that should be one kill of each flag mob to catch you all back up (and flag a few of those slacker 10%).<br />
<br />
28. Two of the Big Three.  Its time to buckle down and hit 2 of the PoP Big Three.  The order doesn't matter, and will be decided by opportunity more than planning.  You want to see Lord Mithaniel Marr and Bertox dead to your hands.  It will take a lot of time and effort, but if you've come this far, your team will persevere.<br />
<br />
29. Solusek's Tower.  Start actively farming Sol Ro.  Encourage folks to hit it on offtimes to spread ornate around.  Destroy the minibosses - they fill in slots that are likely weak or missing in your current gear sets (like the lucky 7 monk stick and the Necro dot-focus range-slot).  Try to play this off as gearing-up and prep-work, more than just more flagging.  You are getting ready for something big.<br />
<br />
30. Rallos Zek.  He's big.  He's bad.  He's like nothing you've ever encountered before.  Just keep focused on the goal ... he's all that's in the way of hitting the Elementals.  If Rallos failures are threatening burnout, take a night off, and do something fun.  Hit an LDoN raid, or go mow down NToV for nostalgia.  Return fresh the next day.  If someone else kills Rallos, use the time between spawns to polish off backflagging, or maybe even hit some mob that you skipped on your race to the top (Cursed is EXCELLENT here, just for the shot at Bloodfrenzy; so is Lord Seru, if you managed to get a key and a couple Bane weapons along the way).<br />
<br />
I won't bother with a numbered list to get you from there to Time ... You'll have to do Sol Ro, of course, and PoE-B keys, and the 4 Elemental Pantheon gods ... but once you're on the Elementals, you're where you want to be, at the top of the game.  Love those minibosses, and gear up like crazy.  It only gets harder from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Top guide,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for taking the time to write that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow Shabura, thats the best progression writeup I think Ive seen and my guild is extremely close to following that exact route.<br />
<br />
Some other things I wanted to point out (which are opposites of what has been posted), we have been successful and never actively recruited (we have grown a lot but we have never asked people to join us or seeked out specific classes), and we have focused on PoP progression to date once/week only (not including BoT tower lords as PoP progression, but gearing up), you dont have to raid every night.<br />
<br />
My guild started doing Vindi late of last year and were still farming HoT when I returned to the game.  We are skipping VT, have about 20 keyed for ST, made about 3-4 short trips into NToV, dont much mess with Luclin but have killed a few boss mobs outside Ssra, and never tried any of the Velious kings (not for lack of wanting to, just never found them up when actively looking).  Our first kill of Grummus was 6/23/03 and we just killed Bert last night.  Only Saryrn (have key), Vallon Zek and MM (done trials) remain to Sol Ro and then RZ to Elementals and I have no doubt we will be there soonish depending on what we find up each week.<br />
<br />
I attribute it to a very strong lead group of folks (extremely important) and a fantastic group of players who joined because they wanted to be with us, not because we needed specific classes.  I consider us more of a casual guild than a raiding guild as we typically raid 2-3 nights/week.  I cant imagine how much faster we'd be in the Elementals if we concentrated on PoP 3+ nights/week.  I also think the PoP xp modifier has a lot to do with us progressing so much faster than used to could be done, even the semi-casual players are all 61+ now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What's up Dugann.  Sent ya a PM.<br />
<br />
If your guild has 5 decent offtankers and a cleric or decent druid for each one I would definitely recommend doing burrower beast event in The Deep.  The FT items are very nice, also a 100hp headslot.  Drops 2 or 3 items everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My road map....join a good guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Seru is not nearly as difficult as people like to think or lead others to believe.  We did him without any bane weapons.  The hardest part about Seru is getting an arx key.<br />
<br />
If your guild can kill AoW you can kill Seru.  (I mean if your tank can tank AoW and you have the healing power and have some caster dps you can kill seru, takes awhile sure, but not very hard.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I just wanted to comment that I refer to this myself, and refer others to it, all the time. <br />
<br />
Thank you, Shabura.<br />
<br />
Also, I found this chart (http://img40.exs.cx/img40/6260/ShahrazadProgressTree.jpg) of target mobs for a progressing guild that I thought might be good to have linked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In the end, it depends on what your guild wants to do.  When I joined Sign of One on Karana, they were in NToV rotation still, yet they would kill Tier One Planar Mobs ( Grummus, TT , BoT Named ( We tried Agnarr a few times, and we did alright I thought ).  <br />
<br />
We had a long debate in the direction of the guild progression.  Some people wanted to continue to progress through PoP, yet there was a few of us that wanted to do SSRA/VT because we saw value in that content as well as being a &quot;casual&quot; guild.  Problem stemmed from the word casual.  There were people in the guild that wanted to progress more or simply wanted to raid more.  Camping SSRA for Emp Key or shard camping wrinkled many people's noses, yet when I ran these events, people always came and always sent me tells that they had fun.  Anyways, that was the past :P<br />
<br />
I think Shabura's post is an excellent reference for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Um, wow. I missed this thread the first time it went through (look at the dates) but now . . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">GoD and LDoN pretty much offer a completely different route now.   With the combination of gear and augs from mini-named in places like Ferubi, Riwwi, Sewers, and Barindu, and then later Tipt/Vxed combined with items from LDoN a guild could probably gear to near Elemental level faster than doing the NToV - Luclin - VT route.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough bro, do you want to modify the original post by Sam and make it more &quot;Gates-LDoN&quot; friendly? THat would rock. Its an awesome post, as it sits, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'll add my 2c and the following are problem areas that if you can address the guild will prosper.<br />
<br />
1) Find targets.  Have good trackers.<br />
2) Start pretty much on time.  Waiting around forever sucks.<br />
3) Be fair on loot.  Doesn't matter how, just be fair.<br />
4) Make peeps feel that they are an important part of the guild<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
PS: These things may seem unimportant, but they are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Two mobs that I see almost everyone skipping over are Maestro and Innoruuk in the revamped Plane of Hate. The nice thing about both of these mobs is the limited clearing effort needed to get to them. Both of the encounters are also somewhat unique in terms of strategies needed to be successful. The drops from Maestro are probably Ssra quality, while the drops from Inny are of VT quality or better.<br />
<br />
During the Maestro fight, two disembodied hands will spawn at his organ (An Accompanist) that need to be dispatched by the raid immediately (HANDS!!). Later, three banshees will spawn and walk into the room, and activate at a certain %health on Maestro. These need to be occupied by small add teams (plate tank + shaman) until the main raid is finished with Maestro. One of these has a mana-drain AE, so be sure to have your chain clerics far from this banshee.<br />
<br />
With the Innoruuk fight, waves of adds spawn that can include clerics, spite golems and imps. The trick to handling the adds is realizing that they keep spawning if you keep killing them. What you need to do is have enchanters lock them down until they stop spawning. Spite golems are immune to magic, so need to be killed. Keep killing golems until you have mostly clerics, with a few imps mixed in. Take advantage of the fact that Inny is leashed when choosing a spot to locate your enchanters and their adds. Once the adds are under control, you are free to send in your MT, followed by the main raid. Inny has an AE rampage, which will be excellent practice for your guild for the upcoming RZtWL fight. Oh, and don't forget to have an add team ready to occupy the Evangelist of Hate when he activates.</div></div><hr />
