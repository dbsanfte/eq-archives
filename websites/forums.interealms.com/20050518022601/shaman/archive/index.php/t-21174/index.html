<br />
<br />
SoE has really been bumping it up. You can say its cause of WoW or whatever reason, frankly im not here to debate why they are and how much impact it has.<br />
<br />
<br />
But with the intro of mutiple new CR's and a much larger amount of replies and posting at the EQlive forums, i have to say, atleast they are trying and props for that. It doesnt take a genious to realize how big the problems for ALL classes are and hopefuly they will continue to help all the people that need it and also us.<br />
<br />
That is all.<br />

at least for a week or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agree Litgruv.<br />
<br />
In the past SoE/Verant only communicated, when massive problems occured or to do some major advertising for new expansions. To be fair, atleast it looked like it for the average player.<br />
<br />
One can only hope they finally changed their policy AND make that change permanent. But we will have to wait and see i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since you are giving credit I guess i'll bitch.  Go back 3 or 4 pages and only one of the developers posts is about shaman.  And that is about throwing potions.  Every other class is getting attention and we are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They're just being nice because new games launched very recently.  They're like this every time something new comes out.  Give it a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also keep in mind that sony's stock dropped 4 bucks a share over the month of april largely due to heavily reduced profits led by their console gaming division.  While this might not include their online PC gaming group, some people might be starting to feel the pressure to plug the holes in the leaking ship until their flagship product is ready (EQ2).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to believe they will also soon see smaller on-line gaming profits caused by a shrinking player base.  With the very successful launch of City of Heroes, and WoW entering the final beta stage (gamespot shows a June/July release) I'm sure they are losing players.  I'm positive they will step up the customer service and game fixes as a response to the competition.  However, too little, too late.  Every person who starts playing CoH or WoW is more likely not to try EQ2.  So not only are they losing current EQ players, but they are losing potential EQ2 players, extremely bad scenario for them in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just cant give them high fives.  Sorry.  Sure, its nice to see then actually working on things, but this is still far below the level of Customer service and development that they should be doing.<br />
<br />
I know that for every change that we see there are hundreds that we miss.  However, they have already seen that the general EQ public likes to see them working.  Would it have killed them to be more visible in their changes and &quot;fixes&quot;?  I , for one, am tired of SOE and vaguely disgusted with myself for contintinuing to play their game.  About nine months ago I stopped upsing a credit card for auto renew and have since used gamecards on my 2 accounts; ever three months I have to examine the time Ive spend and ask if its worth another 40 bucks to continue for another 3.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This big push to provide visible customer service is a really transparent reaction to the launch of CoH.<br />
<br />
I'm haven't checked to see how City of Heroes is doing sales-wise, but they've released a VERY tight product so far, and Sony SHOULD be devoting some resources to retaining their player base.  They're gonna need it.  This isn't another &quot;CoH is the big EQ killah!&quot; post.  I'm just saying that other game companies are releasing product that is more fun than EQ, with better graphics, fewer bugs, and a similar price.  I don't even LIKE comic books - but I'm confident I'll be having a ball playing CoH.... at the very least, until WoW comes out.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can't see CoH making that much of an impact.  I would think the people that are interested in Swords and Sorcery type games would find the concept of playing a super hero silly.  I dont play EQ because it is an online game.  How many of you play EQ because of it setting?  I would think WoW would be more of a threat.  But the idea of having guns in WoW red flags me a bit.  I will more then likely buy WoW to see first hand what it is like BUT I also will buy EQ2 as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought so also till two co-workers both who have played eq for years made  toons for City of Heros.   One made a Cleric type superhero and the other a Druid.   Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Have to say I'm pretty cynical about this as well.  The only reason I think they have more customer interaction is because folks really are starting to hit the &quot;end billing&quot; button.  Post time folks don't really seem to be loving GoD, Pre elemental planes folks are short on content, LDoN's are truly repetitive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But with the intro of mutiple new CR's and a much larger amount of replies and posting at the EQlive forums, i have to say, atleast they are trying and props for that.<br />
I will say that the absence of any kind of community presence (or CS support in general) in the EQLive forums was the #1 reason I left SWG. They had no intention of keeping in touch with the customers. We were left with no idea what bug fixes were in the works or even recognized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To early by just a hair to jump into the apocolypse point of view and say &quot;too little - too late.&quot; That EQ realizes it needs to develop a one-one type of customer service at this point in the game is a tad bit humorous though.<br />
<br />
If, however, that customer service development actually helps players/game in a timely manner then you have to give EQ credit. Given their history, I don't see that manifesting itself. Customer service has always been bad ... very bad. For every kudos to an ingame GM assisting someone there are 50 &quot;where are the GM's questions/frustrations.&quot; In response to what is obviously a need for more ingame interaction with customer service, EQ has moved that customer service out of the game (or reduced it near extinction) and now adds a BBoard system window dressed as the solution to solve player problems and concerns.<br />
<br />
In our dealings/rantings/postings asking Brenlo/Rylan to work with the shaman community we all see that wall that prevents communication from EQ to the player base. Regardless of what we see as ingame changes, the actual communication to this community is too much &quot;legaleze.&quot; They can't tell us details of what they are looking at or considering. They can't openly debate our parsings against their own to find the truth of what is going on.<br />
<br />
In short, the wall is some inhouse policy that talking honestly and openly with the class communities will cause more problems than cures. It is the old &quot;if we mention something and change our mind it will upset those we talked to.&quot; The irony is the lack of consistant community communication, at this stage in the game, upsets far more current players.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that is fine with the business model. Perhaps the older EQ players are worth eliminating as the game is geared for the &quot;box&quot; game folks who want fast, low risk, instant gratification game play. Perhaps the current illusion of customer service that allows players to post on a message board their problems and being informed it has been passed on to the &quot;development team&quot; for review is enough for the new base.<br />
<br />
For the old players, from what I am seeing, EQ has reached the point already of &quot;too little - too late.&quot; EQ could change this - easily. Knowing them historically, it won't happen. EQ does not know its foundation customer base - or they do and are trying desparately to remove them to bring in a new generation of players who find entertainment in bells and whistles instead of substance.<br />
<br />
Seeing what the ingame changes are as a result of the forums customer service approach will tell the story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think the remaining developers really know the game well, either.  Witness an expansion that pretty much killed shamans and knights and whose only real rescue of them is by unbalancing the game even further via chanter charm pets, which still leave shamans and knights feeling basically like useless babysitters for chanters and their pets, stripped of the real roles of their classes.  These guys really are at a complete loss on what to do.  <br />
<br />
Knowing neither your customers nor your game is NOT a recipe for disaster ONLY when there is no competition on the market.<br />
<br />
Lineage 2 and City of Heroes both came out this week.  <br />
<br />
WoW is coming up.<br />
<br />
Uh oh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">P.S.  I wonder how many people will sell short on Sony stock right when WoW comes out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't agree with you on this one.  I personally know 3 individuals that have quit EQ in the last month after joining the CoH beta and are now playing the commercial release.  I picked up the game yesterday due to their recommendations (all 3 played EQ for over 3 years). We are all having a blast.  Sure, it's kind of a &quot;light&quot; MMORPG, but it is fun to play, something EQ has lost sight of.  Is Gates &quot;fun&quot;?  I think not.  CoH, Lineage II, and WoW are going to take a good chunk out of the EQ player base.  And I doubt EQ2 will turn it around.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">P.S.  I wonder how many people will sell short on Sony stock right when WoW comes out.<br />
You think that Everquest is more than a drop in the bucket to Sony on a large scale?  Take a look at http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/financial/ar/2003/file/e_ar2003_04.pdf and you'll notice that although Everquest is actually mentioned, it's on page 20 out of 23.  It's the last product that is mentioned in the &quot;Sony World&quot; portion of their annual report.  I would think that The Dixie Chicks bring in more money for Sony (through Sony Music) than Everquest does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">they have what, 500,000 subscribers at $15 a month, so that's 7.5 million in revenue/mo = 90 million, plus another $22.5 million or so for expansions, etc.  so estimate $125 million revenue from EQ, before expenses.  Sony's worlwide sales were $68 Billion last year (according to yahoo).  EQ revenues would be about .2% of the company's revenue.<br />
<br />
If you were cynical (which I am), you would think sony would try and maximize revenues by selling more expanisions, encouraging additional fees by paying subscribers (like server moves), and improving profits by cutting costs (no in game events, no in game customer service, &quot;can't we just outsource the servers and the customer service?&quot;).  Of course, that whole model falls apart when folks start to leave.<br />
<br />
Just to add to the cynicism, I'll start the bidding (what I think they will try and get us to pay) on EQ2's monthly fee at 19.95.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I just picked the game up CoH 10 min ago.   Just as I did this was emailed to me via a friend. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed<br />
<br />
...in the lack of problems with this game on the first day of going live. Not only was I creating my first hero with 10 minutes of cracking the seal on the game box, but I also played the ENTIRE night without a server crash or even a disconnect. As a long time EQ player, I feel I must object to this level of stability in a game system.<br />
<br />
In addition, I'd also like to see the following changes implemented so EQ players like myself can feel more at home in the game:<br />
<br />
1.) For the next couple of weeks, between the times of 3 PM EDT to 3 AM EDT, completely unplug the login server. Wait 30 minutes, then turn it back on and tell all the players that the login server is back up. If the server doesn't crash due to large volumes of people trying to log into the game, unplug it. Repeat as necessary, and after every patch. For a more permanent effect, pour coffee on the computer and/or drop it from a height of 3-4 feet.<br />
<br />
2.) After the server selection screen (but before the character selection), add a progress bar that will slowly fill over a period of 45 seconds, whether it takes that long to load or not. Also, inside the progress bar, add mildly humorous comments which only someone who watches shows like 'Barney the Purple Dinosaur' for its comedic content will laugh at.<br />
<br />
3.) Change the number of available helmet designs to one, and make that one look like a huge coffee can with a slit cut out for the eyes.<br />
<br />
4.) During gameplay, force the game's FPS to drop below 20 if more than 7 people are visible at one time.<br />
<br />
5.) In Atlas Park or King's Row, add a high lvl NPC who will attack the hero if he/she is fighting with a certain type of mob, and add a huge faction hit if the hero kills the NPC.<br />
<br />
6.) Finally, consider adding a couple of NPC's who drop really nice enhancements, then give them an 18 hour respawn time to force people to wait for hours in line to kill the NPC.<br />
<br />
And for future reference, make an expansion that only the top 10% of players on a server can access, but everyone pays for. That would be swell.</div></div><hr />
