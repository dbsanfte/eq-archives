<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally did it. I just wasn't using it any more. With PoP and being on a horse all the time and having KEI, it just wasn't worth clicking the bracer any more. DPS was just too crappy and I had extra mana all the  time. I had to be extremely lazy to ever use it. I found I was using Velium strike or rains all the time and canning rather than us the bracer. So I sold it to help the fast horse fund. And now I have Black Beauty and daaaaaaamn is he fast. I love my fast horse :)<br />
<br />
So anyone else sell theirs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Naa, still got mine. True I rarely use it, but I think I'd regret not having it anymore, like for when I'm solo'n a mob and it's like at 1 percent and all my dots have worn off and I just want to finish him off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've gone through periods where I've had the cash for it, but no one was selling :mad: hehe all depends on your timing I guess.  Although it doesn't have as much value as it used to.<br />
I make very decent exp grouping in the plains, more so, I believe, than i would be soloing in others or at the very least at the same rate but with more ease.  JBB just brings unwanted attention of mobs that hit really really hard, and in plains with them having 25khp+ and breaking root easier (unless thats just me) JBB would only be detrimental.  However, you can always find a use for Free nuking ability so it still has its worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still like mine, if only as &quot;greyed out time&quot; nuke when using rain with it's long recast timer. Mana and aggro saving, and gives you something to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
I think I'll hold onto mine. :) It was a huge deal for me to acquire one (18kpp a long time ago).  It was one of the things that kept me in game after some really trying times in the low 40's.  Getting the JBB made the game fun again at 46.  46-50 FLEW, mainly because of the JBB.  Call it a crutch or whatever, I loved having it.<br />
<br />
Now I'm 61 and readily bag it in most situations.  But I still love to use it in exp groups.  If nothing more as a forced &quot;spell spacer&quot; to keep me from getting aggro w/ a Warrior MA. ;)  Malo/Slow, epic, bane, JBB, insert offensive spell here.  It isn't amazing damage anymore, but it is steady and mana-free.  Epic isn't going to reach duration in most cases, but it also is a great &quot;spacer&quot; cast for me.  If the mob survives longer than normal, that extra damage adds in.  I don't plan on destroying my epic either, btw. ;)  Even if I ever lay hands on that nifty ToT hammer. :D  It keeps me contributing to the group after my mana's been stolen for example by a mob.<br />
<br />
I also love it when I spiritstone to Everfrost Peaks and one of those silly named skellies starts flying around me like a mosquito.  I have no offensive spells up for whatever reason, and the JBB takes him out nicely.<br />
<br />
It isn't the greatest thing any more the way it once was to me, but I don't think I'll be selling it. <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just used it this week in the Executioner trial. I alternated <br />
between our nuke and the bracer to chain cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still have mine... But I thought selling it a few times lately as I very rarely use it now...<br />
Last time I used it it was to break a root in Drunder... and my root resisted 4 blast.. go figure lol<br />
I was the only time I used it in maybe 3 months, I think it's time to get some cash from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still carry my JBB around with me bagged, didnt use it at all from 61-65, I suppose I stopped using it when I got canni5 at 60.<br />
<br />
However, I can't really bring myself to sell it; one of those sentimental items ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thought about selling mine for a while, but I do still use it for farming/factioning off greenies, where I still think its exceptionally useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I sold mine...<br />
<br />
Of course I am a lizard, and couldnt actualy use it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Berakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">know i can use t yet being only 24 but i have started collecting pieces of the JB set. how much is too much to pay for a JBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldn't pay more than 15k and I'd push towards spending around 10k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've sold three, last one was about a month back to finance my SKs cultural armor addiction.  I only ever used it a lot on raids, but spear of torment + cann5 really made it obsolete.  I don't think I'll be getting another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I loaned mine to a level 56 friend to help him solo to 60 when he cannot get a group.  The damage is just too pitiful to be of any use in the planes, and I can time my nukes, etc without the aid of the bracer, so I don't see the value for day-to-day use.  It DOES come in handy for slaughtering greens for tradeskill items, but so does a level 58 pet :D.<br />
<br />
When I get it back I will likely sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">65 and still wear and use it . with rains i  /cast1 then click jbb <br />
<br />
650<br />
650<br />
650<br />
265<br />
<br />
No matter how you slice it , its a mana free DoT at 265 every 10 seconds or so ( dpending on whatever you do). 4 clicks and you did 1k + hard to not keep that in your back pack or on your arm , for soloing its still a big deal in keeping the damage rolling while you regen mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm, never thought I'd consider getting rid of it, as it's my oldest piece of gear, but I never use it anymore.  And come to think of it, I need the cash for 65 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">just sold mine yesterday for 25k on TZ.<br />
wasn't using it.<br />
25k better spent else where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Good question, I've been asking myself the same thing recently. I think I'm gonna hold on to it, kinda like my fungi (which got loaned out for a few months and is now sitting on a twink), I just can't bring myself to sell either one. <br />
<br />
I still find myself clicking it occasionally, mainly when I have BoN loaded as my only damage spell (and I rarely have more than one damage spell loaded) and I want to do some extra damage while a dot runs it's course. If SoT is memmed, I never use it. If a rain is memmed, I very rarely use it except maybe at the end of a battle when you can't land a rain spell. I'll normally use the recast time on a rain to canni (don't have cann5 yet so that might change). <br />
<br />
It basically gives me a crappy DD that doesn't take up a spell slot and that's still useful occasionally, at least at 61. <br />
<br />
If any friends of mine where playing a 46+ shaman I'd loan it out for a while but those are all being botted and I won't give it to a Bot. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I once bought a JBB for 15k.  I loved it-- I couldn't see how one could live without it.  But then I traded it and 10k for a Dathor Great Hammer.  I kinda regretted it but Dathor Great Hammer was awesome.  I scrounged up for another one and bought it for 25k, and the Dathor Great Hammer + JBB combo was amazing!  Eventually I got epic and sold my hammer for 60k and bought other stuff with it so that great synergy was gone (thinking back though, it really wasn't that great-- I was just trying to convince myself that it was cool).<br />
<br />
Then I hit 61 and gained about 30 AAs or so, without having Torpor.  I got so desperate that eventually I traded 35k, an Obulus Deathshroud, and my beloved Jaundiced Bone Bracer for it.  I figured I would prolly not need my Jaundiced Bone Bracer as much if I had torpor.<br />
<br />
I was right!  JBB really is outdated once you get JBB and especially if you have canni 5.  In an xp group the best damage you can do is rain-- if you have a somewhat decent tank you can rain without fear of agro and still do great damage.  If you need to overburn you can cast two spear of torments between each rain (or alternate rains)-- of course, you'll agro.  But in normal situations you just don't have time to JBB.  Malosini, Turgur, Cripple, back off.. canni maybe.. rain, canni canni, rain, canni canni.. there is just no use in using a JBB and it just decreases your potential damage output since you can regenerate mana quickly with torpor and canni, and thus cast much faster more damaging spells.  I eventually replaced my empty bracer slot with a Barbed Rubicite Bracer to up my hitpoints for Canni 5.<br />
<br />
Soloing, there really isn't any point in JBBing either, especially in Tier 2 when you *want* root to stay there.  In tier 1 your dots and your pet tear up the mob quickly enough that really a JBB is pretty negligible.<br />
<br />
JBB is amazing 45-61 or so.  Past that it is pretty sucky and if you keep depending on it it will limit your potential for damage imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I sold my JBB to help finance my torpor acquisition. While it was sorta painful for a lot of reasons (mainly nostalgia), I haven't really missed it. I was afraid that my kill rate would suffer, but I actually killed mobs faster with the dots (usually bane and/or ebolt) and recovered faster after each fight. I have considered purchasing another, but will hold off until I have the more important 60+ spells and a few gear upgrades. (My hp are low from selling off some gear for malo.) Then if I have the plat to spare, I may get another, just to say I have one. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">All i know is alot of my biggest money spots are ni in PoP , these are places that im tanking the hits , or letting dog dog tank them. i guess its a tool that has a use for a certain task , in XP groups and in PoP i do find i dont use it , but fighting 50-60 or lower mobs im DoTing , jbbing and letting dogdog chew , its all about keeping the damage rolling alone in those situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sold my JBB for 25k yesterday, had bought it months ago for about 12k.  Today I saw a JBB for 21500, bought it and when I'm not actually playing it's in my trader bag for sale.  Feel kinda bad for item inflation on other shaman but I'd like either Malo or Topor, too.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i sold mine. havent thought twice about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">mine has been sitting unused in my bags for 3 months now.  Put it on my trader mule last week.<br />
<br />
I don't miss it.<br />
I never really used it that often anyway, I didnt get mine, until level 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The Day I can melee with a one handed weapon for more dmg then using JBB, SOLO, is the day I get rid of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm holding onto mine even though I use it less than once a week.<br />
<br />
I use it as a convenience nuke when I xp with a CoD charming chanter. Yes I'm still paranoid about pets and xp bugs, and I'm too lazy to mem/unmem burst of flame.<br />
<br />
The second scenario is fighting a chanter in pvp and me being totally drained dry. This is where I flaunt my shiny JBB in his face and he goes 'Ach noo, not the dreaded J-Bee-Bee. I hastily make my way to ze safe zoneline. Hlep!'.  Ermm, scratch that actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I sold mine when I get my winterstorm (180dd clicky spear off of THO).  Without my winterstorm, though, i wouldn't have sold my JBB.  I would have kept it in my bag, but never would have sold it.  I know i would regret it one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xoralundra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Still got mine. Haven't really used it since soloing in PoP took forever with little gain. Besides which it's usually just easier to nuke with Velium Strike now that, since getting Cann V, mana isn't really a consideration.<br />
<br />
However I can still envisage where it will have it's uses. It still has nice AC on it so I'll switch it out on the run from CS to ToV when I really don't want to be stunned. It's also nice that you can pull a nuke device out of your bag whilst on the run... i.e. without having to unmem something, sit down, open book and mem a nuke.<br />
<br />
Also, I figured that with PoP and all the port stones, I may as well sell my Faithstone. However the other week I was in the positioned where I needed to rebind, could have used it and regretted selling the damn thing. Same thing applies to the JBB; I'd rather it kept taking up one space in my inventory than to come to a point when I could have used it and didn't have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you powerlevel or 2 box, JBB will always have its uses.<br />
<br />
I would also wait to see whether frogloc shaman can use them, the market could chance for them dramatically if new froggie twinks can use them.  Same argument for selling fungi now. <br />
<br />
wait 2-3 weeks to sell these pivotal items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I got one and ate it !! <br />
I haven't been feeling right ever since...looking a little green and scaly these days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Might be because I'm a leezard !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">sold the day i got my THO spear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Sold it, needed money to get my enchanter that sweet looking dagger.  I don't miss it either.  Replaced it with a bracer with nice stats instead of having the the crappy stats that the jbb has.  JBB is too slow and hits like a little girl on PoP mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You know, even at my lowly level (about to ding 57th), I am thinking about it. I hardly use it anymore. Horse + cann + c2/3 means I am rarely, if ever LOM. Better to DoT/Nuke/Rain. Dunno, haven't decided yet, but I really need an equipment upgrade, and the 20 - 25k will be a nice start to my Topor fund.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well, assuming no resists (after mal* in the mythical Land of Susceptible Critters) I look at it like this:<br />
<br />
Bane:  1498 hp in 7 ticks, 425 mana.  Overall 214 hp/tick, or 35.66 dps.<br />
<br />
JBB:  1578 hp in 8 ticks, 0 mana.  Overall 197 hp/tick, or 32.88 dps.<br />
<br />
Torrent:  1620 hp in 3 ticks, 380 mana.  540 hp/tick, or 90 dps.<br />
(OK, it's actually more like 1080 hp / 3 ticks, for 60dps)<br />
<br />
JBB at any level can be a nice addition.  The trade-off for me is losing Cann time while it casts (no CanV).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">This could be good.  More JBBs going into the market for lower level shamans to purchase and enjoy.  I'm sure not using/enjoying mine lately.  Yah I'm done with it. <br />
/auc WTS JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hey guys, if one of you i son FV server and have one that he think is useless, I'd be pretty happy to have this toy (currently level 45).<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Klatcrane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I've still got mine. Anything that lets me cast without a spell slot is nice. I often have rain memmed, and rarely have room for a DD nuke too. JBB is then useful between rains (Canni V, ODS, horse - don't need canni IV much) or when we get adds and the rain would break root/mezz on the add.<br />
<br />
Its also very useful when running from A to B and some green mob aggros. I've probably got sow and focus memmed from buffing someone, and no nukes ready, no pet etc. Its also great for farming greenies - stick pet on one mob, cast jbb on another - or both on same mob for the tougher greens.<br />
<br />
I think the key point is canni V and a horse though - once you have canni V its usefulness definitely diminishes. If you have a horse too, then your mana issues are over, and the JBB becomes more a conveniance than anything else. <br />
<br />
25k would get me.... lodi shield, heiro cloak, ooiv - nice, but not game changing. Hmm, think I'll hang on a little longer, or loan it to a friend and see how I do without it.</div></div><hr />
