<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been 51 for a while, but I have not tried to get xp until now. Been doing quest camps with no xp.<br />
<br />
I just tried the TM room in EC. Clearing it twice gave me aprox 5% xp. Spawn time in this room is 20 minutes. Some of the mobs turned out to be light blue. If 5% for clearing it twice is a normal average, I would get 2 1/2 blue (10%)  in about 1 1/2 hour.<br />
<br />
Is this good/bad/normal xp at this level? I have never had a character above lvl 50 (even 24 for that matter) before.<br />
<br />
The only problem with this camp is that it is boooooring and no loot. It is also heavily camped, so finding it open is not common.<br />
