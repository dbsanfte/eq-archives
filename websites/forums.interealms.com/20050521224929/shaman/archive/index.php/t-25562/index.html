<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I the only one who doesn't remember to turn off personal tribute before they log for the night?  Is there a way to have it shut off automatically when logging? It bothers me that it just gets wasted for no reason.... I know it isn't hard to farm stuff for tribute or keep enough in the tank for when I need it but it's just one of those wasteful irritants I would like to see changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used to have the same problem, and then I got a UI mod that I absolutely love.<br />

Its beautiful in its simplicity.  I use tribute alot, and this mod has saved me thousands of tribute points, as I always turn mine off when Im not exping/raiding.<br />
<br />
[i]blarg...image isnt working.  Oh well, theres a link there too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Thorzion, I will check this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, I used to do the same thing. New mod pieces are great for solving the Tribute problem. I use Tablets Future Blue (much love for Tablets) and am considering switching out some windows so I can use Lodi Dodi (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/showthumbs.php?id=3003) because of the tribute timer in the lower right hand corner of the stat window.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know this is a bit off-topic, but is there a UI you all like that has the percentage number show on our blue mana bar?<br />
<br />
I always end up putting my mouse over the blue bar so I can see the &quot;tic&quot; when the percentage changes.... I use this so i can time my cannidancing correctly.<br />
<br />
Sure would be nice to get a great UI that shows this all the time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can package mine up if you like, but I'm done giving out tech support. It works for me, through some techno-magical anomaly (probably). It shows the mana % and the actual present and total mana pool numbers.<br />
<br />
This screenshot of the bottom right corner of my screen shows:<br />
<br />
a. Now discontinued version of Athee's hotkeys, with inventory slots<br />
<br />
b. Default spell window<br />
<br />
c. Player window (yes, I know, it shows the target; it's a mod of Thott's (yes, that Thott) ui. trust me, it works. And it flashes when in combat, but doesn't show con color.)<br />
<br />
d. Pet window (mod of old version of Fangorr's; doesn't show pet buffs because I got used to it like that) Buttons are attack, back off, guard here, follow me, sit/stand. I removed the get lost button.<br />
<br />
e. Group window, including self.<br />
e.1.a. My (your) Fkey (yellow), name (white), health % (red), mana % (blue)<br />
e.1.b. My (your) health bar (red), pet health bar (green), mana bar (blue), stamina bar (yellow) (hahaha, like that matters anymore)<br />
e.2-6.a. Groupie 2-6's Fkey (yellow), name (white), health % (red)<br />
e.2-6.b. Groupie 2-6's health bar (red), pet health bar (green) (sometimes*)<br />
<br />
d. Target window (yes, I know, it shows my (your) specific info; see note c.)<br />
d.1. HP: current (white), total (green); Mana: current (white), total (green)<br />
d.2. AC (green), Level XP % (yellow)<br />
d.3. Atk (green), AA XP % (yellow), banked AA (yellow)<br />
<br />

<br />
Note, target and player window are a set, if you only use one or the other, you'll be very sorry. Please take both or neither. The rest you can take or leave, as you like.<br />
<br />
* SUPER DUPER CAVEAT: group members' pet health bars sometimes don't show up. I gave up trying to fix that. Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thx Samanna, looks good.  psionic11@yahoo.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">http://samanna.net/ui - it's the SamannaUI.zip file.<br />
<br />
You probably will want to remove most of the other custom bits:<br />
<br />
Arista Timer UI - mp3 player window (and I think old version as friends window too); they are (and were) set for my buff durations; I'll need to recalculate durations with diminishing focus effects on newer buffs, fun. :( ...or just cast and check time left, maybe. /sigh<br />
<br />
Loot, inventory and container windows, and my customized version of bigbankwindow. Oh, and an nice compact little spellbook window. I'll post a full screenshot of all of them open after I log in tomorrow for you. <br />
<br />
Wow, didn't realize all those images were in there, must have come from UIs that I tried and didn't like. Heh. Also the storywindow mod with all the spell and quest and tradeskill data... I didn't give the support files for those, but you can get them at http://eqinterface.com if you want them. Ignore any .swp files, they're swap files from using my vi editor. (yeah, geeky)<br />
<br />
I guess just keep the EQUI_*.xml and the window_*.tga files for the ones you want; you'll need window_pieces04.tga also. I guess I really should tidy that up some. Maybe after I update the 2.0 info...<br />
<br />
Enjoy! And if you fix the phantom groupie pet health bar issue, please let me know what was wrong.<br />
<br />
Oops, I guess the spellgemwindowthingy isn't included, I think I'm using the default one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tablets (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2401)<br />
<br />
My all-time favorite UI. Very functional, not a lot of crap graphics to get in the way, windows fit together seamlessly ... Much love for Tablets!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like Lodi Dodi, but I cant use it, and for only one reason.  The cast timer is stuck at the bottom of the spell window.  I hate to have my spell timer in the middle, just above my target bar because I often have to get moving as soon as a spell is done casting.  Thats just 5 years of habit though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow,,, I feel,, so illiterate *laughs*<br />
I was proud when I finaly got a custom target circle and a single, self only, custom numerical HP/Mana/Endurance bar working =)<br />
<br />
*decides to play with these a little*</div></div><hr />
