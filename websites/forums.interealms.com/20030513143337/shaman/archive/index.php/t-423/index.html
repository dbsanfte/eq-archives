<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all- looking for some help in trying to solve this quest. I have 3 snake organs from Shissar Stalkers in The Grey. You are able to turn these in to a gent in Katta Castellum ( Sp ) and recieve a decent Necklace which has EB effect. I am an Iksar shammie though and thus am KOS - is there any way to fudge my way thru to be able to get this item- As soon as I try to trade, I get attacked and even trying to do this invis -well same thing- when you hand someone something your invis poofs and you are close enough to aggro- any help would be greatly appreciated!!- And Yes I am aware that I can cast eb  it would take that extra lvl of grief ofF my mind when I am hunting there though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get a friendly druid to go with you.<br />
<br />
You go in invis.<br />
Druid casts harmony on him. His agro range in now 1 foot.<br />
You open trade window from maximum trade range.<br />
Druid casts invis on you. You now have indifferent faction.<br />
You hit trade.<br />
You get the necklace and the faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That worked wonderfully. I am now the proud owner of an EB necklace. Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I couldn't get guts to drop ;/<br />
<br />
Killed about 20 of those friggin snakes and got 0 guts before I got tired of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where do you guys set up camp to kill the snakes, i kept trying to upll from the center of zone (near Ssraezza sp? Temple) and got like 5 snakes each time i tried to pull with cancel magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's the best spot for snakes Walruss, it's tough to do solo till you're higher in level.  Bring a good group and you can pull around the castle and have a fun time of it.<br />
<br />
That's an awesome idea on the harmony trick, I'd never thought of doing that before.  So many nifty things I've been missing out on =)  Is there a level cap on mobs that can be harmonied?</div></div><hr />
