<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did they change the exp modifier of this zone?<br />
<br />
I use this zone to lvl up from 26 to 33 on my characters and when I went there the other night with my troll shaman, the exp blew.<br />
<br />
I took a break about 9months ago, but before I left, I was under the impression the zone was considered a newbie zone and had a great exp modifier.  They did a few revampings of zones, but I wasn't sure if the swamp got hit by em.<br />
<br />
Guess I'm off to find another hunting ground :(<br />
<br />
Oh...another thing that pissed me off.  Before where I was hunting, the only thing that would aggro you were the skeles, frogs and the occassional iksar npc that pathed through.  Now I have plants, mosquitoes, etc that are aggro.  What the hell?  All around, it looks like they ruined this spot.  To bad...it was great back months ago.  Never had to worry about fighting over a camp...no one else was in the zone :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They did change it around some so I am sure they twinked it here and there.<br />
<br />
They moved the HS frog out of the caves. Put blue to 60 sperms in the water before the TT zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">grr..that's a damn shame too.<br />
<br />
That zone used to be awesome for late 20's to early 30's.  Nice quiet, and the exp flowed like wine.<br />
<br />
*sigh* <br />
<br />
Oh well, guess I'll give Netherbian lair another shot.  Just seems like those mobs in there regen like crazy.  I had to keep 2 dots on them at all times to even kill the little buggers.  I've gained a few lvls since I've tried it, so I guess tonight I'll give it another shot.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Watch out for those angry sperms... I saw a monk running away from them toward TT.  I wasn't that worried, until 2 of them dropped me before I could turn around.  It never occured to me that there would be things doubling for 330 in the swamp of no hope  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/grrrrr<br />
<br />

<br />
Dem frogs where a nice spot.</div></div><hr />
