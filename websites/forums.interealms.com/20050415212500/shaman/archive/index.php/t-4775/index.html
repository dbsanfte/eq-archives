<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the past few weeks I've been experiencing seemingly random crashes to the desktop while using the new UI within EQ.  Switching back to the older UI seemed to solve this problem for a while, but then the crashes started up again.<br />
<br />
In order to resolve this issue I upgraded from:<br />
<br />
AMD 1900+ processor<br />
Soyo Dragon Motherboard<br />
SB Audigy sound card<br />
WindowsXP<br />
512mb DDR Ram<br />
<br />
to:<br />
<br />
Intel 2Ghz processor<br />
ASUS Motherboard<br />
onboard audio<br />
WindowsXP<br />
1024mb DD Ram<br />
<br />
I expected this to resolve my problem, but the crashes started up again even with a fresh installation.  There are no third party programs running in the background, or installed.<br />
<br />
Logic would dictate the crashing problem is graphics card related.  The problem is either: graphics card settings in the system bios, or the card itself.  Since I am using reference drivers from nVidia, I find it unlikely the drivers are at fault.<br />
<br />
Being a bit of a graphics card addict, I try tweaking for the best performance.  I believe the setting that is causing the problem on both systems is the AGP Graphics Aperture setting.  I had it set to 256mb when installing the board, and have since scaled it back to 64mb with no crashes as of yet.<br />
<br />
Needless to say this is an expensive lesson, but I hope this helps those of you out there with similar issues.<br />
<br />

Gotta love it...</div></div><hr />
