My hand hurts from manually removing the rest of the spam, such as the &quot;Guards!! Guards!!&quot; and &quot;Vabeker begins to cast a spell.&quot; that made up about 75% of the lines of text during this parse ~_~.<br />
<br />
Cutting to the chase, that's 277 procs during the 10 minute parse, or just under 28 procs per minute. assuming Panther hits for 550 every time (and it should at -300 chromatic) that's 254 dps by keeping it up on our pet if he's buffed properly. I have a feeling the dex from focus/champ makes a big difference for NPCs somehow, whereas on PCs dex seems to have less of an impact. Parses of the effects of cripple spells tend to support this line of reasoning.<br />
<br />
One thing's for certain, keeping this on every pet on the raid is massive, massive sickening DPS, and while it's a lot of work to do so, it's definitely going to be the source of rogue/wizard bitching.</div></div><hr />

 :eek: <br />

<br />
Manually? Sheesh. I am pretty sure Word/Open Office can remove among the lines of &quot;anything but lines that begin wit xxx&quot;. Failing that, if you plan on doing any more parses like that install a programming language with regular expression support and ask someone to write you the 5 lines of code that will do the work for you. Heck, install PHP+Apache (both free) and I will happily explain how to write programs like that - it is beyond easy.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just in case anyone wants to try it out. Apache HTTP server download (http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi), PHP download (http://www.php.net/downloads.php). Download both (Anyone who can not figure this stuff out in a minute on his own should just get the windows binaries). Install apache. Install PHP. Start Apache. Start your web browser. Type &quot;localhost&quot; or &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; in the adress bar and hit enter. You should see the standard apache homepage. Open the httpd.default.conf file in the apache/conf direcotry, add the lines <br />
&quot;LoadModule php4_module &lt;php file path here&gt;/sapi/php4apache.dll&quot;<br />
and<br />
&quot;AddType application/x-httpd-php .php&quot;<br />
Restart apache. PHP should now work. in the &quot;htdocs&quot; directory add a plain text file, save it as test.php. Add the following line to it:<br />
&lt; ?php echo &quot;php working&quot;; ? &gt;<br />
without the spaces between ? and &gt;<br />
Point your browser to localhost/test.php&quot;. You should see &quot;php working&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do hope I did not forget anything important there. I has been a while since I last installed these. I am happy to help in PMs if this does not work though.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: php tags and message boards do not play nice together.</div></div><hr />

I was always wondering this myself, until I keeped on hearing this quote &quot;Can I have panther please (or on my pet), MY dps is insane with it&quot;<br />
<br />
I think its kind of funny, how we think we are the one that is doing the extra dps because we own the spell, yet the people we cast this spell on think they are doing the dps, because it shows it on their screen.  So, since EVERYONE thinks that they are actually doing the dps, everyone is happy.  This is probably the most ironic spell in EQ.</div></div><hr />

As long as we don't have other classes start whining about how over-powered we are, I'll be very happy. If it takes a buff that increases the party or raid's DPS without it being directly linked to us to make us more valuable, I'm all for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This is just an easily measurable way of calculating DPS.<br />
<br />
Since attack and haste add DPS a case could be made about who's DPS is it that results.  This is just simple to measure, but if you want to claim DPS claim the boosted damage a melee does from attack buffs as well.<br />
<br />
The person is only doing DPS as long as they are alive and actually attacking as well.  So it really is an indirect way to add to someones elses DPS I would think because so much more is dependant on what the other person (pet) does after it receives the buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If I can claim half of the spell's DPS and keep it on 5 meleepets, I'll still be out-DPSing my guild members. I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'll quote myself from the other thread.  I firmly believe any damage dealt by Maw procs is the shaman's dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't guage this against other proc buffs, because it doesn't work the same way. Other proc buffs tack on a pretty inconsistent 5-15dps over half an hour to an hour. In other words, those act like proper buffs. These spells do active-level dps on par with nukes and dots, in exchange for active involvement, just like nukes and dots. <br />
<br />
Buffs are long term power boosts for a character, raising/enhancing their innate abilities. You can run, but with SoW you run faster. You have some hp, but with a buff on you have more. You swing your sword, but with Avatar you swing it better. The Maw line is different from that. It's big-time damage, and it's not the character carrying it that does the damage, it's the shaman. <br />
<br />
It's like you set a rat on fire and let it go. You didn't give the rat a shot of caffiene and testosterone to make him stand up and kick some ass, you put YOUR destructive power on his back and sent him in. It may look to the enemy like the rat blew up, and so he's awfully mad at that rat. But it was YOUR firepower that did the burning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">your dps is entirely dependant on others participation. if they don't swing, or fail to send in their pet then your additional dps is 0.<br />

Stop trying to make it one or the other, it's a symbiotic dps relationship in which both parties win. Isn't that good enough?</div></div><hr />

Well, its on the way to being that, thanks to &quot;loud mouth&quot; Grizlor  .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gargunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">If you believe this post and this post alone will make the devs change panther/leopard then you're wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
No no bud.  They are right.  Grizlors post will no doubt change the face of EQ as we know it!  There would have been no way for a Wiz with a Shm alt to do the parse on their own!  It was Grizlor who did it, and it would have been only him!.<br />
<br />
No Wiz with this info on their own would have thought to post it, nor would they even be upset once they did find out.<br />
<br />
Grizlor is the our bane.../yells for Grizlor to be stripped  and given the tar and feather treatment.<br />
<br />
/dunb$hit mode off.<br />
<br />
Get real buddy, Griz only provided info for the few shammies that did not know what was up and maybe let them have a moment of fun before the spell gets nerfed.  You just want all the fun for as long as you can.<br />
<br />
This sight is for Shm info, and that is clearly what Griz has given.  Sorry if it messes with your uberness.  Others do not come here to hear about how cool you are and how lame Griz is.<br />
<br />
I happen to think they will not nerf the spell and if they do it will not be by much.  Thats just what i think and i could be wrong.  You see, i am not a developer, rather a player, and I let them worry about what it is they feel they need to do...I will figure out how to have fun with my Shm one way or another and no one spell is going to change that.<br />
<br />
Anyway sorry for spelling and grammer, I am rushed...take care and relax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>keltor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Heck.... I hope the DEVs &quot;nerf&quot; it and change it to a 275 damage proc, costing 325 mana and lasts 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">This argument is pretty silly.  How many shaman out there can keep this up on more than 5 people for long periods of time?  How many on more than 3?  It's a 1 minute spell.  AAs and gear make it last longer, just like they do for every other buff.  That's the point of AAs and gear focus.  <br />
<br />
A 69 shaman with no AAs and not in a raiding guild would be lucky to keep it up on 2 people continuously.  It's nice burst dps.  It procs a lot on pets.  It procs far less on me than them, that's for sure.   Proc AAs don't effect the proc-rate.  It's nice for exp groups with melee, sure.  It's nice for named mobs on raids, no doubt.  <br />
<br />
It's not what we asked for but it is kind of fun and it is useful.  I was very doubtful when i read the spell description before I had the spell.  When I saw the proc rate for myself I became a believer but it's not some end all dps spell.  It has serious limitations.  <br />
<br />
You can still stack 10 wizards on a raid.  10 shaman aren't gonna work.  3 maybe.  Certainly not the same.  So wizards can still solo exp way faster.  Wizards still stack better for raids...but maybe they won't get groups as easily?  So what...</div></div><hr />

Seriously, Grizlor. Damn you for giving us useful information. Some of us are obviously too inept to appreciate it.<br />

That post by Grizlor was proven to be fake, as no other Shaman with this spell was EVER able to get their pet to proc at that rate. Chances are, Grizlor is just a bored child that wanted some attention, by stirring up some trouble. (please dont give him or his post anymore attention, as that is exactly what his is looking for)<br />
Ask any (mature) shaman that has this spell if you dont believe me.<br />
<br />
Haha, here's the whole log. My UI doesn't have pet buff timers, so I kinda just randomly rebuffed the pet throughout the fight to be absolutely sure it didn't wear off.<br />

<br />
This one from Warbear was, in particular, a real gem:<br />
<br />
I knew this would happen when &quot;loud mouth&quot; Grizlor posted that. If the Devs nerf this spell, I am going to make sure EVERY SINGLE Shaman know it was because of him, and his stupid post. The smart thing for him to do is at least edit his post, but that would mean Grizlor would acutally have to think before he posts.<br />
<br />
Looks like you thought long and hard before you posted that. Are you also going to make sure &quot;EVERY SINGLE Shaman know&quot; about Grizlor's contributions to this community over the years? Grow up.<br />
<br />
Griz: You contributed more than your fair share to this community over the years, and I will be the first to stand up and say, &quot;Thanks for being a loudmouth.&quot; I always thought you were at your best when you were going on about something. Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I thought folks on here, like warbear, were joking in their comments to Grizlor.<br />
<br />
If they weren't then they are placcy hat wearing tards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">from graffe:<br />
Here's the beef:<br />
<br />
Test was done in a controlled enviornment. No AEs, no Enrage, Rampage, or any crap like that.<br />
Pet was buffed with Focus and Champion so it quite obviously had max dex<br />
From all estimates, pets and other NPCs process weapons and buffs about 3 times as much as players do. Try fighting the ghoul lord, I guarantee if you let him he'll proc ykesha far more than 2x per fight :P<br />
People bitching about this spell have no clue about the shaman class. Considering our other responsibilities come first, the quantity of dps we can add to any sort of actual, non controlled fight is significantly less. PCs proc this roughly 10 times per minute or so. Casting panther on pets during raids is usually the best, but the pets probably aren't buffed and almost certainly don't have champion.<br />
This is probably one of the first truly symbiotic spells in the game, as it strongly depends on what the thing we cast it on does to determine its usefulness. Given the tendancy of other people to do things like, um... die (especially on raids, and especially among pets), I'd say you folks are getting your panties in a wad.<br />
<br />
from graffe:<br />
<br />
While we're bitching about spells that are stupidly efficient let's examine these two:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.ht...521&amp;source=Live<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.ht...522&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
one chanter providing 1/3 your raid's dps for 2kish mana every hour makes panther look retarded<br />
edit: I guess an enchanter would have to scroll voice of clair, but my point still stands<br />
<br />
from graffe:<br />
If anyone should be complaining about DoN spells it's necros, as wizards now have a super efficient damage spell, with a decent resist modifier... which absolutely destroys the benefits of damage over time spells because claw of vox does it all in one shot and has no recast like the solist line did.<br />
<br />
Lastly, panther is a buff, people ask for it, and it's highly annoying in that manner. You guys can complain about this spell fairly when you start seeing this:<br />
<br />
<br />
You first post how uber we can be with that parse to the whole world.  Then you try to rectify that large dps # by fighting with Wizzards, saying how annoying and useless it is to cast in on people/pets (when you have already showed how usefull it really is).<br />
Well, at least you can see now, that braging about something only leads to trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Grizlor's numbers were basically from a test done in a vacuum. The problem is that a couple of those wizards at Graffes seem to think they can just take that number and multiply it by whatever they like and call that our dps. Never mind that some of the numbers they use are impossible or just downright wrong...they have a lot of numbers they can just toss around themselves that make a nice smokescreen to get their fellow wizards up in arms.<br />
<br />
...and their replies to Grizlor are down right comical. lol, one guy dismisses Grizlor's response because they want our spell. Yeah, I want a lot of other classes spells too. I guess that's not that bad compared to the guy telling Grizlor to go kill himself though. That guy is a real winner.<br />
<br />
Whatever, there's no denying these spells are good and a great addition to what a shaman can do so you just know you're going to get the standard whinning, crying, prissy BS that plague most EQ boards.</div></div><hr />

And this is why we need the rep system back. That post deserves a bump or five. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">warbear, bearage and anyone else who does not want information like this to spread:<br />
<br />
We should be happy for every bit of knowledge about the game that we can get our hands on. With the way Verant and SOE have handled the game pretty much all the information we have comes from the players. That also means that until we collect enormous amounts of data we can not even begin to second-guess SOE's class balance.<br />
<br />
I for one want to know when monks outdamage and outtank every other melee (pre-Kunark), when clerics are only useful for rezzing and raids (Kunark), when wizard teams can outdo balanced raids (Velious), when shaman do so well in current content you want 2 or 3 of them in every non-AE group (Luclin), when entire classes are unfinished (beastlords and berserkers shortly after their introduction). I want to know about that just as much, if not more, than I want to know about zone crashing bugs, bugged raid encounters and buff stacking. Class balance is one of the most important aspects of EQ (and every other multiplayer game) and any underpowered and overpowered issues need to be made public knowledge.<br />
<br />
After all how can we claim that we want our class fixed if we at the same time try to hide the DPS this new spell lets us do? If it is indeed overpowered it needs to be toned down. If it is not, why fear other classes knowing about it? There is basically 3 possibilities:<br />
1) the spell is overpowered and SOE decides to nerf it<br />
2) the spell is not overpowered and is not changed<br />
3) the spell is not overpowered and SOE decides to nerf it<br />
<br />
In case 1 the spell deserves to be nerfed. I do not want special treatment in this regard. And we might even get improvements in other areas as a slight compensation (or at least a reasonable duration for the spell).<br />
<br />
In case 2 nothing changes except we have now made public how much DPS we do, which should be good for getting groups.<br />
<br />
And in case 3 (SOE nerfing the spell solely because of whining), well, in that case we will get nerfed about 2 weeks earlier then we would have otherwise (which is when the first shaman bot would have parsed panther DPS). And we do avoid the possibility of some bard bot rigging the numbers to show that shamans do 45040 DPS while healing a raid MT.<br />
<br />
To sum up: I can see no reason to not parse and post things like this. I can however see reasons for it, not the least of which is keeping the moral high ground.</div></div><hr />

And we might even get improvements in other areas as a slight compensation = Are you kidding me ?  I am sure you know as well as everyone else, that this is SOE were talking about.  I mean come on, we have been asking for compensation for slow midigation ever since PoP came out.  How long ago was that ?!<br />
The only thing they ever did was separate our healing capabilities even further from Druids.<br />
<br />
(or at least a reasonable duration for the spell). = I dont understand how 1:30+ isnt reasonable.  Our bane only lasts for 0:30 and our poison dot only lasts for 0:42, not to mention you can only start casting a DoT after a mob is slowed.  With Panther you have more then enough time to cast this before the mob gets in camp.</div></div><hr />

I've mostly used this spell in groups when I'm not the main healer. I usually try to sustain this spell on my pet at least. Pets first since they proc it more often.<br />
<br />
I'm personally very happy that I finally have a spell that increases melee's damage a significant amount. When I began playing EQ the idea I got about the shaman class was that we increased melee damage significantly more than any other class could (maybe it had something to do with Avatar being called the &quot;ultimate melee buff&quot;).<br />

griz, i think they did have some valid points about their class issues. i played a time geared 70 wizard for an exstended period of time. I'd take a like geared/AAed mage over a wizard even pre-DoN (imo mage DPS is better than wizards dps) =p Wizards are suffering from their lack of utility and with a shaman in the group they see a tenancy to go melee heavy (personally i would say pet class heavy, but whatever...)  if this is true i see nothing wrong with it....with a BL, bard, or chanter in the group instead of a shaman, the group goes caster heavy due to the mana regen avalable...<br />
<br />
all that being said, i don't think most of them grasp the actual limitations of panther.  the guy posting that since we have the best active mana regen in the game this spell is over powered is way off.  Keeping panther up and mobs debuffed cut into our active mana regen time...  To keep this up on a group with a few melees and a few pets is difficult and makes playing REALY stressfull imo.  to be honest, with the gear/AAs i have now, i am losing mana faster than i gain it back when i am cycling this spell on everyone. Even with Spirit Channeling considered, i am depleating mana faster than it comes back.  this is the same idea as a wizard nukeing + meleeing which seem OH so bad on the gaffe forums (mana usage vs mana regen)... it is really all perspective i guess...<br />
<br />
not to mention, i think most of them view a shaman as easy to play as a wizard... wizards can be macroed VERY easiely even without 3rd party programs. i use to hotkey my wizard and play him to 95-98% capability...  even with 3rd part programs macroing a shaman is nearly impossible (i actually looked into it=p) i don't think they understand that 90% of shaman wont even come close to using panther to its full potential, not to forget that due to gear/aa limitations most cant anyway.  this varies in a large way to a wizards, say, 68 magic nuke that most people can just click and cast to full potential...<br />
<br />
anyway, you were really over there picking fights after a while.  you know this =p</div></div><hr />

Heh. I'm going the sneaky route - on Tuesday's raids (TT and Grummus), I kept S.Leopard up on our raid leaders (Paladin, Monk, Warrior). They each commented about how much DPS it was. <br />

Hopefully I'll get special detail duty on future raids of keeping this up on 6 or 8 toons best I can, and popping Spiritual Channelling to keep it up full time on 8 or 10 toons for the last 5 minutes of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Griz, f@%#$ em. If it gets nerfed it gets nerfed, and I wont complain because its MEGA powerful. I like it the way it is, but I wont complain. <br />
<br />
EQ is a game of evolving adjustment. Classes, spells, abilities, etc come and go, get nerfed and get bumped up, etc etc etc etc. Panther-Leopard is MOSTLY balanced due to the short duration. The ONLY nerf I could see is a small recast timer. <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Honestly guys. Some of you are acting like you won the lottery, and IF they take taxes out, your gonna BITCH UP A STORM. We got a bump. A HUGE bump. If the &quot;powers that be&quot; decide its TOO big, and make a modification, well, welcome to EQ, hope this isnt your first day. But don't complain about getting 1,000,000 Dollars because you started with 4,000,000 and someone came along and took 3,000,000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The wizard issue has been the same since Velious. Wizard DPS needs to be balanced against that of the other DPS classes, that much is clear. What is not clear is how this should be done. What classes to balance against? What kind of gear? With full spells? What about foci? Resists? How much better is ranged damage vs melee damage? Should burst damage be balanced? Or ustained damage? Both? Neither? What outside buffs should be assumed?<br />
<br />
And all of that is made more complicated by the small amount of utility wizards have. Clearly some utility is better the none, and much is better then some. What is not clear is how to balance utility vs DPS.<br />
<br />
And thus we end up with statements ranging from wizards outdamaging everyone else to wizards being the worst DPS class - and they may all be correct, depending on situation, group makeup, expansion, gear, buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
And on top of the whole wizards vs rogues vs monks vs rangers mess we have charm pets which make everyone look silly, wildly varying dependance on buffs, wildly varying levels of usefulness of some of these classes utility, (some) druids wanting to nuke close to wizards, (some) clerics wanting to nuke as good as wizards vs undead and so on.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the only way to balance this whole mess is to give every class in this game (and there is already way too many of them) the same amount of DPS/Healing, scalable abilities (slow, haste, tanking, etc) and utility. You can not balance healing vs slow, haste vs nukes or in the case of wizards, burst DPS vs long term DPS or DPS vs utility. It is hard enough to balance utility vs utility, or different kinds of DPS vs each other - jumping between categories won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I mean come on, we have been asking for compensation for slow midigation ever since PoP came out. <br />
Are you saying we havent gotten ANY compensation recently? You wanna bitch about PoP, fine, but you cant reasonably complain about OoW. No way. We got a nice chunk of utility there for the &quot;Uberness of Slow&quot; being reduced. <br />
<br />
This crap wears me out. No wonder I barely come here anymore, now that I am a bit busier in RL. This was the first board to get the &quot;ax&quot; in my daily routine, and its comments like this that create it. <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does it seem like there are &quot;sects&quot; in every single class that think THEIR chosen class should be the biggest baddest class in the game. <br />
<br />
Leopard and Panther are EXTREMELY powerful spells. It would SHOCK me if there wasnt ANY adjustment made on this line. Such is the way of spells this strong. If they add a 1 second re-cast, all you nay-sayers please leave the game, so I can get more groups.<br />
You can not balance healing vs slow, haste vs nukes or in the case of wizards, burst DPS vs long term DPS or DPS vs utility. It is hard enough to balance utility vs utility, or different kinds of DPS vs each other - jumping between categories won't work.<br />
Hear Here. Thank you Murtak. Saddly, your opinion is not only the minority, its the FRINGE EXTREMIST minority, the Ralph Nader of EQ. <br />

I am with you though, 100%. This game is IMPOSSIBLE to balance. I really dont understand how everyone cannot see this, and accept a nerf here and a bump there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I did over 534 dps in a 17min fight last night (warden hanvar) which accounted for 552k dmg.  NERF ME!!!!<br />
<br />
Not to mention my pet did more dps than all but 7 guildees.<br />
<br />
Really, all that this spell does is make it so that the fights end that much quicker, and so that it gives me a slightly different role in teh game.  It's a great spell for us, if you are willin to take the time to cast it.  I'll admit it, when I'm in the group lately, I would rather have more melees than casters, unless they have pets :)  <br />
<br />
Actually I did fret the other day when the gods gave me two sks in a group in the nest.  That sucked for a bit hehe.<br />
<br />
The spells are great for me.  I spent the entire fight chain casting it on everyone I can.  With any real fight though I literally have to use every means necessary to keep the mana up, which usually involves chain rod, canni5, ancient ancient canni, sc.. whatever I can and mos of the time I'm still near oom if not oom by the end of the fight.  But, you know what.. i love it.  it's fun.  I've always been on of those shaman that did whatever he could to maximize my dps on fight (bane, sisslak and chaining rains) and this is my new favorite method of improving dps.  <br />
<br />
Look it really doesn't matter what happens.  Mages, beastlords and necros will like the spell because for them it improves their pets dps.  Had a mage pet last night that ranked 6th in overall dps, and that didn't include any procs that the owner had casted on his pet.<br />
<br />
Then again, the warden hanvar fight is very much a strictly melee fight fight, even with the huge slow.  Warden's resists are very high overall but the slow doesn't affect melee as much as the resists affect casters.  That fight I used to be able to go the entire fight and do more dmg with pestilence striek then I would by chain casting spells.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is going to be able to keep this spell up like I'm doing.  not everyone will like to do it.  I don't mind it, but that's me.  The real only thing that totally sucks for me about this spell, is that my pet loves to break my root with it.  Mob dies, pet runs to the rooted add and instantly breaks root. .... ****ing pet.</div></div><hr />

I thought the SK issue was resolved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">no, check out my post on the issue.  There has been two problems with the shadow knights.  The first problem was that panther/leopard didn't proc when casted on a shadow knight.  After the patch, the sks were able to proc leopard, however, the coding for panther was fubared for sks and they started proccing Banish Intruder, which is basically a port to bind.  So no, it has not been fixed yet unless it was ninja fixed this morning, and I doubt that since I'm sure it will be involved on the next real patch.<br />
<br />
oh.. I'm too lazy to go buy leopard since I received panther (not bragging, but I was one of the first serverwide that received it.. not really knowing that I was going to get it until it appeared on my cursor).  Besides, I'm saving all my extra crystals for my beastlord, since he can still use some of the equipment/procs as upgrades.<br />

Btw.. where is that thread on graffe's located.  I'm still trying to find it, although I know that it was locked.. i just want to read how it started and ended.</div></div><hr />

Funnily enough, in spite of all my rants on class balance, I consider EQ to be a pretty well-balanced game, considering the unbelievably crappy base design (in terms of class roles that is).<br />
<br />
I have played plenty of pen &amp; paper RPGs and pretty much all of them, DnD, Shadowrun, World of Darkness, DSA - 90+% of them are horribly unbalanced. I could write a dozen pages simply listing the various infinity loops existing in DnD and then go on for 20 more pages with nice examples of completely useless skills, classes that make you worse at what the class is supposed to be good at, random powerups for classes that already kick everyone else's ass and so on.<br />
<br />
The difference is of course that there is no DM in EQ to hand out the artifact to the player who took the sucky class, to take away the infinity loops from the casters and to provide a decent mixture of challenges to the players. SOE has to do all of that and overall they are doing a pretty good job, especially considering what they are working with. The one thing I can really fault them for (and this is big) is not adequately listening to customer feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">&quot;infinity loops in DnD&quot;? How can you have or use a loop in a role playing game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for the record, I'm pretty sure I locked the thread.  BOTH sides were getting whiney, and we have a few rules against language, trolling and such.<br />
<br />
Your post was useful.  I can assure you that many wizards do understand the limitations of not having a large enough sample size and reptitive parses.  Minor variable skew the results dramatically.  Parses are an excellent tool, but not an entire &quot;answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just from reading this thread I can see that it's not exactly a unified front here either.  We have our fair share of hotheads at Graffe.  In the future the proper way to respond to an aggravating post is to hit the report function on the post.  I, or another moderator, will take care of the situation.<br />
<br />
I started a thread on the official Sony Boards in the wizard section.  Please feel free to comment there as well.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I am not advocating a nerf on the spell.  I have said that I actually think the spell is a neat idea.  I saw earlier in this thread a comment that it probably would decrease the desire of a group to grab a wizard.  This is my chief concern.  Even in that post they talk about the legendary ability of a wizard to solo.  I can assure you it is not all its cracked up to be.  I am not complaining about my need for increased soloaility.  However, it is not anywhere on par with group xp.  Yes other classes can not even do the modest amount of soloing of either of our primary classes.<br />
<br />
I did not come here to argue the merits of the spell, I came here to ask for a bit of consideration from the wizards perspective and how this spell affects wizards.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually of the opinion that wizards need a boost, or rogues need a bit of a cut at the extreme high end. or both.<br />
<br />
Some people might ask what my mission is, since the first post in this thread could be seen as bragging, and my arguments at graffe might try to imply that I'm trying to hide this.<br />
<br />
Neither is true. My mission is truth and enlightenment, and when people post or otherwise try to convince people of things that are not accurate, that's where I stepped in.<br />
<br />
The solo bit is funny, though. i.e. the fact that you post &quot;soloing is not all it's cracked up to be&quot; on this forum, when we're well aware of that ourselves, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Are you saying we havent gotten ANY compensation recently? You wanna bitch about PoP, fine, but you cant reasonably complain about OoW. No way. We got a nice chunk of utility there for the &quot;Uberness of Slow&quot; being reduced.  <br />
<br />
This crap wears me out. No wonder I barely come here anymore, now that I am a bit busier in RL. This was the first board to get the &quot;ax&quot; in my daily routine, and its comments like this that create it. <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does it seem like there are &quot;sects&quot; in every single class that think THEIR chosen class should be the biggest baddest class in the game. <br />
<br />
Leopard and Panther are EXTREMELY powerful spells. It would SHOCK me if there wasnt ANY adjustment made on this line. Such is the way of spells this strong. If they add a 1 second re-cast, all you nay-sayers please leave the game, so I can get more groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only new utilities we have from OOW are:<br />
  <br />
Champion - Not bad, but some of us arent sure if the small increase in damage (only 5% if you figure in them already haveing Lion's Strength) and short duration is worth the large amount of mana.  I do cast this on the Rogues though, just to keep them happy.<br />
  <br />
Talisman of Might - They gave Druids this exact same spell. <br />
  <br />
Vindictive Spirit - AE 50% slow that last for a total of 18 seconds.  Most shaman would rather spend the time casting the TA on each mob rather then trying to fool around with this.<br />
 <br />
Pure Spirit - Not even sure what the heck this spell cures.  Tried it once, casted it 4 times before it cured something that my RC3 cured in 1 cast<br />
<br />
Talisman of Fortitude - adds a total of 80 hp (at least on spell casters)<br />
 <br />
Talisman of Sense - supposed to help with mobs missing you, but no one has said that it makes much of a difference, nor do people ask for this much(which is kind of a good thing).<br />
  <br />
Spirit Veil - What they first did, is dramatically increase the fade rate of regular invisable, so they have a reason to give us another one. (I am sure you have noticed this)<br />
 <br />
Putrid Decay - By all logic, they should have not of even given us this spell.  It does not go with our disease debuff line up, nor is there a resist modifier on this.  This is a necro spell, what is a shaman going to do with it ?<br />
<br />
The rest of our OOW spells are just upgrades to our regular spell line up, which carry the same problems.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't refering to your posts.  I was refering to...<br />
You can still stack 10 wizards on a raid.  10 shaman aren't gonna work.  3 maybe.  Certainly not the same.  So wizards can still solo exp way faster.  Wizards still stack better for raids...but maybe they won't get groups as easily?  So what...<br />
<br />
Maybe GrishMT isn't part of the &quot;we&quot; in your statement, but I have to speak to the whole board.  It is the last two lines of his quote which is creating the issue.  Wizards already suffered from poor grouping desireability. This spell is hitting us wizards where it hurts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Wizards and Shamans fill completely different roles. A shaman is primarily a slower, and a wizard is primarily a DPSer.<br />
<br />
If you have a caster heavy group, this spell does nothing. You would be much better off getting an enchanter for the mind buffs as well as the slows.<br />
<br />
If you have a melee heavy group, this spell is amazing. The pet itself will do 250 DPS (As shown by the parse) and every melee gets a nice 80-100 DPS boost.<br />
<br />
There is NO point in getting a 2nd shaman. If I have a group make up like so:<br />
<br />
Tank, Cleric, Enchanter, DPS, Puller ... The last spot would most likely be filled by another DPS.<br />
<br />
If I had a group make up like<br />
<br />
Tank, Cleric, Shaman, DPS, DPS .. The last spot would most likely be filled by another DPS as shaman do not stack in groups.<br />
<br />
If the problem is that there are too many DPS classes that fit the role which causes your grouping problems, then that is a completely different issue. This spell does NOT take anything away from your grouping desirability.<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet that we won't see any. Tank Cleric Shaman Shaman Shaman Shaman groups anytime soon because of this spell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Every class claims that it has lousy group desireability. Even the Clerics. I think that's decent enough balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is some classes are correct in their claims.<br />
<br />
While I do believe 95% of people make groups with just friends and don't care who they group with, wizards are not nearly as desirable in groups as clerics or shamans.</div></div><hr />

Necros are under-appreciated, wizzies need a group-boost (they've been on SoE's sh*tlist since Team Manaburn), berzerker's must not be any fun since high level ones are still ultra rare, monks are still on the decline... <br />
<br />
Except for the slow mitigation idiocy and the difficulty of getting Alchemy past 255, I'm happy being a Shaman. Other classes aren't faring so well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Just for information - my original comments to Grizlor was not to be nasty particularly at Grizlor - but more to make a point that sometimes it's better not to say anything.  For example, I personally know of many useful things that are in DoN and it is very likely for you all to find them - however if you post on a public board which Sony employees do read from time to time then it's just going to cause an investigation.<br />
<br />
Since now the whole thing has blown up on both this forum and the others then I'd say that if Sony do decide to reconsider the spell I'd like to suggest that:<br />
<br />
The spell when cast on player casters adds bonus % dps to their casts.  If the spell is cast on pets/melee it adds the proc as it does now.  This means that the wizards, mages etc will be 'uber useful' as currently a shaman is with a full pet group.<br />
<br />
It's quite funny - the other day I told two druids in my raid to raise their bear pets.  You know why right?    Well  I think we can please all IF then allow us to buff the nukers to improve their damage in the same short duration but high dps way that we can currently do for pets.<br />
<br />
I don't think the spell is too powerful - I too can cast it a number of times before going OOM - but other posters are right - it will burn your bar - although you feel like you are really making some input to groups and raids - and I think this spell was justified - I don't think it needs a nerf at all - I think they just need to allow us to buff the nukers with it too.<br />

<br />
The rest of our OOW spells are just upgrades to our regular spell line up, which carry the same problems.<br />
<br />
1) Champion stacks with the might line now according to Lucy, so its 10%, not 5%<br />
<br />
2) Druids dont have talisman of might, they have a single target spell that does the same thing, not a group version. Not surprising that druids have the single target one since the might line is an evolutionary change from STR buffs, which druids also have. Dont make me explain to you why group spells are superior to single target versions, or I'll have to take your shaman license away ;)<br />
<br />
3) Vindictive spirit is a situational spell, which has its uses. It is not intended as a replacement for our front line spells.<br />
<br />
4) Pure spirit is a single target cure for detrimental spells. If you dont know what those are, I'd suggest re-rolling ;). Usefull for pets, people out of group, when RC is down etc etc. Obviously situational, but it has its uses.<br />
<br />
5) Fort adds roughly about 165hp on warriors from what I can remember. Every bit helps.<br />
<br />
6) Sense increases your chance to avoid, which is usefull to anyone doing any tanking. I allways get it on my warrior if I can, since any edge in survivability is valuable. Doing your raid a disservice if you dont keep this on your tanks.<br />
<br />
7) Spirit veil - fade rate on invis hasnt changed for the worse as far as I can tell. If anything, its improved. The only times I've ever died from invis fading is when I'm not paying attention. I usually carry about 5-10 instaclick invis potions with me in case of fading, and I have never been in a situation where I've run out since the release of GoD. Ever.<br />
<br />
8) Putrid decay - its not meant to be used with MD, its meant to be used with malos, which it stacks with. It's primary function would appear to increase utility of PR/DR based spells (those are the resists most of our dots and nukes use, as you should know). How usefull it is is debatable, but that is what its for - basically another situational spell. It does have a resist modifier btw (neg 200 DR), so it should land on most things without the need to debuff first.</div></div><hr />

Spiritual Channeling  = Your right, those AA are nice to have, but so are all the other classes.  My point is, they never did anything &quot;Extra&quot; for us, to make up from all the nerfing they did to us (that includes shortening the duration of NPCs life, so then our DoTs will never last their full duration.  Keeping our heals way under par, so no higher end group can rely on shaman only for healing.  ETC).<br />

you are obviously one of those bitter shaman who will always see the glass as half-empty  = When infact, it was I who thought of the buff proc.

<br />
Like I said, I have tried this spell out before.  It seems to have a 40% chance to cure most detramental spells.  But, since this spell has a 12 seconds recast time,  it would take a very long time to cure someone, not to mention that this spell cannot be dependable.  I dont know in what situation in which I would want to waist my time trying to cure 1 person, when I can spend my time debuffing, healing, Panther, ETC <br />

I always keeps this spell on tank even they want it or not.  Half the time, they dont even ask for this spell though.  If this spell really made a difference, wouldnt you think that everyone would be asking for it ?<br />

7) Spirit veil - fade rate on invis hasnt changed for the worse as far as I can tell. If anything, its improved. The only times I've ever died from invis fading is when I'm not paying attention. I usually carry about 5-10 instaclick invis potions with me in case of fading, and I have never been in a situation where I've run out since the release of GoD. Ever.When OOW first came out, I had to double the amount of invis potions I carried on me.  I remember running threw MPG to Rifts, and useing all 6 of my potions.  I have NEVER seen it fade like that before (and no nothing was agroed).<br />
<br />
8) Putrid decay - its not meant to be used with MD, its meant to be used with malos, which it stacks with. It's primary function would appear to increase utility of PR/DR based spells (those are the resists most of our dots and nukes use, as you should know). How usefull it is is debatable, but that is what its for - basically another situational spell. It does have a resist modifier btw (neg 200 DR), so it should land on most things without the need to debuff first.<br />
<br />
Think about it. The only time you would use this spell would be on raids, since boss mobs are the only one you would cast this on.  Wouldnt you think that the Necros would have casted this spell anyhow on the mob ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, hopefully our other abilities would keep us from only being used as a bot.<br />
<br />
As far as Panther being considered a tedious 1 min buff, well you have to figure, it does resolve ALL of our issues that we have with DoTs.<br />
<br />
This spell also resolves many issues on our &quot;Class Issue List&quot; which includes :<br />
<br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  (currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning<br />
<br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro!  (currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning <br />
<br />
9. Shaman Survivability, Shamans are the least durable of the Slowing classes. This makes it highly risky for us to fufill our role. <br />
-even though this issue was more dirrected towards the agro from slowing,  Panther still resolves the agro issue in 2 ways:<br />
1) No more need to cast HIGH agro DoTs<br />
2) Panther adds more agro to the Tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I like it a lot. If you're in a safe group, it's tedious. But then, if you're in a safe group, so is everything else.<br />
<br />
I decide on the pull if I'm going to slow first (usually) or root an add (unless they're all unrootable mobs). Then do I patch heal the OT or start slowing? After that, if I haven't already, I spam SoL on my pet and the melees. On double pulls, I hit them all; if we're usually singling, I hit half the team on each pull.<br />
<br />
It's like it always was: a little bit of effort makes the big difference between another shaman and A Good Shaman - I'm once again getting tells for groups even when I'm not LFG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
panther does not resolve ANY issues with dots. instead we don't cast dots anymore... they are still as broken as they were before OoW, especially noticable if you don't have panther/leopard... the only thing panther did for the dot issue was skirt the entire issue. while i don't complain about this, it is true...<br />
<br />
on a side note, instead of calling for a nerf to shaman perhaps it would be better to call for a  utility increase for wizards or something else to make them more desireable in groups... nerfing shaman isn't going to make wizards more desirable for groups.<br />
btw, with a necro/BL/bard/enchanter in group, personally i am all for filling an xp group with wizards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">I've wished for a long time that I had some buff that was worthwhile to casters.  The only thing we can cast on them at all has stacking issues with their self ac/mr buff.  Melee turn into little walking blenders with a shaman around, but casters couldn't care less.  Furthermore, every other buffing class, even some that you wouldn't consider buffers, has something for both melee and casters.  Clerics (spell haste), Rangers (agro) Druids-Enchanters-Bards-Beastlords-Magicians-Shadowknights-Necromancers (mana regen, and some other stuff). That leaves just Shaman and Paladin without some kind of caster buff, except that the paladin buff (they only have one) actually stacks with caster self-buffs.<br />
<br />
I don't have a good proposal for this one.  Bene mana pres tacked onto Fortitude, Detri on Sense?  New Malosinianiania spell with a % damage increaser?  I dunno.  But I'd like something to help out my buddies the finger-wigglers.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: clarification: I'm not calling for a nerf, I'm simply saying, as a class with the same skill (healing) should they be told to rely upon it for saving their own lives? I have had experiences where healing myself has caused the mob to reaggro and kill me. survivability just hasn't been addressed.<br />

This is probably one of the biggest falicies of this game. If a player cannot SEE a measurable difference in an item, spell, ability, then its generally forgoten and overlooked. Sense doenst add hps. Do you REALLY think that 100 hps from Fort makes THAT big a &quot;difference&quot; in the overall, every-character-over-10K game we play now? The same applies to an additional 1 FT, or a few more +attack, or a couple +regen. Overall, these teeny tiny minor bumps are almost totally meaningless. <br />
<br />
I would almost argue that Sense is more valuable than Fort, because avoiding a 2K hit is a bit better than an extra 100 hps. <br />
<br />
Honestly Warbear, I would love too see you run down every class in this game, and tell us all how you would make them perfect. SOE made PLENTY of moves to the positive for Shaman recently, to offset the overall reduction in the value of slow. Personally, I am of the &quot;just take slow totally out of the game, and make every mob hit exactly as fast as you want without any debuff&quot;. I am sick of trying to balance against this ability. People whined about the mitigation in OoW, but now, look at how trivial it really is. Shaman are a solid, reasonably balanced class, in relation to the game and every other class. There is NOTHING worth getting pissy about at this point, nothing.</div></div><hr />

Like I said, I have tried this spell out before.  It seems to have a 40% chance to cure most detramental spells.  But, since this spell has a 12 seconds recast time,  it would take a very long time to cure someone, not to mention that this spell cannot be dependable.  I dont know in what situation in which I would want to waist my time trying to cure 1 person, when I can spend my time debuffing, healing, Panther, ETC <br />
<br />
<br />
I always keeps this spell on tank even they want it or not.  Half the time, they dont even ask for this spell though.  If this spell really made a difference, wouldnt you think that everyone would be asking for it ?<br />
<br />
When OOW first came out, I had to double the amount of invis potions I carried on me.  I remember running threw MPG to Rifts, and useing all 6 of my potions.  I have NEVER seen it fade like that before (and no nothing was agroed).<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
1) True, the spell stacks, but effects dont. However, its pretty unlikely that someone is going to have the druid spell on so that is not an appropriate argument. There is no cap btw, some discs have modifiers at 100% or more.<br />
<br />
2) Cure rate for pure spirit is the same as radiant cure 3, namely det(6). Resplendant cure 3 is det(15). Like I said, applications are for people/pets out of group or situations when the AA is timed out. The fact that you're not using it in those situations doesnt mean they dont exist.<br />
<br />
3) It makes a difference in any fight where the tank has a chance of dying. The fact that people dont ask for it is either (a) lazyness or (b) ignorance.<br />
<br />
4) Ya, well, I've had invis fade in rapid succession multiple times prior to OoW (and GoD for that matter) as well, in fact it seemed much more prevalent back in the old days from my recollection. Nowdays it doesnt seem to fade as much. One bad run, no matter how badly it was burned in your memory, is not evidence for an increased failure rate. What was different about GoD/OoW (particularly OoW) compared to prior expansions was that there were very long runs where invis is pretty much required, consequently invis failure becomes much more noticeable. It's just a perception, not reality.<br />
<br />
5) We dont have any necros, so no, they wouldnt be casting their version. We do, however, have lots of shaman (8 at last count).</div></div><hr />

The **** I have been reading isn't even worth quoting, so bear with me.<br />
<br />
Brohg + Warbear: Obviously I am not asking for improved Survivability in WoS or some ****ty zone where mobs can barely touch me. <br />
If a mob did such a low DPS that I'd be able to self heal reliably, my Survivability would be fine. Of course with my gear I am not going to be in WoS, but those people who are in WoS do not have my gear(See the pattern?).<br />
<br />
Of course some dip**** is going to tell me he easily offtanks in RS, Qvic+, Anguish because he has done it so many times(which is probably like 3 times for a total of 30 seconds). The point is that mobs in these zones can usually kill you and you can't do **** about it. (Btw, if you are going to bother to contradict me, run to, say, Qvic, which is over a year old, zone in, pull a mob and tank it till it's dead, then post the logs here.)<br />
<br />
Warbear: Are you being sarcastic or why are you even talking about dodge? Wanna compare your uber dodge to a Warrior's?<br />
<br />
The AC you gain from gear, unless it has an avoidance mod on it, is exclusively boosting your mitigation. Defense skill on the other hand is not and the crappiest Warrior still has a higher defense than any Shaman. This is one thing you can't make up for with gear.<br />
<br />
Last I checked Warriors can use defensive whenever they wish to. Another aspect in which your crappy geared Warrior has got you beat.<br />
<br />
In regards to AC and damage mitigation tables. These are highly depedant on your class. A Shaman with 2300 AC doesn't mitigate nearly as well as a Warrior with 2300 AC, just because his AC softcap is a lot higher than yours and because he's a plate wearing class.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, survivability depends not mainly on your gear. Not even close&quot; = so your saying a Bazaar equiped person can survive almost as well as an Anguish equiped person ? I dont think so buddy<br />

How in the heck does your reply have anything to do with the quote you posted ?   <br />
The quote compaires totally different kinds of gear, while you answer compaires the same kind of gear.   What is the point that your trying to make ?  And does it have anything to do with the quote ?<br />
<br />

 <br />
<br />
Sure you can.  You just said it, &quot;Avoidance&quot; FROM THE GEAR.  You also forgot about shielding.  The cap on shielding is 35%.  Which means, geared right, a Shaman can have full time &quot;defensive&quot; FROM THE GEAR.<br />
<br />
In regards to AC and damage mitigation tables. These are highly depedant on your class. A Shaman with 2300 AC doesn't mitigate nearly as well as a Warrior with 2300 AC, just because his AC softcap is a lot higher than yours and because he's a plate wearing class.<br />

- dodge - Equipment gives more of this (I have Dodge3 and Dodge 8%)<br />
Oh my, could this be the avoidance gear I mentioned? You even quoted me.<br />
<br />
- AC (this is only partially from gear) - Almost all of it is from gear acutally<br />

 <br />
- defensive disciplines (only needed for named mobs)<br />
*boggle* I said these make you more survivable. Do you disagree?<br />
 <br />
- defensive tables (are increased threw gear bonus effects, which includes avoidance, shielding %)<br />
NOTHING will get you off the shaman table and on the warrior table. That is like saying enough int gear will let you cast KEI.<br />
<br />
Ways to get more HPs<br />
 - gear (The biggest one of all, which determines what you can and what you cannot tank)<br />
Actually HPs only determine what can oneshot you/how far you can between heals. If you can reliably survive until the next heal hits HPs do nothing. Now, that is a fairly big condition but it hardly qualifies as &quot;determining what you can tank&quot;.<br />
<br />

Nice answer that - of course it has nothing to do with what I said. I am saying level, defensive skills, class and defensive class features determine your tanking to a far greater degree then gear. Feel free to take a level 50 shaman with no defensive skills and a level 70 shaman with maxed defensive skills - same AC, same HPs. Now let them tank something in, say, MPG or a comparable zone.<br />
<br />
According to you the difference in survivability should be minor, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warbear's assertion is that it is all about gear:  so the test should specify that they get equipped with identical gear.  When they do, the level 70 will already have more HP; and perhaps some defensive effect on AC, I don't know about that part.<br />
<br />
Then it is time to run the test:<br />

When druids get beat on they can cast healing spells:  but if it is all going to hell they can cast a mitigation spell, or can evac.<br />
<br />
When clerics get beat on they can cast healing spells:  but if it is all going to hell they can cast very fast spells, or invulnerability.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Look, I am not saying anyone is wrong here.  Skills, class cap, discs, ETC,  do seem to help and is what separates one type of class to another.  But, I think, Equipment is what makes the real difference, when it comes to survivabilit/duriability.   For instance ;<br />
<br />
Back a while ago, I was invited to join a group in Rifts.  Now the tank was an Elemental/PoTime geared Paladin,  so it wasnt a walk in the park for the Cleric.  Now, after killing about the 4th or 5th mob, the Pally died.  The cleric said his hp go down too fast for him to cast CH on him.  Then, for some reason the Paladin got mad and left the group after he got rezed.  <br />
So then, after about giveing up, trying to find another tank, I figured, I would try and keep the group awake by pulling a mob.  Well here I go, pulled a mob (with Balance, to try and get good agro right away) into camp, and started on it with my Poison DoTs.  After the Cleric had seen that his chain healing was only healing me for about 900 or so hp a heal, he slowed down a bit.  Then he eventually stabalized his healing to the rate of my hp going down, by casting CH on me.   I must have tanked a good 20 mobs or so before an unlucky round finally got me.  <br />
<br />
I am not saying that Shaman can tank even nearly as good as Paladins, but I am SURE my equipment advantage had EVERYHING to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Hell, I have tanked better than some Pallies in BoT and up, but the same goes for some SKs and Warriors. You get a warrior with 6k hps and a 1300 ac in WoS, and he goes down fast.<br />
<br />
I have an advantage with self heals that do damage though, and I seem to be very lucky with the channeling. <br />
<br />
Gear makes a huge friggen difference. Huge. Level and the ability to not give a damn if you die or not makes a big differnce as well.</div></div><hr />

Um... Yeah paladins aren't great in RS due to inability to stun... but I've still duoed mobs in RS with paladins (Ele/Time geared ones) and they don't go down THAT quickly. You must have had a sucky cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Um...

<br />
What difference is there between a sucky cleric and a super cleric, when there is no mods for CH (other then once in a while crit.)?  Also, every cleric has their &quot;casting CH &quot; hotkey, so you know they are doing their job.<br />
<br />
But anyways, you get my point.  A sizeable difference in equipment gives more of an advantage then skill, or soft caps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">AC softcap ring a bell? Most of your displayed AC is going to waste anyways.<br />
<br />
But how is it that you get to that AC softcap?  FROM EQUIPMENT<br />
Do you even know how low the first of the caps is? You get full benefit from AC to around 800. That is where you get most of your AC benefit from. And our defense + starting agility skill alone gets us to 500 or so (probably more like 550 with the raised cap).<br />
<br />
 <br />

False. Warriors flat out take less damage, simply by being warriors. Yes, AC also makes you take less damage. Of course being a warrior with better AC makes you take even less damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
*boggle*  its the HPs that greatly determines how reliable you can survive until the next heal hits.<br />
Yes. I will explain what I meant again. HPs are great, up to a certain point. That point is &quot;I can reliably survive until the next heal&quot;. If you are getting heals every 4 seconds it does not matter if they hit you at 1000 HPs left or at 6000. However the various ways to take less damage are still useful.</div></div><hr />

Go ahead and ask on some warrior board if they would rather have 500 AC from gear or from the defense skill. Go ask them if they would rather have 500 more AC or have the softcap raised by 500.<br />
<br />
Sadly I don't have my preKunark numbers anymore, but I seem to remember some guidelines like 100 AC more = 20% less damage taken. That is what happens pre-softcaps. You can't do that anymore. Skills, AAs and raw level still give benefits like this though.<br />

<br />
At the time, the cleric was chain CHing, with no mana issues, and did have all healing AAs (well, at least critical heal).  It just turned out, that the gear played a very important part.<br />

<br />
Shaman Defensive capabilities = Slow, Healing, VP<br />
<br />
Cleric Defensive capabilities = Healing, Divine Arb. , Divine aura/barrier<br />
<br />
Enchanter Defensive capabilities = mez, slow, Rune<br />
<br />
Beastlord defensive capabilities = slow, defensive skill(s), heal <br />
<br />
Druid defensive capabilities = Healing, Oaken guard, Instant Tele (forgot name)<br />
<br />
Seems like they gave every priest and slowing class 3 main defensive type spells/skills.  Yes, our VP seems to be a joke right now, due to the resist rate, but the same thing can be said of BLs healing.  <br />
You also have to figure some Defensive capabilities are much more powerfull to make up for the weaker ones.  Or, perhaps if the offensive capabilities are stronger then average, the defense is made that much weaker, to make up for it.   Remember, its all about &quot;Balance&quot;.<br />

I'd has a couple of margaritas and I *really* liked my idea. I wanted some sort of Spirit of the Falcon - an instant cast big ole flapping birdie which would distract the mob by gauging their eyes! (great at getting aggro away from us, only last 3 seconds or so, 10 minute recast). I also suggested ferrets would could jump out and bite the mob in the jimmy. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">Three defensive abilities per class? Please.<br />
<br />
Shaman: Slow, Vindictive Spirit, Root, VP, Heals, HoTs, Group HoT (AA/Epic). Common ways to get aggro: healing, slow, DoT<br />
<br />
Cleric: Stun, Root, DA, DB, DvA, cleric epic, Heals, Fast Heals, Group Heals, HoTs, group HoTs, group CH, Vie. Common ways to get aggro: healing<br />
<br />
What this boils down to is: Shaman aggro early and everything they can do to survive that aggro causes yet more aggro. On top of that they have not one &quot;oh crap&quot; ability that can save them when they are being smacked around and already close to dying. Clerics have four, two of which can also save group members without aggro. On top of that they have less aggro issues.<br />
<br />
I think there're more AAs clerics get to save themselves. One that makes the mob agro someone else before them (as long as they don't cast or melee), another that's like self-DI, and targetable DA.<br />
<br />
Echanters also have the doppleganger and the AA that uses mana instead of HP.<br />
<br />
If I've gotten any of those wrong please correct me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">The self-DI aa is trash.  Really really trash.  Not just low value, I mean.  It doesn't even work when it works, which is only 0.5% of the time.  When the aa fires off, it only heals for 2k damage, which isn't enough to get the cleric out of low-hp agro if his total is 7k or more.<br />

Champion - Not bad, but some of us arent sure if the small increase in damage (only 5% if you figure in them already haveing Lion's Strength) and short duration is worth the large amount of mana. I do cast this on the Rogues though, just to keep them happy.<br />

You probably tried it before it got boosted.<br />

I dont think I ever said I wanted Rune in our spellbook, or Jolt, or FD, or DA. I said I am not debating the issue of what form our &quot;survivability&quot; ability should take, I am just trying to get you (and other nay-sayers) to see that we DO INDEEED NEED SOMETHING, and something more than &quot;we have heals&quot;. Clerics have &quot;heals&quot;, and DA. Rangers have &quot;heals&quot; . . . and Jolt (which is sort of an emergency survivability ability, as it throws aggro off). Necros have taps (sort of &quot;heals&quot;) and FD. See where I am going with this? Saying &quot;Shaman can heal themselves in emergency survivability situations&quot; isnt even CLOSE to being a compelling agruement. Hell Clerics are a Plate class with faster heals, better AA clickys for survivability, and near-insta cast invulnerability. And last I checked, I USUALLY cast my debuffs BEFORE clerics start dropping heals (I know there are circumstances where this isnt the case, please dont start listing them). <br />
&quot;Blazz said = we have some of the most aggro inducing spells in the game, and the most &quot;non-specific&quot; form of minimizing the effect of that aggro than anyone&quot; = True, but that is why they gave us Panther.<br />
I agree to an extent. Panther definitely gave us a way to jack up our DPS contribution without increasing our aggro potential (or bothering to fix the broken aggro issues on DOTs that already exist). However, Panther does nothing to reduce the initial aggro we generate with our debuffs. <br />
<br />
No offense here warbear, but you are losing this debate, baddly. I totally respect you, your opinions on our class, and your ability to play a shaman at the highest level, but you are dead wrong here. And to be perfectly frank, your continued insistance that we really don't NEED any form of emergency survivability is actually sort of detrimental to our class overall. On the plus side though, perhaps the debate itself will bring the topic to the forefront where we can get some recognition and acknowledgement that Shaman are a class that deserves some kind of survivability ability.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Shaman are a class that deserves some kind of survivability ability.<br />
Heck, every does. I can deal with everyone getting an even amount of survivability or with having that survivability being tied to the aggro you generate. But currently shaman are among the top &quot;get unwanted aggro just to do their job&quot; classes and get the least defensive tools. That just ain't right.<br />
<br />
And I do hope noone comes back with something like &quot;hey, clerics don't have invis, mages can't root and shaman can't save their ass&quot;.<br />
1) That is not even remotely comparable.<br />
2) Other imbalances don't make this one fair.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, every deserves to have the same amount of fun in this game. To me that boils down to having the same amount of choices (i.e. different strategies/abilities you can use), the same amount of usefulness and the same amount of raw power. Ideally you would have the same amount of micromanagement required to reach your power too, but that is not quite as important. Anyways, each time a cleric can hit DvA, DA or DB to correct a mistake (either his or a group members) and the other classes don't get something like that that decreases their usefulness in comparison.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't mean for everyone to get DvA. But if a cleric can compensate for the puller messing up I better be able to compensate for the cleric messing up (say, the spirit shifting AA we discussed during the big class balance debate) and the ranger better be able to compensate for me overaggroing. Currently all we get is a tool (healing) that allows us at best to stall and wait for someone else to compensate. Meanwhile other classes get half a dozen emergency buttons. That is just as messed up as shaman in Luclin - getting slow and HoTs and DoTs and a pet and haste while other classes did not get a single durability tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">we are one of the only classes without a DA/rune/FD type spell/AA/disc to help fend off agro...even my pally can cast DA....<br />
<br />
i agree it would be nice to see something in the form of an AA DA style dealy with a 10ish minute recast timer (i think a large rune could be to over powering for us, and even with 20 buff slots i don't have room for another perma buff...) if this ever developed into a spell i have to have perma memed it would be damn worthless though imo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">well, this thread has gone all over the place.<br />
<br />
we need a survivability tool/defensive spell to compensate for massive aggro spikes. this spell could have been Vindictive Spirit, but it needs ALOT of tweaking to be used in that manner. the rune could be beefed up a little (amount/% negated and duration), and the aggro could be lowered.<br />
<br />
a shaman jolt spell is not a bad idea, but I'd like something more unique...like an aggro DS...lowers aggro by a certain amount each time you are struck...call it &quot;Empathy&quot;<br />
<br />
this kind of defensive should be attainable at similar levels that the other classes get theirs. and this should also be regardless of gear. this is something that should benefit lower-end and higher-end players because we all encounter the same problems, perhaps to different degrees, but still the same problems.<br />
<br />
I'm just pointing out that bringing gear into question is really not fair to either high-end or low-end people. it has nothing to do with the idea of class survivability as a whole because not everyone has the same gear or experiences. but we all draw aggro from slow, we all draw aggro from DoTs. that is what the survivabilty discussion is about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, clerics seem to have the most when it comes to haveing defensive spells/skills, but look at what they lack when it comes to DPS.  Again, its all about &quot;Balance&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
I guess, that I might have been only looking at my situation, where higher end shaman can easilly hold their own for at least a couple of rounds.  Perhaps if someone can explain to me how well shaman can hold up in other levels of the game, I would have a better understand as to why there is such a dire need for extra help to survive.   <br />
For instance;<br />
<br />
If I get agro from a fast hitting mob that hits in the low 1k, generally each set of rounds take a little over a bubble of hps from me.  But since the only reason I get agro is because I slowed the mob, I have enough time inbetween rounds to Root, heal, VP, etc.  Or I may even just stand there until the tank takes agro from me.  <br />
The only time where I have a hard time, is when there are multiple mobs, and my slow gets resisted (My slow always seems to get resisted alot more, when there are multiple mobs), and I get agro from the one not being tanked.  Then, the only thing I can do is either hope VP wont get resisted, or wait until Balance repops.  But even then, the healer in the group seems to have my back.<br />
<br />
So, in my situation, haveing a resist modifier placed on VP would be nice , but its not absolutely necessary for my survival.  Another words, adding something to help my survival would be more of a want, then a need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">I definitely agree with Warbear.  Shaman don't need a DA/FD/whatever.   A big resist modifier to VP and maybe a lowered recast time would be plenty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are totally missing the point here. You say you dont have trouble with aggro on raids unless there are lots of mobs, but please explain when ANY single-mod situation is aggro-intensive, and when ANY multi-mob situation is a problem, aggro-wise. <br />
<br />
Forget it, I was going to get into a ton of examples like &quot;do you wait til a tank gets aggro on adds before you bother to slow&quot; etc etc but its not worth it. No one is going to be able to change your mind warbear. <br />
<br />
I want you to remember ONE THING though. Just because you have ADJUSTED your playstyle to the point where YOU dont have aggro issues (which, BTW, most of us have done, DUH) that doesnt mean the issues dont exist. I think your main deficiency here is that you have managed to modify your general play enough that you just dont SEE the problem. Tell ya what. Next Tcvatci raid, pop a Nihil on that add that no tank has picked up yet, and see how survivable you are. Mobs that quad for 2K a pop arent fun if a tank doesnt already &quot;have&quot; them. <br />
<br />
Either that, or continue to stand at the back of the raid, waiting a good 30 seconds into the pull, and convince your self &quot;I am alive, this is easy, I dont have a problem&quot;. See its really not about what we are capable of now. Most of us play our class to its limit with regard to aggro, mana, etc. Its about the potential we have to be much more active much earlier in those 8-pull-1500-hitter battles. <br />
<br />
For some reason, I think you probably never die in those, do you.</div></div><hr />

Is there a link to this &quot;fix&quot; anywhere or is it just another flavor of the rumor mongering bull**** equal to the &quot;dog dog KS's another raid&quot; headlines?</div></div><hr />

I was told that the information is available on the &quot;beta boards,&quot; and that our class correspondant could verify it there.  Also, it's common sense we would not get a buff to up our DPS by 200.</div></div><hr />

dunno, yeah i get agro once and awhile, but i kinda learned agro control back at the orc highway.  sure id like a way to survive a raid wipe and be the hero and rez in a cleric...but theres not a whole lot that isn't overpowering that will allow me to debuff/slow/dot Big_Named_01 and then sit to camp out.  <br />
I like my ability to generate agro, i try to buuild it up often. not to the point where i take it from the tank. but i do like to be second on the list when xp grouping, because i know i can stand and self heal/hot/ keep agro while cleric camp/run.<br />
dying is part of the game, always has been, always will be, atleast with don, you can just summon your corpse for 157p</div></div><hr />

No offense Scowls, but I think your missing the point. The point is that Shaman NEED to be MUCH MUCH more careful about our aggro BECAUSE of the fact that our emergency survivability is pretty weak and slow. <br />
<br />
I also enjoy the ability to generate aggro. I am not asking that the aggro be reduced on my spells (except poison DOTs, but we wont go there, Panther &quot;fixed&quot; this . . . sort of), I am asking for some way to bail myself out in case of an emergency. Doesnt even have to be huge, IMHO, just something I can pop if the **** hits the fan. <br />
<br />
Most of the arguments against the need for this feature have centered around us &quot;actively&quot; knowing HOW to balance our aggro and our offensive capabilities (yes, debuffing is offense). Thats all well and good. Far as I know, Clerics need to learn to balance their heals vs the tanks aggro. Chanters have to balance their debuffs with aggro. And if they make a mistake, BAM, they have resources to deal with it (DA and Rune in those 2 examples). Shaman get &quot;Um, heal yourself or get better gear. If your in Txcliu gear, you can survive the train in WoS ya know&quot;, or better yet &quot;learn how to control your aggro, dumbass&quot;. These are such juvenile arguements on this subject that I am embaressed to have to even RESPOND to this garbage, but it seems more and more people are jumping on that &quot;I control my aggro just fine so I dont need any emergency ability&quot; bandwagon here. <br />
<br />
I learned how to control aggro on Orc Highway too. Doesnt mean I dont need a tool similar to the tools that other classes have. I think its fairly safe to say we generate a good sized chunk of aggro with our spells, and our spells work BEST if cast early in the battles. Its only reasonable that we have a similar method to deal with those times when you popped off on the un-tanked one before the off-tanks could get in and grab aggro.</div></div><hr />

I interpreted the following excerpt from Brenlo's revisioning post to mean that SoL /SoP are working as intended:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
In DoN you received the spells Spirit of the Leopard and Spirit of the Panther. You seem to like these new spells and they have added more desirability for you in groups. We will be extending these into full spell lines so that Shaman of other level ranges can see the benefits from these spells.</div></div><hr />

I'd have expected to see something show up on Lucy if they were going to tinker with proc rates of the spells or, if it were to affect our pets, something on the Mage, Necro or Beastlord boards about it (as their pets proc as much as ours do with Leopard/Panther). Beastlords have a series of proc buffs for their pets and yes, they go off as often as Leopard/Panther does - it's one of the reasons I kept /feedback'ing on the Beta server to get Rabid Companion to go live. ;)<br />
<br />
There's been no signs at all of any changes to proc rates, other than a mention of it on this thread.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there aren't any &quot;beta&quot; boards worthy of the name. I've been in the Omens and DoN beta testing and although there is a board set up, it didn't have any posts last time I checked and no mention of it was made in the beta acceptance emails.<br />
<br />
About the only place it could be mentioned are the private forums on the EQLive site, but again I'd have expected news to travel elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

You must always have a very good tank, to use Yoppa's Mending.<br />
Most of the time, all I can find is pickup groups, where it is questionable if that tank should be in that zone.  (Mainly due to the times I can play from working late at night)<br />
There is also a question about multiple mobs incomming. A druid can barely keep 2 tanks alive in that situation, how are we supposted to ?  Unless of course you have an Enchanter in that uber group of yours also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u206"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p206">I want you to remember ONE THING though. Just because you have ADJUSTED your playstyle to the point where YOU dont have aggro issues (which, BTW, most of us have done, DUH) that doesnt mean the issues dont exist. I think your main deficiency here is that you have managed to modify your general play enough that you just dont SEE the problem. Tell ya what. Next Tcvatci raid, pop a Nihil on that add that no tank has picked up yet, and see how survivable you are. Mobs that quad for 2K a pop arent fun if a tank doesnt already &quot;have&quot; them. <br />
<br />
Either that, or continue to stand at the back of the raid, waiting a good 30 seconds into the pull, and convince your self &quot;I am alive, this is easy, I dont have a problem&quot;. See its really not about what we are capable of now. Most of us play our class to its limit with regard to aggro, mana, etc. Its about the potential we have to be much more active much earlier in those 8-pull-1500-hitter battles. <br />
<br />
For some reason, I think you probably never die in those, do you.<br />
 <br />
On the contrary, I am generally the first thing that a mob hits upon inc.  But, because I know exactly how my guild works, I know that the mob(s)will be picked up in a round or 2.  And then I get senselessly spammed out with cleric/druid heals afterwards.<br />

Mobs that quad for 2K a pop arent fun if a tank doesnt already &quot;have&quot; them. = Even though a Shamans survivability will only be for a couple of rounds in that situation, a chanter, druid, etc survivability will be no different, seeing how any rune will fade in 1 hit anyhow.  Yes, they might survive an extra hit... but they are still dead regardless. <br />
Other then giveing us some form of stone stance, or something that will over power us (perhaps this is what you might have been thinking), nothing will make that much of a difference in those type of situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there are only 3 reasons why I can think of why it hasn't been changed from this last patch ;<br />
<br />
1) They haven't gotten around to it yet. (which would suprise me, seeing as how they have almost always corrected problems right away in the past, that people can take advantage of)<br />
<br />
2) They are haveing trouble correcting it, without running into other problems. (It does seem like they have a hard time fixing something that is pet related)<br />
<br />
3) It is &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a feeling, that if there is going to be a change, it will be done during a large patch.</div></div><hr />
