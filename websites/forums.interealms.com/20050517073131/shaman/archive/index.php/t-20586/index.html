<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finaly zone in and try to play around in the zone. I know these dragons arent cake, but we had almost 2 full groups with nice DPS and we couldnt out DPS the regen of the dragons? Some one was saying theur are broke and have insane regen now ?<br />
<br />
<br />
What up with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hoshkar regens 3k/tick and has a 1250DD AE that checks disease-150.  None of the rest of them regen nearly that much, and in my opinion none of the other AEs are even nearly that strong or hard to resist.<br />
<br />
I imagine he's the one that was killing you??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We took a jaunt through vp two weeks ago.  Didn't see anything unusual.  Perhaps a patch since then might have done something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well we tried silverwing un prepared s a add and we didnt really have alot of force on him as im looking back, most of us were on the adds ( this was a friendly fun gathering ) and everytime i saw his HP go down it cam eright back up in a tick. Seemed like it was a lil odd. Then yes, we tried Hoshkar and even with focus on him he kicked our arses, mind you it was a 7 member adventure. Perhaps we should just skip him next time lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any tips in VP while i have your attention ? I had alot of fun there and oddly enough for a 6 man group and even with 7 on raid EXP, the exp wasnt that bad. I almost made a AA there and we really didnt move that fast and whiped 2 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">VP is my personal little solo spot. Always empty. I ignore racnars and just solo G Wurms. Most of them are 4% per kill but random G Wurms spawn as caster types and they give 15% each. The only loot are spells but the peace and quiet of the zone make it worth it to me.<br />
<br />
Whenever I can talk 9 other guildies into it we clear all the named dragons for fun. (Ok so I still want the snare staff that never drops for me.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doh, the snare spear is rare drop ? :(<br />
<br />
Why you think i wanna go so bad there lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For being a &quot;rare&quot; drop, we got 2 in the 1 time we felt like clearing the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There wasn't much up tonight, so we did another run-through of vp.  Was a scheduled raid night so we took everyone who came and just plowed through (4 groups).  Everything seemed normal.  Several of the dragons are just plain tough without some substantial dps.  A bard is also a *very* good thing to have, the ae is mean.  Good thing is that nadox will clear up the melee slow very easily.<br />
Whats funny is the reaction of some folks when they see me tanking guardian worms.  I've told them that this is what shaman are made for )</div></div><hr />
