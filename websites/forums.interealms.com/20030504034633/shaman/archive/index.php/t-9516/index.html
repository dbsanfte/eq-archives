<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Compare to our L51 slow spell, CoG uses more mana, longer cast time, and only 40% slow instead of the usual 75%...and it seems to be resisted more too...so why use it?</div></div><hr />

Some mobs are 100% MR, but NOT disease resistant. So. 40% slow is better than nothing. <br />
<br />
L51 shaman slow is desease based not magic based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sekin, our level 51 slow &quot;turgurs&quot; is Magic based, it checks against the mobs MR<br />
<br />
bout 5% of the mobs in game have extreamly high MR making it impossible to land turgurs ... so we use cloud of grummus<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net do your homework</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for a bit more clarification, 51 slow checks against magic but is cured via cure disease.  This is a relatively recent change to the slow line, enabling players to cure slow off tanks without needing to annul all their beneficial buffs.  Previously, turgurs required an annul to remove so you can see the benefit of being able to cure it with cure disease!<br />
<br />
Don't feel badly, it's confusing to have a spell check against magic to land and then be curable via cure disease.  <br />
<br />
Turgur's is DEFINITELY magic based to land though, that's why malo/tash/bard song is so helpful in sticking it.  Note that neither malo or tash have a component which lowers disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try Coldian Ring 10 War 3rd wave,  you will need CoG to slow these giant fast, <br />
Kromzek Warlord are very high MR, even lv 65 shaman need malo+ malosini  to land slow</div></div><hr />

obviously, your charisma isn't high enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what has charisma got to do with it?<br />
<br />
please lets not get into the age old argument of &quot;high charisma decreases the chances of resists&quot;......It's been proved it doesn't.</div></div><hr />
