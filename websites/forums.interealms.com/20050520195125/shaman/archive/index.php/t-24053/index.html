<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All, off the wall question inc.<br />
<br />
I remember reading that there is an npc in GoD (abysmal sea?) that will allow you to change the graphic of your head piece.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge of this?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds pretty borked though. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the help Kamidari, I searched the cruible but not allah, should have known better. :(  Now &quot;borked,&quot; is that a technical term?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the one with the mumrite armors works now !  im glad i retired with ****in horns omgz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hope they expand this to all helms.  I want a graphic with my EP helmet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Borked used to be Bjorked. Then got Americanized. It's a technical term for when fubar isn't socially acceptable and snafu just doesn't seem to fit.<br />

I REALLY want my hrons back, but losing hp/mana off a qvic hat just wouldn't jive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless this has been &quot;fixed&quot; at some point after I quit playing, there is always an option to change your helm (or any other armor graphic for that matter).  All that is required is that you can change your form to a NPC form (skeleton, bear form, wolf form, goblin are the ones I can think of).<br />
<br />
What you do is equip the item that you want to see, then change your form to one of the above listed.  Then you take off the item and place what you actually want to wear on in its place.  When you click off the illusion you will be wearing what you want, but you will have the armor graphic you desire!<br />
<br />
This is easy to do as a shaman since you can easily do bear form!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pretty sure going illusion then clicking illusion off nixes your helm anyways</div></div><hr />

Yes, the illusion trick still works, however, you need to do it everytime you log on.  Was hoping for a premanent solution, however, the quest does not work with my helm.  The helms that the npc will accept seems very limited.  Thanks all.</div></div><hr />
