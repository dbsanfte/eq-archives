<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before I deployed I had convinced a few friends to go with me up to PoM and hunt for a spell component..In our group was a good friend of mine from real life who was playing a lvl 53 enchanter.  We were camped out on the castle wall hunting the mini zoro's and it was getting pretty boring so I turned to Dorenie (the chanter) and asked her to mez one of the rascals.. She was hesitant and was unsure if she could even mez the little bugger..The conversation went a little like this.<br />
<br />
Gustov: Hey, dorenie, try and mezz em.<br />
Dorenie: Um, I dont think I can.<br />
Gustov: Whats the worst that could happen?<br />
Mehinny: (the druid) She could get creamed.<br />
Gustov: Nah, they dont hit that hard, sheesh.<br />
Dorenie: Um, how hard do they hit?<br />
Elfton: (ranger) Not that damn hard, just mez em!<br />
Dorenie: Fine!  But if I die Im gonna be really pissed!<br />
     At this time Dorenie goes running down the wall her robes flapping in the wind.<br />
Elfton: Private message to Gustov: Dude, theres no way she can mez em, she's gonna get spanked.<br />
Gustov: PM back to Eflton..:Yeah, this is gonna be soo funny!<br />
     About this time Dorenie casts her mez and low and behold the little bugger does a quick about face and comes tearing off after Dorenie, who is now high tailing it back toward us..<br />
Dorenie: (while running like mad) You guys suck!  I soooo owe you!<br />
Gustov: (laughing so hard typing is hard: Run dorenie, Run!<br />
It was classic..I laughed quite a bit after that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL....i remember having some good times in /gu chat. Too many to count lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The shock and awe of my guild when, on a raid, bear form faded, and they found out that, indeed, the legends were true - Gandwer WAS a female character!<br />
<br />
And then the other day... one of our guld mages has been cranking out Torpor for guld shaman<br />
<br />
Me to guild: Hey guys, what's up?<br />
Guild mage: Hey Gandwer! I got you a present!<br />
Me: Yippee!<br />
Guild Mage: :)<br />
Me: ...Is it made of meat?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was on my friends Mage one day for a Raid in one of the planes.  Anyway, mass mod rods had to be cast so me being me casts! Unfortunatly I cast just as the monk was pulling for inc, I agro'd everything he had FD'd off and wiped out a 65 person raid =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our first emp kill in Ssra... we were IN the emp room, in the safe corner, and a wizard sends out an eye to pretarget the snakes.  Well, it was actually a paladin dualboxing a wizard... and after he cast the eye he looked away to tend to his pally, not noticing that it had FIZZLED.<br />
<br />
So he turns back to the wizard and runs forward to move the eye forward.  The Blood of Sraaezha and all the snakes immediately move over and wipe him from the face of the planet while the entire raid holds our breath to see if they will notice us...<br />
<br />
..and they did, and jumped us without notice.  NASTY situation.  Blood out of position and no tank has aggro, nobody has pretargets, etc.  We recovered and won, but we had a lot of deaths and it was a very messy victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN last night.<br />
<br />
me:40m<br />
war:I wish I could give you my rod.<br />
me:It's okay, I'll just eat myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/gu Anyone have a use for &lt; insert class here &gt;?<br />
Wastrel tells the guild: Come wash my car!<br />
/gu &lt; random profanity here &gt;<br />
<br />
I get dangerous when I only catch part of the conversations and toss out my 2 cents on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
/rsay Rod Inc (says the mage)<br />
/e covers ass! Exit Only!<br />
<br />
/e slyly considers how to wipe out the raid and blame the bard.<br />
/e realizes that thought was outloud and blames the enchanter for it.<br />
<br />
I 3box for a reason. It keeps me out of trouble...most the time. Ok, sometimes is does...OK! I manage to still get in trouble on a regular basis, but I blame the sun being in my eyes!<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I 2 box a cleric anymore on most raids.  So i can effectively heal my group, and join in the oh so fun cheal rotation at the end.  But hey, it is keeping me out of trouble so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only funny in hind sight:  Neh &amp; Rak fight for my epic.  &lt;br&gt;<br />
  Just as Neh is pulled, there's a loud bang outside my window and I lost all power.  After my profanity echoed off the mountains here in Vermont, I pulled the laptop out, boot it, and use my employers dial-in (shudder) account.  Get back in right at end of battle to loot her.&lt;br&gt;<br />
   I explain to the raid what's going on, so we quickly run down and try to pull Rak down the elevator.  Well the monk fails twice, finally a 65 Pally is pissed off, so he hits DA and pulls Rak &amp; 2 other reavers down.  No problem, we have overkill anyways.  Just as I see Rak die, the battery gives out on the laptop! &lt;br&gt;<br />
   Pick up the cell phone to call a guildie to log me in to loot the tear.  No Cell service, so the blackout is pretty wide spread looks like.  Finally run into the bedroom and use an old land line phone so he can logon and get me my tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">now thats an epic battle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Funny, I also lost connectivity during my Rak fight. My boyfriend and I were playing side by side, watching the mage pets slowly beat Rak down, all of a sudden I went LD. When I couldn't get back in, John had the presence of mind to log out and log me in on his computer to loot the scale.<br />
<br />
Turned out to be some glitchy IP address thing with Verizon DSL, but I'll save my Verizon DSL ranting for another time.<br />
<br />
I don't think I would have played EQ so long if it wasn't constantly a source of amusement. Illusion has always been a good source of hilarity:<br />
<br />
1. John getting illusion skelly and running around newbies - I have screenshots of people shouting about a &quot;named red con Skelly who was nice.&quot;<br />
2. John deciding it would be really funny to illusion skelly and then sneak up on a friend...the friend happened to be sitting at the NK bridge - guards don't find skelly illusions particularly amusing.<br />

Early days of Velious, early copy of Bear Form - five thousand plat<br />
Hanging out in FV, learning the old trick to make [quest text] - free<br />
Getting newbies to bring you quest items - priceless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/gu, &quot;Anyone got room for me?&quot;<br />
Poguk tells the guild, &quot;Depends.  How much do you weigh?&quot;<br />
<br />
/gu, &quot;later all, gotta pick up the house&quot;<br />
Poguk tells the guild, &quot;wow, didn't realize you were that strong&quot;<br />
<br />
Took a few of my guildees on their first high risk LDoN and was trying to coach them through how to handle mobs that hit for ~1000.  I was playing as my monk and was pulling singles for them.  Along the way, FD failed, got a few casters on me and I died.  Got rezzed in and looted my stuff REAL quick so that we didn't lose any time.  Got buffed, and proceeded to spend the next 60 mins wondering why I was doing such ****ty DPS...  we proceeded to lose the adventure by 1 item....<br />
<br />
So we're sitting there after we had finally got a partial win and doing our split and I open my inventory to delete the copper and silver when I notice that my Greater Lightstone was in my primary hand... and my Golden Wraps of the Compact were sitting comfortably in my inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Loading up my buddie's 60 necro, running to Oasis, casting spectre pet and going into arch lich form (illusion: spectre).. then running back and forth in front of the docks. Watching people run from the spec train was hours of enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Handing out alcohol to newbies in Kelethin (wood elf city) was always enjoyable. *drink* *SPLAT!*... /giggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hanging out in the deep with a ranger friend who had never been there.  <br />
<br />
ME:  See that bridge beside us there?<br />
HIM:  Yeah...<br />
ME:  On the other side is a named...go pull him<br />
(/snikker IRL)<br />
HIM: OK...<br />
Ranger runs....<br />
Ranger has taken DMG from falling...LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br />
HIM:  ***...did I miss the bridge and run off the end?<br />
ME:  I guess so...you should come back we can try again.<br />
<br />
20 mins later after CR and getting back<br />
<br />
ME: Go pull that named<br />
(hehehehehe....)<br />
HIM:  Ok...<br />
Ranger has taken falling DMG....LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br />
HIM: ***!!!!!!! did i do it again....?<br />
ME:  I guess so....wanna try again?<br />
HIM: OK<br />
<br />
Got him to run off one more time, by the time he realized that the bridge was 'fake' i was laughing so hard IRL that i couldnt type....He was lvl 65 and had like 60% into it...so i didnt feel bad killing him a few time for fun (got him rezzes too...cleric laughed his ass off rezzing 3 bodies when we told him what happened)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">in oasis, group of levels 8 to 12 with one newb that was discovering oasis for the first time<br />
<br />
Newb: what should I pull now ?<br />
Me: Bring a Sang Giant, we have a kick ass group.<br />
others: lol, yay, we rock !<br />
Newb: Incoming a Sand Giant. Get ready !<br />
others: What ????<br />
<br />
we all turned to the puller and laughed hard when we saw the SG behind our puller. We all zoned but the puller that has been crushed to death ^^.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had my friends warrior a few years ago and was tanking a bit for a few months...<br />
<br />
We were doing Dozekar. I get him behind the firepot, no problem, but after a while i notice that im hitting slower..<br />
<br />
I had forgotten my clicky for dispell countering...<br />
<br />
I tanked Dozekar completely unbuffed for the rest of the fight and lived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A couple years ago a ranger was foraging in PoG and kept talking about how happy he was he could just run around there completely safe.  So, after a while he hailed the prince in /gu.  I told him to ask him for phat lewts.<br />
<br />
30 seconds later...<br />
<br />
Ranger tells the guild: GD it!  I hate you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Turned out to be some glitchy IP address thing with Verizon DSL, but I'll save my Verizon DSL ranting for another time.<br />

verizon sucks ballz. And you can quote me.<br />
<br />
I have them for cell service.<br />
<br />
Here's MY verizon commercial:<br />
<br />
Random schmuck: &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Director: &quot;CUT !&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Tell you what - I'll LIE and say I hear him - but I want some Catherine Zeta Jones nookie.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Back before I could see right through dogdog, people used to come up to him and hail him for SoW and ports, happened a couple times while I was afk.  I thought it was hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I used to set dogdog up in Kelethin by the bank, or in the entrance of EC tunnel and watch the newbies come by and ask him for sow too. Gotta say the first time it happened (when it wasn't intended) was the funniest, never laughed as hard. =)<br />
<br />
Then there was the time I acidentally kicked the Kelethin alchemy merchant with my ranger (my first char, was level 15/16) and he moved out of place and wouldn't do any business. I felt it was my duty to get him back where he was supposed to be and died like 3 times pulling him there. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I zoned in to Kod`Taz for raids one night, and immediately went afk while zoning to eat dinner. Well apparently about 34 people 20k'd off my head while i was gone. That's some funny ****!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I saw my brother die in upper guk ( Troll warior 7 at this time ) because of an ogre warrior that was afk at the zone line.<br />
<br />
That was kinda funny. But it has been even more when 15 minutes later, he got a tell from the ogre saying: Ups, was drinking a coffee.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the same line, on The Tribunal server, there were 2 ogres that were blocking the door to the main bank in PoK. They were both running in the door, and there was almost no way to enter or leave the bank. It lasted 2 hours, just the time to get a GM in PoK .......<br />
They have been banned for 1 week, but was kinda funny to see.<br />
Any shaman of the tribunal that saw that too ?</div></div><hr />
