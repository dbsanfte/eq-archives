<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like a little extra wis and, especially, and upgrade to my pants. A shaman can only go on so long with soiled breeches...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Legs seem to be a real weak area for shaman,  not much to choose from till you can raid.<br />
<br />
Gatorscale is usually pretty cheap and would be a nice upgrade over that diaper your wearing.<br />
<br />
Brown Chitin or Sunlords leggings would be better but both are quite a bit more expensive.<br />
<br />
Totemic are actually not bad for AC based leggings considering the cost (got a pair for 80pp once).<br />
<br />
I used to have crystal chitin leggings and was quite happy with them but made the mistake of selling them to buy a corking device,  regretted it ever since but i've been wearing shadowscream leggings since then and haven't seen anything that I can afford that would be worth the money to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">An option for the leggs would be to have a smith make up a set of the old Northman Imbued legs for ya, AC12, Wis2 , Str1, SV Cold 2. Any Barbarian smith over the level of like 180 should be able to crank out a pair for fairly cheap at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kromriff Military Leggins (14AC +5 Wis) are decent leggings for a Shaman.  You may be a tad low to do the quest at lv. 33, but you could certainly do it in your low 40's if you had a bit of help.  <br />
<br />
You'll need to do three things<br />
<br />
1) Kill wolves and Giant Scouts in GD to get Coldain Faction up.<br />
<br />
2) Go to Crytal Caverns and hunt orcs until you get a bottle of no-drop Karsic Acid (you can kill Spider Queen there and use her Sceptre but that is a tad harder because the queen a tough mob for you).<br />
<br />
3)  Kill a Blood Wolf in GD and loot his Blood Wolf Harness, or buy one in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can read about the rest of the quest on www.everquest.allakhazam.com, just check out Thurgadin Quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the final step, you'll need some help to kill Fergul, one of the named giants in GD unless you are 50+ or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So what kind of force would I need to take down said giant? Is there any other loot off of him that might attract others to help me? I'm not in a guild...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will offer some cheap / ghetto upgrades (don't be shy becasue you are ghetto - I have been ghetto and proud for 55 levels)<br />
<br />
Range Slot: Howling Harpoon offers much more Wis / Mana than your slimey - and it has a nice proc (stun) that is sometimes useful. Pretty cheap in the Bazaar too<br />
<br />
Waist: Your current belt is fine, but if you really want to go wis (?!)Flayed turmoilskin is pretty cheap these days. If you can afford, get a chitinous belt'<br />
<br />
Wrist: Head to KC and ask politely to loot a Jarsarth Bracer - they rot all the time. If you can get a level 50+ to help you with the last stage, do the Coldain Military Breacer quest<br />
<br />
Legs: Do the Kromriff Military Leggings quest, get a level 50+ to help with the last stage<br />
<br />
Neck: Get a Imbued Ivory Collar, or even a Blackened Aloy Medallion<br />
<br />
Arms: Jaundiced Bone is dirt cheap, and the manaless stregth buff will save you mana when you get high enuff to clicky it<br />
<br />
Chest: Froglok BP? Barbed Ringmail - not sure what to say here - dont know how much you got to spend<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Elder Wolf Hide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks again for all the replies.<br />
<br />
I haven't found anyone that can make Northman mail - yet.<br />
<br />
I have about 500pp,  and that is dwindling quickly as I'm starting to buy my level 34 spells...</div></div><hr />
