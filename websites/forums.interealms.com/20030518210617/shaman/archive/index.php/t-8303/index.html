<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess this is why you should always check the cave just in case. I went to EF to checkout the IGs but  found they were camped. So I started running back to Halas to work on some baking when I figured may as well look for the GB even though I've done this before and never had any luck.<br />
<br />
I got to the cave and took a hard right, walked down a ways and ran smack into an icebone skelly and killed it. It occurred to me that this was the PL and from what I read it takes 7 hours for either another PL or the GB to spawn so I turned around and headed back out. I then saw the Lich guy approaching me and remembered he was some nasty necro and made another 180 turn with the idea that I'd just make a circle around him. Well what do you know as I'm running away from the Lich I see this humongous bear running straight at me and this big grin formed on my face -- I didn't have to con him I knew who it was. As I'm killing the GB I'm sweating up a storm thinking the Lich couldn't be far behind. Luckily the Lich never came by and the Glacier Pelt was mine woot!<br />
<br />
So anyway I was under the impression that the icebone skelly was a PL under a 7 hour timer so I'm really boggled how the GB spawned so soon after that.</div></div><hr />

To answer your question, I think I remember that there are 2 skellie place holders, either of which can spawn the glacier bear.  I think it's even possible for 2 bears to be up.</div></div><hr />
