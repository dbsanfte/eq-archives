<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does the Assist Wembly quest in PoStorms result in a flag for the purpose of PoP advancement or just access to Tactics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If its the diaku emblem one, its just Tactics access. Still have to kill MB for the regular flag progression.<br />
<br />
The other quest, for BoT access (Heads, beards, etc), is required for advancement I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's what I thought.  I was surprised to find that it increased my charm (Intricate Wooden Figurine) stats even though it was not an actual flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, the way the charms work is by zone access.  Basically you  get a free AA point and a charm upgrade every time you earn access to a new zone (not from level based access).  If you do the alt entry quest and then go back and get the regular flag from MB, you don't get another charm upgrade from MB.<br />
<br />
After tier 3, the charm upgrades are few and far between, as it takes lots and lots of flag earning kills to get to the next zone.</div></div><hr />
