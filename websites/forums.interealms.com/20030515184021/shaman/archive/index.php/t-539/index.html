<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Truthsnark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi ho, first time poster long time lurker.<br />
<br />
Wondering what the level requirements are for the epic quest.  I've completed through the turn-in of Marr's Promise/Woe/Envy to the wandering spirit in Karanas, and have the gem for the spirit in Emerald Jungle.  I'm level 32, and amiable to Truespirit faction (not sure if high amiable or low amiable).  Will I be able to turn the gem in to the spirit in EJ at level 32 and receive the next test, or should I level up further?<br />
<br />
By the way, I used neither invis nor invis to animals for the Test of Patience, and was not pestered by any sharks at all for the duration of the test.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

I got my ass handed to me by Black Dire when I was trying to slow him at 50 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe you have a level requirement of 50 to get the epic.  You can do all the steps, up to and including killing Rak (if you have someone to MQ the tear for you since you can't go to Fear until 46) before 50, I believe.  However, you won't get the spear if you turn in the Rak drop unless you are level 50.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm rather sure that you can get the spear itself at level 1 if you were actually able to do it, but the effect won't work until level 50.  I remember reading on here awhile back that someone got the epic sometime around level 30 or so just to prove that it worked, so I can't say from personal experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have to be 50 or 51 to get epics, otherwise the npcs will eat your turn-in and you wont receive reward. The level 30 epic thing was either a tall tale, or has since been fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More people posting false info as facts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are the facts that I know first hand:<br />
<br />
You CAN get the epic before 50, I know this for a FACT because my friend (Klisa, Iksar shaman on Brell Server) got his Epic at level 46.  <br />
<br />
I did every part of the quest before level 40 other than Fear/Rak/Neh and never had a problem.<br />
<br />
Spear effect is level 50 to cast.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Is it possible before 46 by doing faction work and MQ'ing the tear?  I guess its possible, but I'm not going to post info as fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are some epics where the level 50 resitriction is true. There are others where it is false.<br />
<br />
For Rogues it is definitely true.<br />
For Magicians and Shaman it is false.<br />
<br />
I don't have direct experience with others to say for sure one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Theoretically you can get your epic at level one if you MQ the tear from a shaman who already has epic and has a spare tear.  You would need to do some parts of epic over again for faction but in theory its possible.  Anyone know if there is a level limit on the DoT effect?  That would be one hell of a good PL tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone know if there is a level limit on the DoT effect?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I answered it 2 posts above yours.</div></div><hr />

I waited until 51, just to be safe. I'd had everything completed (excepting Kirn/Neh/Rak, because I hadn't decided if I'd skip ahead with the faction or just do the killing yet) at level 44-46 or so. I wasn't about to risk losing my Tears because I was trying to finish the quest early.<br />
<br />
As for Magicians, the NPC in Butcherblock will NOT talk to you if you're under level 51. It may have been changed in the last few months, however.</div></div><hr />
