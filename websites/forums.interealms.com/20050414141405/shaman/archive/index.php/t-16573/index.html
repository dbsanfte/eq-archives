<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My wife had the bright idea to turn on the computer when the hurricane was incoming, and a couple of power flickers later, power went out for about an hour and a half to two hours.<br />
<br />
When it came back on, for good we were told, I powered up the computer and got on line, and started up Wolfenstein multi-player, and the machine locked up. I rebooted, started up EQ using EQw AND normal EQ executable, and it locked up. Rebooted, tried again, another lock-up.<br />
<br />
Using DX9 and GeForce 4 MX420. I'm thinking that my video card got baked. Ran dxdiag and all the tests came up alright, altho' the white bouncing boxes were not bouncing smoothly, but more choppy/jerky. <br />
<br />
Any clues?</div></div><hr />

Run chkdsk (scandisk on 98/ME) and make sure there's no filesystem errors.  If that comes up clean, you've probably got a hardware failure of some sort.  vid card, motherboard, ram, and cpu, or any combination of the 4, could be causing the problem.  Most likely, it's the motherboard. :(</div></div><hr />
