<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Haven't played in over a year so need to catch up a bit. Whats new with shaman guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Hrothgar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just read about the new focus items, and the healing change, and undo of the kiting nerf...<br />
<br />
So we can get items that give us like a 30 percent more powerful DoT, got the 10% healing penalty taken away + can get items to make us have a 15-20% better at healing. can get items that give 10-20% more damage to our nukes, 10-20% reduction in mana useage for DD spells, and 30% more duration to our benificial spells...<br />
<br />
/BOGGLE !!!!<br />
<br />
Do we a get double attack, duel wield, parry, riposte, Clarity 3, and Ice commet too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not yet, should be in the next couple of patches though (jk)<br />
<br />
I came back to EQ after 1 1/2 year hiatus and so many things changed, it's awesome.   Welcome back, and good luck.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well the healing and kiting nerfage was removed because they were out of date and it really isnt that big of an increase with luclin mobs as the HP of your blue mobs have increased since those were implemented.  Kind of tells you how outdated are spells really are ;)  The caster mods are being placed in to balance the difference in upgrades to dps of casters and melee types. :)  But from your post I am guessing you already knew this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also check out the benefits of a horse, esp with JBB.  Med while standing and chain casting JBB, canni, or other spells.<br />
<br />
HoS was nerfed/fixed so cant stack rage, dex, str with it anymore.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin port potions;  Port to home city idols<br />
<br />
Tim Deep pot room ok for binding<br />
<br />
DOT stacking fix in the works, to allow 2 shaman on raid to stack same spell on mob; mob spell effect limit being raised to 30 soon<br />
<br />
Hell levels gone from 1-50, going soon in post 50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pretty much all of the things they said they'd never fix because of &quot;The Vision&quot; were fixed.  <br />
<br />
Umm . . . new ports to the moon for the TP classes which is convenient.  <br />
<br />
Umm, AA skills . . check em out.  That double attack **** actually happened if you buy the skill Rabid Bear.  For 5 minutes you get +300 attack, +100% haste, and about 200 skill in double attack.  Re-use time is a bitch tho, 2+ hours :(<br />
<br />
Clarty 3?  Puhlease.  That's slow mana regen compared to Canni5/Torpor.  Tho it does stack and lasts a long time so it's a nice buff to take with you from a raid to a solo session.  <br />
<br />
Timorous deep pot room is kewl to bind in, ports to 9 cities.  <br />
<br />
Um . . . yah that's about it.  Most of the improvements to the class have been with items that you may or may not be able to get/want to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... not yet, but we're gonna let the druids whine about that for a few weeks and then we'll get it (and rez) when they do! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe Robert135 - a blast from the past.<br />
<br />
Anyway to paraphrase Zorlac &quot;Amazing what happens when VI got rid of the dead weight.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ancient Scourge of Nife......    Jeez. Man thats a nice addition. Damn...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Good luck picking that one up, Robert135.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember you, good to have ya' back!<br />
Hmm, what else has changed;<br />
Trade skill have gotten a prety large boost, especialy smithing, for example:<br />
Crimson Darkscale Brestplate<br />
AC 53, Str 10, Sta 5, Int 5, HP 60, Mana 20, Ogr, Trl, War, Shd Rallos Zek<br />
<br />
Crimson Darksplint Tunic<br />
AC 30, Sta 10, Wis 10, HP 40, Mana 40, Ogr, Shm, Rallos Zek<br />
The downside is if you wern't at a skill of 250 in smithing before the patch it's become near impossible to skill up post 200 and the new recepies use blue diamonds like water and they are going for 2K+ each now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman have soloed named WW Dragons, Lodizal, and god knows what else. :)<br />
<br />
Check all your old gear, new focus effects were placed on a bunch of stuff.<br />
<br />
Warning! the caster mobs have been given updated spell tables and they now hurt you bad.</div></div><hr />
