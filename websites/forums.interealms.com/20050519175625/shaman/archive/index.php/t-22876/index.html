<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I did a search and I'm not finding anything, it may be that its real early in the AM and I should go to bed, but I'm making this post anyway :P.<br />
<br />
I belong to a very small guild. I'm happy where I am, and even though I have high play time, raiding isn't why I play the game. Although, we as a guild would like to try some new things, one of the things we were considering attempting is the Hedge Event in PoN. I've never attempted this event befor, so I am clueless as to how it works. What I was wondering is if anyone could share some info, or point me to some place that I could find said info.<br />
<br />
We as a guild can field 2 groups of mostly 65's, possibly 3 on our best days. As for gear, my magelo is in my sig, and I would say I'm slightly ahead of the curve compaired to the rest of my guildies, though our MT would have roughly 9k+ hps.<br />
<br />
Can the npc inside be arggoed and then memblured to control the pace of the event, is one of the biggest questions I have. Although any and all info is good and appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mezzed and memblurred will server you better.<br />
<br />
Take three groups in there. You will need at least two competent Enchanters.  IIRC the MOBs hit about as hard as a LDON normal (388-392). More and more spawn as you wander deeper into the maze.  The final guy is not that tough (500-600 a pop) and not sure if he can be slowed.<br />
<br />
Make sure people are assisting. ('natch)<br />
<br />
As a warmup, try taking a group through the &quot; protect the Gnome&quot; event in Cazic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe he can be slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This event is pretty easy, you may have to try and die a couple of times just to get a feel for the spawns and stuff.<br />
<br />
Basically as you move around the maze (following the quest npc) you will get pops in increasing numbers, 2 then 3 then 4 and so on.<br />
<br />
Just keep the npc mezzed at all times apart from when he is walking from place to place, you can even charm him to move him out of harms way when the mobs pop, kill the mobs, invis, mezz, memblur and move on.<br />
<br />
Took me four or five trys to do this event solo (3 PC's, two accounts per PC)<br />
<br />
Shaman, Cleric,  Enchanter, Necro, Druid and Mage.<br />
<br />
Equipment level just to give ya an idea<br />
<br />
Cleric fully time equipped<br />
Shaman mostly time equipped (doing the tanking)<br />
Enchanter: Mostly VT equipped with a couple of Ldon items<br />
Necro: Some Time gear but mostly Ldon<br />
Druid: Trash twink gear<br />
Mage: Some Ldon, mostly trash<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuggs<br />
<br />
Edit: When you charm the NPC, buff him up with virtue etc, makes it easier to keep him up if you make a mistake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just did this the other day with the biggest group of knuckleheads around.  Here's some stuff I learned from this PUG....(I was running my Bard at the time btw)<br />
<br />
1.  It helps the group A LOT if the chanter tries to mez more than the bard... or at least as much.... or at least mezzes at all really now that I think about it.  The chanter with us was horrible.  He might lock down 1 mob while I had 3 pinned and taken care of.<br />
<br />
2.  Let the tanks agro everything.  The knucklehead rangers and wiz that were with us would charge ahead of the wandering NPC and promptly die forcing us to rez and buff and wait etc etc.<br />
<br />
3.  I dont believe there is a time limit (see 2) since it took us 3x as long to get to spawn 5 as it did to finish the other time I've done this.<br />
<br />
4.  When you have agro, kite around.  The rooms arent very big but they give you enough room to run around so the chanter can mez... If you are the chanter this is where you want to assign a druid to be your gheto mezzer.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly the first time we did this we were a bunch of lvl 60s that didnt know what to expect.  After the 4th spawn, every time we had a new spawn area the warrior would go in and agro the mobs, the cleric would heal right away and now have solid agro to kite around and let the chanter mez.  It was ugly ugly stuff but it worked. :)  <br />
<br />
This last time I'm not sure what the plan was.... It was a horribly run event but I was tagging along with a guild so I wasn't going to tell them what to do.  I did think it was really funny when the quest NPC started walking away that no one noticed.... except me :) So I follow him around the first corner and park him there.  After the mobs are dead everyone starts spamming with &quot;OMG the NPC is gone where did he go?!&quot;  Finally someone came around the corner and let them know that I had him... but the fact that out of 3 groups not one of them saw the turd leave blows me away.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a fun event and I'm sure you'll do fine.  9k+ warriors and folks in your gear will do it np.  My guild is 6 people all botting and we are thinking of trying it with just us.<br />
<br />
One question... You are ahead of the rest of your guild in terms of gear but the tank has 9k+ hp?  RL friend that dropped out of an Uberguild?  9k+ Buffed or unbuffed I guess is the real question.  BAH either way you'll mop up :)  Let us know how it goes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Construct of Nightmares can definitely be slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OK, here's my rundown, having done this several times.<br />
<br />
Allakhazam quest guide is at http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2219, please refer to that for all dialog.<br />
<br />
1. Make sure ALL party members have the preflag (say &quot;Tortured by Nightmares&quot; to Adroha Jezith in Sickbay).<br />
<br />
2. Make sure NOBODY HAS ANY AE NUKES MEMMED.  Bards should not play AE damage songs.  You do not want Thelin damaged.  Personally, I do use AE slow; sometimes I get Thelin aggro, but memblur fixes it.<br />
<br />
3. Form up at the maze, near ZO2 in PoNightmares.  It helps if you have an evac'er in each group.<br />
<br />
4. Group leaders hail Thelin and follow the conversation, I think it ends with &quot;I am prepared&quot; or some such.<br />
<br />
5. At this point, all groups are ported in to a maze.  DO NOT TALK TO THELIN YET.  The question is, are they in the SAME maze.  There are THREE COPIES of the maze, all identical but at different (x,y) locations in PoNightmares.  If you have groups in different mazes, someone needs to evac, run back, and talk to Thelin again.  It may take 2-3 trips to get everyone in the same maze.<br />
<br />
6. Raid leader talks to Thelin again and he starts moving.  He goes a long way before anything interesting happens.  Have a chanter ready to mez/memblur Thelin at all times.  He will eventually path into a dead end with a single werewolf standing in it.  Kill the werewolf (Thelin will help).  Thelin then continues into the corner to pick up a piece of his dagger.  When he does, some mobs will spawn, I think about 2-4 of them.  It's critical to pull aggro off of Thelin as quickly as you can; I like to use AE slow here.<br />
<br />
7. Thelin will continue walking.  Any time you need a break for rez/rebuffs or for medding, just mezz/memblur.<br />
<br />
8. Rinse and repeat step 6 4 more times, except the number of mobs increases every time.  I think the last time we had 8-10 mobs spawning.  You do occasionally run into ravens in the maze that have nothing to do with the mob-spawn cycles.<br />
<br />
9.  Now Thelin will head to the central courtyard.  We always mez him at the entrance to this, pull and kill the birds inside, and make sure everyone is medded up and ready to go.  Then let Thelin go; he will walk to the fountain and the Construct of Nightmares will spawn.  CoN is a fairly conventional melee fight, just keep the MT alive and knock him down.<br />
<br />
10. At this point, loot the dagger off the CoN and hand it to Thelin. Terris Thule will spawn; Thelin goes over to her and has a conversation, then she despawns.  Now hail Thelin to receive your flag; you will also be ported out of the maze with the same hail.  Note that all loot is droppable except parchments, so you should be able to distribute loot outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
If you can field 2 groups of skilled people, you can do it.  Grab another group of scrubs just to fill out the 18 man event, but don't have any of them in key positions.  Solid CC and a well informed raid party make this event a breeze.<br />
<br />
If you are concerned about the event, here's what I recommend for a little advance recon to help things go smoother.<br />
1)  Go visit the Hedge yourself beforehand.  Bring a friend or two if you want, but really you can do this all alone.<br />
2)  Once inside the Hedge, don't start Thelin up (since you are alone), and move throughout the maze carefully.<br />
3)  Kill every static spawn you see.<br />
4)  Mark the location of each static spawn point on your map using the map editor.  Be sure to SAVE THE MAP after making modifications to it.<br />
<br />
I did this for soloing purposes (so I wouldn't stumble into spawns), and EVERY time I've gone back on a Hedge raid, the map I marked all the static spawns was the map we were given.  My impression is the other two maps are only used if there is another Hedge event going on at the same time (with a different raid).<br />
<br />
Knowing where every static spawn is means you can run ahead while Thelin is walking, aggro the static and bring it back to the raid for a quick kill.  This will save you time and make the waves a little more manageable, as several of the statics are placed at or near where the waves spawn.<br />
<br />
The waves are triggered when Thelin crosses certain points in the maze, and are always at a dead-end.<br />
<br />
Be sure to kill the 4 birds in the corners of the final courtyard where the Construct appears.  Do this before letting Thelin move up to there just to be safe.  The Construct has a lot of hp (comparing to the normal Hedge mobs) but really doesn't hit too hard.  If your tank has 9khp, I think a single cleric would be fine for keeping him up.<br />
<br />
Unless you are really low on DPS, I wouldn't recommend using pets that aren't controllable or ANY pets for people who have any kind of connectivity issues.  Especially no enchanter pets, since they will likely incur Thelin aggro periodically through the event.  Linkdeaths often end up leaving the LD player's pet whacking on Thelin.  If this happens during a wave, it can cause you to fail.  A hasted pet with mage toys can do some serious damage pretty quick. :p <br />
<br />
Best of luck to you. :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A couple of minor corrections. Trash mobs hit for over 400, but nothing special otherwise. The final wave consists of fewer than 8-10 mob; 6 or 7, I believe. The Construct is slowable and hits for 1K+, but again nothing special.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">funny seeing this thread--has been a couple days since i hit the site, and i led this last night. log in, wham--thread about the event. <br />
<br />
easy run. the hardest part is getting people to the hedge. that should say something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you for the responces all, much appreciated. It may be a bit befor we actually attempt this, as we don't plan raids or such, usually just wait for enough people to be on and looking for something to do, heh. But I am realy looking forward to giving it a go, new things and all.<br />
<br />
Who ever mentioned the gnome walk in CT as a warm up to this. Most of us are fairly familiar with the gnome. We used to do him fairly often, like twice weekly, heck we still do it on rare occasions for a bit of fun.<br />
<br />
One question... You are ahead of the rest of your guild in terms of gear but the tank has 9k+ hp? RL friend that dropped out of an Uberguild? 9k+ Buffed or unbuffed I guess is the real question. <br />
<br />
Fully raid buffed I think he comes out to 9.4k or just short of it. He 3 boxes a chanter, cleric, and warrior. Hes not currently &quot;offically&quot; flaged as a guild member, but he was at one time, and never joined another guild. So we still count him as a guild mate and he does stuff with us, and is one of the people I regularly group with. Like myself he has a high play time, but doesn't want to be in a &quot;raiding&quot; guild. So he/we work to better our characters within our means. Mostly Hard LDoN, LDoN merchant, and GoD gear, with a splash of other stuff in there. No Elemental access etc. We just work hard to get things done. Like how we are currently running open raids to take down Suled Dar's Shade to get our VP keys(he didn't loot a book on all 3 of his toons on our first success to let some others have a chance). Anywho, hope that answers that question.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the responces, I look forward to giving this a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, so we planed on doing this as a guild on Sunday, and still do. Me and the group I normally do things with decided to start the event to get a feel for it, we fully expected to die.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, we didn't, and beat the Hedge on our first go through, just the 6 of us(half the group being boxed by one person). It was fun to do, and I look forward to doing it as a guild.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the advice and tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The maze is very easy . And some tip help a bit. Per example make(and make him each time)  a  (more is better) pet and park him in room where mob pop . They  always attack pet first when they pop .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I thought the Hedge event was a pretty cool encounter.  Our guild's raid leader grabbed a couple seasoned members and took a bunch of the newer members of the guild through this not too long ago.  It's a great event to work on raid communications and discipline.  It's possible for one person to screw things up by not listening to instructions on this one, and it's small enough that  a raid leader can keep an eye on who is doing what.<br />
<br />
Lots of fun, and the TT encounter it opens up is a heck of a lot of fun too.<br />
<br />
Exeley</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you want to prep the key players (tank, chanter, cleric, etc.) you can do a walk-thru of the maze. Nice if you have the zone map with the hedge included. Refer to it during Thelin's walk and you can tell how close you are getting to the main event-fight ... but I am getting ahead of myself.<br />
<br />
If you do the quest to the point of being transported into the hedge just leave Thelin alone. Don't hail him. Then just walk thru the hedge maze (using map) and work your way to the center. There are a static spawns you can kill on the way to get a basic feel for mob difficulty. You will not spawn the multiple mobs on this test walkthru.<br />
<br />
This is just a way to get folks who are unfamiliar with the area a chance to get past that and focus on the group spawned mobs during the real event.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge there is no way out of the hedge maze except to complete the even and hail Thelin other than (1) gate, (2) port or (3) die and wait for body to pop in PoN GY. So if you take a non-gating class they need a gate potion or add a druid/wizard to your tour group.<br />
<br />
Shaman can solo this zone area also. There are few posts scattered here with details on doing it.<br />
<br />
Good luck - for a young guild, this is a fun event. Good practice for getting folks to pay attention, focus and react to multi-spawns quickly.</div></div><hr />
