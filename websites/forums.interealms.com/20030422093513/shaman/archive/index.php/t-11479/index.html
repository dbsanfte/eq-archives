<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is teh deal. I'm a 59 shammy who has not started alchemy yet. With the new racial potions, dye, guilt, ect I figure it might be time I start.<br />
<br />
With my Mage when i did baking ect, I always had a high int. Never had to worry about &quot;trade skill gear&quot;. My shammy is a hp shammy. I think my wis is 157. Not stellar. Obviously the higher the wis the more successful the combines (and persumably the skill ups?) If so, how much do you think is a reasonable amount to spend on items with + wis for skillups? Take in mind that the items are gonna be complete garbage and never used for anything else...<br />
<br />
Thanks much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used my regular gear with KEI (C3) and Greater Bear Form (+10 Wis) and I had 251 wisdom. I also had the new Alchemy kit (adds 5% to Alchemy). I skilled up pretty quick, but it cost me about 6k to go from 62 to 150.  But now, at skill level 150, I can produce SOW potions at a 94% success rate. <br />
<br />
I was told to get good wisdom jewelry (if you don't have any now). I don't believe there is any straight wisdom gear that you don't have already as a Shaman to improve your stats, well nothing cheap enough that is.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck and welcome to poor side of town now!<br />
