<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use the warcraft 3 icons, can download em somewhere on eqinterface. Default icons are really ugly, and not enough variety for my tastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There have been quite a few graphic issues, I'm surprised nothing was mentioned on this patch. Perhaps they are going to be doing yet another patch soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is nothing wrong with pink!  In fact my character is dressed entirely in pink!!!! ;)<br />
<br />
But I don't really have a comment on this because I don't use default spell icons anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They have a border around them much like the border on your sig =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm using Celtic 2, and my icons have the pink boarder around them.  <br />
Yes there is nothing wrong with pink, but my Barb. does not feel the need to &quot;get in touch with his feminine side&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pink is yucky. The spellbook and buff icons are pinked/greyed (beneficial/detrimental), but not (thankfully) the spellgems.<br />
<br />
I use default icons so I can talk to the Warriors in easy-to-understand sentences: &quot;Korg, do you have the arm with the sword buff? Korg, do you have the blue heart buff?&quot;... LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm using Phank icons .. really hope that I dont see this pink border stuff when I log in &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

Fix for ze pink icons, just replace the file in your interface directory with that one.<br />
While I did like them for about five minutes it got rather aggravating after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So much pink hate!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helzik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use default icons so I can talk to the Warriors in easy-to-understand sentences: &quot;Korg, do you have the arm with the sword buff? Korg, do you have the blue heart buff?&quot;... LOL<br />
<br />
LOL Samanna.  I use tking icons and I've often encountered that problem.<br />
<br />
Groupmember: &quot;Hey Zik, can I get ~buffX~?&quot;<br />
Helzik: &quot;You should have Talisman of the ~thing~. I  just cast it&quot;<br />
Groupmember: &quot;I don't think I got it&quot;<br />
Helzik: &quot;Hmm, message says it landed&quot;<br />
Groupmember: &quot;Oh, wait, is that the purple doohickey icon?&quot;<br />
Helzik: &quot;Not sure, I have different icons&quot;<br />
Helzik bangs his head on the wall.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
P.S.  I think pink looks just fine on some people.  But I'm not one of 'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did the vertical flip deal and it worked fine, fixed spellbook and buffwindow icon borders.<br />
<br />
Then I went buck wild and applied the SarsBuffs (http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2983) buffwindow mod. Note that it uses whichever icons you have loaded, it doesn't change them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol in the latest patch message they put this...<br />
<br />
-Due to a lack of popularity, we will be removing the pink border from spell icons. (what's wrong with pink?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is nothing wrong with pink!  In fact my character is dressed entirely in pink!!!! ;)<br />
<br />
But I don't really have a comment on this because I don't use default spell icons anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL That's nothing one of the top guilds on Mith Marr are all dressed in pink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There have been quite a few graphic issues, I'm surprised nothing was mentioned on this patch. Perhaps they are going to be doing yet another patch soon.<br />
<br />
Yah, cause npcs warping if  cornered into a wall is a rare occurance on raids and doesn't need to be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm using Phank icons .. really hope that I dont see this pink border stuff when I log in &gt;&lt;<br />

<br />

<br />
too bad most of us phankers arent playing eq anymore, only a very small number of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah I love Phank!  I never played on your server but I heard stories about you guys for the longest time.  Then I found your site and read all about your adventures .. very funny stuff (I particularly like the story about the cleric epic) and well written and great pictures!<br />
<br />
It's good to see that some of you are still around :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Holy crap, that Phank stuff is hilarious!</div></div><hr />
