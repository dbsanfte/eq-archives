<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mystt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tell me what you guys think...<br />
<br />
I have been thinking to something missing from the Shaman.  Not that I am PRO &quot;...give shaman CH&quot;  or something overpowered; but something legitimate and able to be seriously be looked at.<br />
<br />
After thinking awhile and in a group with Viscerator (hey man) camping those STUPID EMP KEYS ( I hate them)--we were talking about Crit Blast abilities and AA points.  The thought just hit me...What do shaman do the best....&quot;SLOW&quot;--well maybe a CRITICAL SLOW...not a 100% slow or something that would make the mob's that are IMMUNE suddenly be slowable...but,  maybe a SLIGHT UPGRADE to 85% slow or something to that effect...<br />
<br />
Tell me what you guys think???<br />

Holy He|| would those increase my shamanly enjoyment!  The loss of decent melee abilities in the 40's really bummed me out- to know I could work to get a little of that back would be a great motivator to grind!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh, 75% slow is already overpowered, now 85%, see this mob normally has a dps of 2000, you just made it... 300!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How about Endless Buff.<br />
<br />
One buff spell you cast has an unlimited duration... (dispellable I guess, upon death too.) Just pop Focus on your group once, and you're set!<br />
<br />
Not sure about this, but can't see how it would be too overpowering. Perhaps limited to longer-duration buffs such as Focus, or group buffs only.</div></div><hr />
