<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I duo frequently with a mage, and I haven't been able to make it so I can see his pet's health on my group bar.  Is there an option somewhere to make this happen?  I've resorted to having to stop and target the bug to check on him, or assisting the mob to see if he needs healing.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!<br />

<br />
Had a summoner last night in party..  his pet agro'd someting and he didnt inform group would have been bad I I didnt notice his pet not being with us...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pet heal is a spell he just scribed, but even so, I'd love the option of seeing pet health  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it were to be added to the group bar, I'd definitely want it to be switchable (on or off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the options menus under targeting there are keys you can set to target a group members pet.  I believe it is default shift+f1, shift+f2, etc, but I don't know of any way to have the pet health show up in the group bar. :(</div></div><hr />
