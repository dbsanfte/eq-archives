<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not to be one to look a gift horse in the mouth...  And I wouldnt have even noticed it probably if it were not from a friend cleric who upon seeing the destination of where the Spiritstone of Everfrost ports us,  ( the igloos) piped up... &quot;*** kraum, my spiritstone ports me right to my cleric guild&quot;<br />
Anyone know if this is &quot;working as intended&quot;TM or bugged???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess this is Working as Intended (tm).  That's the port location for the Everfrost gate potion, they probably didn't want to write new code, so they used the same location.  If I'm not mistaken, the spiritstone for those wicked troll and ogre shammies plops 'em right down next to the shadowed dudes in the swamp, no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Cabilis one which is soo nice uses the same loc as a gate potion.  It lands you right in front of Kaesora.</div></div><hr />

It looks like this was as intended.  A shame they couldn't have used the spot the Timorous Deep Halas Firepot uses (right by the dock next to town) instead. :p<br />
<br />
As a side note for tradeskillers:  The igloo location the Spiritstone sends you too is an AWESOME spot to farm spiderling silks and a fair spot for padding pelts, though there are more ruined than anything else.<br />
<br />
I leave the (heavy) stone in the bank now, and after I die on a raid and a rez doesn't appear to be an immediate thing, I gate to TD, go to a bank town (Halas, Felwithe, wherever), then click my stone.  Even naked (well, in bearform for my dignity), farming padding components is effortless there with dogdog.  Use those worthless spirit pouches to hold the loot.  After the rez, dump them on the ground except for one or two with the good stuff in it, and transfer loot to real bags. :)  Presto, efficient use of downtime!  (If you don't tradeskill, leather padding stacks sell to PC's for around ~100-200pp a stack now.  Something to think about...)<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's a good idea!  I'm bound at bazaar, so I usually put on my 2nd-best suit of armor (Jarsath) and head to Dawnshroud for hopper or caveman fun.<br />
<br />
/me eyes the empty cave mournfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bozze Blightbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How are spiritstones made anyway? Without membership to any of the &quot;pay info sites&quot; for eq such as flashlink etc I can't seem to find much info. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">http://www.eqtraders.com/  , for all yer trade skill questions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
www.eqtraders.com is THE place to go for tradeskill information.<br />
<br />
That said, to answer your question, Spiritstones are made with the pottery tradeskill.  It takes an extremely talented Master or Grandmaster potter to be successful, and some of the components aren't easy to come by, as well as being a little pricey to attempt.  The failure rate is HIGH.<br />
<br />
On my server, spiritstones were priced at 10kpp for awhile, but have now settled to the 4-6kpp range.  YMMV.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I bought one for 8k when they were still rather new ... I think I was the first one in my guild to have one.<br />
<br />
I find it very useful because I bind myself right where I am hunting at the current time (at the orb in TT, right outside Chardok ZI, etc.) so that I am not in for a nightmare CR in &quot;the worst case scenario&quot; ... I used to keep myself bound in the Nexus, but, I shudder to think of a CR to, say, Sebilis, if I couldn't get a port.<br />
<br />
So then what I do is just use my stone to go to Everfrost.  I've got a bank, food/water merchant, and all of that not far away at all.  Then, I can, if it's needed, run to Surefall Glade to grab a port in case of a guild raid.  Or if I need to go to the moon, I run to NK and take the spires up (I don't mind the run).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a potter (187) and I have a spiritstone of Everfrost (though I didnt make it myself). I like it. I'm bound in Nexus for quick travel to the moon, and can gate to Everfrost if I need to get to Norrath quickly, then a short run to Surefall to meet a druid. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes the Troll one drops you into the middle of the shadowman camp in the swamp. <br />
<br />
This makes for a nice way to get to CT quick. Then with the OT gate hamber and gate I can move around fairly easy. Keeps the ports down to a minimum because I dont mind running a couple of zones to get some place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The spiritstones go to the gate locations, based on the religion of the shaman.  The Faithstones, go to the temples of the various clerics religions.  Shrug, dont ask its the &quot;VISION&quot;</div></div><hr />
