<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Was great fun!<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who attended, both KoE and our close friends.<br />
<br />
Zelfy you did an amazing job pulling. That must have been a great rush. <br />
<br />
Rizz, outstanding job on the organization and strategy. <br />
<br />
Keepers, one more kill to notch on our belts. I am proud of you all.<br />
<br />
As for me? Well, I started a quest a long, long time ago. And beleive me, this quest has seemed literally like an everquest... I have often wondered, 'will it ever end?'<br />
<br />
My character is a paladin, and I chose to be a paladin for several reasons. One of those reasons was the Paladin swords, and the quests that needed to be taken to obtain those swords. First there was Ghoulbane. Then Soulfire. After that, the Fiery Avenger.<br />
<br />
Then Varent committed a terrible crime and created swords and holy weapons for all classes.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Being a paladin was no longer unique in that one aspect of the game. In the aspect of having the most UBER of weapons. <br />
<br />
I was disappointed as were many paladins. Then they gave us a new sword, the Fiery Defender... the paladin epic. It was a small consolation to those who have faithfully played the paladin class. Eventually, I, like many other paladins, took this offer and continued on.<br />
<br />
However, I cannot forget or forgive that I have been working on the Fiery Avenger and subsequently the Fiery Defender ever since I started EQ, only to have so many other classes receive a weapon that is viewed as much more powerful and necessary to a guild then any of the paladin 'holy swords'. <br />
<br />
Then Varent, with their '201' wisdom, continued to add insult to injury when they decided to not allow paladins above the level of 52 to obtain the pieces for their epic off the dragons that they drop off (Naggy and Vox). <br />
<br />
Paladins above level 52, now had to get the books from Gore and Sev/Tal. Great! What a brilliant decision to outline the &quot;vision&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lets give the paladin class a penalty for surpassing level 52!&quot;<br />
<br />
I stayed at level 52, deleveling dozens and dozens of times, in an attempt to continue on Naggy and Vox raids because I was in a small guild that was not able to go after those higher level dragons. For five months I did this. I watched my other friends in game, level and surpass me to such a degree that they no longer wanted to hunt with me because I was too low of level.<br />
<br />
Then... one day... I joined KoE.<br />
<br />
Since then I have seen this guild rise to the pinnacle of success, and I have seen them do it with a level of class and dignity that few, if any on this server can ever claim.<br />
<br />
Last night my guild members and I took down a dragon. Not just any old dragon, but a dragon that provided a great challenge.<br />
<br />
A dragon that held in his possession one of the items that I have sought after for so very long. My guild awarded me that item... one of those DAMN BOOKS!!! <br />
<br />
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at that point. After all this time... after all this effort... I finally have one of the two books I have been seeking to complete my epic. The epic that has held every paladin's imagination for so very long.<br />
<br />
Thank you KoE. You have no idea what this means to me. I am forever in your service.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kilrain, great post my friend. The &quot;Vision&quot; has definately stuck it to the Paladin. It is good to see you get this very difficult part for this very difficult quest.<br />
<br />
/cheer<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Quay Shadowsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well i didnt get to join you in killing the dragon but i did get to watch from Aseid's computer. Ummm let me rephrase that i got to see the inititial charge and the 30 or so people get feared, and then i watched Aseid get wiped out. i really do think he was the first to go down. Anyway he popped back in to  find that you guys had indeed slain the Dragon, for which i say CONGRATULATIONS KEEPERS on a job well done, and though i wasnt there in person i was most certainly there in spirit. And congratulations to you on the book Kilrain. Next time i   hope to get to join you. Be safe all and i'll see you in Norrath.  :)</div></div><hr />
