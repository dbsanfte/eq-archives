<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this a good hammer, i just spent 500pp, which i think was a good deal, and then 200pp to raise my 2hb skill to 115. At lvl 30, i deal about 46-51 dmg when they are debuffed, and it procs a good bit. But im not sure if i should switch it out to my Spine Chill Spear/Charred Gaurdian Sheild instead. I mostly just root, slow, disempower, dot, then melee down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blight Hammer is quite nice for soloing.  The DOT saves you some mana, as you dont have to cast it, as long as you get the proc, and at level 30 its amazing, because of the proc...<br />
<br />
I believe that 2hb is probably better then piercing at this level, as 30-33 are amazingly weak damage wise, and if you can cast the 34 dot of your hammer at level 30, and deal 46-51 damage a hit, youll be able to solo sooooo well for the level.<br />
<br />
And dont worry bout disempower, i never noticed any decrease in the mobs capabilities when it was debuffed like that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't pick my Blight up until 52...actually dropped from naggy. I still use it while soloing at 54 vs. SF in oot. Packing the spear and shield away lowers my ac below 850, but the proc is pretty nice. Have noticed faster kills in oot with hammer than w/o it so it's in me hands when I'm there. Still use harpoon and shield when in group tho...need the ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can, pick up a granite face grinder.  That thing packs a punch.  No proc though...so not sure how much better it would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Love my Blight.  Got it as a gift for some guild favors.  Miss my shields...<br />
<br />
You MUST have some haste up at ll times with it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am hoping to get my epic this week (tear is burning a hole in my pocket).  I have been using Blight since my early 40's after I picked it up on a Naggy raid where I was the only shaman there..(sigh).<br />
<br />
This hammer has saved my life several times..so many in fact that I don't mind having to cast a shield-spell to keep my AC up.  It procs well, does 500hp's of mana-free dot damage, and with haste can do additional 40hp procs in addition to 80'ish hp's per full hit...Seafuries fear it.<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of melee damage the SoF does, but I'm considering keeping this hammer in a hotkey slot so I can swap it out with the epic when I wade into battle (a la bard weapon/instrument swapping).  An additional few hundred hp's damage for us non-JBB types is nothing to sneeze at.<br />
<br />
A good investment (and a great price!)<br />
<br />
p.s. I still use a SBS and a chillspine spear for raids atm for wis/resists and AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm...I might have to pick up a Blight and try it out :)<br />
<br />
The GFG I've been using is great, but if I whiff a lot, there goes my dps out the window.  With the blight, if it procs, and I still whiff...at least the dot is still chewing on em.</div></div><hr />
