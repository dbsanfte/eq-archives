My exp seems to be pretty bad. I'm presently grouping in OT and it takes me about 40 minutes to get a yellow. If that is normal dont read anymore and just tell me its normal. If that isn't normal and is pretty bad reply with where you leveled at during your 36ish time and the exp/loot factor it gave you. I've tried soloing but it seemed pretty bad exp/loot considering the exp/loot i could get while grouping (not to mention the safety). My items aren't great... that cant be helping the soloing issue, Darriel's my first character so my items range from raw-hide shoulderpads to ivy etched bp to centi ss. I dont have luclin so if you leveled their dont bother telling me to go their :). Also if you could tell me when its a good level to go to ry'gorr keep (to kill the mobs that drop ry'gorr equip) i'd be apreciative. Also ive seen 3 guild members level in OT (grouping) from 37-40 in maybe 10 hours tops. So far i've heard good palces to be is Sola/Solb, OT (hehe), almost anywhere in velious with 31-35 animal mobs, and Lguk in a bit. So please! Help out a ranger in need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 hrs/3 levels = 600 mins/15 yellows = 40 min/yellow<br />
<br />
What's the problem?</div></div><hr />

As others have indicated, 40 minutes per yellow is not that bad at all. The key to leveling in OT is your group. There are going to be LOTS of blue mobs out there, so you want to get a good fast group - prefereably one which can dual pull (have two pullers bringing in mobs at once). This is easy on the Ledge or the SW corner, or over by the Sarnak tower. If you do the Sarnak tower you can bring extra value by Harmony pulling tower.<br />
<br />
Soloing can be nice if you can't find a group (try sabretooths in the SE corner), but your best experience will certainly come in groups. Try and replace any raw hide armour you have - at 36th level this should be pretty easy to do really. Maybe a Blood Stained Mantle? AC6 and +10 vs magic, which is always nice. If your really trying to get fast experience, find a static group and maybe hit Mistmoore or Kedge Keep - both zones have much better experience modifiers than OT, but you need to bring a group. Lower Guk also will have much better experience, and you may find a group easier there to be honest. If you try it, look for a Bedroom group (BR). Good luck my friend!<br />
