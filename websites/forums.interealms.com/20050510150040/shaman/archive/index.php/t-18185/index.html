<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mighty fine feline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My apologies, I am sure that this has been brought up before, searching the forums did not seem to find threads that addressed this issue. I just turned 34 (Vah Shir Shaman), I prefer grouping still, but at this point I never have enough mana to feel that I am contributing my fair share. In the past, I have played melee characters, so it took me awhile to learn not to hit every mob.  Having finally learned to back out of the fight was a big step for me.  Now I must learn how to control my mana. When I first hook up with the group, I try to buff the melees and dps with Talisman, dex, sta, agi, haste and regen.  I only cast regen on casters. My pet gets Talisman and haste. Then I am out of mana and I never get back up over 50%. I programmed the canni dance into a hotkey, and do that until I am at 30% health, still mana is not over 50%.  Frequently I am the main healer, so it makes me very nervous that  I have this responsibility with low mana.  Of course, as soon as we finally sit and med, then it is time to rebuff and I am back at low mana again.<br />
<br />
My wis is at 178 equipped, I have focus items with Mana Preservation II, Spell Haste II, and Burning Affliction II.  I plan to get a horse in the next few days, hoping that it helps.  Does the level of the horse affects its usefulness?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why are you giving all those buffs to the melee?<br />
<br />
I just Talisman them, give them my best STA buff then haste them (if there's no chanter). I say if you want something else ask. I only haste pet when in groups (he's my timer) - dogdog shouldn't be getting hit too often.<br />
<br />
The problem is you are healing. Shaman are bad healers until 44 with Stoicism. In LDoN I can sucessfully MH and slow, as well as keep up haste and other buffs. Stoicism will bring tanks up to 100% from 70%, depending if they have temp or not.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't your mana, it's how you're using it. Don't regen the casters, only if they get smacked. Make sure to regen yourself. That becomes easier at 39 and Chloroplast (but I still give Regeneration to the casters when hit). That allows you to canni more as well as the horse. I have never gotten a mana pres. item (too expensive) so I wouldn't know how much those help, but I can assume a lot.<br />
<br />
Good luck conserving your mana :cool: <br />
<br />
Oh yea - get an Extended Enhancement II item or better. Haste will last longer, regen will last longer, all buffs will last longer. It's more important than Spell Haste II. I rarely need the haste, I banked mine but have yet to sell it. All my friends are super uber twinks or uber mains (one of my friends is worth over 100k, at level 45 - he bazaar farms like crazy). Good luck!<br />
<br />
Oh yea (again) - Are you DoTing when in an XP group? If you are, don't bother unless it's an add. Mobs go down too quick for the DoTs to be worth it. IMO. So that may be another manasink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at this point I never have enough mana to feel that I am contributing my fair share.<br />
<br />
The 30s are, without a doubt, the crummiest levels for a shammie.  Your mana pool sucks, your heals suck, your spells are expensive, they only work on a single target, they don't last long enough, and you can't regen mana noticably better than any other caster.  Getting the dog at 34 is a single bright spot, but otherwise its pretty grim.<br />
<br />
But trust me, it gets a lot better later on.  By 51 (I know that seems like a long ways away; its not), things will start to really look up as you gain the ability to shave off 60% of the mobs DPS with slow (and the % rises as you level to 60) and get the later Cannabalize spells.  Still later, your group desirability will increase to the point where you are will be turning down unsolicited grouping requests, yet you will gain the ability to easily solo mobs that take whole groups to kill.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way: most classes have a power curve that describes their utility relative to level.  Ours is balanced toward the end of that curve, and at 65 you could construct a decent argument that we are overpowered.  Thats annoying when your druid buddies are quadding 4 mobs for 2 blue bubbles every few minutes, but don't envy them.  They are very powerful thru the 30s and 40s, but peter out by about 60, being left with few group roles beyond a few buffs and few exp solo'ing options.<br />
<br />
And then theres beastlords, but I won't get into that here.  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I totally agree with the extended enhancement II item, will save you much headache.  Cheap and easy to find is the drakescale belt, should be able to pick one up for 200p at the highest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, EE II item works wonders, I really notice the difference when I forget to put mine back on. Another couple el cheapos are the Batfang Headband and Clawed Knuckle Ring. Mana Preservation II is FREE, everyone should do the really really easy quest for the Fine Antique Ring, can do it at level 1~ with 50 plat or less.<br />
<br />
My shaman is currently in the same range, this is what I do to help when mana is tight:<br />
<br />
Don't give out all your buffs. Talisman and STA for everyone, though many casters won't want Talisman because it doesn't stack with their self buff, and then Haste for melee's if yours is all they've got, and Regen for you and melee's that are getting hit. After that, make them beg. DEX I will give to melee with proc'ing weapons, STR to the master looter. =p AGI is a totally 'I've got so much mana I don't know what to do, so I'll cast Nimble' type buff. If you're having mana issues, flat out refuse to cast it.<br />
<br />
Use a lower level slow, and don't bother with slow on single mob pulls. In my normal group, on a one mob pull by the time Tagar's finishes casting the mob is at 50%....waste of mana. I only slow on multiple mob pulls, and if I'm doing alot of healing I'll switch to Walking Sleep to help save mana.<br />
<br />
Horse - a horse is a horse of course of course, does the same for mana regen no matter what level you are or which horse/leezard you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did I mis-read or is he main healer, main slower, main buffer, no kei, no horse and he's never above 50m?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been having a similar mana shortage at 31.  I'm mostly doing LDoN groups and once Clarity wears off (assuming I get one in the first place), my mana pool sinks like a stone.  I'm usually the main healer in my groups, so I mostly regen myself, the MT and anyone who takes damage and spot heal the MT.  Then canni dance.  I never DoT, but occasionally nuke or slow depending on the mob(s).  By the end of the adventure, many of the buffs have gone by the wayside.  Dropping down to a lower level slow is a good suggestion.</div></div><hr />

Honestly that sounds about right, and I never had the horse advantage.  I think you may want to cut back a little on buffs.  Just give the tanks talis, str, sta.  If they complain work in the other buffs later on.  Another option is to wait a little while to buff for when you join the group.  Instead of putting everything up as soon as possible hit them with talis first.  Don't even bother hp buffing your pet in a group, it's a waste of mana.  Just keep him hasted to time when the tanks need it.  After a couple kills hit yourself and then the tanks with str.  Then slowly work in sta.  The regen is great on a main tank and the damage dealers as well.  Your strat for the casters is good to, but only keep it on them if/when they get hit.  Another important thing to remember is that if you're the main healer and slower tell them to stop pulling because you need to med.  Let them sit at 50% hps while you do med.  DO NOT heal them and then make them sit there at full hps while you med.  Honestly if you're main healer and slower buffs get thrown out the window except for the most important at that level - haste, hps - stats are not necessary but str may help.  Don't worry about contributing your fair share.  In the groups you describe you're not their for damage.  You have your pet, he's doing the damage for you.  You're keeping everyone alive - I think that counts as your fair share.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am level 39 now (as of today) so i recently went through these levels...<br />
<br />
/AGREE with the above posters. <br />
<br />
casting agility is just a waste of mana.  it's effects are trivial.<br />
<br />
I will cast talisman, and sta on the tanks.  Eventually I will work in STR but usually someone else has a STR buff and I ask them to do it for me.  I usually warn group that hasting pets is a last priority.  I am well twinked and usually always have the mana to do it, but in a case where mana is tight, hasting pets just costs too damn much.<br />
<br />
When I join I usually ask for very slow pulling while I put up buffs, and I canni 2 times in between each cast.  This not only means when I am done buffing I have alot more mana, but it also means that the buffs are a little bit spaced, so when I need to re-apply buffs the first time around I don't have to stop everything, but rather buff in-between duties.<br />
<br />
Slow is really priceless and even if mana is struggling I would say slow every mob that stands more than 10 seconds.  If your dps is insane and mobs drop in less than that, then don't waste the mana, but for the most part slowing ends up netting you mana gains by not having to heal them later.<br />
<br />
I know at the low 30's slow doesn't seem to do much, but I promise I have been main healer in almost every group I was in, and when I slow like a madman I tend to have more mana.<br />
<br />
like others said, don't bother regening the casters unless they are getting hit enough to warrant it.  Regen is really expensive at these levels, and it fades really fast.  cutting this out will greatly help your mana.<br />
<br />
Also, if your main healer, don't be afraid to ask for a short med break.  If your at 30% health and still around 40% mana, then it's time for a quick med.  The 40m isn't bad, but you have no reserves left, not to mention that you don't have enough hit points to take a few rounds of beating after a slow or a heal.<br />
<br />
But probably the best thing to help is know your fellow casters.  If it's you and a group of tanks, well, your pretty much stuck asking for med breaks, but if you have other casters in the group, there is no reason that they couldn't pickup other duties for a short while to allow your mana to climb a bit.  If you have a chanter in group, they should be taking hastes in the first place (unless they want you to take for a short while to med up).  Also, chanters could take slow duties for a bit if mana gets really low.  BL's can also slow mobs for a bit to help.  I don't group with enough mages or wizards to know what of theirs crosses over with you, but I am sure someone here can help me out.<br />
<br />
Necros can heal a little, and can also help add a bit of mana to you.  Pallies can heal obviously, and I think they have a STR buff.  Druids can obviously take over heal duties, but they can also regen and str buff.<br />
<br />
there are more obviously, but this post is already way too long.  I guess my point is, work on figuring out what &quot;bare necessity&quot; is in your particular group, and don't be afraid to fall back to it to keep a safe amount of mana and hps on hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with some of what illitian icerage says.<br />
<br />
Mana efficiency is a problem for us til a bit higher in level.  For now I'd try to maximize your buffing efficiency by not giving out extraneous buffs.  For example, the only casters that need regen are necros as it supplements their health to mana spells, you need regen to supplement canni, and you might regen the main tank if it helps reduce healing.<br />
<br />
One way to save a little mana is to cast spells of a lower level and mana cost.  You probably won't want to do this with buffs for your melees, regens, or hastes, but you might get away with it buffing non-melees.  Stamina doesn't impact hp that much at lower levels and the AC gains from low level agility buffs aren't that significant compared to how hard critters hit.  I wouldn't bother with either unless you're floating in mana and even then I'd usually only do tanks.<br />
<br />
Only heal when you need to.  Our early heals are lacking (well, our heals in general are lacking).  At your level it may be good to keep your best and 2nd best heal memmed and use the smallest one you can...you don't want to overheal and waste mana.  Critters don't hit that hard at your level and most tanks are fine at 70-80% health unless they have really horrible gear.<br />
<br />
I did a lot of LDoN at your level and I'd usually use my 2nd best slow to use less mana - otherwise I would never have had enough mana throughout an adventure.<br />
<br />
I would suggest getting a Ceremonial Iksar BP if you can - they have very a high regen effect that works wonders with canni at your level - you'll canni more for more mana.<br />
<br />
Speaking of canni...I wouldn't canni so low on health....I personally shoot for around 80% health...you don't want to put yourself at risk...the only thing that's important is that you stay below 100% health to let regen feed your canni dancing.  I keep regen up at all times and at your level had that Iksar BP...and you canni any time you get to 80% or more health.  I think that's more effective than doing a massive canni down to low health (at least until you get the stoicism line for extended canni dancing).<br />
<br />
I'd suggest getting some better group makeups!  While I was main healer often at your level and it can be done it is taxing.  Ideally group with a cleric and/or a chanter.  Chanters are nice to group for the obvious mana regen and crowd control but they also always have better haste than us and it's a relief to not be doing the hasting.  :)  In any group it's generally ideal to have ONE tank taking the damage to making healing/regen easier.  Work with your tanks to make sure only one of them is 'main tank'.<br />
<br />
In many group situations, particularly at your level, you will be support shaman.  You'll be resonponsible for maintaining buffs (often including hastes and some regens), slowing (you should be slowing all critters to minimize healing...although you can't always use your most powerful slow at lower levels due to mana inefficiency), and you should be ready to backup heal.  It's also good to have root ready for self defense or to protect a cleric/caster that gets aggroed.<br />
<br />
One great thing about the shaman class is its flexibility and the many different ways one can be successful as a shaman.  Because there is so much we can do you often, particularly at lower levels, have to spend a lot of effort balancing what you do because you just can't do it all.<br />
<br />
To close I'd say stick with it.  Shaman start out kind of challenging and highly mana-inefficient...but the class gets better and better and more and more enjoyable over time as you level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When i was your lvl and was main healer I would cast sta dex and tailsman on the mt, tailsman,stamina and haste on the dps and only tailsman on everybody else. and if i had to slow i used the very first slow we get. if i wasnt main healer then i used my best slow and kept everyone buffed. Its good your getting a horse though you will see the benefits immediately.if another shammy is in group split up the buffing duties one buffing haste the other stam,tails etc. if a chanter is there let him haste of course, and if you have a bard, amke sure he is playing his mana song</div></div><hr />
