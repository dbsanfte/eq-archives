<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alonok Spirittalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I try to remain out of the Arguments although I fail at times, but this is getting ridiculas.<br />
<br />
I DON&quot;T care if the Druid heal heals more. I don't care that it costs the same mana and has the Same cast time but heals more. I don't care what the druid can do. I Don't care what the Cleric can do. I don't care about the Wizard, Warrior, Enchanter, Bard or any other class.<br />
<br />
I CARE ABOUT SHAMAN. We got a MAJOR enhancement for our class. I am happy. If you don't want the spell, don't use it. If you Like the spell use it. STOP comparing it to every other class spell. Do I like Druids getting every damn thing they want? NO, but I don't care. I don't care because I am concerned with what WE get. Be happy for what we got.<br />
<br />
I listen to the Uber Shaman talking about how we have this and that. How we can do this and that. How anyone that complains about something we have or do not have is a Gimp or a loser. Personally, I think they are the losers. You don't want us to petition to improve our class because you don't think we need what we ask for.....Fine, don't buy the spell if/when we get it. But shut the hell up with your Holier than thou Attitude because you have hit 60 and own a full spellbook.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, before others start complaining, take a look at what we have BEFORE you start complaining about what we don't. So the Druid heal heals 1k more damadge. We have Slow to cut down the amount of damadge done. It doesn't cover spells or HTs true, but it still covers Melee damadge, making us EQUAL. <br />
<br />
I would like to see a Casting Slow to reduce the damadge from Casting mobs so lets ask for that instead of complaining that our new heal is not as efficient as a Druids because it heals less.<br />
<br />
I agree that 50% of our buffs are irrelevent. I could care less about Group Charisma or half the other crap we get. I would like spells that suit us better than the same buff over and over. But screaming that XX Class got this and we didn't is not going to help us. Stating what we have, why its worthless and what should replace it would help us. I don't like most of the PoP lineup. I really don't see a need for 20 more useless buffs that we can cast on people that already have maxed stats, so lets say &quot;Thank you for the new Heal, BUT could we look at XX&quot;.<br />
<br />
Druids are known to be whiners. Everyone sees them as whining Bastiches that get everything they want if they whine long enough. We are not like that. Shaman, as a whole, are logical sound people. Lets keep it that way and Thank them for the Spells we get while requesting/Suggesting others instead of screaming &quot;Druids got (Insert item here) I want that too!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that you have some valid points, and I agree with some of what you said.  But I think you have to understand that other people may have more experience than you.  For instance, your tag says your level 55, and if im not mistake means that you cannot cast the new heal.  I think that more experience might cause you to be less rash.  For instance, you said you dont care about group charisma.  Though its not one of my favorite spells,  I actually use it for a couple select encounters, which is more than I can say for so many of my other buffs.  But you probably have no idea what im talking about, and thats because you havent done it yet.  No one has all the answers, and there is always someone with more experience than yourself.  So its important to listen to the opinions of those people, even if you disargee with them, because they might have a more diverse perspective.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does he have to cast it to read all the algebraic formulas that have been poted in here?  There is so much information in the posts on this bored i think Verant comes in here to see what they created for us. I like reading all the end game tactics, you all have a ton of exp and i like reading and looking forward to reaching that goal one day. But it gets old reading posts that seem to say if you aren't 60 and have a full spell book shut up you have nothing to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So if all classes but Shaman wake up tomorrow with 1000 HPs automatically added to them, and Shamans instead get only 300 HPs (reasons include cannibalization, regeneration, slow, etc.), we should be happy because we got extra hit points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sooooo ... your made a thread bitching about the bitching.<br />
<br />
anyone else see the irony in this ?<br />
<br />
i think the &quot;bitching&quot; had died down quite alot. the bitterness i feel is leaving , this is not a productive thread at this point mate ;)<br />
<br />
i understand your frustrations , just understand everyone elses....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bitching in general doesnt solve anything. it's just annoying.<br />
logic works better(knowing *** youre talking about helps more)<br />
<br />
edit:lol my favorite acronym which includes the letters t f and w seems filtered! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Now I want to see a thread bitching about making a thread bitching about bitching...<br />
<br />
This one was pretty funny, but that one would be completely hysterical.</div></div><hr />
