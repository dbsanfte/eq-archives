I also am starting to raid ToV:HoT pretty consistently, have won a bracer so far, but haven't turned it in yet, only at warmly faction.  I have about 30k to spend.  Was thinking maybe a horse was worth it, as I solo a lot, but that's why I'm asking here =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fungi tunic all the way. Consider selling the eyepatch or even the lodizal shield for it. Fungi tunic is the single best thing you can wear until torpor at 60.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It would be a tough toss between a fungi and a horse in my opinion.  Personally I think the horse is infinately more valuable in outdoor group situations as you will have zero downtime but the fungi is definately the way to go if you fight indoors a lot or solo.<br />
I know that others will disagree with me saying that horses are not as good as a fungi solo but that's just my 2cp.  I don't like the lack of manuverability solo on a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sell the Tobrin's eyepatch in your quest to save for a fungi.  Replace it with Crystal Spider Eyes or Death Mask of the Elysians.<br />
<br />
If your guild is on dragon faction, get to ally (or the minimum required level) and get a Talisman of Benevolance for range.<br />
<br />
Ditch the RE bracer and go with one of the nice droppable bracers that are now available (there's a thread on this page talking about it)<br />
<br />
Start working on the earring of the solstice quest.  Shop around and buy the gifts as cheaply as possible, or offer to help master tradeskillers out with the grunt work (ie finding a cleric to imbue emeralds or making stacks of celestial essences) for free combines.<br />
<br />
Shadel Bandit Ring.<br />
<br />
If your guild is on dragon faction, put together some raids on that giant that drops the Orb of Infinite Void.<br />
<br />
Ditch the RE boots.  Barbed dragonscale or nice, or the dragon hide boots from WW.<br />
<br />
Ditch the RE helm.  Is the 5 int that important?  JB is very cheap.<br />
<br />
IGS or Strength of the Elements for shoulders.<br />
<br />
Legs are tough to upgrade, cross your fingers for SS legs, they're wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sell the lodi shield and get a hiero cloak.  You should be able to make a significant profit from that alone.<br />
<br />
I agree with getting the Obulus Death Shroud.  They're around 2-3k I think on my server.<br />
<br />
Hunt in Sebilis and pick up a Jaundiced Bone Helm.  They drop like candy in the jail area.  You could also get lucky and loot a Bone Mask of the Jarsath there to replace your eyepatch which you can sell for good cash.<br />
<br />
Then, yeah, why not get a fungi tunic?  You should be able to afford it easily by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since your on CoV faction i'd look into the circlet of the farlkin or what ever it's called. Should be pretty easy to get if your guild still does arena raids for faction or armor still.<br />
<br />
Also look into the talisman of benevolance for your range slot.<br />
<br />
For visible armor your goal is obviously going to be Skyshrine, or dorf. Fungi is a great bp tho before you hit 60 and get torpor.<br />
<br />
For an earring, the earing of the solstice can be bought in parts for about 10k on my server now and is a great earring that will last you a long time. Can cut a fair bit of cost off that too if you gather some components and pay for combines where possible.<br />
<br />
Another earring option is the sanctum guardians earring if you can stand getting the smithing skill.<br />
<br />
For face i'd sell the eye patch and get a mask of war or a crystal eyes mask or a death mask of the elysians.<br />
<br />
For a ring grab a shadel bandit ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Remoh Nospmis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the great responses so far =)<br />
<br />
I do have a couple things I missed in my original post.  <br />
<br />
1) My guild isn't really raid capable, I've been raiding with other guilds on my server<br />
<br />
2) Fungi's go for 50k on my server /cry<br />
<br />
3) obulous death shrouds go for 10k, not 2-3k on my server.<br />
<br />
heh, seems like everyone on my server has tons of cash but me, so anything not &quot;uber&quot; sells for little to nothing, but anything neat at all gets jacked way up /sigh.<br />
<br />
