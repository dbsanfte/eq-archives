<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Extra: This thread is not about the may 8th patch, those with posts regarding that, please post elsewhere. i want to get opinions and ideas from the glade about how WP can be brought up to par, and whether or not i'm overstating my case on the stats (don't think i am, but..) so let's get to it.<br />
<br />
clerics:<br />
hero + marzin + bulwark: 1125hp + 56ac<br />
ST aego: 1100hp + 54ac<br />
Grp Aego: 1150 + 60ac<br />
<br />
enchanters:<br />
c2 + enlightenment + GoB: 13mana per tic + 21wis + 21int + 150 mana<br />
KEI (grp): 14mpt + 25wis + 25int + 250mana <br />
<br />
rangers:<br />
SoN + CoE + CoP + Spikes: 65atk 25ac 75hp 21ds<br />
WP (self): 70atk 13ac 75hp 21ds<br />
(stats from lucy's)<br />
<br />
i forget who else has an aego-like spell.<br />
it's not bad.  the extra long duration is nice.  the overwrite issues suck balls.  but it really needs a little more oomph to be balanced. <br />
now i -know- we're only hybrids, and we're not meant to get the best spells, but if memory serves me at quarter to five on this fine thursday morning, rangers have had a new thing to be the best at: ATK buffs.  (we used to just have archery and tracking, and, to a point, aggro management.)  <br />
<br />
now Absor/Verant(if you feel the need to answer), does this still apply?  is there a reason this is self-only?  Aego and KEI are both HIGHLY useful in grouping and raiding situations, but this spell just has something about it... like it's just super mega hyper ultra firefist.  which is great! but with extremely limited usefulness.<br />
<br />
i have two possible visions for this spell.<br />
1. 90atk 20ac 150hp 21ds, self only.  <br />
i can see +-10, 10, 75, 5 point adjustments to the respective stats.  imo, a bit of an extra push, but nothing out of line.<br />
2. 70atk 25ac 100hp 6ds, single target, stacks with druid/mage damage shields.  <br />
rangers bow/fearkite, not so much toe-to-toe fighting, so the DS loss won't hurt soloability (although it will affect most any duoing you might do).  <br />
<br />
basically, #2 is a combo/upgrade for CoE/SoN/CoP, like the spell should have been all along. like the equivalent buffs of other classes.  i would much rather see this, as it would greatly increase my effectiveness in a raid or group situation.<br />
<br />
but if the good folks at Verant see fit that it should remain self only, #1 should convince rangers to never again use the old velious combo, just so they can swap SoN out for brell's.  and really, if our aego is self only, it should be so good we don't think of turning back, because self only is a huge limitation, and a new restriction on our atk buffs.<br />
<br />
but they should give #2 a fighting chance.  i'm more than content to have my unbuffed melee on par with warriors(and defense as is) if i know that they'll all need me to eke out that 7-10% more damage.  it leaves me knowing i'm desirable.  it leaves me knowing that we're doing something for which there is no substitution, like crack, or CH.<br />
<br />
heh. but not quite as potent.<br />

25 DS, 90 ATK, 125hp, 25AC, duration 2 hours.  Targetable.  <br />
<br />
Period.  <br />
<br />
without Brell's etc from overwriting it.  <br />
<br />
Then it would be where it belongs.</div></div><hr />

Just make it so that they stack like haste and slow spells do.<br />
Makeing it targetable would be nice, but iceing on the cake.<br />
<br />
Also, as a sidenote I find it kind of amuseing seeing all the flames from rangers not even level 60 yet. I mean you dont know the problems first hand how can you comment on them. You really need to try it out for a while before you can make up your mind about the usefullness or not of it and exactely how bad the stacking issues are. (the player made stacking issues largely rely on who you raid / group with)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelador</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got most of the paladins in my guild trained not to cast Brells on my group without at least warning me first... now if only I could teach the well-meaning mages not to cast Aegis of Ro too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, one thing that caught my eye at 5:30 in the morning is this line...<br />
<br />
&quot;rangers bow/fearkite, not so much toe-to-toe fighting, so the DS loss won't hurt soloability...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm guessing that you are not 60, and don't have this spell.  Further guessing that you don't spend a lot of time soloing, or talking to warders who do.  We almost *never* resort to bow-kiting, and WW is the only place I can think of to fear kite at 60, which isn't exactly an option for most rangers who are of a dragon killing bent.  Majority of our time soloing is spent toe-to-toe with a mob in FunGro or Seb or something, where every little bit of dmg shield is invaluable.  I would be *very* upset to see them lower the dmg shield portion of this spell.<br />
<br />
As for what I think should be done to improve it?  Well, for one thing, I'm not actually sure its in dire need of improving.  Perhaps add in a little more AC to it so that its equivelant of CoE, and maybe up the atk disparity between WP and the combo, but other than that I don't think it needs much tweaking.  <br />
<br />
I *would* like to see the stacking and overwrite issues resolved tho.  The shroud of hate issue in particular is very irritating.  In zones where I'm fighting sk mobs I don't even bother to keep this up cuz its just not worth 350 mana ever single fight that something casts that spell on me.  If you have shroud of hate cast on you while using the combo, you only lose CoP.  Using WP you lose the whole thing, which just sucks imo.  Other stacking issues would obviously be the dmg shield component.  Make it so no outside dmg shield will overwrite it.  Also make it so no other similar hp buff (read paladins) will overwrite it.<br />
<br />
Once they solve these minor issues tho, it will be a top notch spell imo.  I have been in love with this spell since I got it about 4 months ago, and even with yesterday's nerf, I still like it simply for the convenience of casting once every 2 hours or whatever, and for saving me a bunch of buff slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diegaron</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fix the stacking issues with lower level spells, Brells, DS, etc!  And, as a minor consideration, increase the AC slightly to match CoE.  That is ALL that needs to be done and this will be an AWESOME self-buff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Kishin's second suggestion.  Remove the extra DS component all together.  The cures many of the stacking issues right there.<br />
<br />
70atk 25ac 100hp 6ds, single target, stacks with druid/mage damage shields. <br />
<br />
If anything I'd advocate 5 more attack, and like 2 more AC.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if it was targetable on others as well, and would be in line with how the Paladin buffs are going.<br />
<br />
But paramount would be that this spell doesn't overwrite Brell line of spells, nor does Brell overwrite it, nor should they stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman get Focus of Spirits (combined STR AND DEX) - it is not canceled by other STR or DEX buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My suggestion.<br />
<br />
Part 1: Manditory<br />
Without this part being resolved, the Wader's Proction spell scroll best used to line bird cages (so don't scribe it to the book!) Anyway...<br />
1. Brell's and Divine anything should not be able to overright this buff.<br />
2. Mage and Druid damage shields should not be able to overright this buff.<br />
3. Resolve the issues with Shroud of Hate so that it stacks with Warder's Protection.<br />
<br />
Part 2: Optional<br />
Here's a &quot;dream&quot; version of the spell (ain't going to happen):<br />
1. Change the effect to: +70 ATK +25 AC +75 HP +21 DS<br />
2. Allow it to stack with Mage/Druid DS<br />
3. Make it so that Brells &amp; other Divine buffs from Paladins do not stack but do not cancel it either<br />
4. Make it a group buff<br />
5. Possibly increase the mana costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmodeous</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - I don't agree with the removal of the DS at all.<br />
<br />
I solo all the time...  as such, I love the extra DS.... it really does help me out by making the mob die a bit faster and limits my downtime to something I am willing to deal with.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can say is this:<br />
<br />
Make the spell special.  Make it a reward that I want to use.  Make it a spell rangers are waiting to get to mem and cast at 60.  Please fix the stacking issues.  If this spell is going to stay self-only, make it worth it.   It should not only be at least equal to our current stack of spells, but a bit better like the other classes &quot;all-in-one&quot; buffs.<br />
<br />
I don't want anything unbalancing...  I want class defining.  I want equal treatment for the achievement of reaching 60 and getting that spell.  I want it on par with the other classes.  No more,  no less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  You'd think with a name like &quot;Warders Protection&quot; you'd be able to cast it on others...  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's going to stack with Mage and Druid DS, you'd have to remove the extra 17 points of DS.<br />
<br />
If it's going to be a group buff, then it will have to have it's mana costs increased.<br />
<br />
With the mass group buff abilities that our class has available, I don't know if something like this should be made to be group based.  Though it WOULD make getting the mass group buff ability worth while, it would also I believe drastically change the level of this spell.  Right now our individual spells are &quot;kinda nice&quot;, and select people would take the spells in there individual forms.  Make this a group spell, would be a far greater increase than Aego to Group Aego ever was.<br />
<br />
Mana Costs:<br />
Cleric<br />
1st Setup - 420 + 575 + 350 = 1345<br />
2nd Setup - 750<br />
3rd Setup - 2000<br />
Ratio (Singlish to Group) = 1.49<br />
Ratio (Single to Group) = 2.66<br />
<br />
Enchanters<br />
1st Setup - 115 + 200 + 200 = 515<br />
2nd Setup - 900<br />
Ratio - 1.75 Increase in mana cost<br />
<br />
If Rangers were to get CoE, SoN, CoP all rolled up into one buff.  I'd say our mana cost ratio should be higher than Enchanters.  I'd put it at a ratio of 2 for a single targetable version, with a 50% credit to CoP since it's a group buff.  If it was made into a group buff, I'd put it at 3.<br />
<br />
Ranger<br />
1st Setup - 125 + 50 + 200<br />
Proposed Single WP - (75 Atk, 27 AC, 100 hp, 6 DS) - 500 - 550 Mana<br />
Group WP - 750 - 825 Mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel that removing the DS component, would actually be beneficial.  It will NEVER be able to stack with Mage or Druid DS spells if it has the added DS component.  So by removing it, we'd be able to have greater DS setups in group situations, but while soloing we'd have to live with using our individual DS.  Sure it would cost more mana in the long run, but we wouldn't be loosing any DS in the end.<br />
<br />
As long as it has the added DS component, it will have to not be able to stack with Mage or Druid DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I just realized something.  If WP was made into just a single targetable spell, the duration of it, isn't as signicantly greater than all the individual components.  CoE, SoN, and CoP all last pretty long.  With that in mind, it shouldn't cost 2, but perhaps down by 1.5<br />
<br />
So then I'd say:<br />
Proposed Single WP - (75 Atk, 27 AC, 100 hp, 6 DS) - 400</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exedeus</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm all for removing the DS component to the spell and make it targetable/DS stackable. If you are so worried about losing the DS component to it, Lord just cast your own DS!. Again make DS &quot;Stackable&quot;. <br />
WP=CoE+SoN+CoP (20ac+100hp+70attack)<br />
Brells NON stackable (wont hold)<br />
DS stackable <br />
<br />
The issue here is that Brells and SoN clash.. Verant seemed to design it to be similiar lines of spells, one giving you more benefit than the other. <br />
Brells= 200 hp<br />
SoN = 100 hp + 25attack. <br />
<br />
But you CANT have both according to VI. Brells and SoN never have stacked before.. and now that it is included in WP, its why Brells overwrites the whole spell. <br />
Making WP targetable/grp, now you will have allot of Pally's saying Brells will be useless since it &quot;wont hold&quot;. ANd allot of Tankage wanting the HP over the WP and making you CoP/CoE them instead, thus WP goes back to the drawing board. <br />
<br />
So now lets throw this in the soup.. How about REMOVING the HP factor of this spell? So that Brells would stack? And leaving the DS component to it, BUT make it so that Mages/Druids will not hold their DS on you, but will stack with Bard songs DS, etc.<br />
WP= 60attack+25ac+DS<br />
Brells (maybe even SoN) Stackable, <br />
DS non stackable. (wont hold)<br />
<br />
In this combo, the Main Tank / Secondary Tank in a raid might not want it cause he just might want the DS ( again making you CoE/CoP him) but hey .. that would be just 1-2 people aside the rest of your raid grp, making the spell worthwhile.<br />
WP would be a grp spell, make it a manahog for obvious reasons, and with Brells/Maybe SoN stacking, it wouldnt lose much taste<br />
<br />
<br />
just my ideas )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alexzander</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Removing the DS componet of this spell is shear lunacy. Besides the small attack increase you get from it, and I suppose less buff slots, not having to DS between pulls makes this a powerful spell.<br />
<br />
Sheild of Spikes lasts 6 mins and costs 100 mana. Over an hour, that is 1000 mana alone saved on damage sheilds, which is rather stagering. Granted this is more of a small group/soloing thing, but on raids its useful for the buff slot savings (or would be if it wasn't for stacking issues).<br />
<br />
Relv posted an interesting possible work around in verants spell coding structure that would allow the spell to keep all its atributes and not be overwritten by everything. I wonder if it would work.<br />
<br />
One of the entire porposes of this spell is to reduce down time while soloing, please don't lead a crusade to take that away from us.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't be unbalancing, we'd still get to use a buff we cast on EVERYONE else (another 60 buff, too, go figure) and it would probably make everyone happy. <br />
<br />
If they drop the DS component (or lower it significantly) it's going to end up on the very last page of my spell book where I'll never look at it again.</div></div><hr />

Anyway he said to bug it and email verant about it and I did.<br />
<br />
Something needs to be done. As it stands right now, if someone damage shields me during a fight (he was a nice druid and well meaning)  I loose 70 attack, 75 HP, etc etc<br />
So much for this buff lasting longer and helping me out.<br />
<br />
I agree WP should be upgraded slightly if it won't stack with COP (I always thought this was balanced by the fact that I have one less buff slot to use on raids, which can get tricky at times with bards, necro's etc in your group).<br />
<br />
Verant needs to pay attention period. If it makes folks feel better alot of classes got nailed with the nerf stick and spells yesterday.<br />
<br />
I also heard a disturbing rumor from a Rogue about Aura of battle items either not stacking or being cancelled by our attack buffs??? Anyone know anything about this? Or is BS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
     The one thing that would make this spell perfect is too increase the AC to the level of COE. That one change alone would make this spell alot better. . With WP I could maybe even keep a DD memmed or Call of fire.. '</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danlby</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I happened to be the developer of high level spells, I would put an effective &quot;curse&quot; on spells acquired from 50-60, and then I would implement uncursed spells that were level 60 only and required some effort to obtain (including being no drop probably). For example, I would keep WP self only, and my changes would be:<br />
<br />
(a) HP: allow WP to stack with the paladin HP spell line. I honestly think this was the intended stacking scheme (anyone have insider info?). I believe WP has a HP conflict to prevent stacking with SoN, but the only conflict there should be attack. Unfortunately, VI doesn't have  75 hit points extra shouldn't be a reason to prevent this from stacking with Brell's, etc.<br />
(b) DS: increase the DS beyond the capabilities of mages (but not allow them to stack of course). Mage + 1 is all that is needed to prevent overwrite.<br />
(c) AC: increase to 26.<br />
(d) Attack: decrease attack to 50. Stacks with SoN because of HP stacking change.<br />
<br />
Essentially, I'd make WP into a DS+CotP+CoE Aego.<br />
<br />
I think such changes solve:<br />
(a) Stacking issues. Would there be any left?<br />
(b) Lack of hit points for rangers - earn 60 and you earn a step towards your own fix.<br />
(c) Provides some incentive to have rangers tank during raids, since rangers will be capable of the highest damage shield. However, if this change tipped the scales too much, WP could give &quot;best mage DS + 1.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: would it be unbalancing?<br />
The HP and DS could be too much in some eyes. 75 extra HP is equivalent to having one extra fairly good HP item. An extra 15-20 damage shield might be excessive, any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

If Warder's was a targetable non-group spell, that wouldn't be an issue. I'm already clicking off Brells to cast my buff on me. Rogues of my guild do the same as they would rather thave Strength of Nature.<br />

<br />
The problem with this theory is this..<br />
<br />
Buff Package #1:<br />
Call of Predator: 200 Mana w/ 1 hour 15 minute duration<br />
Strength of Nature: 125 Mana w/ 1 hour duration<br />
Call of Earth: 50 Mana w/ 1 hour duration<br />
Mana per hour: 375<br />
<br />
Buff Package #2 (aka I got a Velious tunic)<br />
Call of Predator: 200 Mana w/ 1 hour 15 minute duration<br />
Strength of Nature: 125 Mana w/ 1 hour duration<br />
Call of Earth: 0 Mana (use tunic) w/ 1 hour duration<br />
Mana per hour: 325<br />
<br />
Buff Package #3: Warder's<br />
Warder's Protection: 350 mana w/ 2.5 hour duration<br />
Nature's Precision: 50 mana w/ 30 minute duration<br />
Force of Nature: 100 mana w/ 19 minute duration<br />
Estimated Mana per hour: 540<br />
<br />
<br />
What this gets down to for a ranger like myself that does not like to solo...<br />
<br />
If I am tanking, the higher AC of the COP, SON, COE combo is going to be better for the group plus I'll be able to use a stronger damage shield if a mage/druid is present. If no mage/druid is present, then package #2 still makes more sense (especially if there is no shaman either) as maintaining Chloroplast on multiple people will be easier.<br />
<br />
If I am not tanking but am pulling, the Warder's, NP &amp; FON combo becomes a time waster due to having to stop and rebuff more often due to the short durations of two of the spells.<br />
<br />
If a paladin is in the group, I only have to redo 1 buff every time I get Brelled and not 2. Warder's will only stack with FON if it is casted first, so you have to kill off FON &amp; Brell then recast Wader's and finally FON. (Hey, can we say that Wader's and Force of Nature stacking if cast in a paticular order is an exploit or is it a bug that casting order matters?)<br />
<br />
<br />
About the only time the Warder's, NP &amp; FON combo makes sense for me in a group situation is if:<br />
1. Someone else is tanking so I don't need the extra AC<br />
2. Someone else is pulling so I don't cause downtime from extra buffing<br />
3. There is no Druid or Mage in the group tossing damage shields about (or at least not doing group damage shields)<br />
3. I have KEI so that wasting mana isn't an issue<br />
<br />
Sorry, that is just too many conditions for this spell to really be worthwhile.<br />
<br />

Mana cost were based off those posted on the Lucy site (http://lucy.fnord.net) so hybrid mana usage penalities were not factored in if applicable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaynia</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DS component of the spell is also the reason why you probably won't see WP ever become targetable. A two and a half hour long targetable DS being given to rangers? Not likely. Druids and mages would complain, and rightfully so since they already have problems filling roles in raids.<br />
<br />
I can almost see the reasoning behind taking the DS component out of the spell as a quick-fix to eliminate stacking problems with mage/druid damage shields. The problem I have with it is that it was just yesterday that a good number of the posters on this board were wailing over being &quot;nerfed&quot; because Verant fixed an exploit. Now we're *asking* to be &quot;nerfed&quot; again? Huh? /bonk<br />
<br />
The only way that removing the DS from WP would be acceptable would be if they gave us an additional spell that makes up for it. They could make a new spell that gives a 2 and a half hour self-only 21 point DS. Reduce the mana cost of WP by X mana then make this new spell cost X mana. Then make WP targetable but keep the new spell self-only so we won't be encroaching on mages and druids. Heck, if they wanted to increase the AC on WP to match CoE, that'd be fine too. Yes, I've read everyone who says that the extra AC doesn't matter because of soft caps. But if it truly doesn't matter, then it wouldn't be unbalancing to do it either. In other words, there's no reason not to. The benefit to doing this would be to give some extra AC to people below their cap (or at the very least to silence people concerned about it). There is no downside that I can see to adding extra AC.<br />
<br />
This would also lessen the mana penalty we experience when stuff gets overwritten, although the stacking problems are going to be fixed eventually anyway. Even after the stacking gets fixed, this would still be a usefull change because it would make it reasonable to make WP a targetable buff.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, I don't think any of these changes are absolutely necessary. But please don't go asking for a nerf to make up for stacking problems that will be fixed in time anyway. At least ask for something more like what I just suggested. The only thing we lose from my suggestion is a buff slot. It's still probably worthwhile though.<br />
<br />
Edit: grammar, i should really proofread :P</div></div><hr />

I'm referring to spell casting costs for hybrids traditionally being higher, but didn't they remove that.<br />

My point being though is that if you find yourself not needing to cast the damage shield in the first place, the Warder's, NP, FON combo actually costs you more mana with minimal (if any) improvement. And more often than not, I find myself not needing to cast Shield of Spikes.</div></div><hr />

That's not what Lawrence Poe said, or what my testing found.  If a spell costs 300 mana, you truly pay 300 mana.  You can test this if you don't believe me, just be careful of what the person you are testing it against is specialized in.<br />
<br />
the Warder's, NP, FON combo actually costs you more mana with minimal (if any) improvement. <br />
<br />
20 more ATK, less buff slots, and less rebuffing is &quot;minimal&quot;?  You and appearently 75% of the rest of the glade went to the trouble of sploit stacking WP+COTP for 40 more ATK, paying a lot of mana in the process... if you went to all that trouble and spent all that mana for 40 ATK, I'd think you would logically see the value in 20 more ATK.</div></div><hr />

Come on, it is our level 60 Luclin spell.  The way it is now, I still have to keep COTP/COE/SON memmed to cast on everyone else on the raid/group.  Are Aego and KEI self-only?  No.  If this is going to remain self-only, then it was not intended to be a aego-like combo buff that replaces some of our lesser buffs and we need to stop thinking of it as such.  Like someone said, this should be a spell we don't have to hesitate to use because some aspects of it aren't as good as our lesser spell combos... it should just be a given that we use it in place of those combos at all times, just like aego, KEI, etc.<br />
<br />
2) Other people's buffs should NOT overwrite any buffs that I currently have up.  Can anyone give me a compelling reason why this should remain the case?  This was a holdover back from when you couldn't click off certain buffs.  Under no circumstances should someone else be able to remove one of my buffs by overwriting or otherwise!  That is a borderline exploit.<br />
<br />
If I want their better buff that isn't stacking with what I have on, then it needs to be MY CHOICE to click the interfering buff off first.  Push for this, as this will solve all annoying spell overwriting issues in the entire game, not just with WP.  If you want Brells, you click WP off first.  Simple.  No more annoying overwriting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valphoo</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a few thoughts...<br />
1) this SHOULD NOT BE TARGETABLE!!! this spell is in the same vain as the shaman/robe/cleric class of PERSONAL ONLY BUFFS!!!  Furthermore, IF this spell were made targetable class balance issues would need to be taken STRONGLY into consideration.<br />
<br />
2) The benefit of this spell should be saving buff spots with a longer lasting buff time. As the ranger pinnicle spell from luclin it should be sufficiently good that it is a buff ranges want to keep up all the time without fail. so how should it work?<br />
<br />
spdat should give 100 attack 75hp 10ac 24 damage shield <br />
1 hour duration and 300 mana <br />
<br />
this gives us what we want.. attack and HP. Tha ac compoinent is just there so it won't stack with things like COE etc. The damage shield is as much a blessing as a curse. The HP now are exactly the same as they were. The attack is now basically SON+COP and the ac from before turned into attack. Look I am a ranger I could give two cents about ac cause thanks to my skill caps I will never tank for sheeeeet.  This spell gives the attack boost which is on par with avatar and gives us the damage boost we need to be competative with other classes.<br />
<br />
oh a side note: there is not hybrid mana/casting penatly. The only hybrid casting penalty is that you fizzle like mofaka on high end spells when compared to pure casters. This fizzle rate could be thought of as a mana penalty but really it isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khelzor</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like the idea of removing the DS, increasing the AC and making it a Group buff. Make it so that it neither overwrites/or is overwritten by brells. Then add a DS self only spell that does not stack with Mage/druid ds.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be ideal I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yendor</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here, I just posted this to Developer's Corner:<br />
<br />
This idea grew out of a discussion on the Ranger's Glade with our disappointment with all of the overwriting issues involved with our level 60 Luclin spell, Warder's Protection.  It uses a lot of mana for minimal improvements over a spell combo we had pre-Luclin, and is completely overwritten by some group buffs like Paladins' Brells Mountainous Barrier and the big Mage group damage shield (I don't recall the exact name),  forcing us to re-spend all that mana to recast WP on ourselves.  We aren't the only class with that problem, however.  For example, the cleric spell Blessed Armor of the Risen apparently has some overwriting issues as well.<br />
<br />
Why do buffs other people cast on me overwrite buffs I already have up in the first place?  As far as I can tell, this &quot;feature&quot; is a holdover back from the time when you couldn't always click beneficial buffs off.  But now you can.  Other people being able to overwrite my buffs is a borderline exploit.  Example:  Why should a paladin, in a non-PVP setting, be able to LOWER the ATK of a ranger (thus reducing the ranger's damage output) by casting Brell's Mountainous Barrier on the ranger and overwriting Warder's Protection?  What compelling reason is there for beneficial buffs to overwrite something I already have up?<br />
<br />
I propose that it should be MY choice to click off the interfering buff if I want someone else's buff that may not stack with what I have on for whatever reason.  Control of what buffs I have on is MINE and MINE alone.  If someone casts a buff on me that is better in some aspect than what I already have on, it should not take hold.  It should be my responsibility to click off the interfering buff if I want what that other person is trying to buff me with.<br />
<br />
If I have Warder's Protection up for the ATK boost and for some silly reason, as a ranger, I want to give up the ATK for extra HP of Brell's... then I should have to voluntarily click WP off to accept Brell's, not involuntarily get a buff overwritten without any control over it, and then have to expend even more mana to recast it.<br />
<br />
Advantages:  This would solve ALL annoying spell overwriting issues in the game.  People with group buffs that have stacking issues won't feel like their spells are useless because only a certain subset of people actually want them.  People needing certain buffs won't have to complain anymore when they get their buffs overwritten.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:  People might actually need to learn more about spells so they know which one they need to click off in order to accept a certain buff that otherwise won't take hold on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikito</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thorn Coat, it stacks with the clerics aegis spell or bulwark of fait which ever one gives just raw AC. So from this i can see that its not unheard of that a self only spell stack with other spells that do nearly the samething. So instead of you all trying to figure out what to do this is what &quot;needs&quot; to be done. Forget the part about taking away the dmg sheild or HP or adding more to it or what not. VI if your reading this my point of view is from the very high end game. Just make it so Warders Protection stacks with Call of Earth, and Call of the Pred without any problems. Problems meaning the special order i would have to cast buffs and at the right time to get CoE and Wp and Pred to stack.  Meaning i can just go off and cast CoE, Pred, and WP in any order when every i want and they will stack. So what if Brell's doesn't stack with it. thats the group lvl 60 paladin HP buff VI. i'll just click Brell's off and recast warder's protection. It won't be any big deal because i won't have to take off any of my other buffs to set them up in the right order again to get them WP, CoE, and Pred to stack. And its a self only spell so big whoop about what it gives me. This is the only thing that needs to be done to Warders Protection. People post what you think about this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what do we lose by removing 17 points of damage shield?(assume you aren't casting spikes to replace it.)  soloing 244 small mushrooms in FG, the extra 17 DS works out to just over 3.6% of total damage.  Am I willing to give up 3-4% of my solo damage (shrooms will take 4-6 seconds more to kill) to have stacking issues fixed?  you bet.<br />
<br />
<br />
the broader picture of why WP needs attention..<br />
<br />
every other aegolism-type spell is as good or better than the sum of its parts.  WP is not, it is actually less than the sum of its parts.<br />
<br />
every other aegolism-type spell is targettable.  WP is not.  Self-only buffs typically are better in some respect than targettable buffs.  WP has a long duration and offers a significant mana saving over time.  However, if you remove Shield of Spikes from the mix, this mana saving decreases significantly.  It should stay self only, but be at least equal to the combination of buffs it replaces.<br />
<br />
one of WP's components is our lvl 51 buff, SoN (75hp 34atk).  The only hp buff SoN does not stack with is Paladin's Divine series.  This series increases from 100hp at 55 to 200 at 60, and 225 (125% increase over 5 levels) for the group variety.  WP offers no hp advantage over the level 51 spell it replaces.  No other class has stacking conflicts with the Divine series, so Rangers are the only class facing a tradeoff between 150 more hp from BMB or the extra stats of WP.  Should rangers face a trade off, or should they get those 150hp like everyone else?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
proposed change:<br />
DS to 5   removes stacking issues with mage/druid DS<br />
AC to 26  make sure it overwrites CoE<br />
ATK to 80<br />
HP to 226   make sure BMB doesn't overwrite it<br />
     or, 150hp and hard code it so Divine series doesn't overwrite.<br />
     or, 75hp and allow it to stack with Divine series.<br />
<br />
keep it self only, adjust mana cost as appropriate, and keep 2.5 hour duration.  Prevent SK atk debuffs from overwriting it.</div></div><hr />

You and appearently 75% of the rest of the glade went to the trouble of sploit stacking WP+COTP for 40 more ATK, paying a lot of mana in the process... if you went to all that trouble and spent all that mana for 40 ATK, I'd think you would logically see the value in 20 more ATK. <br />
<br />
Nope - waste of time really. The times I did try to do Warder's / NP / FON - a nice pally made sure to fix that. So it was costing me time and mana constantly having to redo both Warder's and FON as you can only cast FON after. What's really annoying is when the paladin in the group decides to be a blank blank and delibrately Brells you after he sees you rebuff yourself... had this happen a few times to the point that all you can do is use buffs they can't cancel or leave.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't happen, an SK mob is nice enough to send WP away. When you get hit be the SK debuff, it lasts long enough that you're going to be out Warder's for several fights. If the next fight has another SK mob, well you see where I am going here.. and endless chain of wanting to rebuff Warder's but not being able to unless you are willing to sit around (down time) and wait for the debuff to go away. Even then, you'll find Warder's gone the next fight anyway. To even think that you can maintain Warder's around these mobs is delusional, especially when you're tanking them. Even if I'm not tanking, there still is a good chance that they find some way to debuff me.<br />
<br />
Plus I just don't care for the buff paranoia that goes with Warder's of constantly having to check to see if some paladin, shadow knight, mage or druid sent it away or having to worry that it will constantly be sent away.<br />
<br />
<br />
In these cases, it makes sense to use an alternate combo when you have mana to burn of Call of Predator, Strenght of Nature and Force of Nature for +80 ATK. (Cannot remember if NP stacks here.) Besides have less of a buff paranoia factor, it also has the side benefit that I can use myself as a buff timer for SON and FON.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the theory that I'm benefitting by not having to cast Shield of Spikes on myself at the cost of 100 mana for 6 minutes (that 600 mana per hour) - I'd like to know why I would even be casting Shield of Spikes on myself in the first place around... oh say flurry drakes.</div></div><hr />

You would end up with a 50 plus DS and thats overkill. <br />
<br />
Either take the DS off and add us another higher level druid type DS spell, or leave it on and take the fact that the druids n mages DS's dont stack, but to have it stack with others is abit extreme.<br />

<br />
Erm 1000mana saved per hour is no indication of it's solo application? My largest 2 places my mana went was ds and chloro, that eliminates one.<br />
<br />
Buff Package #3: Warder's <br />
Warder's Protection: 350 mana w/ 2.5 hour duration <br />
Nature's Precision: 50 mana w/ 30 minute duration <br />

The flaw in this arguement, is noone is making you spend the extra mana of NP and FoN. Comparing son/coe/cop/ds to warders makes it a no contest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chade</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when the Monk epic came out, the right click effect did not stack with Haste spells.  It was changed so that, the other components of the spell would stack with haste spells, but the monk would still get the ATK, STR, and AC that his epic effect would also give him.  Thereby having the best of both buffs, the faster haste from the enchanter buff, and the added benefits of his epic. <br />
<br />
What I'm curious about is if this could be implemented for other such buffs.  &quot;Force of Nature&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot; no longer stack, due to the ATK component on both spells.  What I would like to know is if it is possible for one to have &quot;Force of Nature,&quot; and then &quot;Avatar&quot; cast upon them (via a primal weapon or spell) which would then take the greater ATK of the &quot;Avatar&quot; spell, yet the benefits of &quot;Force of Nature&quot; would remain (3pnts of regeneration, and 3pnt damage shield).  I believe if a change like this could be implemented it would make many other issues disappear as well.<br />
<br />
Another example would be &quot;Warder's Protection&quot;.  It is over-ridden easily by damage shields and &quot;Brells Mountainous Barrier&quot;.  If a system were in place to take the &quot;better&quot; of each component of each spell.  Then the spells would be able to &quot;stack&quot; with &quot;Warder's Protection&quot;, as they will only override specific components of the first spell not the entire spell.  &quot;Warder's Protection&quot; has 4 components, 75hp, 21pnt DS, 70atk, 13ac.  &quot;Brells Mountainous Barrier&quot; has 1 component, 225hp.  In my example, the 2 buffs would stack.  A player would have &quot;Brells Mountainous Barrier&quot; in one buff slot, and &quot;Warder's Protection&quot; in another.  Combined they would grant the best of both, 225hp, 21pnt DS, 70atk, 13ac, but not additive (i.e. not 300hp).  Damage shields would work in the same fashion.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how simple a change like this would be to implement.  However I believe that if the system is already in place to handle the Monk Epic and Haste, why can this not be implemented for other such troublesome buffs.<br />

You posted that you don't like to solo.  Fine, but many of us do.  I have a job, a wife etc and many times my EQ time is restricted to odd hours and only an hour or so of play.  If I couldn't solo I would dtill be level 51.  So, as much as I hate to disagree with you, many of us value a long term DS so we don't have to constantly use the mana for a DS.<br />
<br />
I would also urge many of you to not use the Aeo/KEI arguement.  We will never make a good point trying to compare our spell casting power to pure casters and trying to justify our spells that way.  Get rid of the stacking issues!! Anything else is grave and I will say &quot;thank you very much&quot;.<br />

SoN and Divine/Brell's would stack. Perhaps mages and druids would complain, but it's not a competitive DS buff as long as it's self-only. Am I crazy?<br />

No, it would make it into a buff slot saver, with nothing to defferentiate it from our existing spell line.<br />
<br />
Seriously, noone is making you use Warders, if you like Son +Coe + Cop + ds better, just use that. Removing the DS from warders would be simply a nerf, and a lazy one at that. Make no mistake, they will fix the stacking of this spell eventualy, there is no need to nerf it down to near uselessness so it will work in the mean time.<br />
<br />
It seriously baffles me that people see removing the DS from warders as a good thing. I simply do not understand your reasoning at all, nor your approach to fixing it. Again, if you dislike this spell,<br />

Also, I wouldn't have to rebuff 3 spells, I'd only have to do one casting, saving rebuff time.<br />

Your inability to see why, is a failing in you, not us.</div></div><hr />

This spell is not like aego, it is self only. I has more in common with spells such as blessed armor of the risen. Your suggestion is similar to suggesting that the mana regen from blessed armor should be taken off so potg won't overwrite it.<br />

Again, noone is making you use it, if you preffer coe son cop, then use that instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajalon</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think making it 226 hp would be the solution.  That would just make brells (and Paladin buffing in the process) pointless and worthless.  Granted, I don't have the spell yet  (3 yellows!), but when I solo now, most of my mana is spent on shield of spikes and chloroplast.<br />
<br />
Here's how I would change the spell:<br />
<br />
75 hp (make this stack with brells, make it like the monk epic so you get the 225hp from brells instead of WP)<br />
90 attack (slightly better than CoP+SoN)<br />
30 ac (slightly better than CoE)<br />
4 DS (so it will stack with mage/druid)<br />
-- Targetable. (we are talking about an aego type spell -- an upgrade to it's component spells right?)<br />
<br />
Then give us a self-only, 2.5 hour 17 point damage shield.  That way if we have the self-DS up, and a mage/druid buffs, it goes away and doesn't stack, so no uber 52 point DS.<br />
<br />
WP would be better than the sum of it's parts, and we'd have a self-only upgrade to our current DS that wouldn't stack with mage/druid in a grouping situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would solve nothing, the level of the ds is not what causes the stacking problem, it is the number the atribute is in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be cool, if the DS was broken up so that 4 was allocated to be considered like CoE, and the other 17 would be considered to be normal DS.  then if we are hit with a DS, it just adds 4 to the greater DS.<br />
<br />
It'll be great when they get this spell sorted out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajalon</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually that's a good idea..   forget the 2nd self DS spell :)  AFK -- I need to get some caffeine and get the brain in gear :)<br />
<br />
Actually -- edit -- another reason for the separate damage shield was, if the spell was castable on others, I'm not so sure verant would like rangers able to cast a 2.5 hour damage shield on other people /shrug.  There's no easy answer I guess, I just wish I had a spell to look forward to that was better than the sum of what I'm casting now, and that I can cast on others too.<br />
<br />
Maybe simply add a second spell minus the DS that's castable on others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ellizzbeth</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The proposed DS increase, isn't that big of a deal, b/c (1) we're not main tanks generally, and if you're soloing, you won't have anyone to DS you, so I don't see how this would be unbalancing, in that if you want to utilize the higher DS, then u need the ranger to tank, and that has its drawbacks as well-- so changing this attribute might be interesting way to ameliorate things.<br />
<br />
Another thing VI could do is include in their patch message something about why ninja-buffing other classes might be really dumb, so instead of the rangers telling guildmates to calm down with their buffing (some take offense when I say no BMB for me), VI can help spread the message that casting every buff on everyone you see isn't a good thing necessarily.  They can speed up the learning curve by disseminating more info.  It's the pallies with DG who always seem to ninja buff me, as the 60 Knights are clued in.<br />
<br />
The mana cost is bit large, or they really should prevent SoH from overwriting this, and what other class has self buffs overwritten or not stackable with Avatar-- that really stinks.  It's not like primal are easy to get (ask any ranger without it), or they should give rangers a different type of primal weapon, as we have good attack #s, so maybe add 100 sta instead of 100 attack- so I can choose to have Fon up and use primal.  We only have so many buff slots anyway, and am always choosing buffs to sacrifice, given the situation.  But I'd prefer to have that choice, rather than default scenarios.  <br />
<br />
WP is a decent spell, but I think a designer (someone accountable and with authority-- otherwise this is a token gesture) needs to go play with a Warder and use this spell, and then maybe they'll come to grips with the issues surrounding this.  My guess is they play a level 11 halfling ranger (which is probably actually a level 11 gnome SK) over there, and are still trying to figure out what snare does. =/<br />

You posted that you don't like to solo.  Fine, but many of us do.  I have a job, a wife etc and many times my EQ time is restricted to odd hours and only an hour or so of play.  If I couldn't solo I would dtill be level 51.  So, as much as I hate to disagree with you, many of us value a long term DS so we don't have to constantly use the mana for a DS.<br />
<br />
I think you miss my point or perhaps you do get it but disagree...<br />
I don't think our ultimate Luclin spell should have been disigned with *ONLY* soloing in mind. It should be worthwhile to a ranger while he is soloing, in an exp group or raiding. To say that they spell should be left as is with no twinking because it is a great soloing spell... I do not agree with.<br />
<br />
I think the only reason why the soloers love this spell is because they do not come into contact with things that kill Warder's (or at least not regularly.)<br />
The bulk of my playing time is spent on raids thus I often find Warder's to be constantly Brelled to death. (Even with the stacking tricks, Wader's was outright useless due to the Brellings.) Which is quite ironic really - the spell tends drops from raid level mobs, yet is practically useless when raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing for anyone method of fix. Stuff like Brells &amp; other class non-L60 damage shields shouldn't be dispelling it. The L30 SK debuff is just added insult to injury.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually just making it so fricken Brells doesn't dispell it would increase Warder's usability by about 1000000000%. Hey, I can use it for a full 2.5 hours now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly Crydee.<br />

There isn't really a spell in the entire game that was designed FOR soloing.  Just that WP is only useful when soloing, since all of the stacking issues.<br />
<br />
This should change.  WP should become both more stack friendly, but also should watch out from becoming overly powerful.<br />
<br />
The ways WP would become more useful.<br />
<br />
1. Castable onto others. - With this, Verant won't be able to justify allowing a DS to last 2.5 hours.<br />
<br />
2. Better stacking abilities - We do WANT to be able to get more DS while using this spell.  Unless they're able to the whole monk epic spell stack thing, then the DS component has to leave.<br />
<br />
In the end, yes it wouldn't be the great soloing spell that it use to be, but it would still be more effective to use than using all the individual spells.  (In the given situation where the DS component is knocked down to be equal to 4)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1/. Warder's Option 1:   70atk 25ac 75hp 21ds<br />
I believe it should be targettable or a group buff. But I would be happy if they just provided at least CoE AC and made it so that all Self-Buffs are impossible to overwrite.<br />
<br />
2/. Warder's Option 2:   90atk 25ac 100hp 21ds FT3 (ie. 3-point mana-regen) Self-Only<br />

I GAIN ATK from useing this buff, I GAIN DS from useing this buff, yes I lose a little AC but its more than worth it.<br />
This is a buff to use whether you solo or raid, its awesome in both places.<br />
<br />
From what I can hear most of the ppl complaing about this has been useing alot of stacking exploits and then yes you might get lower numbers but for the rangers that havent this is actually an upgrade. (stacking FoN with Avatar before ect.)<br />
<br />
If VI only fixed the ATK debuff overwriteing it I would be more than happy.</div></div><hr />
