<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was thinking of moving my duo to PoS to kill some froggies for exp (the ones behind the forest giant fort). Anybody have exp fighting these? I was hoping that the shammy slow/heal, SK tank method could keep up with the froggy damage. SK has decent gear 1550 AC/4500HPS with just shammy buffs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice regarding this camp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The frogs here hit too hard for you to keep up with healing at this point.. it might be possible at 65 with Q, but it would be very hard/irritating to tank these before then, which is why most of the people hunting these grounds root rot, kite, or charm them.. (druids, necros are the ones usually camping this area on my server)<br />
<br />
It's been a while since I've been there but I seem to recall the frogs hitting for 400ish? maybe a lower or higher.. they can take a person down quick. They also have a decent chunk of HP, and relying on a SK for damage (plus dogdog) you're looking at slow xp / time return.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Krakur.  It is doable but not efficient.<br />
I'd recommend doing the PoN Hedge event duo (don't start Elder moving once you get inside - just kill the static spawns in the maze) or the Innovation Factory (Tins &amp; Golems) until you get your shaman to 65.<br />
Much easier pulls, no worries about adds, and exp for the most part is better then the rest of the zone.<br />
<br />
You might be able to try the planarian larvae in Valor.  I think they are just a step down from PoS frogs in terms of difficulty from what I recall.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
A 62 shaman doesn't have the tools to root/rot &quot;FAST&quot;, even with VP.  The only safe DoT for rotting without breaking root would be Anathema.  VP doesn't root a mob any quickier, in fact Greater Immobilize casts a quarter second faster w/ an inherent -30 resist adjust.  <br />
<br />
Root/rotting doesn't lend itself to fast kills unless you are boxing a necro.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
