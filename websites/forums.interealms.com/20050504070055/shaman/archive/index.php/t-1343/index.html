<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK ... there appears to be a set of spells on Test called &quot;Prayer&quot; with questionable effect's but somehow tied to the your God and a TP'ing their temple.<br />
<br />
Suggestion ... use this &quot;Prayer&quot; combined with a Rez type effect to create something loosely called &quot;Penance&quot; as a new  spell/effect.    Say you die off in some God forsaken place such as VP.   If you could get back to your corpse (don't scream DAoC at me - /wink) ... doing Penance to get a (say 10%) rezz'd/TP back to the temple of worship.   The effects could really harsh with maybe a super long timer on rez effects.   Say like a hour of game time.   Or you have to clean your God's toilet with a toothbrush before returning to the game ... ;)<br />
<br />
This could even be based off a Quest to be able to use it at all.   Make the quest tiggerable by ONLY your home Trainer and you have to return to complete another quest to use it again.    Add enough steps into gaining/recovering it's use that it can't be exploit ... but still usable.    Plus adding a reason to return to your HOME trainers for something ... since trainers are almost useless by your fifty's.<br />
<br />
The goal is not to replace anything that a Pally or Cleric can currently do ... just allow a player to get to a safe spot.   I would see this very useful for the tired Raider that only wants to recover their body and camp/go AFK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol  them idiots at verant will be stumped on vahsir then&gt;<br />
<br />
all them cats are agnostic- verant were too stupid to bother giving the cat folk a decent god!<br />
<br />
i think verant have totally failed to spice up the religion side of norrath, however i understand that many folk these days are agnostic in RL and find religious ideas too scary to grapple with.<br />
<br />
whys the world becoming so full of blondes?<br />
<br />
maybe verant needs to reread some decent roleplay systems  aka Harn  and Runequest to pirate a few good religion ideas !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Religion restricted spells please. Nothing groundshaking and nothing to compensate for the &quot;flaws&quot; of a certain race, but more of a fun, but still useful tool for the roleplaying shaman. The imbue amber/ivory/whatnot spells were nice, but just came in handy for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />
