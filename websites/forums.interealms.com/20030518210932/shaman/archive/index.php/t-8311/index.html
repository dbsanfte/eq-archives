<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible for a 56 Shaman to solo dragons in WW? Wanting to get there and try it out. Have Epic, JBB and fungi tunic. I know tough part will be getting through SG if i can't find a succor.</div></div><hr />

As for getting through SG, be buffed, be confident of the route, be fast. I've run it with my 55 cleric and survived, if you're quick and lucky you can avoid aggroing the seahorses altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Three friends and I took out Yeldema for the first time last night - 56Pally, 55Druid, 53chanter, 55Shaman. She was cake - we were very nervous because we had never tried a WW dragon before, and we had all sorts of complex strategies and plans, but she was toasted so fast that it was almost an anticlimax considering our nervousness. <br />
<br />
Malosi stuck first cast! Slow stuck 2nd cast, she never resisted and e-bolt. Druid level55 heals were fine for healing pally - didn't need LoH.<br />
<br />
It was good fun, even tho the rewards were minimal (lucky chanter now has level 55 spell banked), but sometimes it is good fun just to try something that you haven't really got any safety net and little knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Njaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No offense, but ignore Seredith's comments regardin getting through SG.  Go to the corner when you first zone in, force yourself into the wall/corner, sit and camp.  As a barbarian, I usually have to shrink or bear form the first time.  Get as close to the wall as you can, sit, and camp.  Log back in and you *should* be in the wall if this tactic worked.  Sit and camp again, log back in ... after the third time, you'll be next to the zone to WW (this is called the poor man's succor).  Not sure if this is an exploit or not, but the trick works just as well in LK in Velk's.  Trust me on this ... I've done it a few times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragnhild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ghetto succoring is considered a sploit, if you do it just hope there isn't a GM watching you.  I wouldnt' be to worried though, don't think I've seen a GM in eons.  That being said, SG is easy to run across.  Wish you luck in your attempt.<br />
