<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to pl up my cleric who is now 28. To help Out I'm douing him with my 36 sk. For now since I only have 1 comp I'm running the sk like as af hes solo for pl purposes and the cleric is just leaching. Dungeons kinda suck for this due to the pain in the butt of trying to move 3 toons on the same computer. Are there any decent pl spots outdoors (or even indoors where I can set up and not move) with easy pulls of only 2-3 mobs besides the lizards outside ct? xp is slowing down and want to know where to head to next. <br />
Would dl be a good spot? I've done dsp before and find that I get tons of adds and they got insane hps for the level. Not to mention crazy lag from moon zones. Would I be able to handle pulling the zone at Com?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The SK should be able to solo the giants in FM and give the cleric decent xp that way.<br />
<br />
There are also a few spots in OT that you can do this way but xp will be slow PL'ing this way no matter where you go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might try crystal caverns. You can set up at bottom orcs, be very good xp for both of them and not too tough. I soloed my monk there from 30-42 in about a week and a half, of course my bind wound went straight to 199 in no time ;). Decent money to make there too, or start smithing with all the velium you'll get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">try paw.. your SK will rip thru those mobs and would be pretty darn good xp for the clr.<br />
<br />
Also could try sola or solb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The gnoll spires in SK is VERY good experience, I personally believe they increased it there.<br />
  And you can easily single pull them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kaesora is very nice xp and if you time the mob pops you can sit in one place, good to around 35 (can bind melee outside now).  After Kaesora I always did CoM, where again, there are plenty of places to sit and pull to, can go all the way to low 50s there with decent xps (can bind melee inside).  Both places are fairly quiet meaning no interruptions from other groups or trains, etc.</div></div><hr />

There is no better place in the entire game, from 30 to 43 it's all good.<br />
<br />
Tons of little guys with like 1k hit points tops, who only hit in the 70s and give 2-3% exp per kill. I powerleveled my beastlord there and I think the fastest level I got was from 39 to 40 in about 50 minutes. It's just that insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xmortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just Spent the last month PLing my shaman up.<br />
<br />
From late 20's till early to mid 40's Kaesora is butter.<br />
<br />
Then move to the Hole.</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine just recently switched servers to join me and 2 other RL friends, he did 1-51 in a week. 1-10 newbie area, 10-23 PC, 23-33 hhk, then ldon till 51. With very minor twinking (like 3k tops, he ended up making about 8k over the span of the week. As a rogue tho, he is always in high demand for LDoN, you could do the same with the cleric tho. IMO, just snag a bard partner and trio the 3, cleric, sk, bard = great combo till low 50's. If your only after PLing, go group with the cleric somewhere till hes 34 then continue to group with the SK.</div></div><hr />

Will report back for anyone who's interested as to how good the xp is here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I went the other day on a wednesday at 3pm, and it was packed. Let us know how it goes tho, I may start takinfg my alts there from now on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree with this. I 2-boxed a Pally and Enchanter combo from 30 - 42 in Kaesora. I was getting about a level every 3 - 4 hours depending on adds and any deaths. I would start around the library and around 38 - 39 head to xalgoz's lair. The cleric will be able to single pull in this area with lull and you can duo Xalgoz easily (he is level 40). If i can duo him with a pally and chanter I bet it is even easier with a healer and tank.<br />
<br />
Kaesora is very high on the xp mod zone list and you can see xp fly in here. I love it because it is quiet and cash is pretty good (about 6p per mob). Your cleric will rock in this zone because there are only a few spots with live mobs. You can ITU right down to Xal's lair without much problem (lull past spiders).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For that level range, I like HHK or, oddly enough, OT. Depending on your SK's level of twinkage, the High side of Echo Caverns would be really good too (and it's one of the more lag-free Luclin zones). You would probably need the entire high side to yourself to make it worth it though.<br />
<br />
CoM is good, but it doesn't start shining till the low to mid 40's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im confused, you say you disagree, then it looks like you agree, not sure what you disagree about unless you are saying to stay there later than level 35 :)  Didnt find enough stuff was red at 35 so I moved on to CoM, I dont recall checking Xalgoz's lair though, might be all red up through 37 or so.</div></div><hr />
