<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AnotherBarbShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure its here somewhere, but I can't find this topic.  I searched and searched.<br />
<br />
Here's the issue:<br />
<br />
I can cast str and dex, then focus or hos, and they stack.<br />
<br />
But if I cast focus or hos, then try to stack str or dex, it won't stack.<br />
<br />
I don't know which way its supposed to work, but clearly this is a bug!!<br />
<br />
Any help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you cast STR and DEX first, HoS/Focus will overwrite and replace them, but when you cast HoS/Focus first, they (STR/DEX) can't overwrite because of the HP component. IoS + Talisman + STR + DEX, however, will stack together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AnotherBarbShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you cast STR and DEX first, HoS/Focus will overwrite and replace them, but when you cast HoS/Focus first, they (STR/DEX) can't overwrite because of the HP component.

<br />
<br />
Actually if I cast str and dex, then hos or fos, str stays.  If I cast hos/fos first, str and dex won't take.<br />
<br />
So if I cast str, then hos, str stays.<br />
If I cast dex, then hos, dex gets overwritten.<br />
If I cast hos, then either str or dex, they don't take.<br />
<br />
That's why I think there's an issue.  Someone else want to try and see?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If someone is asking you for both str and hos, you really need to ridicule their gear and make them feel inferior for needing so many buffs.  It's best to nip that &quot;oh I need every buff you can possibly give me&quot; feeling in the bud.  It will save you a lot of annoyance later on.  You need to train melees right asap.  Remember:  You're not just doing it for yourself, but for your fellow shaman.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just an FYI this only works with Focus of Spirit and HoS.  It doesn't work with Focus of Soul.  Perhaps because shortly after you get FoSoul you get Diaku that will stack with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I am not mistaken, your STR buff &gt; HOS STR component, that is why it stays...but if HOS is cast first, no STR buff can be cast.  Your DEX buff is &lt;= HOS DEX component, so it gets overwritten.  The amount of allowed STR/DEX buffs change with each upgrade, until the single buff is no longer high enough to not get overwritten.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sense.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AnotherBarbShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks moregar, that DOES make sense.  Explains the whole thing actually.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;training tanks not to ask for too many buffs&quot; lol, the reason I noticed this is because I was smithing and was trying for max str :)<br />
<br />
Plus when I buff my regulars, I absolutely pile on anything and everything I can possibly give them!!<br />
<br />
Even in pickups I usually give them most of my buffs, though usually don't bother about str and hos stacking issues.</div></div><hr />
