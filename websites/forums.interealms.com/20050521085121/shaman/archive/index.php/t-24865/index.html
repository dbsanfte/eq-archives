<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im playing a lot less these days, but for the first time since i can remember I havent been able to get a group all week.<br />
<br />
Not that I have been pushing, and ive only logged on fer 30 mins at a time and only three times this week, but im used to getting an invite within the first 10 mins.<br />
<br />
Even the old tried and trusted, hmmm illl move towards an epic mob so i get an invite method hasnt worked.<br />
<br />
Channels i'm used to having 10 - 20 people are down to three.<br />
<br />
Whas goin on?<br />
<br />
A couple of friends of mine said wow beta and eq2.<br />
<br />
Anyone else know whats happenin?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WoW, EQ2, Halo 2 (is it out yet), Lineage 2, Vanguard<br />
Our guild population is beginning to hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Apparently, WoW gave out a bunch of new beta accounts yesterday; 4 of my friends were out yesterday DLing the client and starting a beta character.<br />
<br />
EQ2 apparenlty went live yesterday.  It generated much less fanfare that I was actually expecting for a big Sony launch, but it was noticible.<br />
<br />
Halo2 launched Yesterday (11/9).  I expect this release to attract more and more EQ'ers (that like Halo anyway) as more games become availible (the Toys R Us near my house had 150 copies availible for sale; they sold out within 2 minutes of opening the store.)<br />
<br />
So yeah, yesterday was a bit hit to EQ populations on my server too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was really noticing this the other day.<br />
<br />
Zones are empty and hollow.  My chat channels are emptying out.  All my old friends are gone.  Most of my newer friends are gone.  More of my newer new friends remain.  <br />
<br />
I really feel like a dinosaur.  When I see someone from pre-Kunark days it's like this grand welcoming, even if we didn't really hang out much.  <br />
<br />
It's sure getting harder to do things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I pity most people who think WoW or EQ2 will be panaceas to their MMORPG woes.  After the shininess wears off and the leveling is done (which is easier than EQ, but was made a bit more difficult since WoW started) players are going to realize, again, that having to cooperate with others to achieve something is where most problems arise.  One or more classes will be perceived as &quot;better&quot; and that opens the door to balance complaints.  There will be bugs, lots of them: broken quests, odd pathing, untuned raids. <br />
<br />
The short of it is, if you're leaving EQ because you hate it and think WoW or EQ2 is going to be better, you're going to be disappointed.  Call it pork.  Call it swine.  No matter what you call it, it's still a pig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But it's a different pig, which is refreshing.</div></div><hr />

I agree..we already saw Shadowbane, FF9, SWG fall flat on thier faces...and how many realize WoW is a Blizzard game....if you ever played Diablo you know how screwed up the dervs were with those online games...so I dont expect WoW to be any better than how Diableo was handled...as for EQ2, &quot;IF&quot; you have the system requirements to actually run the game, you will find it - at least I did in beta - directed towards new roleplayers and not for the hardcore player. (Sometimes I sit back and wonder what Sony was thinking by makeing a second EQ, just seems so illogical not to just put all that brain power in improve EQ...like getting into potime and gating into the future.../shrug). I have noticed a decrease in population on Drinal now and in guild. <br />
<br />
A word of warning....I have come across some high lvl players in oow expeditions and some grps and found out they don't have a clue what they are doing..what's this?...people buying high lvl ebayed peeps..not good...high lvl newbies!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
dewd, high lvl ebay is old hat.  cant tell you how many times i ran into ebays in the 55+ range in Velious, Luclin and PoP.  big tip offs...<br />
<br />
bards who dont twist.... ever.<br />
tanks that don't taunt<br />
paladins that dont stun<br />
sks that dont fill your buff bar up curing combat<br />
mages that only have the vendor purchasable pet spells<br />
enchs that dont stun/mezz<br />
clerics/shams who dont buff<br />
monks that have no clue how to split a pull<br />
<br />
lol, too many to list.  but you get my drift.  i'd only guess its gotten worse with the number people who have decided after 3-5 years, its enough and are cashing in rather than &quot;just retiring&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A lot of poeple I know have server transfered.<br />
<br />
As i play AU hours it means all of the high end chars have gone.<br />
<br />
Most of the peeps I used to play with over the last few years have gone elsewhere (its not me! I swear).<br />
<br />
Whilst I understand that its easier to join an established guild than build one, its making a gap in the middle tier.<br />
<br />
Either you have 250+ aa's (which most long term players have pretty easily) and can raid 6 times per week, or there is nothing.<br />
<br />
Hmm, im feelin it may be time to hang up the account for a while again. <br />
<br />
Such an on again off again thing this game. Its amazing how much of your interest i perked by measurable progression.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if we were all more effective at goal setting in real life EQ wouldnt be so attractive 8)<br />

Talk about hard to find a group.<br />

Does anyone think that the lose in playerbase will be enough for SoE to consolidate servers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two of the four people I came into EQ with have left (cleric, enchanter) for good. <br />
<br />
The person who's guild I transferred servers to join (and almost the whole guild) - gone.<br />
<br />
I'm better off, though, because THEY WERE WEAK AND PROBABLY HOLDING ME BACK!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My friend accurately described EQ as circling the toilet bowl for the past year, and its finally about to be sucked in.</div></div><hr />

People might come back if they are tired of another games.. like SWG or DAoC.<br />
And... unless they cancel their account, SoE does not care. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How are the newer servers doing?  Some of the talk I've been hearing on Inny from a few people is that the newer ones are doing better than the older ones.  Is it purely gossip or is there something behind it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The situation also feeds on itself.  As people leave EQ for other games or even just to try them out, it weakens the playerbase.  Such a loss contributes momentum towards the decision to retire that a lot of EQ players who are playing just for the people have been thinking about.  The players there because EQ is the last MMORPG they will play then leave, further reducing the playerbase, leading to the hardcore people leaving, etc.<br />
<br />
EQ2 (bought two copies today) and WoW look fun and I have hope.  I don't expect either of them to replace EQ right away and possibly not even forever, but they are the first real alternatives for a very long time.  I have hope because all one of them has to do is be equal to EQ and I would probably switch just because of EQ's age.  If I could find any new game as entertaining as EQ I would switch, but so far none have come anywhere near close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well remember that EQ2 and WoW designed for casual 1-2 hrs players, not like Eq1. Tho EQ1 does have its casual elements with LDoN's, it still seems to be aimed at high end raid guilds. Nothing coming will really compete with the high end, not for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Same thing is happening on Xegony.  I've gone for over 90 mins lfg.  Half the guild hasn't logged on due to EQ2 beta, WoW beta, GTA:San Andreas, Halo2.  And don't forget you have the holidays coming up in America.  I've noticed in my guild over the past few years, as Thanksgiving and Christmas come up on the horizon, everyone goes: Crap, I have realitives.  Must be social so they'll give me money for Christmas and actually let me come over for Thanksgiving dinner.  Food!!<br />
<br />
Expect the populations of all servers to come back a bit after the first of the year.  By then most of the folks that tried out WoW and EQ2 will have had made a decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Exact same on Terris. All the high lvl guilds are hurting for numbers. My guild used to have at least 40 every night, now we bearly break 20 on a good night. I've gone back to soloing instead of trying to get a group (its frustrating spending an hour lfg and get a horrible group that wipes right when u get there). Soloing is still fun and i find the camps more open than they used to be. Inner Acrylia, Veksar, Droga are all empty for the most part. <br />

<br />
lol @ someone citing L2 as impacting EQ guilds... I knew all of 2 people that played L2 and they've long quit already.  Banging my head into a wall repeatedly is less boring and less monotonous than L2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There's going to be a dip in server populations for the next 4-6 weeks while people try out EQ 2 and WoW. But then their free month on those games will expire and they will have to make a decision. At least half will come back to EQ 1 I predict, maybe more.<br />
<br />
When DAoC came out, EQ was a ghost town for weeks if not longer. But within 2 months it was back to normal as the bubble of hype for DAoC collapsed. The same might happen for WoW and EQ 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bullian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">the past few nights on the nameless server has been normal. i have actually seen more people in pok. avg. about 120 at any one time. the weekend will be when it will be most noticeiable i think, we will see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I had to give a little chuckle to the (admittedly small) number of people comparing WoW to D2.  You might as well compare EQ to Doom.  First, there's these things we call &quot;genres&quot;, and comparing a game from one genre to a game in another makes about as much sense as comparing your mother to a bananna.<br />
<br />
What Vigdis said is probably the best description for it so far.  This is the next generation of mmorpg's.  As much as I hate Sony and am not thrilled with EQ2 compared to WoW, it's still a class apart from EQ1, which I don't think you could pay me to play at this point (ok, for $15/hour I might).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In a few weeks a bunch will be back.  I just love how people still preach doom and gloom for EQ every new game that comes out.  You would think after the other &quot;EQ Killers&quot; didn't live up to that prediction they'd realize that only EQ can kill EQ, GoD nearly did it but with the OoW expansion as good as it was, I think Dev's learned their lesson.   DAoC, AO, SWG, L2, Shadowbane, FF, etc, they all dropped populations at the beginning, then many came back.</div></div><hr />

I don't think there is going to be such a thing as an EQ &quot;Killer&quot;, but I really think the combo of EQ2/WoW will deal it a pretty serious kick in the berries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dazek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I played on Druzzil for a long time, then for a change of pace - moved to Sullon Zek. Admittedly, SZ is packed with twinks, snot nosed kids, and ebayers. But for those who try to play the game, it is a great place to learn the limits of your class and improvise playstyles.<br />
<br />
That server is empty - by far the least populated server - By far... And you can only group with 1/3 of the people on such an empty server; doesn't leave you a lot of choices! So when you group, you do the best that you can with what you've got. You always didn't have a tank, slower, chanter, cleric... <br />
<br />
I'm back on Druzzil and have noticed people are losing the idea of the Holy Trinity - as least on pickup groups. Point being: You'd be amazed at the groups you can cobble together out of nothing... <br />

<br />
I think it depends on why someone is disappointed in EQ.  If it's because they want a more casual friendly game, then WoW (don't know about EQ2) definintely seems to be a better option.  If you want a better high-end or fully developed game, then I agree that EQ is by far the better option.<br />
<br />
As for me...I plan to play EQ for the twice weekly guild raids and grouping with people I know.  But...for the other times I want to play a game, I'll probably play WoW.  I really only want to play my warrior in EQ, and soloing isn't an option - so it's either sit for hours hoping for a good pu group (not likely!) or have some fun with WoW.</div></div><hr />

That's probably why WoW started their open beta on the 9th  ;) <br />
