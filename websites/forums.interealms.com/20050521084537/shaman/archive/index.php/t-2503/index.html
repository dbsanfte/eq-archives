<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Congratulations on getting your tear.<br />
<br />
Wish you would reconsider repeating the shield quest multiple times.  Hanging around the Hole you might be able to get in on a raid for Kindle and get to take out Kirn that way.<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You may want to reconsider factioning your way through the epic bro.  Over in the quests forum there's been talk that &quot;cheating&quot; through your epic may have been fixed.  I don't know if it's really true or these people just messed up (you never know for sure on a forum)  I just wanted to point you over to that forum so you can make up your own mind....<br />

<br />
But in any case - grats on the tear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats on da Tear....<br />
<br />
The Hole has been changed and is now less of a chalange.  If joo can get a couple of groups in CoM to finish joo SoF then joo can also get the hole done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Congratulations, Geist. It's also great to hear that at least when some of the upper guilds clear out PoF, they are considerate enough to not let the tears rot.<br />
<br />
I'd also recommend doing the Hole, even guildless, because it's a fun dungeon (says he who gets killed by his friends there every Tuesday, /sigh). If you're really stuck, use the server boards (check the .sig below) to start networking with people - there's always chanters around who want to go kill their mob just next to Kirn, so partner up with one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye... I *HATED*  the hole.  Swore I'd not go back.<br />
<br />
After the changes, heck.  It's some of the easiest xp in the game now.  Nice, uncrowded (at least on Bristlebane) and comfy... as long as you have a way back out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Soon my guild on Xev will be trying the faction method.  Both the Shaman giving the tear to Rak (me) and the one looting the scale have max TS faction.<br />
<br />
Will let you know how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Faction method still works.<br />
<br />
Postage-sized guild got 2 Shaman Epics in the past 2 days.<br />
<br />
1) Shaman with max TS faction turned in and looted the scale.<br />
<br />
2) Shaman A with max TS faction (Me) turned in scale, Shaman B (Not me) with max TS faction looted scale and is now  Heyokah.</div></div><hr />
