<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwedo18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
  im a lv 60 shammy on the quillious server. one of my best freinds in the game is a 60 dr00d . we duel all the time for fun .. but i can neve beat him.. only two things ever stick .. malo and my epic dot.. which isnt enough.. i am oom due to resists and then the fights over.. any suggestions on beating a 60 druid that resists everything i throw at him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If he resists everything, even after Malo, you're down to melee. You will melee much better than a drooid, but you have to get the fight to the point of melee first.<br />
<br />
If you know he'll resist, don't bother.  Don't cast offensive spells on him, except for annul magic. (f he has instant cast items to replentish buffs, you'll need golem wands or old pummice)<br />
<br />
Make sure you leave several buff slots open at the top of your list to dispell his dots.  Healthrough his DD's (piece of cake if you have Torpor) and make him run out of mana.  Then dispell the crap our of him, and remove his SoW, and any damage shield. Now it's melee time. Epic dot and melee at will.<br />
<br />
At least, that's what I would try :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwedo18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok ty for your advice ill see what i cant come up with ;o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">once malo'd did ya malosini him?  or try?<br />
<br />
did you use incideous decay(unresistable)  then stack pox and plague on him?<br />
<br />
did you slam alot?<br />
<br />
JBB+ epic= infinite damage..:)<br />
<br />
did ya haste pet and MR FR CR SOW him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwedo18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">he resistes malosini.. after malo... he banishes or whatever to make pet go away.... but ill keep trying one of these days ill beat him .. then ill retire ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JukaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aslo after you ID, slap on Insidious Malady. It's cheap, fast-cast, &amp; it'll land at somepoint. Like Malo &gt; Malosini, but should work better. When I run into people who are cocky cuz they they think they have good DR, I do this &amp; it usually works at little mana cost. Then you've got his DR down 100! *grin Try it &amp; GL.  Jukasaza. ps *agree shaman @ 60 oom &gt; drood @ 60 oom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Disease is the best way in my opinion to beat a druid. When you land ID and pox/plague, he should try to cure it. But with all the disease counters you should have on him, he wont be able to do it in time for you to either land epic/ BoN, or your dd. When he tries to heal, start the melee. It takes a few times to get it right, but druids are not that hard really,other then them gating away from you when you are winning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A small note.  Use what only Shaman can use.  If you want to beat him, go camp Gornit for a few hours.  Make stinging wort potions.  A stack of these are worth 3k hitpoints in healing.<br />
<br />
You never mention how close the fights are, but certainly this little tidbit is enough to let you win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The reason a shaman should win this fight is time.<br />
I have a druid, and a shammie, I love dueling with both of them.<br />
The thing that pisses most people off is how long druids and rangers, and shammies for that matter, can last in a duel.<br />
You're not in a hurry, so concerve mana.  I would save as much mana as I could for heals and canceling their buffs.<br />
<br />
With regrowth, plus our line of heals, we can regen mana much faster than a druid.  With Canni 4 there is no reason for us to go out of mana.  Basically, wait them out.  Play it smart, keep a few slots open for their dots...if they get you...dispell them.  Use as little mana as possible...hopefully, they will burn themselves out.<br />
<br />
Once you get them low on mojo, cancel any damage shield they have ang charge in for melee.  Yeah, it may sound a little odd, but if they are resisting most of your dots and they only do 60% anyway, there is no shame in using your advantages.  Druids can't melee half as well as a shaman.  So, burn them out of mana, just keeping yourself alive, and once they are oom, move in for the kill.<br />
<br />
I have finished duels at near FM just from playing it safe and using canni.  Once a druid is oom, they're not getting it back.   Once we're out of mana, we're just a few HP's away from full.<br />
<br />
Think long term.</div></div><hr />
