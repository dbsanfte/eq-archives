<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did not see anything on this topic so I have created this thread.<br />
<br />
Currently my adventure stone is augmented to a wisdom charm which I know is stupid and I should get a Wooden Figurine and in my laziness have not yet but my question in this:<br />
<br />
If I destroy or unaugment my adventure stone and want to put an adventure stone into my wooden figurine can I even go back and do the hails to get another adventure stone and if so do I just hail everyone at each camp untill I get my stats back (currently adv stone has 2 to everything and around 30hp/mana) or will the new adventure stone I get already have the stats that my old one had.<br />
<br />
Right now I am apprehensive to destroy my current adventure stone in the chance that I will have to restart all my stats.  I have already put a ton of time in LDoN and am in the top 100 list on Torv but do not want to have a zerod out adv stone.<br />
