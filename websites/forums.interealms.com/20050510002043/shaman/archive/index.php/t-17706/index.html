5 months isn't really that much time given the lifespan of EQ so far.  Return if it is FUN!  Here's a few biggies that've occurred:<br />
<br />
1.  Shared bank slots (2 slots you can put packs in and a shared plats slow) - makes it easy to move stuff between toons on an account - nice for moving around tradeskill stuff, twink items, or loot to sell on your trader.  I love it.<br />
<br />
2.  LDoN expansion.  Instanced dungeons in 5 different themes with difficulty that adjusts based on group level.  They're a lot like a classic dungeon crawl in that critters don't respawn once you kill them.  You're on a timer, with a specific goal (there are several goals), you get adventure points for finishing, there are random named mobs that drop occasional decent loot, and you can augmentations drop randomly.  Augmentations can be slotted into exising and LDoN specific gear to enhance them.  The camps associated with the themes have merchants that sell stuff you buy with the adventure points...and some of the stuff they sell is very nice.  For shaman, you can also buy some new spells there, like a curse based DoT line, shrew and pack shrew (indoor SoW variant), and eventually even Greater Remove Curse (rather than being pillaged for it in the bazaar).  Personally, I love LDoN and consider it the best thing to happen to MMORPGs (the instanced dungeons thing) - it's done a great deal to encourage people to group up, as even pickup groups that break away from 'the trilogy' formation can do well.  Xp in LDoN before 51 is also phenominal...you can make a level every 2-3 adventures easily.<br />
<br />
3.  Due to the EQ Evolution bundle, lack of any other decent MMORPGs hitting the market, and I'd think due to LDoN, there seems to be quite a few new people joining EQ and quite a few old timers returning to EQ, like folks that played a long time ago (me) and are on a 2nd run of EQ.<br />
<br />
4.  Recent patches have actually added stuff rather than nerfed, IMO.  The only thing they seem to have nerfed lately are exploits, which should be nerfed into the ground anyways.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes you should.  Well depending on where your toon is at (level wise).  If you were in your 60's and tired of the PoP thing then HELL YEAH come back.  LDoN has made the game for me 1 bazillion times better than before (note i am not in a guild so this is where i am coming from).  NO more bot groups, no more HoH, no more no more no more.<br />
<br />
if you are sub 60's then yes come back there is LDoN, but a lot more nice gear out there and places still to explore</div></div><hr />
