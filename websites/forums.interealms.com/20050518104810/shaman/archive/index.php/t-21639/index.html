<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a brief search but didn't find and probably didn't look close enough for what I am looking for.  Does Healing Adept stack with Improved Healing IV?  Obviously this would concern the Tnarg spell.  Anybody know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, it does.  I'm not sure how the calculation is made, but they both impact the amount healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I could be wrong, but from what I have been able to determine, it works something like this:<br />
<br />
When you cast a heal, the server runs a check on what AA abilities you have that could affect the heal.  AA are always calculated first.  After that calculation is made, the 20% bonus from IH4 are factored in.  After the Focus calculation it checks for a crit, which is something else entirely.<br />
<br />
That seems to be what happens in my experience.  I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read through those charts, and then scroll down and read the rest ... I believe it will tell you how much your Tnarg's will heal for with different AA and focus effect combinations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All focus effects stack with AA abilities, I don't know any exceptions aside from spell casting time reduction having a limit of 50%.</div></div><hr />
