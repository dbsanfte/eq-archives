<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just had one of my worst looting experiences.  I was in WoS, Along the south wall near IZ and a friend invited me into group... It was a friend I have known for some time in EQ and had great respect for being one of my guild leaders.  He at one time lost all his items and the GMs wouldnt help him get his things out of a High end plane I think.....  All his things rotted.....  I helped him by getting him roughly 8k worth of weapons and a 4k hand hasteitem.   For some of you that seems rather small and rather pathetic but for me being lvl 53 at the time that was huge....  I never asked for him to repay it... I only wanted him to get back on his feet with him being lvl 62 during the POP expansion.<br />
<br />
I have been gone for roughly 6 mths, to a new expansion and most of my friends gone.  My former guild leader has joined a rather respectable guild that is well known on our server....  I was in the same group he was... I died in another group and they all ran.  He as a pally rezed me since no one else  in the zone was a cleric..  Only 6 people were in the zone at this time.  After rez he invited me in his group, which was almost ALL his guild.......  We started pulls, our main obect was to grab the hunter and bring him down..... We did.. and he dropped the ring with +4 regen/mana regen.  He held it and we continued... We found 2 other names and they dropped good loot as well.  He being the looter looted them and we continued.. We were going to roll for items after one of us left.   During one of the pulls my friend left and was going to log on.. I didnt understand what it was about but it was obvious that him and his guild had knowledge of why he needed to leave and cme back.....  He never came back.  this is the second time that ring that I REALY need was lost to me due to someone not letting everyone roll for it.  The worst thing is the guild had no problems with this.  In fact when I brought up the ring they only laughed about it.  Nearly causing me to believe this was planned.   <br />
<br />
WHO CAN YOU TRUST, NO ONE....... The only reason why I dont expose the guilds name and my friends is for 2 reasons.  One, he may have realy needed to leave at that moment due to an emergency,  two,  I want to give him a cance to explain what the crap went on and why he did this to me being possibly the only one outside of his current guild...   <br />
<br />
Is this a common thing among guilds now, get help to get items and not give everyone a chance to roll for items?  Better yet, what ever happened to the rule, Need before Greed.  IS the high game only about getting to help your bank instead of helping everyone get exp and items each class needs to use?  Is this what EQ has come to due to the better itmes being released?<br />
<br />
What do you think.... Am I being alittle overly sensitive?  Have you been in a group where a mostly guilded group did this to you?  Again this is a highly well known guild on my server.... All guilds know this guild and most high gamers on my server know this friend of mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the item was the Infernal Ring of Regrowth i think, or one similar to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While I cant say whether or not your friend has turned into an asshat, I can say the the situation you described is NOT indicative of the 'high end game' in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've never had someone camp off with high value loot in 4 years of playing.  Sorry it happened, but I don't think its too common.<br />
<br />
I tend to run with an older crowd (25-35), so various annoyances like that don't spring up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should really ask him before you get too worked up. Several times in my EQ playtime, I've camped with a looted item by accident - just forgot I had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">id try asking him, see what he says...could be an accident, would be bad if he read your thoughts about him if it were</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All I can say is this is definitely NOT the norm.  In my guild if you were busted pulling a stunt like this you would have 24 hours to explain yourself, and then get the boot if there was not a good reason for your behavior.  Even in group situations where we pick up non-guildmates, we explain the NBG loot rules to them.  In certain cases, where we go to a zone to get a certain item for a certain person, obviously the rule changes a bit.  However, in these cases, the person trying for the item is not allowed to roll on other things, unless he forfeits his claim to said item.  <br />
<br />
Last night we were in NC trying to get a Drakescale for a guildmate.  We had 4 guild members and 2 non guildies.  We explained the situation and they were more than satisfied, leaving with close to 2k in gems.  Sadly, we never saw the shield.  I'm sorry that happened to you Sun, but take heart in knowing that there ARE people in EQ who still know the meaning of honor; and are more concerned witht the gaming experience vice the loot/pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't let it get you down.  If that is their only way to get gear then let em have it and move on.  The worst thing you can do is let it keep you up at night.  I borrowed a Jade Mace to a friend of mine way back in the day when it was actually worth some money and I never saw it again.  About 4 months later he asked me for help getting his corpse out of SF.  I had a rather good laugh.  It will come around back to them, don't let it get you down.  I would say this is a once in a blue moon situation.<br />
<br />
If you don't get it resolved come back and post the guild/user info. :p<br />
In the mean time go solo the Fabled dude in the Giant fort in FM for a good ring upgrade.  No regens on it but a good upgrade for your CTB ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Have you spoken with HIM about it, yet? Your outrage seems really premature, to me, if you haven't.  His guildies probably chuckle becaues the ring doesn't have much value to them, so the whole situation is just &quot;oops, hehe&quot; and either forgettable, or solvable later.  Just this week I had to log out of a guild exp group really abruptly because of a situation irl.  In my haste I forgot that I'd looted a not-yet-randomed spell rune.  When I got back in game the next day, no one freaked out, it was just taken care of.  You should try that approach.  Just chill till you talk to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">which was almost ALL his guild  i know in my guild if no one in the group can use we guild tribute if there is only one person out fo the guild we usually all roll and then guild bank, but if it is a friend of someone we will give to whoever can acctually use often.  we like to help out the guild when we can most stuff we get goes to guild not to bazaar.  so they could have thought the same and just put toward the guild cause it was mainly them and its not that big a deal to that level guild if im understanding you right.  this is not really the right thing to do not give you a chance to get the item.  but remember usually guilds kinda just keep things around int he guild and just give to someone in the guild that can upgrade from it.  but it could be a total accidental mistake of camping without splitting or maybe a emergency and just had to leave cause could not stay for the split many reasons possible best thing to do is talk to him i bet it was either an emergency and he is sorry about camping with it or he did not think that it was a big deal being use to the guild groups and not worrying about WOS loot and figured it would all be solved out later so just dont worry about it rreally.</div></div><hr />

I deceided not to make a big issue about it and let the ring go...  I don't want to make a bug seen over it.   I think your right, I was ultra pissed off about to the point of over reacting.  Now that I step back and take a deep breath I feel I am able to try for the ring again.<br />
<br />
I continued to try for the ring later only to have a group brab from our the named everytime out bard tried to pull to our group.....   Our group leader said he heard they were using some program called........  something track enabling them to track every named in the zone live feed, the moment the named mob popped in the zone.  So getting named after that was rather impossible.    This coninued the last 3 times I have gone in WoS hoping for the named mobs.   <br />
<br />
Once the bard died and I maloed the named and attempted to pull.... At first It seemed to be working, the plan was to have the pally Stun the mob before it got there so I wouldn't be lunch.. However the stun the named threw was most new to my knowledge and hence I was inable to take another step while the mob made MOST short work of me.....<br />
<br />
I checked the value of the ring in the bazaar, some seel this ring close to  80k, Thats a massive tall order for someone like me with only 14k in the bank..... Ahhhhhhh life, isnt it wonderful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Would suggest making it know you are looking for usable items when ya join a group ....<br />
<br />
Reason being, is I mainly group with purely guild groups, and 99% of the time the drops aren't even considered upgrades for ALTS .... Being in that frame of mind (and habit) and having a non-guildie join the group, it is easy to forget the items may be considered upgrades for new comers ....<br />
<br />
I know I have been guilty of the same thing above, but nobody said anything when it was looted ... so I just kept plowing without much thought for it at the time :(  (I did try to rectify it the day after).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As others have said, accidents happen, sometimes highly embarrassing accidents.<br />
<br />
Some years ago you couldn't sell in Crystal Caverns without Sneak since SOE didn't add faction modifiers to the local Orcs until later. It was also a time when a couple of K was a respectable chunk of money around level 35-40. So naturally, my Monk was the designated seller after a long evening of slaughtering Geonids in a pickup group. As soon as I got the gems, I went LD and couldn't get back on for 5-10 minutes. You could almost see the anxiety on the toons' faces when I finally got back :)<br />
<br />
But even if your worst fears are justified, I wouldn't worry too much about it. You know the saying &quot;If you lend a man $100 and never see him again, it was money well spent?&quot; Besides, new gear becomes available all the time, especially with new expansions coming out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Prexus_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got flustered after getting deaded several times in a WoS pickup group and pulled the cord on my computer after death number 5, in less than half as many hours.  I completely spaced the fact that I was looting a little and had picked up a muramite rune and a sword ( the pally / SK attuneable one ). I remembered the following day and was morbid. I thught &quot; Wow I bet the group thinks I'm da debil for slashing out with the phat lewtz!&quot;  I'm currently trying to track them down, I use a parser so I have a log of the peoples names so I should be able to find them again to roll on the items. But wow, I felt like a donkey rear after I realized what I did. *sigh*<br />
<br />
Sometimes it actually is a mistake. Don't think the worst of people until you have a chance to discuss it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, I did it, i broke down and went to his guild post and requested a chance to roll for it....    I couldnt log onto his guild web sight even though I was regestered, man less give him a pm.  So I managed to get a message in one of his post eve though his sight wouldnt let me log on.   I got a email from him the next day saying he was having router problems which is why he logged off.  He didnt mean to leave with the item, he didnt even need it, infact he sayed he would pass on the roll, it was mine.  He wanted me to contact him when we were online at the same time, he said he would drop what he was doing and get that ring to me.  <br />
<br />
By the way he wrote the letter I get the since that I embarrased him, of course this wasn't my intent, I feel horrible now even going that far for the item.   I'm not in a raid guild and I dont have any other way for getting loot, and even if I was in a raid guild I just dont have alot of time to raid.<br />
<br />
Anyway, It is apparent that I over reacted, I just hope I didn't overly piss him off now.......  I wrote back to him telling him sorry if I embarrased him over the issue, It was impossible for me to log in and pm him.  Oh well, he will get me the ring soon.</div></div><hr />

And things liek that usually have a reason, If it was in spite or for greediness then usually they have been blacklisted by the server.  Most people just dont start up and become asses and ninja loot.  They will usually have some sort of history of it.  I dont think I have ever gotten unlucky enough to get one of those ninja looters in my groups (Knock on wood).  But, they are out there and you gotta watch out.  Sending a e-mail to your friend doesnt seem out of line, I mean if it was just because he was greedy then you would know not to group with him anymore, but now you know he is still a nice guy and will be able to spend some good time with him.</div></div><hr />
