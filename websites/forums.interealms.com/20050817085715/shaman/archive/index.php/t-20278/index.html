<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What would happen if SoE effectively removed the stat caps by raising them to something like 1,000?<br />
<br />
In my mind the stat cap is one of the seldom-named reasons for the Shaman&#8217;s plight.  We certainly argue that our buffs are effectively useless now and should not be counted as a strength, but we seem to take the current game mechanics as set in stone and immovable.  I don&#8217;t expect for loot not to have nice stats and I certainly can&#8217;t blame the players for raising their statistic with the use of items.  Our problem is that our lowest buff can usually top off the typical end game player.  What would happen if that ceiling was blown off the stats and our buffs could once again raise the players&#8217; stats into the stratosphere? <br />
<br />
Is this theoretically possible?  I mean heck they are re-coding the graphics engine!  The AA system has basically made the &#8220;leveling&#8221; open-ended.  Why can&#8217;t the game code be modified to make the player stats open-ended?  We have a limit of 15 buff slots and only so many item slots so it is not like the pumping up of stats is unlimited with our current spell selection.  <br />
<br />
Everyone would benefit from this, I think.  Every class that can cast a buff and every class that can receive a buff will benefit.  The devs in charge of item creation would have more area to roam.  The devs in charge of building mobs can make mobs with higher AC and Attack ratings.  It will delay the need for new levels.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?   Is this a bad idea?  Why won&#8217;t this work?  Where are my socks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting idea.<br />
<br />
Problem is they would have to recode the entire game for that.<br />
<br />
With 1k being the tops on stats, each point in a stat would mean less. and they would have to further increase the points of stats on all equipment to make it look appealing.<br />
<br />
the only hope now is to maybe work a way to trade in stat buffs for something altogether different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They don't have to recode the entire game.  There is no hard limit to the numbers anymore like there was when 255 was the max.   Watch what happens the instant you die, for whatever reason the intentional caps on stats vanish and you can see your true stats.   I recently noticed this when I died the other night and had a long zone time (during that 1018 server crap).    My WIS was showing at over 500, as well as all my resists being over 500 (had resist buffs up at the time).  It showed exactly what my resists would be without a cap.<br />
<br />
So they can remove the cap easy enough, the question is will they choose to.    And would it really matter for things like resists, cause they'll most likely just make the newer mobs AE have a bigger resist adj to compensate.   It will also make some encounters a joke because you'll have people with sky high resists and mob's AE's won't land at all.<br />
<br />
Stat caps I can see being jacked up higher, say to near 500 with AA work.  But I don't think raising resists higher than 500 would be a good thing for the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like to jack my poison, magic and disease resists and go solo trak...  see what happens when you arbitrarily remove or increase stat and resist caps?<br />
<br />
HAHA.<br />
<br />
no, I don't think anymore scope creep/overrun is the way to go.<br />
<br />
EDITED~ fur gr2m3r.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">O.k., be kind on the flames please...<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a cap on equipment based stats, while allowing for a larger cap for enhancements, i.e. casted buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's their game, they can code whatever they wanted.   But it means allowing for calculations above the stats and such.<br />
<br />
Lets say 305 was your max strength... they have a calculation for how much that increases your DPS (and what you can carry).<br />
<br />
Lets say you get Focus and Diaku on top of that now... and those can exceed teh stat cap... then you throw FA in there...  lets pretend thats +200 STR.<br />
<br />
So now your STR is 505.    They need to &quot;code&quot; in what the effect of that extra 200 strength is.   Does it follow the same &quot;benifit&quot; of going from 205 to 305?      (It would probably be diminished if they added such a thing).<br />
<br />
I don't think coding it would be a challenge... I think balancing it would be.    What would the effects be, on a max stat'd person... who got FA + all other shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
It would bring value back to our buffs for sure... especially on the higher geared people (and I don't just mean time... people can actually max their stats fairly easy today... pre-elems).     It would make Ferine Avatar truly rock as a spell even more... no matter what STR the tank had... they're getting +140 more + benifits for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really dont think this would make a signifigant differance.  already any stats over 200 have dimished returns and this is further cut beyond 255.  stats are also greatly over rated in their signifgance.  the benefit dex gives to procs has been proven to be negligable above 200, sta over 255 returns maybe 1hp per point, and agi is what 1 ac per 10 points?  over all pure hp, mana, atk, ac ect is signifigantly more valueable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The stat cap is definitely an arbitrary construct over which they have complete control, no question there.<br />
<br />
The thing is... what do you think removing the stats cap would do? Diminishing return doesn't begin to describes the benefits from stats above 255, much less above 280.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you're buffing a tank. He is already at the cap of 305 or very much near it. 60 more points of STR, STA, DEX or AGI are going to bring him... what? Pass 305, those 60 point of STA are likely going to be equivalent to 60-90 more HP, probably less... you think a tank is going to sacrifice a buff slot for that? They already sacrifice more HP than that getting Rangers' SOT or Beastlords' SV buff over the Paladins' Brell, for the additional ATK they provide. And the 1-2 of damage avoidance AC 60 more AGI would bring isn't exactly going to scream 'Buff me!' either. Add another 140 AGI from avatar and you're adding what... 5 AC? They're willing to lose twice that equipping a ring with Vengeance II on it and don't even blink doing it.<br />
<br />
You have a better case with DEX or STR, but even there... the +ATK you see from buffing STR is not equivalent to, say, the +ATK from the ATK buff component of Ferocity or Avatar. And that DEX is going to amount to 1-2% additional proc chance. Plus, they're getting those buffs for free, bundled as they are in Focus, which at this point they already get for the less and less significant HP buff component, or in FA which they want for the +ATK component.<br />
<br />
Stats buffs are not what's going to make or break the high level shamans. They haven't been since Luclin and, giving that people are asking for the cap to be moved up again, the PoP cap raises haven't changed that either. Asking for higher caps is like asking for a sixth lane on a five-lane highway... yeah, you're going to get there a trifle faster, but you're still going to end up in the same place.<br />
<br />
You want significant buffs? Ask for buffs that give passive mana regen. Or actual combat abilities, like Avoidance, Strikethrough, combat skills (1HS, 2HS, parry, bash, etc.) bonuses and so on. Now, any of THAT is going to have the other classes sit up and beg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if stats really matter much(resist do but not str/stam etc)then yes it be good, but they dont so it makes  it pointless, juts higher and higher numbers that really do nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd even be happy with stat buffs not giving actual stat increases, but only raising your cap, ie empty stat points. (not talking resists here)<br />
<br />
The exception is FA where the atk component would need separation into a separate buff to become useful as no one really has maxed atk without FA.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the buff number limit such a change could not become unbalanced, but would always make our stat buffs useful on everyone. The downside, of course, would be the annoyance of getting stamina tells from the warrior, dex tells from the rogues and separate cha tells from the chanters.... or maybe that's a plus too as it adds a bit of options and uniqueness for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The exception is FA where the atk component would need separation into a separate buff to become useful as no one really has maxed atk without FA.While there is a cap on worn +ATK, there is no cap on overall ATK. So there is no need to separate FA out into any other stat or category. You can stack worn ATK, all the spell/song ATK buffs that you can get to stack, and if a new spell or song is added into the game that stacks with the previous stuff, the ATK number will gladly go right on up.<br />
<br />
On my rogue, who does have max worn ATK, I have been up to 2200 ATK, and with the right buffs (which I never get), I could apparently get up into the 2350 range or so. Realistically, I hit 2000 with VQ, Billy, FA, SoP, and SoT. Its rare that I get Ferocity simply because we have like 2 beastlords that raid with us, and they cant keep it on everyone and both are lazy enough not to cast it unless you beg for it. :p</div></div><hr />
