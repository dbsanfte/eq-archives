<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, I decided to give EQ another try a few days (http://www.corpnews.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=664) ago and someone told me that they have just activated the buddy program. Basically it's a 30 days brand new account with all the expansions enabled till LoY and to use before the end of July.<br />
<br />
So, there's someone of you that won't use this code? I'm searching one so I'm able to spare LoY and PoP..<br />
<br />
Hopefully a new shaman will enter the game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is it just me, or does this just scream SCAM to anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not scam. It's just someone who would like to start the game. Since I don't know anyone playing it I'm searching a way to find a buddy code.<br />
<br />
I have the interest in the game and if you follow the link I posted you see that we were discussing the shaman class. But before I reach that point I need to access the game. Since EVERYONE will have those buddy codes and I don't believe that in two months EQ will reach 1 million of accounts I just ask someone who doesn't care about it to offer me one.<br />
<br />
The original page about buddy codes is here: http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=62304</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is it just me, or does this just scream SCAM to anyone else?<br />
Nah, seems to be a valid thing and he is not asking for your account info anyways.<br />
But, no email yet and I m sure I ll find good use for my buddy key. Especially since you do not even have to buy the game or any expansion up until LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is it just me, or does this just scream &quot;SoE planted this poster here to try to get some free advertisement&quot; to anyone else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is it just me or are there a lot of paranoid posters here ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is it just me or are there a lot of paranoid posters here ;)<br />
<br />
just because your paranoid, doesnt mean they are not out to get you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't really care if you think I'm from SOE, I just want a buddy code for *myself* :)<br />
<br />
I don't care what you'll do with other buddy codes or if they'll have more or less subscribers. I'm just looking forward to start the game and my ogre shaman. I have the client ready but I don't know how damn to find the code since everyone isn't playing anymore or is going to use the code.<br />
<br />
Damn. I don't want to whore for a free code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is just me or is this mostly going to be used by 2 boxers? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is just me or is this mostly going to be used by 2 boxers? :)<br />
<br />
I hope to try out 3boxing (on one pc) using this.... it could save me a ton of money if it works... and even more if it doesnt work so well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Damn guys, you are supposed to give *me* the buddy code, not to use it for yourselves. :)<br />
<br />
I guess I'll have to keep playing DAoC and WoW ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good call in saving yourself a month of your life that way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyway, someone has at least received the mail from SOE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nope I havent received it, but I am looking forward to using mine. On FV, you are only allowed one character, so this is a great opportunity for those on the server that always wanted to start an alt, but didn't want to pay the extra money. And if I like playing the new one, then maybe I'll just keep paying, but it's nice to have a free trial run to try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I want to enable LoY on my already existing 2nd account.  But for me, I have to pay for it, and new accounts get it for free.  I wonder if I can use a buddy code to activate LoY on my 2nd account?<br />
<br />
-Barious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haven't gotten the code yet.  Will probably let my son use it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I havent gotten the code yet.  But I'll trade you a buddy code for a WoW beta acct! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't log in WoW from weeks, waiting the PvP server.<br />
<br />
The account belongs to an italian portal so I don't &quot;own&quot; it :)<br />
<br />
And I wonder when damn SOE will send these codes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They're in now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You mean they sent the codes?<br />
<br />
SOMEONE HAS ONE? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Abalieno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks a lot, I got Monjay's code and I finished the newbie dungeon even if I'm confused about what I should do there to finish even the revolt...<br />
<br />
The game is a lot better from the first time I tried, at least the interface and the controls. I need to figure out better how the class works, where I can get new spells and so on.<br />
<br />
But really thanks :)</div></div><hr />
