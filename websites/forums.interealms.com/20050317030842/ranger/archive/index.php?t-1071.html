<br />
Lately I have been hunting in Velks lab.  If you can get a village, uppers, pit, or castle (a friend 60 enc and I love starting groups for castle) the exp here is madness.  But otherwise the zone is jam packed and you get a mob every 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Today I took my druid friend along with me to WW to try our hand at fear kitting.  All was well until we got a wolf add,  but we used a comb o of root/fear mezing it until the mammoth was down.  But then while I was running around looking for a good pull spot she was agroed by an Ice Burrower (she was at SG zone) and died.  While she was recruiting a cleric I was running around familiarizing myself with the zone, I found DN and ToV in some huge canyon type things. Well...<br />
<br />
Well, to cut to the chase, where is a decent spot to pull to with minimal adds.  I am a 53 ranger, decent gear, kindly to CoV.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I kill in DN gorge for quick zoning in case of trouble and so i don't train people that are sittin in the SG cave.  If you pull stuff to the northern ledge in the gorge about 100 yards east of the DN portal, you will never, ever get adds and there is a little spot where they get stuck and you dont have to chase them, Thanks VI crappy pathing!</div></div><hr />
