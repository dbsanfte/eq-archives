<br />
What exactly do you think this means?<br />
<br />
[u]Slot 1: Frenzy Radius <br />
 Lull Frenzy Radius(15/30)  <br />
 Lull Animal Frenzy Radius(15/30)  <br />
 Numb the Dead Frenzy Radius(15/30)  <br />
 Harmony of Nature Frenzy Radius(15/65)  <br />
 Soothe Frenzy Radius(10/40)  <br />
 Calm Frenzy Radius(5/50)  <br />
 Calm Animal Frenzy Radius(5/50)  <br />
 Wake of Tranquility Frenzy Radius(1/60)  <br />
 Pacification Frenzy Radius(1/65)  <br />
 Rest the Dead Frenzy Radius(1/45)  <br />
 Pacify Frenzy Radius(1/55)  <br />
<br />
Slot 2: Reaction Radius <br />
 Lull Animal Reaction Radius(25/30)  <br />
 Numb the Dead Reaction Radius(25/30)  <br />
 Lull Reaction Radius(15/30)  <br />
 Harmony of Nature Reaction Radius(15/65)  <br />
 Soothe Reaction Radius(10/40)  <br />
 Calm Animal Reaction Radius(10/50)  <br />
 Calm Reaction Radius(5/50)  <br />

 Pacification Reaction Radius(1/65)  <br />
 Rest the Dead Reaction Radius(1/45)  <br />
 Pacify Reaction Radius(1/55)  <br />
<br />
Also, historically, Harmony was changeed from:<br />
10-21 11:05  Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Reaction Radius(15)&quot; to &quot;Reaction Radius(15/40)&quot; <br />
10-21 11:05 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Frenzy Radius(15)&quot; to &quot;Frenzy Radius(15/40)&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">(XX/YY) <br />
<br />
XX = radius<br />
YY = max level mob affected</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foreststalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can someone clarify something for me?  Does the new harmony spell use Charisma?  Because I have seen that I can harmony giants in Plane of Storms and the crystal golems in Plane of Valor, but can't harmony mobs such as obsolete and arachaic models in Plane of Innovation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cha only effects your chance of argo if it's resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i believe one of these two values is the new aggro disance if &lt;b&gt;a player&lt;/b&gt; comes near harmonied mob.<br />
and the other figure would be the &lt;b&gt;add&lt;/b&gt; distance, if an aggroed mob comes near harmonied mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Locz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Feeldary, I was think that too.<br />
<br />
Anyways, comparing these two:<br />
Harmony of Nature Frenzy Radius(15/65) <br />
and<br />
Pacification Frenzy Radius(1/65) <br />
<br />
Why is Pacification so much better (smaller radius)?  Why do paladins get a better spell (Pacification) than rangers (Harmony of Nature)?  Isn't that a switcheroo, compared to pre-PoP.<br />
<br />
Finally, if Harmony of Nature is resisted, are we supposed to get a resist message?  I have had HoN fail 3/3 times on golems in the PoI factory with no resist message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The second number is the level of the mob, see Harmony for verification (15/40, level capped at level 40 mobs according to experiences). <br />
<br />
As for why the paladin form is &quot;better&quot;, it isn't. Paladins don't get Pacification, it is Clerics and Enchanters only. In addition, it saves vs MR directly, while HoN saves at -10 so we'll get fewer resists. Finally, it is a level 65 spell, it should be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pre-PoP (possibly pre-Kunark) paladins had calm, which at 5 is a smaller radius than Harmony, so no switcheroo there.<br />
<br />
How did you know you were getting resisted, if you didn't get a message?  Immediate aggro?  Or unexpected aggro after a pull?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Locz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe paladins do get Pacify, and it works very well, just like the indoor-Harmony we always wanted : http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=17320.topic<br />
<br />
And here's the spell description:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Locz, you were comparing HoN to Pacification, not Pacify. They get Pacify, but it is lower level capped and doesn't get the save penalty. They do not get Pacification, which is Cleric and Enchanter only. Pacify is not a superior spell, just different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>flagellants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Most lull spells have 3 efects, reduction of frenzy , reaction radius and pascify. Harmony and harmony of nature dont have pacify. What is the effect pacify, what does it do?<br />
<br />
Pacification <br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Frenzy Radius(1/65) <br />
2:  Reaction Radius(1/65) <br />
3:  Pacify <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruvane Hammerfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm so glad to find this thread!  I have been wondering about this myself for a long time.<br />
<br />
So, just for clarification Feeldary, what you are saying it that for proximity agro to work, with HoN you would only need to come withing 15 feet, but with Pacification that would be reduced to 1, and to agro another mob, the mob being pulled could almost walk right over another without a problem with Pacification, but not with HoN?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Renwin Everfool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pacify is on the Atone line of spells...reduces agro until total wipe (if no resists)...a mem blur, but very crappy.<br />
<br />
And, yes..Frenzy radius is how far out the agro range extends from the mob. Reaction radius is the mob's  &quot;help&quot; radius (adds).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hrmmm...  If 40 is the level, that doesn't quite make much sense.  From using Harmony of Nature in HoH, BoT, and Tactics, it seems to work on lvl 65 and below mobs.  The description above would have it labeled as level 40 mobs.<br />
<br />
Also note that every lvl 66 and above mob I've tried to harmony, i get the &quot;Your target looks unaffected&quot; message.</div></div><hr />

Harmony is level 40, HoN is level 65.</div></div><hr />
