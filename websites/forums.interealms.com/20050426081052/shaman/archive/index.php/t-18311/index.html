<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in an RP guild and one of the things that you must do is write your background history for any character that you are guilding.  The following is the begining of that for three of my alts:<br />
<br />
There is a tome tucked away in the library of the Plane of Knowledge, it is hidden among the least interesting and most mundane of subjects analyzing the correct and proper etiquette in addressing the Nobility of the Combine Empire.  The tomes have been left alone for many years, all save one, that keeps getting &quot;misplaced&quot; here to be forgotten as all the others.<br />
<br />
The book is small, about the size of an grown man's palm, and plain with no adornment, though it is made of fine leather and parchment.  On the spine of the book etched in the leather, is the title &quot;The Oathtakers&quot;<br />
<br />
In a tight orderly script, the etiquette of taking a formal oath is described, some where however, about two thirds of the way down the page, a prophecy begins with the words <br />
<br />
&quot;Years will pass between the turning of the first star and the last, and the dark one will think he has won, but when the final star turns to a blood red hue, the War of the Oathtakers has begun.  <br />
<br />
One will be strong of the northern clime, the other a child of the rain, the third born of privilege will forsake it in time, when property is brought to life...&quot; <br />
<br />
The passage is immediately followed with the correct phrasing of allegiance to the King depending on rank and relationship.  In the margin of the book is a date some 17 years in the past, and the words &quot;The first Oathtaker has been born&quot;.  <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Sinead grabbed the hilt of her axe and pulled the weapon from the door jam of yet another inn in Freeport. Her anger was seething visibly in her eyes and across her features.  Behind her was a human woman quickly gathering together what little property she could call her own, and a decapitated body of what appeared to be a man slumped on the floor in a pool of blood.    <br />
    <br />
&quot;Hurry up&quot; barked the barbarian at the woman who appeared skittish and frail.  &quot;I didn't just save ye from that slaver for ye to get us both captured and sold by Sir Lucan and his friends.&quot;    <br />
    <br />
The former slave's eyes grew wide at the name of Sir Lucan, but the mention of the man achieved its aim, and the two were quickly out of the inn, and into the streets heading for the gates that lead to the desert of Ro.    <br />
    <br />
&quot;Where are you taking me&quot; the woman frantically whispered.  &quot;This isn't the way to my home, I am from a farming family on the plains of Karana, we should not be going this way.  You are selling me again aren't you?&quot;  The last was the suspicion of the slave who had already been through the hands of three slavers, in the two nights since her farm had been raided and she was taken from her bed in the night.    <br />
    <br />
&quot;And I make my home in the Southern desert of Ro. We go there, and then when it is safe we take ye home through the swamps and then the mountains.&quot;  <br />
  <br />
Sinead paused for a brief moment letting the slave see the truth in her words before she continued, &quot;Or do ye wish to pass right by the Halls of the Freeport Militia on the way out of town?&quot;    <br />
    <br />
The Freeport militia had taken 'tribute' already from the slave on her way into the city for allowing the slaver's 'property', one female human slave, into the city.  The slaver had laughed at her as she told the guards that she had been kidnapped from her home and her family, and pleaded for her return home.  <br />
    <br />
&quot;But, pretty lady&quot; the guard has sneered at her as he looked over the slavers proof of 'ownership', and then roughly lifted the woman's face, making sure that the 'identifying features' matched the sales receipt in his hands, &quot;this man bought you for 79 platinum pieces, I couldn't be stealing his property on the word of a slave, now could I?&quot;    <br />
    <br />
Thinking about passing near that building, and paying again for the privilege of being allowed to live, with the only currency she possessed, her flesh, pushed all thoughts of returning home that way out of the girls mind.  Without further objection she followed after the northern woman, struggling to keep pace with the warrior's stride.    <br />
  <br />
The slave didn't know why this towering barbarian had crashed through the door to the room she had been sharing with the slaver, but she was grateful to be free of him.  He hadn't abused her himself, claiming that she would fetch a better price the less 'used' that she was.  Amazingly, she had been better prepared to deal with being fondled and leered at by the militia, then his cold calculating concern for his property.  To him, she was a chair, no more no less, and she would be worth more with less dings, scratches and dents.  <br />
  <br />
What she knew of Sinead was that this woman was searching for another slaver.  After the barbarian woman had forced her way into the room at the inn she had asked questions, and her captor had apparently did not have the information that warrior seeked. The barbarian had swiftly decapitated the man with her sword, after he answered the questions she had posed him. It had taken just one swing of that sword, and the man's head had come off cleanly, and rolled sickeningly under the bed, eyes wide in shock.  The brutality and strength of this woman confused Elhona, for that was the girls name.  She was in awe of the larger woman, but she was terrified of her too.  <br />
  <br />
The warrior raised her hand in silent warning, pulling up close against the wall as they approached the gates, and Elhona was forced back into the moment and the danger that she was still in.  Dread hit her when she noticed that there were three guards in militia uniforms by the gates.  Slowly bile began to creep up the back of her throat, as fear began to make her physically sick.      <br />
    <br />
Sinead however calmly nodded to a young adventurer she had paid to require 'help' from those guarding the path into the city as she wished to exit unseen.  The young teenage warrior, who had been killing orcs, slowly began to draw in more and more orcs closer and closer to the gates, until the guards were forced to abandon their post and help defend the city.  <br />
    <br />
Once she was sure that all the guards were occupied with the disturbance, the two women exited the gates, giving the guards and the orcs wide berth, feigning fear, on the part of the warrior and showing fear on the part of the slave at the battle near the gates.    <br />
  <br />
Ehlona was petrified of the consquences that faced her if she were to be caught attempting to return to the Plains of Karana by herself through Freeport.  The landscape around her quickly changed from the sparse grass to coarse gritty earth and finally to fine sand.  She took on final look at Freeport and the civilization she had come to loath and followed Sinead into the desert of Norther Ro.  She was certain that whatever fate awaited her there could be no worse then if she were captured again and made to pay for her 'crimes' against her former slaver master.  <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Ehlona was hot.  Her feet burned with each step as the sand crunched and shifted beneath them.  Her lips were cracked and swollen, and her tongue felt like sandpaper.  She had never seen so much sand before in her life, and the hazy glimmer of the heat in front of her pushed her to the edges of her sanity. <br />
<br />
With each step, she struggled to keep up with the pace that Sinead set, but she found that she needed to take three steps for every two that the tall warrior took.  The former slave never once thought to ask for Sinead to slow her pace, both out of fear of those behind her, and the general fear of repercussions for ever admitting weakness that went along with being a slave, even if only for a short while. Finally, the smaller woman could walk no more, and she lost her footing, stumbling on the crest of a sand dune, and slipping down to the bottom and into delirium. <br />
<br />
She heard a harsh accented voice of a woman, the warrior, her mind dully thought, whose back she had been following for what seemed like a century, and her name being called out in the distance.  She felt herself being lifted and slowly swaying back in forth like a her mother used to rock her when she was a child, but this time she was curiously half upside down, and she couldn't get the tangy smell of sweat, salt and metal out of her nose. <br />
<br />
Much later, though she could not understand how she knew that it was not but a moment, Ehlona felt the motion stop, and she felt herself gently laid down into the sand.  The heat was more bearable now as the sun had set and the cold desert night had begun.  Ehlona opened her eyes slowly and tried to focus on her surroundings, but all she saw was the blurred form of the woman with impossibly large calloused hands moistening a cloth from her backpack with water from a canteen,  and as her eyes closed again, she felt the cool moist towel first on her forehead, and then caressing her face, and finally over her lips where she sucked until the cloth was as dry as the sand below her. <br />
<br />
Ehlona tossed and turned fitfully in her sleep. She was in the tundra, lost and freezing in the snow.  Her hands and feet were numb from the cold, and she felt the icy hot burning all along her body as she shivered in the cold.  Her mind however rebelled against the sensations that she was feeling.  They were somehow wrong as the woman was sure that she had been hot, so unbearably hot just a little while ago. <br />
<br />
Then Ehlona felt the warmth of a northern woolen blanket gently wrapped around her.  Anyone that has felt a northern blanket knows, without ever looking that the impossibly lightweight material, incredible soft and warm, that it can only come from those whose hands and bodies know the cold, and what a soul needs to survive it.  She heard a clear high northern voice singing nearby, and she marveled at the crystal beauty of it that reminded her of the sparkle of freshly fallen snow.  <br />
<br />
Slowly, Ehlona's breathing became the peaceful, even cadence of  child sleeping in her mother's arms.  And she dreamed of ice and snow, and mountains that reached into the heavens high above the clouds. <br />
 <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Warm water was being trickled into Ehlona's mouth and down her throat.  The dry cracked lips barely recognized the feeling of moisture as a few drops escaped her mouth and fell on her sand encrusted face.<br />
<br />
The heat was oppressive already, and the sun had barely risen in the sky.  Opening her eyes, Ehlona again saw the impossibly large hands of the northern woman Sinead, as she kneeled next to her gently cradling her behind the neck, and lifter her head so that she could drink.<br />
<br />
Ehlona tired to say &quot;Thank you&quot; but all that passed her lips was a dry croak, before the northern woman shushed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye need to save yer strength,&quot; Sinead commanded her.  &quot;There will be time enough for talk once we are out of the desert and into my home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ehlona nodded slightly and stopped trying to thank Sinead.  For the second time, in twice as many moons, the northern woman had saved her life, and she was quite in awe of her now, especially considering how gently and carefully she was being taken care of by her right now.  <br />
<br />
Her mind went back to the impossibly loud clang of Sinead's axe hitting the door jam just the day before and she found it hard to fathom that the warrior who took off her slavers head with one easy motion could also be so soft in her touch of one as weak as herself.<br />
<br />
Ehlona lifted her head of her own accord and pushed her self to her side and her elbows.  She wanted to show that she was not entirely a weakling, and a small smile passed her lips as she was able to slowly come to her knees facing the warrior before her.<br />
<br />
Ehlona bowed her head in subservience to the woman before her.  And to her surprise, the northern woman gently reached under her chin, and lifted her face, so that Ehlona's eyes met her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye'll be nobody's slave, ye hear.  I won't be letting ye do that no more. Ye are yer own person, and ye will stand strong when yer able.&quot;<br />
<br />
And again the fierceness of her voice surprised Ehlona.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Ehlona was able to whisper, and Sinead knew exactly what she meant even thought the question was not complete.<br />
<br />
Why did she save her?  Why did she care so much?  Why did she come after the slaver?<br />
<br />
All of these and more why's passed between the two women on their knees in the desert.<br />
<br />
Sinead broke eye contact first, and her voice went quiet and almost inaudible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was five when they killed my mother and father in the plains of Karana.  There is no such thing as an orphan in my clan, only those that belong to all.  I am the sister to all, the daughter to all, and the granddaughter to all, but I will never be a mother or a wife to any in my clan.  For that I must go elsewhere, though that matters little to me.  <br />
<br />
I remember that my mother had sent me into a small copse of trees to gather kindling for our evening fire when I heard their screams.  I was frightened, and I stopped just within the shelter of the underbrush while I watched my father and mother trying to fight off many, many men.  <br />
<br />
They beheaded my mother in front of my eyes, my father took a sword to the back.  My brother, I last saw took a blow to the head, and was draped over a horse like no more then a sack of flour.<br />
<br />
My uncle found me later the next day,  with my mother's head in my lap, and my father beside me.  The men went looking for my brother, but the trail was cold once they reached the city of Quenos.  My brother had been taken aboard a slaving ship headed for Paneel, and the heretics that live there.  <br />
<br />
I vowed to find him.  The trail has lead many places, but always it comes back to Freeport, and the slavers that reside here.<br />
<br />
I heard that he was with yer master, or one who knew him.  But again, nothing, always nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sinead stood up abruptly, and reached down to help Ehlona the rest of the way to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will break camp, and we will move again, soon.  Ye can walk for a bit, but even if ye need my help to carry ye, we will be in the Halls of Last Exodus this night, and ye can get yer strength back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ehlona only nodded, tears clouding her eyes, and a new resolve in her spirit.<br />
<br />
Turning back towards Freeport, Ehlona whispered into the wind.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will destroy you.  And you will pay for their lives, and for my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sinead nodded to herself, as she wrapped up her northern blanket, and placed it in her pack along with her other possessions.  The oath of the Karana woman, slight in comparison to her, would join her own, made many moons ago, her mothers blood fresh on her hands.  <br />
<br />
These were oaths that the women intended to keep, and the gods knew it, as soon as the wind carried them to their ears, so many years apart.  <br />
 <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
A scribe in the Plane of knowledge, studied the heavens, that eve.  He nodded, as he watched noticed the change there, when a second star shined with a new red light, directly next to another star, that had begun to glow with the same red intensity seasons before.<br />
<br />
The scribe walked over to a little used area in the libray and removed a small forgotten tome.  Taking pen to paper, the scribe added one simple line to the margin below another annotation.<br />
<br />
&quot;The second oathtaker had been born&quot;.<br />
<br />
He nodded to himself, and dated the annotation.<br />
Solemnly he closed the book, returning it to the stack, and wondered, when would come the third.  <br />
 <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Estoria and Nina giggled as they ran through the courtyard of Estoria's parent's manor home.  The two blonde girls with their hair in ringlets could have easily been mistaken for sisters, their perfect features with button noses and brilliant blue eyes were so similar.  They wore sturdy play dresses, and it was clear that they enjoyed each others company.<br />
<br />
Nina, who was obviously older then Estoria sat the smiling girl down on the courtyard bench in front of her, and began to brush and then braid Estoria's thick hair into an intricate design that befitted a princess.<br />
<br />
It was this, and other subtle differences that if one examined the two closely that showed the differences in the two girls stations in life.<br />
<br />
Both wore clean and functional dresses that were made to take the wear and tear of little girls play well, but Nina's was unadorned with simple stitching and pockets.  Estoria's was made of a beautiful blue the hue of her eyes.  It was embroidered too, with tiny forget-me-nots of a slightly less brilliant blue shade.<br />
<br />
Nina's hands were clean, though there were calluses on them, and her arms were strong from work.  Estroia's hands were soft and delicate, and her arms though firm, held little strength, other then to carry her dolls.<br />
<br />
And Nina's hair was always in a simple single braid down her back.  Never did one see her with the loops and frills and ribbons that the older girl now put in Estoria's hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to come to the party too Nina!  Please!&quot;  Estoria whined in the voice that ever little girl uses when trying to get her way.<br />
<br />
Nina shook her head, and replied &quot;You know that I am not allowed to go, your father already said.  And besides he want to to pay extra special attention to Baron Rathmichael's daughters while they are here, and not waste your time playing with the likes of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the Baron's girls hate me! They take my toys and break them on purpose, and they call me names and say that I am ugly.  They make me cry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina bent down and kissed the top of Estoria's head, and whispered in her ear, &quot;If you are very good, and you make your father very proud of you, I will give you a very special surprise tomorrow when it is time for your lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; Estoria whine looking up into Nina's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhhhhhh&quot; Nina said and put her fingers to her lips, as the loud sound of the newly arrived guests made its way into the courtyard.<br />
<br />
Nina stood up, and took one step back behind Estoria, as the group made its way across towards the two.  Nina bowed her head down, being careful not to look any of the new guests in the face, and waited quietly until they passed.<br />
<br />
But the group did not pass on, as she expected.  Instead she heard the party stop directly in front of Estoria and herself, and a deep harsh voice asked, &quot;Are these beautiful girls both yours Ethel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina heard a small chuckle and then Estoria's mother saying &quot;Heavens no!  Estoria come here my dear and met your father's newest business associate, Mr Collins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Estoria shyly took a step forward, and curtseyed expertly to Nina's relief, and answered in her most charming voice &quot; I am please to met you sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then who, is this other girl&quot;  the harsh voice demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Nina?  She is just one of the servants.  Estoria's nanny and playmate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina almost gasped in surprise as her face was lifted roughly, and she was forced to look into the cruelest eyes she has ever seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;She will bring a fair price in the future Ethel.  Just a few more years, and this one will fetch a pretty penny within the docking district.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina's eyes began to water and she tried desperately to fight back the tears that were forming from the humiliation and the pain.  Just as abruptly as the man grabbed her face, he let it go, and Nina breathed a sigh of relief as the party continued on into the manor house.<br />
<br />
Ethel stopped just before they entered the house, &quot;Nina, please be sure that Esotria is presentable for dinner within the hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina nodded, and took Estoria's hand leading the younger girl into another section in the house to dress her for dinner.  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Flowers of every possible variety decorated the main hall sending a sweet heady aroma to even the furthest corners of the manor home.  The household servants bustled with countless task and impossible chores to be completed by the end of the week, when Estoria would be presented into society, an exquisite young woman of sixteen.<br />
<br />
Nina, who could be argued an even more beautiful woman, would herself turn eighteen in less then three weeks, but there would be no fanfare marking the occasion, except of course, the present that would appear outside her room, sometime in the wee hours from Estoria.  The gifts were always perfect.  Not overly ostentatious, but exactly a thing that Nina would cherish, like the one that she received on her own sixteenth birthday.<br />
<br />
Nina had awoken that morning to find a simple wooden box.  The box had little ornamentation, but it was made of the finest craftsmanship Nina had ever seen.  It was polished to the most satiny finish, and there was but a single inlay in the top.  It was a wild desert rose.  Nina had been touched beyond words, for Estoria had, for quite sometime, called Nina a wild desert rose, rare and beautiful, strong and unexpected, a beauty that should not be, given the circumstances in which it lived.<br />
<br />
Oddly Nina never felt bitter when it came to the pampering and privilege that Estoria received.  Estoria could have been a spoiled selfish, self-indulgent brat, like Baron Rathmichael's girls, but she was not.  She was caring and considerate, her temperament every bit as beautiful as her features.  So Nina more then any other of the servants, was diligently working to ensure the Estoria's birthday would be one that she remembered as perfect.<br />
<br />
Nina was arranging a large bouquet of exotic flowers gathered specially in the Plane of Growth in the main hall when she heard the voice of Mr. Collins in the foyer.  She cringed inwardly as he had begun to make her more and more uncomfortable since her first encounter with him, leering at her openly in public, and groping her whenever they happened to pass one another in the halls.  He had thus far not crossed the boundaries of his station above her, but her had freely fondled her breasts over the top of her clothing , and pulled her closely kneading her buttocks through her dress.  Nina suffered these humiliations in silence, trusting that Estoria would not allow them to go any further.<br />
<br />
Nina felt safe this afternoon, however since she was only one of many in the main hall preparing for the feast, and she was sure that Mr Collins would do nothing more then look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina,&quot; she heard Estoria's father calling to her, &quot;Please come over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dread washed over Nina, but she immediately put down the flowers she was working on, and went to her master as directed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina, Estoria has asked that you be the one that prepares her for her Birthday feast, she also wishes that you and all the other servants be allowed to attend for her presentation and her announcement.  You are all to be fitted for an appropriate uniform for the occasion.  See to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Relief washed over Nina, and she answered &quot;Yes, sir&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may return to your task then.&quot;  her master instructed, and Nina again answered with a &quot;Yes sir.&quot; and began to walk away.<br />
<br />
She heard a muffled whisper as Mr Collins leaned into her master and asked a question of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina, wait a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again despair washed over Nina, as she paused and turned back around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you are done preparing Estoria for the celebration, Mr Collins will require your help in his guest quarters. You are to attend to his needs before you come down for the presentation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot; Nina answered trying hard not to sound as panicked as she felt, and she returned to her flower arranging pale, and shaken.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Estoria had made one request of her father for her birthday, that she be given the lives of 10 of the household slaves of her choosing.  Normally a portion of the household would be part of her dowry, but she requested this small token number early, as she would be attending school outside of the manor home, and she wished to take these servants with her, or that is what she said to him.  <br />
<br />
Her father of course could not deny such a reasonable request and promised that her mother would provide her a complete list of all the household servants on her birthday, and before her party she could choose which ones she wished to take with her.<br />
<br />
Estoria was thrilled, Nina would have the best present for her own birthday this year, for Estoria planned to not only take her with her to school, but to free her from her bondage and grant her the status of life and not property.<br />
<br />
Estoria hugged her father impetuously, forgetting all decorum for a moment, and ran off to find her mother.<br />
<br />
Ethel, Estoria's mother was a plain woman, with pale blonde hair and watery eyes.  She was not remarkable in anyway, and it was apparent that Estoria resembled her father.  She was, as always, working on her needlepoint, a task that Estoria though good at, loathed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother, father has granted my request to transfer ownership of 10 servants to me for my birthday, in preparation of my leaving for school.  He asked that you provide me a list of all servants on the eve of my birthday, so that he can present them to me at my party.&quot;<br />
<br />
No emotion crossed Ethel's face, and Estoria waited patiently, while her mother's fingers deftly worked at her embroidery.  Estoria waited for twenty minutes in silence at her mother's feet, before Ethel put down her needlework, and replied to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are sure this is what you want?&quot;  Ethel asked her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am.  It would make me feel more comfortable knowing that the servants who serve me are loyal to our family.&quot;  Estoria answered her mother trying to compose her voice to be as emoitionless in her reply as her mother's was.<br />
<br />
Ethel nodded once in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your father requested that you be presented with a list of all our household servants on your birthday?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Again Ethal nodded once in reply.  Picking up her needlework again, to show that the audiance was over, Ethel simply stated &quot;It will be done exactly as your father requested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Estoria kissed her mother cooly on the forehead as she stood to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you ma'am.&quot; she said as she quickly left her mother's chambers.  <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Estoria looked absolutely radiant.  Her dress was made of a gossamer blue fabric of an exceptionally fine weave that was intricately embroidered with small sapphire gems the exact shade of her eyes.  Nina had taken special care with Esotria's hair and the result was exquisite.  There were tiny gems that sparkled in the light, giving the over all appearance the Estoria had just descended from the heavens bringing down the stars with her.<br />
<br />
It was only thirty minutes before the presentation, and Nina was putting the finishing touches on her charge when Ethel entered the room.  Estoria smiled broadly, and turned to Nina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that I am ready now, you should go ahead and change into your clothes for this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress.&quot; Nina answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you are done Nina,&quot; Ethel stopped her before she retreated from the room, &quot;I think you have another task to attend to before the reception.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blood drained from Nina's face, and she only nodded, unable to speak as she rushed out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What task does Nina have to do before the party, Ma'am? I requested her services of Father today,&quot; Estoria questioned her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it is no matter, it is but a small task, and you need not worry about it.&quot; Ethel replied in her usual emoitionless voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother where is the list of servants so that I may choose the 10 and present father with them before the party?&quot;  Estoria asked looking for the servant who was supposed to prepare the list and not seeing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The list will be given to you at the party my dear, I am sure that you already have a good idea of who you would choose.&quot; Ethel dismissed the question as insignificant.<br />
<br />
Estoria smiled at her mother and replied, &quot;Oh, I do think that I know who I would like to take with me, but I do not think you want me to take the head cook and leave your kitchen in a state of chaos!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethel did not seem to hear the jest at all, and looking directly into her daughters eyes she stated, &quot;I hope you enjoy your party, and my gift to you my daughter.  I am not sure that you will understand or appreciate it now, but in the years to come, I hope you will realize the necessity of it, and that I truly gave this to you, to free you from the burden of someone else's indiscretions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Puzzled, Estoria took a sealed scroll that her mother pressed into her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I open it now Ma'am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no dear, you should open it when you have received your father's gift. as it goes hand and hand with the choices you have to make tonight,&quot;<br />
and with that Ethel Kissed her daughters forehead cooly, and left the room.  <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Nina hurried along the guest quarters to the rooms where Mr. Collins was needing her assistance.  Fear filled consumed her, but she repeated over and over to herself that Estoria would not allow him to hurt her, and she was able to keep the fear from over taking her.<br />
<br />
She knocked softly at the chamber door, hoping that Mr. Collins was not in need of her after all, and that he had already made his way to the reception hall, but the door was opened immediately by Mr Collins.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been waiting for you, it would not do for you to keep me waiting in the future&quot; Mr Collins sniped at her harshly as he roughly pulled her into the chamber and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Nina looked down at her feet, and apologized quickly, &quot;I am sorry sir, I cam as soon as Estoria dismissed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A cruel laugh escaped Mr. Collins' lips at Nina's response.  &quot;Of course, but that won't be a problem in the future.  No, not at all now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me sir?  I don't understand what you mean?&quot; Nina said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you will my dear, you will.&quot; Mr Collins forced Nina to lift her face to meet his eyes, once again painfully grabbing her below the chin as he did on the first occasion they met.<br />
<br />
&quot;I own you now,&quot; Mr Collins spoke slowly to emphasize every word.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I own every inch,&quot; he continued as he pulled her closer and slipped his hand down the front of her bodice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I own ever curve.&quot; he said as her squeezed her bare breast so hard that Nina gasped in pain, as tears began to fall from her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I own you.&quot; He said once again, as he watched Nina flinch at the words, and he released her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gather your things.  Your former Mistress wants nothing left when you leave with me this evening.  I expect you here.&quot; and he pointed at the bed, &quot;With your things, waiting for me when I return. You will not be attending Estoria's party, and I will not be very late.  Just long enough to show my respects, and then I will be returning to attend to my own,&quot; he paused searching for the appropriate word, &quot;entertainment for the evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Collins pushed past Nina as she sunk down to the floor sobbing silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would stay,&quot; he said as he opened the door to leave, &quot;but I do need to thank Ethel for her business, and of course, the wait will only add to my enjoyment, don't you think?&quot; <br />
<br />
Nina cringed as the door shut behind him.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Estoria waited in a sitting room adjacent to the main Hall to be announced.  Her mother had joined her once again, as had her father.  Most of the guest had arrived and it was but a few moments before she was to be presented that Marcus, the head of the household's servants arrived with the list that Estoria had requested.<br />
<br />
Estoria had already picked the names of the ten servants she wanted to attend to her at school.  There was Marcus's son Will, who had been her horsemanship instructor since she was but a tiny tot, and that would mean that Will's wife Emily, a seamstress, and their child Nicole, a general servant would be in the list too.<br />
<br />
There was Grayson, an older butler, whom Estoria loved dearly and who was in need of a lighter charge, and Charles her falconer.  Of these two only Grayson had a family, and only his wife was still with him at the manor house.  She too would be in the number, though she no longer served any true purpose in the family's daily operations.<br />
<br />
There was Michelle, and Veronica, sisters and both cooks in the kitchen, who were Estoria's favorites for both their food, and their temperaments. <br />
<br />
Beth would be the ninth, and was Estoria's dancing and music teacher.  Most of Estoria's happiest memories were of her lessons with Beth.<br />
<br />
And there was of course Nina.  Her constant companion since Nina had joined the family's household when she was four, and Estoria but two.<br />
<br />
Estoria went through the scroll in front of her checking off the names of those she wished to take with her, and looked confused as she got to the bottom.  There were many names on the scroll, and so she began at the top, searching for Nina's name, thinking that she must have missed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marcus,&quot; Estoria asked looking up into the servant's face from the writing desk where she sat.  &quot;There seems to be a name missing from the list.  I can not find Nina's name anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No ma'am, you wouldn't, you asked for all the names of the servants that belong to the house as of today.  Nina no longer is a servant of this house.&quot;  Marcus answered, his cheeks flushed as he was forced to deliver news that he knew would upset Estoria.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean Marcus?&quot;  Estoria looked up into the older man's eyes confused.  <br />
<br />
&quot;She is no longer under our household ma'am, that is all that I know.&quot; Marcus bowed and left Estoria's side for the main reception room.<br />
<br />
Estoria looked across the room to where her Mother and Father sat charging a few more of the servants with some last minute instructions, and noticed that her mother was watching her.  Ethel, looked into her daughters eyes, and then looked down at the list in front of her, and then again looked down to Estoria's purse where the edges of the sealed scroll could be seen.  <br />
<br />
Estoria followed her mother's eyes, and taking the scroll out of her purse looked back up at her mother who nodded once, and turned back to her conversation.<br />
<br />
Estoria broke the seal to the scroll, and began to read a sales receipt dated some six years prior, and in her mother's hand.  The document described the transfer of ownership of one &quot;Nina&quot; from Estoria's mother Ethel to that of Mr Collins, to be delivered this very day, when 'Her services to the education of Estoria are no longer required.'<br />
<br />
Shock crossed over Estoria's face as the fact that Nina had been sold began to sink in.  Estoria stood up and crossed over the room to her parents, concealing none of her emotions. One thought only playing through her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother, why?&quot; Estoria demanded.<br />
<br />
Estoria's mother and father turned to her, confusion on her father's face, and no emotion as usual on the face of her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that you have received my present dear.&quot; Her mother nodded to the unsealed scroll in her daughters hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as for why, I have already told you.  You are now free of someone else's indiscretion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Estoria's father looked from his wife to his daughter, his confusion mirroring that of his daughter's.  He took the scroll from Estoria's hand and read over the sales receipt, comprehension dawning on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You promised Ethel, you promised when she was brought into this house, that she would never be sold,&quot; anger seethed in Estoria's father's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I promised that as long as there was a place her for her as Estoria's teacher, that I would not sell her.  Estoria has no need of her as a teacher anymore.&quot; Ethel's reply was as cool and emotionless as always, but now Estoria saw it for what it was bitter anger, and calculating deceit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you think that I would keep her here as a reminder forever?&quot; Ethel went on staring directly into Estoria's father's eyes.  &quot;There has no been a day that has gone by since Nina has come here, that I do not hear how remarkable is the resemblance between Estoria and Nina.  How many times have they been mistaken for sisters?  And how odd that they both look exactly like you Ethan.  Why would that be, I wonder?&quot;<br />
<br />
Estoria's father looked shocked, and then amazed.  &quot;You stupid fool Ethel!  Nina looks like Estoria and me not because she is my daughter.  She is the result of my father's indiscretion, not my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethel's hand went up to her face, and for the first time in Estoria's memory, she saw her mother's lips tremble, and her eyes begin to tear.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Ethel began weakly, unable to finish, her eyes darting from the face of her daughter, to that of her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never once strayed from our bed until you started refusing me, once Nina came to the house.  I loved you once Ethel, I thought that you knew that.&quot;  Ethan's voice was sharp like broken glass. and cut Ethel deeply.<br />
<br />
Estoria turned and ran from the room.  She didn't care what passed between her parents anymore.  She just had to stop Mr. Collins from leaving with Nina.  She would buy her back at one thousand times the amount that he had paid for if she had to, but she would buy her back, and then she would be free.<br />
<br />
Mr. Collins' room was empty when she arrived there, and Estoria stopped and thought.  Maybe Nina hadn't gotten here yet, she had only dismissed her  under an hour ago.  Maybe Nina was still in her own quarters.<br />
<br />
Nina's door was ajar, when Estoria got there, and Nina was at the unfinished plank table with her finely made wooden box in front of her, her head down on her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Nina!&quot;  Estoria cried rushing over to her, thankful that her friend was still here, and had not yet gone with Mr. Collins.  <br />
<br />
But Nina didn't answer, and Estoria reached out to Nina to find her unconscious and the beginnings of a note to herself, underneath her friends arm.<br />
<br />
Estoria,<br />
<br />
I am sorry but I am not strong enough to go with him.  I can not let him take me, though I know that I belong to him now.  They only way that I can stop him is in death, and I choose that over life as his whore.  <br />
<br />
I know that if I were a true friend I would go with him, and suffer until I am out of your house, but I just can not.  I am sorry that I was not able to be there for your birthday.  I wanted to be able to give you a wonderful party as a gift.<br />
<br />
<br />
The words towards the end were not easily read, as whatever poison Nina had taken had been quickly taking effect.  <br />
<br />
Estoria sank to her knees tears streaming down her face, the words &quot;No, No, I was to free you!&quot; running over and over in her mind as she laid her head in Nina's lap, and the pen from Nina's hand clattered to the floor.<br />
<br />
Ethan found her there, still crying and he gently picked up his daughter from the floor.  Holding her, he whispered into her ear, &quot;I will try to see if the temple can help her, but she has to want to come back, and I just do not know that her spirit will return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan let Estoria go, and looked directly into his daughter's eyes before he continued, &quot;But I will do all that I can to try.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Carefully, he leaned down, and took Nina's limp form from her chair.  The resemblance between the two was striking, and Nina wondered how she had not questioned it before.  Ethan kissed his sister's brow, and headed out to find a priest.<br />
<br />
Estoria took both the wooden box and the note with her before she followed her father out, still dressed like a goddess, for a party she would not attend.  <br />
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Nina did not wake up.  She did not die either, but stayed in a perpetual slumber, where she would toss and turn whimpering over and over again how she was sorry, so very sorry.<br />
<br />
Estoria had her clothes sent from the manor house to the Temple, where she did not move from her friends side for the 19 days that passed between her own birthday, and that of Nina's.<br />
<br />
Once, her mother had tried to come down and talk to her, but she never got more then her daughter's name before Estoria's glare drove her from the room and the temple.  Her father she tolerated only slightly better, for she blamed him for not confiding in her mother his relationship with Nina, instead of assuming she knew the truth.<br />
<br />
Assumptions, that was the problem that brought Estoria to Nina's side, as she slept in fitful dreams.  Assumptions and bondage.  Estoria's mind solidified around these concepts as she watched Nina, and it became more and more apparent that her aunt would not recover, and if she did, that she would most likely never completely be herself.<br />
<br />
Estoria woke early, on Nina's birthday.  She knew that this year, even after all that had passed, that she needed to make this birthday matter to Nina, and she somehow would make up for the pain of the last few weeks, and the damage that was done.  <br />
<br />
Kissing Nina on the cheek, Estoria closed a parchment into Nina's sleeping hand, and whispered to her a simple phrase, &quot;Nina, you are free.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small smile crossed Nina's features in her sleep, and her breathing became peaceful and quiet.  Estoria was certain that Nina's soul had heard her and felt the bonds release.<br />
 <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Estoria, turned and left the temple and headed into an area of town she had rarely been to see a wood elf woman known to her only as Llenx.<br />
<br />
Llenx handed Estoria an ornate jewel encrusted hair pin, and warned her not to cut herself with it, as there was not antidote for the poison that she knew of, and those that found her would not be able to trace the origin of her illness even if there was. It was the same poison that she had given to Nina, when she had found out that she would need to be attending to Mr Collins three weeks before, and Estoria found comfort in that.<br />
<br />
When Estoria left the tavern she met Llenx in, she quickly went to a more wealthy, but still notorious area of town.  It was the den of the slavers, and smugglers, or at least those that made their money off the backs of them.  She knocked on a bleak yet ostentatious door, and old and sourly manservant answered eyeing her suspiciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot;  The servant answered unpleasantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish to see Mr Collins, it is about repayment for a slave that he bought, but that was 'damaged' before she could be delivered.&quot; Estoria gritted her teeth through the last, but the manservant did not notice the distaste for the words she chose, and he showed her to a receiving room that was equally as dark, and stern.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who shall I say is calling?&quot; the servant asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Estoria, will be all the name that he needs.&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
Estoria fingered the sharp dagger like comb that held her hair in its place, taking special care not to prick herself with it while she waited.  She had dressed in her most provocative, yet appropriate dress, hoping that her anger would enable her to complete her ruse.<br />
<br />
She did not have to wait long, as the manservant returned quickly and requested that she follow him into the Mr. Collin's private study.  The servant knocked once, and opened the heavy door to a room with many odd assortments of knives and daggers, animal pelts and bones.  It was the study of a person who liked the more morbid and painful side of life, and it was just as Estoria imagined Mr. Collins would have.<br />
<br />
The servant left quickly closing the door behind him, and Estoria crossed the room towards the desk where Mr. Collins was seated, steeling herself for the coming charade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Estoria, it is so very good to see you.&quot;  Mr Collins said in his most pleasant and oilily voice. &quot;I only wish that it were among better circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
Estoria nodded curtly, and boldly moved in next to Mr. Collins,  leaning into him and offering her hand to be kissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is a shame, but I come to rectify that I hope.  I come to see if there is possibly a replacement that can be sent?&quot;  Estoria remained close as she said this hoping that she was subtle enough, and yet forward enough that Mr Collins would think her but a foolish young girl whom he could manipulate into promising something she would not want to keep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I am sure that there could be no replacement.&quot;  Mr. Collins stated softly caressing Estoria's cheek.  &quot;You see, Nina was really but a replacement for one already, one of such soft beauty and nobility, that I dare never ask for the privilege of spending a night with her, let alone it be granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Estoria looked down into the cruel eyes of the man who caused Nina to attempt to kill herself, and whispered softly, &quot;But how do you know, if you never ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Collins stood up, and brushed against Estoria's body in doing so.  He lifted her face, his eyes consumed with lust and asked &quot;One night, and the debt will be paid, I ask but one night with you Estoria.&quot;<br />
<br />
Estoria looked up into his eyes, &quot;Of course Mr Collins, that would be fair.&quot; and she took one of his hands in her hair, while she went to remove the comb with the other.    Mr. Collins pulled his hand away in surprise, as the comb cut him slightly, only a pinprick, but deep enough that it drew blood.<br />
<br />
Estoria continued to let her hair down, and she apologized for the cut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mr. Collins,&quot; she feigned surprise, &quot;I am so sorry, I did not realize it was that sharp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is but a scratch,' he whispered back as he took his other hand and began to stroke her now freed hair, and bent down to kiss her fervently.<br />
<br />
Estoria suffered through the kiss for  a long moment , and then pulled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I can not come this eve, I must first think of a reason to be away from the manor for a night.  It would be best if it were to be the first night I am to be at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And,&quot; she continued breathlessly, &quot;I would hope that it would not be just one night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Collins nodded, looking down into her eyes, whispering, &quot;Yes, and I think that that wait, will just enhance my excitement.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled her close yet a again, placing his hand on Estoria's bodice, feeling her curves beneath her clothes once again before letting her go.<br />
<br />
Estoria looked flushed, and he assumed it was from the heat of passion, and Mr. Collins smiled as she left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until the night that I leave for school.&quot;  Estoria called over her shoulder as she left the study.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot;  Mr Collins smiled to himself, as he sat back down at his desk, the fast acting poison that Estoria had introduced into his system began to take effect.  &quot;Until that night.&quot;    <br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Estoria did not return to the manor home.  She gathered her things that were at the temple, taking care to wrap Nina's wooden box, and her note in her things, and prepared to leave.<br />
<br />
She went once more to Nina's room, where her aunt slept peacefully, and kissed her brow.<br />
<br />
She sat there silently for a few moments.  before she whispered into Nina's ear.  &quot;He will be dead by morning, but he is just the first.&quot;  Her eyes flashed and her anger flared once again at the thought of all the men and women who were just as guilty of breaking other people as Mr Collins was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised that they will all play.&quot; Estoria whispered, as she left the temple to head to school.  She would learn, she thought how to harness her anger into a weapon, and she would fulfill her oath.&quot;<br />
<br />

In the Plane of Knowledge, the old scribe looked up into the heavens, and gasped at the intensity of the new star that joined the other two burning red in the midnight sky.<br />
<br />
In a shaky hand, he added this script below the other two annotations.  &quot;It has begun.&quot;</div></div><hr />
