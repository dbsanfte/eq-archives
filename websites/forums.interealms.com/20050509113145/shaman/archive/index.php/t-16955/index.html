<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
Couple of quick questions, tried search but nothing to help with these questions.<br />
<br />
Malox<br />
What cures the Malox line? is it just dispell? I have this funny feeling someone told me once RC could cure it.<br />
<br />
Droga<br />
Which mob is the PH for the King? I assume the king spawns in the room underneath/behind the Earth Seer (I know his PH) so if I am correct he is one of the 4-5 in that room.<br />
Is he the first one on the right as I walk in to the room, the one by the bunks?<br />
<br />
Nadox<br />
Do I need it now I have RC? I think not but I still see so many people saying its a must that it has me wondering what I am missing.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

Radiant cure does, and so does dispell.<br />

The oven in back of the room, facing it, ph is the cave lord ro the right of it.<br />

Nadox<br />

I don't have blood of nadox and I do just fine, though I probably should get it.</div></div><hr />

Nadox is well worth getting since it is the only group poison/disease cure there is. Comes in handy for a few select encounters elemental and above, and I am sure it would be nice for some of the encounters in other expansions also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh...I thought RC was a group poison and disease....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RC (radiant cure) is an AA ability on a timer (3 min?).  It does a group &quot;cure&quot;, and has a chance of affecting things other than poisons/disease.  With level 1, you'll occasionally get other things like Malox.  With level 3, you'll get it pretty often, but it's never guaranteed.<br />
<br />
If you're fighting something that ae's more than once per 3 minutes (which almost every one does), then the AA is only going to benefit you once, and Nadox will come in handy for those other times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Radiant Cure 1 removes 9 poison counters, 9 disease counters, 9 curse counters, and gives 1 chance to remove a detrimental effect. The last part is what removes Malo/Tash spells, but it's random so it doesnt always work. Can only be used once every 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Blood of Nadox removes 18 poison counters, and 18 disease counters. Wont remove curses or detrimental effects, but it can be used as often as you have mana to cast it. It's worth getting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
isn't malox heartburn medicine? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The last part is what removes Malo/Tash  <br />
<br />
Any PR cure will cure tash if I recall right it is 1 PR counter. <br />
<br />
RC is 9 counters of PR DR and Curse. BoN I belive is 18 counters of PR DR. Also BoN is group only and can not be MGBed and TGB dose not work with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any PR cure will cure tash if I recall right it is 1 PR counter.<br />
<br />
Point taken on the Tashani. But, Malo line is removed by the last part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, Blood of Nadox is good because you can cast it on other groups.  Radiant Cure obviously can't.  <br />
<br />
It's great against Trakanon, whatever that means.  <br />
<br />
You should always get your spells.  They represent functionality, if only situationally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One time in particular, a chanter mob got stuck in a rut, and I reduced him to 100% ineffectiveness by chain casting Nadox.  Wind of tashani, nadox.  Wind of tashani... nadox.  Repeat 6 times and that was the sum of THAT fight.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, Blood of Nadox is good because you can cast it on other groups.  Radiant Cure obviously can't.  <br />

<br />
No, you can't cast Blood of Nadox on other groups. I have tried, you can target someone else, but it will cast on your group.<br />
<br />
It is WELL worth getting though, whether or not you have Radiant Cure. If you get hit by AE, it can cure the whole group in one cast. I didn't use it much before I joined an elemental guild, it's useful for some elemental encounters. But it's also useful in LDoN now.<br />
<br />
A mob AE tashes, Radiant Cure will take it, the mob does it again, well, you've used Radiant Cure already, if you don't have Nadox, you'll either have to cure each group member individually or wait for RC to pop up again. Initially, I also used it for curing after an AE poison trap goes off, but I haven't come across those recently (either it's a Mistmoore Catacombs thing or they've removed it).<br />
<br />
As for elemental encounters - there are some fights where people are getting dotted and are dying left and right, but I can keep my group alive, thanks to Blood of Nadox. If you're in an elemental guild or if you aspire to be, the spell is incredibly useful in those encounters.</div></div><hr />
