Sorry for the inconvenience, but it's all I can do for now :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to login as Iamagator but could never get it to work since the move.  I gave up and created this new user name which I actually prefer as it is the name of my main toon.  I would, however like to get my post count (from Iamagator) added to Kashale which I believe was close to 100.<br />
<br />
I know it's not much but a hundred posts is a hundred posts  :)<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sunmoon,<br />
<br />
While I sincerely appreciate the time and hard work you put into running this message board and at the expense of being labeled a whiner, I must voice my frustration.<br />
<br />
I have noticed often times on this board that ones post count is directly correlated to the validity of that person&#8217;s information and/or opinion.  While it may have only been 70 posts, not many by some avid posters&#8217; standards, it went a long way towards the feeling and perception that I am contributing (albeit in some small way) to the overall good of this board.<br />
<br />
What you may not realize is that some time prior to my 70 post count, I had a 40 post count wiped out as well.  At this rate, I will always be a &#8220;Lurker&#8221; on this board.  While restarting my post count yet again may not be a &#8220;big deal&#8221;, I would also surmise that adjusting my post count to what I had previously earned would also not be much of a problem.<br />
<br />
If you still feel the need to leave my post count erased, that is fine.  I will live with it.  Just voicing a bit of pent up frustration  :)<br />
<br />
Please do not read this post as a flame, it is not intended as such.  Again, I appreciate your dedication to this board.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">KAshale, since I've ben runnung this board, I've only had to wipe posts once. WHen I moved the boards last time, as far as I know, no one got wiped. If they did, it was about a week of posts.<br />
<br />
Post counts can mean you post a lot, but I hardly think you are going to be considered any less because you are missing 70 posts. I can understand if it's 250, 500 posts, but if I tried to restore every post of every person that might have missed a few posts, I'd pull all of my hair out :(</div></div><hr />
