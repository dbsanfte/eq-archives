<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’ve been using a spine chill spear and a charred guardian shield since I started playing my shaman.  But for the last few levels it hasn’t been doing very much damage, relatively speaking. I’ve been stepping into melee with the mobs to work on my combat skills, but it’s my spells that are really killing them.  So I decided to look for another weapon. <br />
<br />
I also want to work on my 2H blunt skill so I thought I’d try to find a decent weapon for that skill. And since I miss a lot anyway, I thought it would be nice to do some decent damage with the blows that do land.  After reading another post, I started looking for a barbarian spiritists hammer in the bazaar.  I have yet to find one, but I did find a poison wind censer for 1200pp.<br />
<br />
The censer has a delay of 28, the same as my 1H spear, and does base 20 damage, which is twice what my spear did.  I looked it up on the net real quick, out of fear of someone else buying it, and found that its proc of Gale of Poison did over a hundred points of damage.  So I bought it.  When I tried to use it I found that I wasn’t high enough level to make it proc.  That’s when I did more research on it.<br />
<br />
Whoever created this weapon had to be laughing his or her fool head off.  It drops your poison resist by 30 points and then procs an area effect poison spell that also effects the wielder.  That’s rather sad.  Thankfully it doesn’t proc until level 50.  Still, its very fast for a 2H blunt weapon and it does twice the damage my other weapon did.  I’m thinking of staying with this weapon to train up my 2H blunt skill until I can get the barbarian spiritists hammer.  Does that sound like a good idea, or do I really need to catch up on my sleep?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It procs a rain spell, so not just 1 hit for 100, but 3 hits for 100.<br />
<br />
It was put into the game at one point a while ago when the devs felt like &quot;spicing things up&quot; so they put in some items that had nice dmg/delays/procs, but hurt the wielder as well.  I think 3-4 similar items for various classes got put in at that point, then, as most things, they gave up on the theme and went back to making good items with no drawbacks.<br />
<br />
You may want to look into a Hammer of Spiritcalling.  39/43 ratio, it's a little slow, but packs a wallop.  Generally pretty cheap, 2-4k on almost all servers from what I've heard.  There's also an 18/20 2hb that drops in CT as well, very nice for skilling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the 17 20 2hb from ct is lvl 51 +<br />
<br />
a high 2hb skil is geat for farming greeens....fast delay high damage, and its genocide time.<br />
<br />
Worth having if u have the time to train it up; maybe better to have ihb above 150 first tho.  or if your 40+ and can afford a reif then go piercing.  dont count on the epic for melee- its bad, far too slow; as we miss so much we need fast delay weapon to aid our poor skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice. Unfortunately, the Hammer of Spiritcalling is listed on Allakhazam as No Drop and attainable at level 55.  So I may have to wait a bit for that one.  Otherwise it looks like a very nice weapon.  I’m enjoying the ability to actually do damage in combat for now, but I’ll have to do some searches and see what kinds of weapons are out there that I can afford.  I do still need a 1H blunt weapon and a faster piercing weapon wouldn’t be a bad thing either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used a Frost Giant Femur at first and now Blight, Hammer of the Scourge.  Both have 40+ delay.  I never had any problems keeping my 2HB near max with enough time left at each level to get 1HB (Centi Warhammer) and Piercing (Howling Harpoon) near max as well.  <br />
<br />
A 28 delay weapon would be nice but the proc on that thing scares me.<br />
<br />
Blight is cheap, does decent damage, procs Scourge at 30 and sells for like 200pp on my server.  Worth looking into for the low budget shaman.</div></div><hr />

Allakhazam is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The PWC is a great weapon to use up until you can proc it.  I think your idea is a good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tarmok Battlestaff 33/44 +12 Str Bane DMG Plants+4<br />
<br />
Good ratio, and a nice little basher. kept my 2hb up with this and Blight. The fast delay on the Burning Woods Giants Fort 2hb that drops at the back would maybe be better though</div></div><hr />

The PWC is a great weapon to use up until you can proc it.  I think your idea is a good one. <br />
<br />
its good for farming greenies at high level too ;)<br />
<br />
at 65 you will resist it all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Woo Hoo, more suggestions.  Thanks!  :) <br />
<br />
I find all the weapon and armor choices in EQ to be very confusing.  But they certainly makes the game a lot more fun to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Artistikone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PWC is a great weapon, especially when attacking a large mob. Fighting the large mob at max melee distance puts you out of the AE's range.</div></div><hr />
