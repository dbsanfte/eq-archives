<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks to this forum, I've learned every trick in the book on how to make the most of our pet.  And also thanks to this forum, I know better than to compile a massive list of them, because things like that provoke nerf bats 8)  But despite all this learning, I still mess up sometimes, and so in the spirit of sharing my grief to save others from experiencing it, I wanted to talk about dogdog, and getting too reliant on him.  If you are the kind of person who, like me, gets caught up in one type of play style, I recommend you read on.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, like the subject said, dogdog is great, he tanks, does lots of damage, yadda yadda yadda.  However, I'm afraid that because of this forum I've begun to use dogdog as a crutch.  As a result, I've been denying myself a lot of fun, because I've been using dogdog too much when I shouldn't have been. <br />
<br />
Tonight I was in Karnor's Castle.  BTW, the reason I was there was to work on my VP key, which I recommend to any shaman 50+ without torpor, because a recent VI announcement about VP is probably going to make this key a heavily contested camp in the near future.  Anyhow, I started out there earlier trioing with a couple of 52 monks, using dogdog as normal for DPS/Tank/Speed Bump purposes.  Then I needed a break, camped, and came back at 3 AM.  This time, I decided to use invisibility, which meant no dogdog.  The camp I was headed for is Verix Kylong's, which is at the heart of KC basement.  For those that don't know KC well, there are about 12 static mobs plus 5 or so wandering just to get to the basement, and these are a mix of see invis gnolls, non see invis gnolls, and undead.  Then you get to the basement, and hypothetically speaking whip out an invis undead potion, walk through the basement (20+ mobs, all undead), and check to see if the mob (VK) is up.<br />
<br />
I say hypothetically speaking because I never made it past the first 12 static mobs.  During the times I typically play, these mobs are cleared by the swarms of players who train the zone out more regularly than a Brooklyn subway line.  But because I was playing at an off time, no one was doing this.  So I tried to run by the gnolls invis, but inevitably there would be a wandering undead, or a see invis gnoll I didn't see or forgot to con, and so for whatever reason I kept losing invis and having to fight 3-4 mobs at a time.<br />
<br />
Now I had my drogmor up, and I've trained myself to the point where I can slow/root 3-4 mobs, back off from all but one or two, and mem a spell in between mob hits.  Sometimes they get lucky and interrupt me, but since I'm on my dinosaur, I just ctrl+B and try again, and within a few tries I can mem a spell.  DogDog is a little tough to summon because he has a long memorization time, so I usually have to root all or all but one slowed mob to mem him.  But if I wanted to, I could have done it.<br />
<br />
The thing is I'm stupid sometimes.  And tonight I was stupid.  So I kept thinking &quot;I'll just invis after this fight, so there is no need to summon dogdog&quot;.  This happened like eight times, but like I said I'm stupid so I kept thinking it.<br />
<br />
After eight or so sets of 3-4 mobs each, I checked the clock.  I'd killed all these mobs in about half an hour.  With no dogdog.  To mitigate damage I slowed and separated with root.  To deal damage I used my epic (mana-less and it doesn't break root, what more could I want?) and Bane, though I often left several mobs un-Baned because I was too busy Cursing/Slowing/Rooting the others.  Of course, throughout this I was canning and healing, which should go without saying :)<br />
<br />
By my rough estimates I killed ~25 mostly blue, but a few light blue, gnolls and undead in half an hour in KC.  With no pet.  But pet is supposed to be so helpful, so what's up?<br />
<br />
And thus the point of my post.  For months now, dogdog has been a faithful companion by my side.  Whether soloing, grouping or raiding (well, sometimes he went away for raids) summon dogdog was almost always the first spell I cast upon arriving at my camp spot.  But tonight I realized that relying on any one style of play is a bad idea, because it leaves you closed off to the possibilities of a new style of play.  EQ is such a dynamic game that every zone really is different, and therefore when we get too caught up in the min/maxing for any one set of circumstances, we forget that another zone might mean a whole new way of playing.  Because of what made Karnor's Castle the zone that it is (mob stats, placement, agro range, etc.), dogdog simply wasn't useful to me in breaking through the entrance mobs.<br />
<br />
So my advice to anyone out there who, like me, is set in their one favorite play style is:  Don't do what I did, and don't cast any one spell all the time (Cann being the exception that proves the rule;) ).  Instead try to appreciate the wonderful diversity of Norath, Luclin, and Beyond, and modify your play style from time to time.  Sometimes, the best trick for maximizing dogdog, is to not summon him at all :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. If anyone else out there has a similar story to mine, I'd love to hear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pre-torpor root dotting is probably a better bet than tanking with our pet, especially if you've got 3 or 4 mobs.  When you hit 60 and find torpor, you'll find you can tank the mobs with the dog, plus throw on all those dots, and still have mana to spare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I more or less agree - when I solo in POP at 62 I do have a dog, but I have to call it off to let it regenerate pretty frequently, or heal it (which I hate, damn waste of mana).  I can operate almost as efficiently without the dog and there's a lot less thinking involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In general I agree with the original post.  But I believe your current level also has a lot to do with how you play the game.  There is a huge difference in possible play styles between levels because of the different spells we get.  A level 60 shaman without any mob dropped spells is not likely to be able to hunt in as many different ways as the same shaman with all his spells.  And equipment makes a huge difference as well.  A level 50 shaman with his epic and a JBB will have a lot more options open to him than a level 50 shaman without either.  <br />
<br />
I&#8217;m in my 54th season.  I don&#8217;t have my epic or a JBB.  I have a few of my non-vendor spells, but I&#8217;m still missing a lot of them.  And the vast majority of my gear is K-Mart quality at best.  So I still depend on my spirit puppy a great deal.  At some point I hope to be a little less dependent upon him, but that&#8217;s not likely to happen for some time to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DogDog is great, but at higher levels any mobs that he can tank better than you, wont be giving you much XP.<br />
<br />
Dog is great and has saved my rear alot of times, but he can sometimes get in the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dogdog is great except for when I'm pulling in tactics, then it just becomes an exercise in frustration.</div></div><hr />
