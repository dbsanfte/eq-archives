<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ioki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been a lurker on this page for a long time. <br />
I left EQ to go to the greener pastures of EQ2. <br />
Well the green grass has alot of weeds. I miss EQ but <br />
I am asking current player and even EQ2 player that<br />
have came back to EQ. Is it worth it?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks <br />

<br />
EverQuest has its own weeds, to be sure. It's not exactly a lush green lawn, but then again it's not a barren wasteland, either. It comes down to what you're looking for in a game, I suppose, and that's something you (and you alone) can determine. <br />
<br />
Myself, I have what I want in EQ and haven't considered leaving for another game. But that's just me.<br />

If you left just to try something different then return.<br />
Basically dont return to EQ just because youve played it before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is always WoW.  This is not a bash against EQ.  As Wulfbane said, if you left EQ cause you were unhappy, don't go back.  Give something else a try.  There are other alternatives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well to me it seems the population is going down for sure. I was 3 hrs LFG tonight -- so ended up killing faction greens in DS for much longer than anticipated. There were 3 other shaman lfg - all lvl 70 - at the same time. *hey Rairden ;p*<br />
<br />
Its not a shaman problem, i think its general population. For this reason alone I would stay clear till the numbers pick up again. I guess thats an if...</div></div><hr />

Beautiful. How are the numbers going to pick up (if that's what you want) if people stay away until the numbers pick up?<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
If you liked it, come back. If you hated it, why are you even considering it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried EQ2 when it first came out. It was alright, but I ended up returning to EQ1. I still truly enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
As others have said, if yyou were still enjoying EQ1 when you left, it may be worth it to return.  If not, you need to ask yourself was it burnout, or actual frustration/dislike (the some time away won't help)?<br />
<br />
While WoW has absoulutely no interest for me at this time, if you were dissatisfied it might be worth checking it out (did I say that?)</div></div><hr />

Lol Samanna<br />
<br />
I'd be happy for the numbers to pick up so I can get groups, but I am not going to decieve someone to accomplish it</div></div><hr />
