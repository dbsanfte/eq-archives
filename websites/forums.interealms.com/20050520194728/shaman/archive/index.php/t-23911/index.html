What do you guys think?  Setting aside the face that it cannot be wielded with TA, of course (pushing for fix, maybe?)</div></div><hr />

1) I like the way it looks<br />
<br />
2) It way way way too damned easy to get, given what it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats the ugliest stick i've seen in a long time. Really nice stats though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like it a lot I just wish that TA was clickable from inventory or something.  I really miss using TA so much when I have this equiped that after the wow effect of having it wears off I think I will go back to using TA again until I get epic 2.0.  It is really nice for those that don't have TA though and about the best shaman weapon I can think of outside of Time/Tacvi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hear that some of the shaman are trying to get it so that it can be equipped in secondary/range.<br />
<br />
I really like the effect, and it has saved my group a few times in the short while i've had it.  The short cast time contributes to this a lot.  I can get some nice healing going with this and the AA group HoT, the melee in my group were quite happy as well with both of them running.<br />
<br />
(Yes, it's only 400HP a tick, but there are a lot of times when 400HP will let you survive just long enough for the big heal to hit.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, that's just my opinion.  So far, everyone I have talked to outside of the shaman class thinks that it looks pretty cool.  Maybe we're just a bit jaded :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Crazy idea, sony gives you some sort of option to turn TA into an augment for the clicky slow and augment epic 1.5. The downside to this is you loose the augment slot. Just an idea</div></div><hr />

Stats are nice, yes.  The effect is nice, yes.  But I dont wanna carry around a ****ing doll head.  <br />
<br />
They need to make this thing range equipable so that you can still get the benefits of having finished the quest but are still able to hide that frightfully appalling, repugnantly repellant, awful cat headed stick.<br />
<br />
Did I mention that I think its ugly?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No comments on the ideas concerning range/secondary for either the new epic or TA absor? Kinda waste of time making a primary that many raiding shaman will never use regardless of how nice it is if they have a TA.<br />
<br />
As far as the new epic goes... Kinda sad design. Though i imagine the P*ssy on a stick jokes will run rampant for a long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So that's how the Lion Dildo turned out?<br />
<br />
Bleh. I don't like it, it doesn't feel shaman-ish to me. Give me a real weapon, preferably a spear. We are battle priests! (Or at least we are supposed to be.) Don't give me a lion-head on a stick. I want a worthy successor to the Spear of Fate, not some cat head stuck onto a sex toy.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember the cool creation story for the Spear of Fate?<br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder.' <br />
<br />
<br />
One can only imagine the story for the Lion Dildo:<br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'You are indeed fortunate to have completed this quest, Heyokah. The spirits have a new gift for you, to replace the mighty spear we gave you long ago. We found a dead lion cub on the plains of North Karana. We brought it to Thrildib, a froglok who was well known as a defiler of animal corpses. He spent 15 minutes removing the cub's head and shoving it onto a stick. Then Thrildib stuffed a glowstone into the cub's mouth and called it a day.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Give me something I can wield with my TA. A shield with a lion's head blazon would be cool. Even better, a wooden shield with a lion skin stretched over it, etched with magical runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Effect is nice. The stats are lower than txevu items. <br />
<br />
As for the TA, they should not make it any other slot eqipable. Should they do that they are in effect giving shaman another spell gem slot and they just did that. <br />
<br />
If you want to get into the realm of asking for things that have utility than ask for another set of spell gems that can hold only group buff spells or something like that and give 'em to druids clerics chanter and anyone else. Asking for a change to be so class specific and for one item just makes us look like the whiny complainers that we are being seen as.</div></div><hr />

Because its in the same slot.  I am pretty certain there will be 0 stacking issues, lucy only knows what its been coded to know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, one gripe with it is that why couldn't SOE add bonuses to ALL resists on it? Our old epic has it, why didn't they give the same to this one.<br />
<br />
Another is that lion head.. I don't know, a bear would have been perhaps more feasible, as all shamans can turn into bears, we even have AA skill for that. So beats me why the heck they made it like a lions head.<br />
<br />
And - not a gripe, just an idea - why couldn't it have been a spear again? I quite like the old epic look, it's really nice spear, it's nice even when compared to all the new stuff which has come out over the last years, it still stands out. And now suddenly a mace? Some new, cool looking wicked spear would have been perhaps neater :)</div></div><hr />

Should have been a spear with +20 to all resists.   And a cat's head'?  *** I haven't killed a lion for 40 levels!<br />
<br />
Appears they wanted it to look more like a 'voodoo stick' or a witch doctor totem...I'm going to start looking for my zebra striped zulu shield.  And my grass anklets.  Then I just gotta lose this oger gut.  /sigh.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as this is epic 1.5 I am not sure that its relevant that it's stats are worse then txevu. Most people who &quot;end-state&quot; will have 1.5 equipped will NEVER see txevu. If this was 2.0 then you would have a valid bitch.<br />

Its still a cat head on a stick, dammit.  All the shading and bump mapping wont change that.  You can put a $10K Vera Wang on an ugly girl, and its STILL an ugly girl in a pretty dress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">heck, screw itemization, make this equipable in a non-visable spot to not increase the global file size, i don't care.  I just want to be able to use this and TA (if/when i get it heh).<br />
<br />
I thought originally the epics were supposed to compliment each other, so you could use both at once for some reason (aka cleric shield, if it is a shield).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">heck, screw itemization, make this equipable in a non-visable spot to not increase the global file size, i don't care.  I just want to be able to use this and TA (if/when i get it heh).You can still use this with TA, just swap it in, slow, and swap it out.  It's really not the end of the use of TA because you can't wield them at the same time.<br />
<br />
Was it a rumor or did Sony actually state that they weren't going to deprecate old epics and we would be able to use both?  I seem to recall something official but it all blurs together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">It makes me think the shaman in the pic is heading to a masquarade ball. You know the costume ones with people carrying masks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Yea, i know i could swap out the new epic and TA, there's only one problem, the lazieness factor.  <br />
<br />
IMHO, as a general rule of thumb, sham are lazy.  Before you get all up in arms hear me out :)<br />
<br />
Our primary ability - Slow - when used, allows us to be lazy and not heal people as much.<br />
<br />
How do we do damage?  In general we don't, we make others do it for us though buffs like haste, FA, and /shudder stat buffs.<br />
<br />
How do we heal?  HoT's, cast it once and let it work for for a while, why bother to keep casting it.<br />
<br />
Travel?  We are the first class to get SoW so we can get to where we are going sooner so we can stand around waiting for the others.  Oh yea, we get gate...<br />
<br />
We also get lev to run over water, swimming is too much effort.<br />
<br />
I could go on but i'm too lazy :)<br />
<br />
Another reason i don't want to have to swap them... it means i can't have both equiped at the same time, which imo would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">TA is an item that no shaman would replace.  It's not as simple as it being a &quot;free&quot; spell slot.  TA is a manaless, fizzleless slow with no recast time.  If you do the BiC quest, you can put that augment on it and never have to replace it at all.<br />
<br />
I remember hearing the devs saying (through hearsay) that all epics (2.0) would be items you would never want to replace.  So far, I don't think I would replace TA with epic 2.0, even though I haven't seen the stats.  I know the click and the focus effect for 2.0 and they don't compare to a click slow at all.  TA is probably the best item in the game, although Serpent of Vindication is close or better, since it took the enchanter slow and cut its casting time in half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">For an exp group you can't beat the TA. I am thinking on raids the new epic could be better circumstantially. Certain Time boss fights if it helps on aggro when you actually try and do damage and healing AEs. However it definately is not a put the TA away and never look at it again epic, which is disappointing. If they increased the duration on the GoD slow to Turgors level then I might be able to see it. As it stands now, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">No cast time on TA?  I didn't know that, I assumed it would be 8 seconds or something.  Wow.  That would be hard to beat.  My guild is quite aways from Time so I won't have to make the decision for a half year or more.  I'll just swap in which ever has less stats, click and swap again.  I have no trouble with swapping out slots for clickies(I play a bard too, swapping slots is regular for me).<br />
<br />
I completely disagree with you about Shamans in general being lazy.  Yes, there are a lot of Shamans out there that get lazy but to say it's systematic of the class is wrong.  A good Shaman, playing at the top of his game is the second highest key pressing character next to a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">No cast time on TA?  <br />
<br />
Theres a 3 sec cast time on the TA.  Which actually makes it slower then most peoples turgurs since it isnt affected by spell haste.  The really killer feature of the TA is there is no REcast time, not even the 2.25 seconds it takes spell gems to refresh.  Handy when theres lots of mobs around or you get a resist...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>woonie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I think it is the ugliest thing I have seen on EQ itemwise to be honest.  At least the necro epic was at least a skull.<br />

<br />
You are wrong about this. Any mob that you malos, TA becomes faster than Nihil.<br />
<br />
Malos+<br />
Nihil 1.5s casting time + 2.25 = 3.75s<br />
TA = 3.0s casting time = 3.0s <br />
<br />
if either is resisted, nihil right after gets you:<br />
nihil+nihil = 7.5s<br />
TA+nihil = 4.5s<br />
<br />
That's an incredible difference.<br />
<br />
In p1 of time lets say, 4 mobs pop, I can nihil 1.5s, ta 3s, nihil 1.5s, ta 3s.. that's lighting fast.. but if you have nihil/turgurs it's much slower. And it costs mana to boot.<br />
<br />
I think I can say, and be accurate with the folling statement: <br />
anyone who says anything contrary to TA being the best weapon a shaman can wield at this point in the game doesn't have a TA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Well what gets you is the delay to recast Nihil, which is longer than the normal recast delay of 2 seconds.

The mouth opens when you cast, incase you didn't know that. Took these with everything on high, didn't notice that huge of a difference.<br />

i don't have my TA at this point, but i can't possably see equiping this over the TA.  i guess if i was feeling nonlazy i would slot this in really fast for the hot click and then put the TA back on.../shrug...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Zooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Yea, i know i could swap out the new epic and TA, there's only one problem, the lazieness factor.  <br />
<br />
IMHO, as a general rule of thumb, sham are lazy.  Before you get all up in arms hear me out :)<br />
<br />
Our primary ability - Slow - when used, allows us to be lazy and not heal people as much.<br />
<br />
How do we do damage?  In general we don't, we make others do it for us though buffs like haste, FA, and /shudder stat buffs.<br />
<br />
How do we heal?  HoT's, cast it once and let it work for for a while, why bother to keep casting it.<br />
<br />
Travel?  We are the first class to get SoW so we can get to where we are going sooner so we can stand around waiting for the others.  Oh yea, we get gate...<br />
<br />
We also get lev to run over water, swimming is too much effort.<br />
<br />
I could go on but i'm too lazy :)<br />
<br />
Another reason i don't want to have to swap them... it means i can't have both equiped at the same time, which imo would be nice.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, you are amazingly accurate lol......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Well, I'm one of those who really love the looks of this thing.  To me, it has more of a shamanistic feel than a few turkey feathers dangling from a spear.<br />
<br />
As for how great and dandy it is - my guild isn't in Time yet, so I have no problems carrying this thing full time.  Stat-wise, there's very little difference to TA - the only advantage is the clicky slow.<br />
<br />
On the other hand...  Don't know about other guilds, but we make use of MGB EE &amp; Spirit of the Wood a lot, for raid healing.  With the new Epic, I can stretch the healing for one group a bit longer.  Not to mention, whatever the melee crit effect does, if it does anything - I haven't done any real testing with it, nor have I seen any done.<br />

Words well spoken. I was one of those people who always said the TA is no big deal I have Balance and cast it fast enough blah blah blah..then I used someones shaman who had a TA and was bummed I dont have one. Its a game changing item for sure and personally couldnt see replacing it with an epic 5.0 if it didnt have a right click slow on it.</div></div><hr />

If the quest isn't too bad, I'll do it, just so I can have a mana free group heal every 15 minutes. I would never equip it longer than the .8 sec casting time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then you compare it to the rest of them...I can't believe how good looking the others are.  <br />
<br />
Two things need to happen:<br />
<br />
1)  Needs to be changed to Primary or Secondary equippable, so we can continute to weild a TA if we have one.<br />
<br />
2) It should be converted to a shield, with an appropriate increase in AC and with an appropriate graphic (shield with a lion head would be just fine with me--as a matter of fact, that sounds kind of cool, if they did it right).<br />
<br />
It's no coincidence the new Cleric Epic is for the secondary slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Just make the TA clickable from inventory.  Problem solved.  There will be many many many more shaman with the new epic than a TA, so it only makes sense to change the TA a bit.  There are other primary weapons in the game with better stats than the TA already, so why not just make it clickable from inventory?<br />
<br />
This is the type of thing we should officially request from the devs.  Shouldn't take much justification.</div></div><hr />

Look at the long snout... the long mouth... the very thick neck... that is no cat.  The long golden mane behind his head gives it the illusion that it is a lion, but that ain't no lion.<br />
<br />
It looks to me like either a bear or wolf head.  Which makes sense.  I actually thing it looks more like a bear head.<br />
<br />
I personally think that it looks great and *really* stands out in a crowd.  Btw, from what I've heard, no epic 1.5 has particle effects... only 2.0 will have particle effects.</div></div><hr />

Okay throat, neck --- whatever.  Ya know... that thing right underneath the jaw?  Ya, that thing.<br />

Look at it.. unless this is a cat has a double chin --- it's a bear.  Also, cats/lions don't have long protruding snouts like that.... and cat mouths don't go way back like that... <br />

In our quest for the Spear of Fate, we learned how it was made, what the shaman did to make it special. So we knew what it was, we knew the significance of the tip, the shaft and the feathers. The new one however, has zero lore to it. None, zip, nada. That is what I find lacking with so many things in the game, the absence of lore and &quot;history&quot; if you will. And yes, I think it looks dumb. I feel for our Vah Shir brethern who have to carry around the head of what may be their forbearers, on a stick.</div></div><hr />

The new beastlord epic even has a better look imo and still retains a &quot;tribal&quot; feel that would suit the shaman class.<br />
