<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After selling a bunch of equipment I am not using anymore from my characters I am going to end up with around 9kpp after I but a Barbed Rubicite Bracer from a friend.  I was thinking of using it to buy a new thing for my shaman.  I am now stuck on two things.<br />
<br />
1.  Horse<br />
<br />
2. Silvery Belt of Contention<br />
<br />
<br />
I mostly solo and like to melee.  Been spending time in OT and will most likely go to DL next until I am ready to play my shaman in the guild and then I will go wherever and Dungeon Crawl. <br />
<br />
Just looking for some advice.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That belt you want really isnt gonna improve you in any way. go with the horsie for the med mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The horse, by FAR.  That is one of the three best compliments to the shaman class (fungi, jbb, horse), especially if you are going to be fighting in outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
However if you can save a few more k plat try and get a jbb over the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 54, I'm looking to get the Silvery Belt of Contention.  Haste for me--particularly when I won't be losing AC and Wis, tho at a cost of some Sta--is huge.  Still, I would have to say that at 26 the benefit of medding while on horseback would be awesome.  Say good bye to Cannidancing.<br />
<br />
Now, having said that, I need to point out I'm horseless, JBBless, Fungiless, and evidently clueless.  I wish I could get hold of that kind of cash.  I keep toying with the idea of getting a horse, but it doesn't work in Kael or indoor zones, which is where I tend to find myself a lot lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">to clarify:  &quot;I'm looking to get the Silvery Belt of Contention by killing something and looting it from the cold, dead carcass.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">... and I answered my own question.  I'm broke cuz I give stuff away and practice alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Skip both and save up for a JBB, that will help you more than the belt or the horse. <br />
<br />
But you have to be very careful when wearing a JBB it has been known to cause hemmoroids ! <br />
It's ok though because if you can spare a couple more K of chedda after you've bought your JBB there is a Anti-Flare up Collar that drops in Chardok. Right click effect<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Without a jbb the horse wont save you nearly as much mana when soloing.  I'd definately say try to grab a jbb first if you can, you are only medding on your horse when you're auto attack key is off.  You say you like to melee so a horse wont help much there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At level 26, a horse is of no particular use to you.  Your casting times are not long enough to benefit much from the medding while casting thing.  If you melee, then the horse benefits are completely negated, since you do NOT med while attacking.  When you hit 45 and get a JBB, then think about the horse.<br />
<br />
Get the SBoC, or Silver Chitin handwraps may be a more cost effective haste option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a JBB just letting our main Shaman use it, first to get to 60 and now to help him AA or to have fun with in groups.  It is fun to see him use it when he Duos with my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since you have a JBB chillin, just waitin for you to hit 45 then go for the belt, as the horse benefits will be negated if you melee alot. And at 26, your cast times are really long enough to justify having a horse, unless you want one as a &quot;status item&quot;. <br />
I'd go for Crystal Chitin handwraps myself if a haste item is what you're looking for...it'll cost you less that SBoC. (don't quote me on that though) maybe even a FBSS no AC but you get haste !  <br />
<br />
Keep that Chardok Collar in mind when you hit 45 though, hard to cast spells when your crack is on fire ! You'll end up interrupting your own spell cast. Just food for thought, trying to look out for my Shaman brethern !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly, it highly depends or your armament.<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently I use a Tai Maul w/ the silvery belt at 155skill with this.  I'm repeatedly outdoing my JBB in damage with Alacrity and the Silvery Belt on.  When mana is iffy I use my cann button and attack between (mildy lowering my attack damage).<br />
<br />
I realize this is vs. Toilers which aren't the toughest things in the game, but for now my JBB is secondary.  Hit for 105 today too :) can't wait to make skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Damn twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hehe aye I didnt notice your level.  I would save your money entirely until a jbb pops up.  Soloing for a shaman isnt all that great until 49 and then really picks up at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">JBB's hinder the best thing a shaman can do ... dotting-rotting... yeah you can stand in there and take a beating too , hell i do that sometimes it keeps things interesting. But WHY o WHY would you want to click .... wait 8 seconds ... see if your interrupted...  boom ... click ..... while your doing that ... im watching the mob's HP drain faster than the russian economy.  .... you dont need a JBB to be a good soloing shaman ... its all about knowledge and how you use it ... Im pretty sure most shaman in the crucible agree with me on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haste belt.  Definitely.<br />
<br />
At 45, get a JBB and a horse.  Until then, haste baby !!!<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'd go for the SBoC, though.  An FBSS has the same ratio, is much cheaper and (more importantly) is pretty price-stable.  Once you're ready to dump the haste belt for something else (when your melee starts to suck in the 40's and 50's) you'll be able to get back around what you paid for it.  SBoC is still in depreciation mode.<br />
<br />
And to all those who notice I'm wearing a SBoC - I got it from a guildie at a very reasonable price.  :)<br />
<br />
Edit:  P.S.  Brown chitin leggings are also big depreciators right now- I'd consider selling those and getting some low-end dragonlegs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I reading this as joke, truly; both your assessmet that the &quot;best&quot; thing a shaman can do is rotting a mob, and that &quot;most&quot; at the crucible would agree with you. <br />
<br />
I need not mention that root-dotting won't help you solo a mob that summons or indoors and that druids who can snare are far better suited to that style, as you of course know.<br />
<br />
Good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Jbb are the best soling item outside ya epic....slow mob..send in 55 pet(he will always keep agro)..jbb away..use mana to heal pets..solo old wurms etc using 1/2 a blue on mana..none stop..but if ya want to be a tank ..dont ya think a shaman isnt ya best choice???</div></div><hr />

Not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've always used at least one DoT in addition to JBB dmg while soloing. It makes things die far faster, which is better for me.  <br />
<br />
I'd say his best bet with current gear (btw Bgum, you forgot to add your defense skill to your magelo) is to get a haste belt and have at em.  Any old belt will do.  The extra wis on the SBoC won't help much in the long run, and yer prolly wasting resources on it.  Use the 9k to buy one particular item that enhances AC and wis by a lot, then grab a FBSS and go to town for when you melee.  Keep the Turmoil belt in inventory for swapping out when you're not meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>haze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dont you think VI is gonna nerf this horse med thingy sometime soon and then all of you will have wasted your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">you could then sell it back for most of said money back..   but I only bought the 8k horse anyway :)</div></div><hr />
