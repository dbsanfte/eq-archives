<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok just a quick question that's got nothing to do with Epics lol. <br />
<br />
I was thinking of attempting to MQ the Golden Leaf BP (Supposedly sells for only 30k on my server). Ok the questions are :<br />
<br />
1.   Would anyone know what level of faction that I need to be at in order to do the MQ ? E.g. is it Indifferent, Amiable, Kindly or Ally.<br />
<br />
2.   I haven't checked on my faction with Skyshrine yet but I have killed quite a lot of Giants in EW/GD/Kael since they turned blue, the question is will I be KOS in Skyshrine automatically or will they just start out by not talking to me. (heh heh don't want to zone in and suddenly find out that I'm Kos).<br />
<br />
Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

2, u start out at KoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh wonderful. <br />
<br />
Looks like Kael is going to be seeing a lot of me on the weekends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kysran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Azareal to check your faction with CoV con anything in CS, WW, SS, or there is a named white dragon in WL (cannot remember her name tho) she is on CoV faction.<br />
<br />
Also going on any arena/ Tormax raids can be a good boost.<br />
<br />
The 9th ring war *might* give CoV, need to check that tho <br />

GL friend ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're raiding the Arena in Kael, you may be OK already. Lots of big faction hits with CoV there. Just zone into SS from WL and con a guard, or a wyvern/drake in CS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Azareal, here is a tip for you.  Kill mercenaries and loot the brooches (I think the mercenary assignments turn-ins may be bugged).  What you gain from this is 1 1/3 faction hits for every merc you kill.  Guaranteed.  1 for the kill and 1/3 for the brooch (meaning it takes 3 brooches for the quest faction hit).  I use this technique periodically to repair faction and I never spend more than a couple of hours at the most to get back to ally.<br />
<br />
Kael is a good source of quest material as well for double faction hits (helmets and toes), but those drops are purely random and rather sparse.  Merc brooches drop every time you kill one.</div></div><hr />
