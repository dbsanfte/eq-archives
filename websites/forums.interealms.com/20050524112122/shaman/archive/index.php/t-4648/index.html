<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got 59 last night in Katta at the bank.  Anyone have any suggestions on where to go next for good solo XP, and where to go for good group XP?<br />
<br />
Also I logged after trying out Pox once, so I didn't do anymore levelling, but how bad is the XP in this level?<br />

<br />
However, with one teammate or solo, you can do it in about 3 weeks of moderate playtime in Chardok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chardok eh?  I am very familiar with that place.  Most of the entrance mobs will be LB to me now, wont they?  I guess I would either have to count on single pulling, or try the tunnels maybe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did 59 in katta and howling stones.<br />
<br />
in katta, when I had a KEI and an aego (not required, but nice) I was pulling in about a blue per hour as long as I stuck with it and kept killing.<br />
<br />
Howling Stones was slower, but grouping is required some to keep your sanity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah Nerun, I agree.<br />
<br />
I need to take a week off to detox from all the Everquest I played to get 59.  Then I will need at least a week without soloing before I can even bear to summon a pet again. <br />
<br />
All soloing and no grouping make Baxstarr something something.<br />

I think it took me a total of about 2 weeks... playing almost every night... and getting called away to help random_drood_01 kill this or that for his epic, etc, probably 4 of those nights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HS south in a group. :)<br />
<br />
If you must solo maybe the LDC in sol b.  HS entrance or the pit. If you have CoV faction Western wastes or Dragon Necro. at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Grats and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did 59 over a year ago , but my recomendation is just keep grinding like all hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Start saving for Torpor.  Saw one in the Bazaar tonight... 90k.  Wizzie selling it.  Hmm, connection with manaburn, maybe?<br />
<br />
Grats on 59 - as has been said, the xp really sucks, so just try to get in lots of groups, and try not to look at the bar too much.  60 &amp; AA go so much faster, at least. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I bit the bullet with 59 and started it on a sunday afternoon, dinged on tuesday night.  Took me approxmately 35 hours (I had the monday and tuesday off work).  It is a total git of a level but well worth it.  The game changes a lot when you hit 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK my experience so far in 59 (3 blue to go wooohooo).........<br />
<br />
Its not much different than 58 IMHO...Did most of 56-58 in katta. At 58 it was a little over a blue per hour with horse,bon, epic (no jbb here). At 59 on katta guards its rollin in at  1 blue-little over a blue per hour. Alll depending on my luck with blue vs lt blue spawns and KEI (having it or not).<br />
<br />
Another spot thats is netting blue+ an hour is fg solo. And yes you cant single pull 100% of time here BUT shrooms are wussies. Worst pull scenario is 3 shrooms, but slow em all, put pet on one (with krag and regen he tanks it fine), then melee-dot down other 2 then finish pets mob. With KEI this is cake. But most of the time on initial pulls on a patch you will get on to 2 shrooms. The silly buggers just cast 80% of the time and usually hiot for 30's occassional 100 hit in there. Just buff up dr and mr to resist the slow, stun, and knockbacks they cast.<br />
<br />
But ya main thing is just keep grinding. Stay away from raids, camps etc. I dinged 59 Mon evening and as of log thurs was 3 blue from lvl. In that time I have done 2 gwurm camps and a HoT raid. Play time is prolly anywhere form 2-7 hours this week each night. So really not that bad in 59. Just gotta be diligent and attentive when you do the exp grind.<br />
<br />
Good luck grinding through this hell we call 59.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">got jbb or epic? (or both)  you cant single pull shrooms in FG at 59, but with a pet and jbb or epic you shouldnt have problems soloing there anyway, if its not overcrowded there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">59 is not a difficult level if you go at it hardcore.  Just find a few days where you have nothing else to do and can take off work or whatever, and sit down and play.<br />
<br />
I was at about 4 blues in to 59, then I just said &quot;im sick of not being 60, im gonna go for it.&quot;  I sat down in FG with just me and my friend's 60 sk (two boxed) and didn't move for about 45 hours or so.  When it was over, I was so sick of mushrooms that I couldn't even eat them in real life, but I was also level 60 :)<br />
<br />
However, I would not recommend FG solo.  I was unable to single pull at level 59, I would always get half the patch.  I had to use the SK to pull.  Also, the shrooms take forever to kill with just JBB and epic, so you need to lay a bunch of dots on them.  However, this takes a lot of mana and you end up with downtime.  I would stay in katta at the bank, it is still great exp.</div></div><hr />
