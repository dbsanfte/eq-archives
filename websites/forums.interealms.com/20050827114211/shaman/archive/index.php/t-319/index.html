<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is up with the ammo slot?   One simple and easy to get into the game feature would be to allow ammo to effect stat's.   Maybe even allow Mages to summon ammo with stat's or Alchemy to be able to imbue things.    I've seen tons of imbued items in the game but never been able to understand why if I hold something in my ammo slot ... i.e. ready to use ... that it doesn't offer same effect as Range.   <br />
<br />
As it is ... the ammo slot gets used by most to hold meanless stuff such as fishing grubbs.   One simple change to the code would give the dev team a whole slot to play with ... isnt' that a good thing?<br />
<br />
Maybe there is some history that I'm missing on this since I've only played the game for 2 years ... say something pre-Kunark ... that impacted the ammo slot.    <br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

Most effective use for the ammo slot right now for Shaman?<br />

Put something in it in case you have to loot your corpse and get a res later. That way you don't have to leave any bags or equipment that might be needed.</div></div><hr />

And just think, foragers always drop those lovely fishing grubs....<br />

I guess there's a use for druids after all. :p</div></div><hr />
