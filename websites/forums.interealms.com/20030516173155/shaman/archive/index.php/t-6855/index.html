<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject pretty much says it...<br />
<br />
Is the Chardok ZI/ZO area possible with level 52 2-boxed shaman/monk? Monk is looking for a SoS rather than bare hands... (poor monk, shaman keeps ninja-looting...).<br />
<br />
Both characters will have run3 soon...shaman has a JBB but neither are epiced...pretty ghetto equipment otherwise...<br />
<br />
ATM we are in Maidens Eye having no problems with Gorangas etc, if that helps (as long as monk single pulls!). Wondering about possibility of adds etc or if instill is enough to cope...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i don't think you should have a problem. i currently solo the zone out and am able to easily hold the last five mobs. i'm at level 55 so it seems that with two toons you should be able to do it at 52.<br />
<br />
the zone out is nice as the second pull can be split by pulling with slow from the corner opposite the zone out (at 55 ofcourse but other than long range slows i can't split mobs here). the fifth mob pull is a single as well. plus any problems and you are basically standing at the zone. <br />
<br />
both the zone in and out have wanderers though that can cause some adds at inconvient times. i think that the wanders spawn at the castle ent and wander up from there as the times that i been there where a group was camping the castle ent, i didnt see any wanders. when it was not camped i had to keep an eye out though.<br />
<br />
i've been camping there for a bit and haven't gotten any really nice loot unfourtunately. just a couple spines and a withered staff so far (plus the occassional fs sword).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for reply... of course I meant immobilize, not instill...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could easily handle the zone in/out. I currently duo there with a 54 mage and we have been getting pretty good xp at the zone out. So far items that have dropped for us is a couple of staffs of shieldings, a sarnak battle shield, di zok begirding, argent defender plus some other small stuff as well..<br />
<br />
Only thing that sucks is that not many people yell train till after they pass you and see people at zone out. Almost died today from some warlord who had every mob from the herbalist all the way to the zone out...including the herbalist himself hehe was quite a site..<br />
<br />
its definetly a lot easier when you have the JBB...</div></div><hr />

Maybe the zone in would be safer then? Can always gate...(as long as it doesn't fail! ;)</div></div><hr />
