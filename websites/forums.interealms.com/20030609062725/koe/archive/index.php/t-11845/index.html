<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is exactly the way it has been freezing at the character select screen since day one. It would stand to reason, that since this just started happening this patch, that this is a problem with the directX/rendering code.<br />
Im curious to know from those who have this problem.<br />
Processor type<br />
Video card<br />
Sound Card<br />
Keyboard and mouse, type(usb/ps2) and brand.<br />
 <br />
AMD XP2100<br />
GeForce3<br />
Soundblaster Audigy<br />
Logitech Keyboard and Mouse, USB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had this problem only since this last patch....  I think it has to do with the windowed eq changes they made - All i had to do is CRL-ALT-R to release it (just like you do in eq windowed mode)<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same issue here.. have to &quot;fiddle&quot; with it a bit to get it to work right. Clicking the mouse sometimes gets it going as well. Probably a bug that will be fixed in a patch coming our way soon.. (or so I hope).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tweedl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had this problem for some time now.  This last patch had nothing to do with it, for me anyway.  I usally have to escape out and restart EQ.  Sometimes, its my keyboard that doesn't respond at login screen.  In that case I have to use my mouse to click exit and start EQ again.  Lets just hope that the mouse and keyboard don't go out on at the same time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I cant get dula into game at all on my computer since i went ld the day after patch.  I get to char select screen click on whatever char I want to play and i get black screen and music.  That's it nothing else.  With all chars, on that account.  I can log in any of the chars on my other two accounts but not the one Dula is on.  Not sure what to do, gonna try the live chat help today.  Hopeing they can shed light on the situation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dalaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also constantly get this at the Character select screen...have to 3 finger salute (CTL-ALT-DEL) to break out.<br />

Dula; Be ready for tech support's all-in-one answer ...&quot;delete ALL the character ini files and the eqclient.ini in your EQ directory&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Repeatedly clicking / hitting the mouse seems to work for me atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Right click release the mouse :) or shift + ctrl + enter.....maybe ctrl + alt + delete :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well its fixed!!  I tried the live chat, waited for a good 10 minutes before the phone rang.  I got up to answer it was wrong number came back and wouldnt you know it....tech support came asked what kind of sound card I had, did not get a response from me cause i wasnt there then said &quot;have a good day&quot; and disconnected the communication.<br />
 <br />
Their question made me wonder about my sound set up.  I had directx8.1 installed.  I remembered someone at one point say something about 9.0 being out so I downloaded 9.0 and tried to log in and that worked like a charm.  <br />
 <br />
Yay!! I can play again!!</div></div><hr />
