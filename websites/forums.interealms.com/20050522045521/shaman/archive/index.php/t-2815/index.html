<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jkagy3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wana play on the FV server, beacuse i heard the people are really good players and really nice. I want to play shaman and i want to have fun doing it. Which race would be good for shaman that would be fun and not have huge amount of down time? Does regen make a huge difference if so, would you suggest troll or iksar for guy start out from scratch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Due to snare necklace, and JBB...  A troll may be the most fun.  plus that innate regen will help you have little downtime in earlier portion of game.  Non of the races have downtime in later game properly equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being on the FV server means roleplaying, a lot.  Troll is very easy to roleplay :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, as far as user-friendliness is concerned, Barbarian may be the best choice.<br />
<br />
They have the least problems with faction and have a low EXP penalty.  They can wear all types of armor (including the JBB), and really, innate regen saves a little downtime, but it's not as big a deal as it is hyped up to be.<br />
<br />
My next choice:  Troll, for the reasons Caanus already stated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For playing for fun, in a new server, pick the one that is fun :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ogres are the most fun to roleplay, cause you can say stuff like &quot;mez barsh j00 gud&quot;.<br />
<br />
Im perfectly happy w/ my sexy barb though :) all the chica's look up my kilt :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play on FV as well, i am a Barb.  I choose barb for a few reasons a) i did not want to be evil, when server came out and i created my char evil could not group with good.  b) speaking human was very nice, back then could not learn languages nearly as easily.  c) barbs and our women our dead sexy.  <br />
<br />
But if asking what race to start now, do whatever you want.  Troll/ogre/iksar are can be fun to RP, but unknown to most if u dont rp you wont be riducled.  The advantages of troll/iksar are not soo big that you should base your decision soloy on fact you regen more.  Just choose what will be fun for you, and remeber that you wont get a fungi, JBB for long long time, so far only 1 fungi dropped on server and a few JBBs i still need to get mine *cry*.    Good luck and dont let any of this be a deterance, its  great server with a good group of people and a very interesting enviornment.  look me up in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt;meow&gt; I'm a casanova on the server. You gotta have a tail the ladies go crazy over it &lt;purr&gt;<br />
<br />
but choose what you'll like every race is fun to roleplay with and its not that hard to e in char. If you need advice send me a tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I play a barbarian and I regret my choice.  Faction and exp penalty was a big deal for me, but not anymore.  More than 200 played days on Nektar, had I chosen another race, I don't think it would have mattered in the end :D <br />
<br />
Between ogre and troll, I'm not entirely sure anymore.  Both start out with lower wis, but that's not the issue, I have 80 base wisdom (90 with aa) so bleh! :mad: <br />
<br />
I've helped my cleric friend quest inno snare necklace 2 months back, and I found out it wasn't that great.  You can say a snare is a snare, but that snare is really really sucky :( It is better than nothing though, and trolls still do get regen.<br />
<br />
Ogres appeal to me more and more now just simply because of the fact they can't be stunned from the front, which means less interrupts, which eventually can save your (_|_) in high end raids.<br />
<br />
And both ogres and trolls would be easy to rp in FV I imagine; anyone who's seen Jar Jar Binks on Star Wars can pick it up pretty quick.<br />
<br />
BTW, as much as I regret having chosen a barbarian, it's not the end of the world.  What matters is that you're having fun playing your char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aren't you in Darkblood Nektar?<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm 54, I'll update the sig lata</div></div><hr />
