<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know what your thinking, why would a 59 shaman even go there..why, cause its fun..now..I was doing some indepth research and Alakazims claims there is an 8th floor...he is the quote..There is also possibly an 8th level to the tower which requires a quest to obtain the key to enter. Nobody has the found this quest or key, and the floor, quest, and key are not in the game at present time.  What kind of micky mouse bull**** is this...Has anyone actuall been to the 8th floor..its a cool place to hunt and I love the atmosphere..if you know, please tell me soonest...This is where i go when the epic becomes a grind..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the 8th floor does not exist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 8th floor is a rumor that got started because of the confusion  of how the tower is layed out and the number of portals located at the top floor.  The last floor consists of an upstairs and downstairs but is not divided by a &quot;portal&quot;.  After killing Tserra you should get a &quot;master&quot; key that allows you to instantly transport between the first and top floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since you can view zone files with third party programs, its fairly safe to say that there is no 8th floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any portals on the 7th floor are in the same catagory as the door at the very bottom of The Hole, or the Cave in the Kerran village in StoneBrunt. It is a place to hook in a future expansion, should the Devs decide to use it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All the mirrors on the top floor lead outside, once you have Tserrina's key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you quest the 8th Floor Key in Burnt Woods.<br />
<br />
But shhhhhhh.............</div></div><hr />

Burnt Woods was moved to Oasis earlier this week, let me know and i will give you the complete monthly scheduale of where Burnt Woods will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, Im getting three different answers on this, 1. It doesnt exits, 2. It does exist but isnt used yet.  3. It does exits, and has been used for special events..That info I got from a online GM.. So I suppose I will have to keep digging..Although I suspect its much like the Guardain of the Seal down in the Hole..Useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tugela gave the answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Useless door in the Hole - do you mean the one involved in this quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2634), to get (among other things) this item (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25236)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is so an 8th floor.  Its where Mayong Mistmoore lives with his pet Kraken and Megalodon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, it's the ecret-Say abratory-Lay for oject-Pray 'lpha-Aay.<br />
<br />
Shhhh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sigh, the gene pool it seems it getting dangerously shallow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">nothing like mystery to a zone, and the what-if I discover something that hasn't been discovered before or done before. I think one of the buzzes I got in eq was solving a quest that had not been solved before in Echo caverns, well it could have been solved before but wasn't on allakhazam.  When everything is known, it kinda ruins the game in a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rommel, the gene pool isn't shrinking, these are actually hilarious jokes based on **** you weren't around for, don't fret.<br />
<br />
There is no 8th floor. Aroject Plpha doesn't ****ing exist. And the burnt woods are now stationary and home to Veeshan the dragon herself. You can even go fight her, but only after you camp a post-nerf version of the fungi. Watch it though, might be hard to run down there in time, since SoW is slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Garf, don't set the kid up - you know he'd need Chain Celestial Healing support before he could even think about tackling Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The secret 8th floor can only be reached using Tserrina's key while simultaneously holding a plains pebble in your pocket!  Or is that to lessen food consumption?  Hard to keep those handy tricks straight some times...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Garf, don't set the kid up - you know he'd need Chain Celestial Healing support before he could even think about tackling Veeshan.<br />
<br />
I guess this new age of shaman just can't hack it, eh?<br />
<br />
Truly sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Funny stuff...nice break from the state of the game threads.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The place made a lot of people wonder because it seemed there must be some quests there.  You get quite a few no drop pieces that seem to have no purpose -- many have no stats and seemingly no reason for being.  Yet for some reason they bothered to make them lore and no drop.  A ring or two come to mind still after the years it's been since I've been there.  <br />
<br />
Used to spend a ton of time camping there.  A very, very fun zone I think.  It's one of my fonder memories.<br />
<br />
Great place to take a mage.  For some reason, that place was stuffed with mage goodies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I never hunted here, and would like to go.  Think a lvl 65 could do alright here?  And I mean all the way to the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I went in last night to show a 62 Cleric friend the messed up wedding party on the fourth floor and somehow we lost invis vs undead and pulled about every mob on the third deck..Well, since I hadnt put any offencvie spells up, I got aggro from the mobs so she could gate out..It was pretty sad, but on a high note,I slunk back in tail between my leggs and ran into a 65 mage who likes to go there just for kicks and knows the place like the back of her hand..We murdered everything up to the top floor, smacked the Tsarina, well, sort of, she mezzed me and I beat on the mage for a while, but it was cool, she just ran about till the vamp died and the mez went away..lol..But its a fun zone, with some really quirky drops..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a cake walk, I did it at 61. It's a fun place to solo your way through.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking for the entrance to the 8th floor though... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>magistrate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Actually the 8th floor was a rumor and a friend who left the game who was a gm told me there is a way to use the mirrors there to go to Hate. Maybe thats the mystery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol this made me think of this quote from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. ;)<br />
<br />
My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with the girl who saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavors last night.</div></div><hr />
