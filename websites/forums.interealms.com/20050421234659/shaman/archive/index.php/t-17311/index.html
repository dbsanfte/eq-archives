<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all:<br />
I'll be heading to Velks to gather silks for my 5th Coldain Shawl and get some experience while I am at it.  I was looking for a hunting guide (or advice) for the silks and other camps in Velks.  I searched the forums for *velk* but aside from a bunch of references to &quot;go to Velks&quot;, there weren't any posts that really discussed the specifics of the zone.  I am looking for general advice on what spells stick, what spells don't stick, what are the camps and where, and any other advice you feel is pertinant.  Due to my time available to play, I'll mostly be solo or possibly duo if I can grab someone there.  Here's my Magelo so you can get an idea of what my setup is like.  Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did a bit of time in velks, was alot of fun. I spent most of the time at the bottom when I was solo. There are like 3 open areas (rooms almost) at the bottom, any of them are decent for setting up camp. At 56, you shouldn't have a problem tanking a couple. I was there at 51 solo, root parking adds and so forth.<br />
<br />
See invis is your friend as those spiders will invis. I don't remember them being especially resistant to anything, although I would be hesitant about our cold based nukes. Slow em, dogdog, dot and get in their face and it shouldn't be much of a problem.<br />
<br />
/ooc you are there for silks and you will get alot of help (at least I did on saryrn) from other people killing spiders that have no need for them. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The spiders in Velks are resistant to cold, but if you can land maloxx then you can usually use the cold nukes if you like. The poison dots work better imo. I see you have the epic, so that will come in handy as well. ;) I spent many of the levels from 55-60 there so you shouldn't have too many problems. It will get nicer at 58 though when you get canni4 and KM. If you have stoicism, though, that may not be a peak level after all. Canni4 will still be nice though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The spiders are rediculously easy. They have about 5500 hp, but they don't hit any harder than mobs in Dreadlands (despite being an average of 8 levels higher). They hit for around 90. Even the Gargoyles only hit for ~109.<br />
<br />
Only the translucent spiders drop the silks you are looking for. A_Crystaline_whatever. The Blizzards and Shards don't.<br />
<br />
Crystaline Watchers are rogues. They backstab for around 280.<br />
<br />
Crystaline Devourers have a nasty dot called &quot;velium Poison&quot;, which does about 1k damage over 2 minutes. Buffing poison resist should protect you lvl 57-. After lvl 58 I wouldn't worry about it.<br />
<br />
The Gargoyles are slightly higher level than the spiders, and have higher magic resistance.<br />
<br />
Since this is an unkeyed, easy dungeon, you can expect a higher ratio of retards, KSing and training (both intentional and unintentional). Fortunately, it's also a popular place for people to PL toons on secondary accounts, so it's relatively easy to get a rez, should you need it.<br />
<br />
The maze area where the spiders spawn can support approximately 2 groups. Any more than that and the mobs get extremely hard to find. There are also 2 Icepaw Kobold camps, both of which can be reached by one of 2 fake walls. The castle is rarely camped (At least on Xev).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That dot is NOT poison based, its cold based, and also has a -200 resist modifier, so you will almost never resist it.  Just keep regen on yourself, and stoi once, and you will be fine, its not that bad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Becareful now because I have been reading about a new mob that they introduced on the bottom floor of Velks. It summons and hits decently hard for a velks spider. It also drops some nice loot. It was mentioned in this thread: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=17983<br />
<br />
GL in there though. I am also farming my threads and it is very boring. VL is pretty empty on RZ so I pretty much just shout to myself in zone and talk to Goner until someone shows up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've soloed the &quot;Fierce Blizzard Stalker&quot; 5 or 6 times now, only died once, due to adds (think necro I told about earring accidentally pulled one to the room during fight). Started at level 57. He doubles for low 200's &amp; summons, HoV is a good idea. Only ever resisted slow once. Splitting the 2 spawns near him is counter intuitive because of pathing, it looks like you should pull from the entrance back toward the placeholder, but if you do, you sometimes get all 3, but if you pull the placeholder first, then work to the entrance,  they seem to come single.</div></div><hr />
