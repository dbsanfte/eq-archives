Howdy folks,<br />
<br />
Feel free to discuss EverQuest: Omens of War.  The beta Non-Disclosure agreement has been lifted in relation to content and screenshots, however it does continue to apply to the testing experience and interaction with members of the development team on Omens issues. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of your help testing Omens of War.<br />
<br />
K .... spill it, folks. Empty, er inquiring, minds want to know!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty yeah<br />
<br />
Looks like might be better than Gates. Yeah<br />
<br />
Comparable to Kunark or Velious. Not from what I have seen.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didnt play too much to not spoil it for myself or my guild when I lead them over there. But it really does look to be more of the same. While GoD can be fun on occasion. The gear requirements are F ing stupid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK<br />
The task system will be for level 5 thru 70 and, according to SOE, you can level up without grouping to level 70. All of them are supposed to be soloable.<br />
I did a couple as a level 5 druid and they were hard, but doable. <br />
The AA's are ok except for the one that lets you tell your pet not to cast spells..cause we all know how many spells the shaman pet casts:-/<br />
The spells are ok. I was level 70 for a few days and everyone wanted my buffs again.<br />
Slowing wasn't a big problem..some only partly slowed...nothing different there.<br />
Nukes were a little better.<br />
The zones are ok. I get lost around a corner, but the ones I was in were fun. I fought in Noble's Causeway (mobs soloable by a 65 shaman), Wall of Slaughter ( need a group), Harbringer's Spire ( raid content...was on a raid). Never found the rest of the zones lol<br />
Make sure you have a really good invis when running thru most of the zones.<br />
They wouldn't let us test the new epics..well guarded secret.<br />
To me, the expansion is worth it for the spell gem, which costs 3 AA at this time, and being able to suspend your pet across zone lines. If you suspend one and log..it will still be there when you log back in.<br />
There is also a system (tradeskill) of creating attunable augments. The are player created and droppable till they are equipped. :-) You can also buy a portable augment box for applying and removing augments.</div></div><hr />

Nope.<br />
<br />
I didnt get to spend a lot of time in beta, but I enjoyed the time there.<br />
<br />
From my notes:<br />
<br />
Dranik's scar [green cons in the lower section, light blue/blue in the upper section]<br />
Harbinger's spire [blue cons, lower level]<br />
Noble's causeway [blue cons mostly, white in places deeper in, red cons in raid/event areas]<br />
Wall of slaughter [mostly blue cons, some white deeper in. Red con nameds]<br />
Bloodfields [mostly blue cons, large raid area to one side]<br />
Ruined city of Dranik [complex area, front areas blue, deeper sections (mostly indoors) yellow to red. Some large raid mobs. Better come with a good map here]<br />
Riftseeker's sanctum [Never found this zone]<br />
Proving grounds (of Mata Muram, I think) [high level zone. arranged as a maze. some yellows, mostly red cons. Access to the zone is protected by a large raid mob]<br />
Dranik catacombs a-c<br />
Dranik Hollows a-c<br />
Dranik sewers a-c<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
Also 6 cavern instanced zones, I forget the names.<br />
The locked zone is apparently something with &quot;anguish&quot; in it.<br />
<br />
Something like 24 zones in all.<br />
<br />
Mob density was relatively low compared to GoD or PoP zones. Most mobs are static rather than wanderers, so none of the giant square zones filled with wandering mobs and groups clinging to walls that we are so familiar with. Mob density seems designed to make you move when hunting, rather than sitting in one spot and pulling.<br />
<br />
People might like to compare it to Kunark or Velious or Luclin, and you would see elements of all of those here, but really, its best described as Omens ;).<br />
<br />
Just about everything I fought mitigated slow, but I never got the sense that this was a issue. My impression of the fights was scaled down dps and scaled up hp/ac whatever, so the fights are longer than what we are used to in GoD, but shorter than SoL. Somewhere inbetween. I considered the limited number of test fights I did easy, both with betabuffed toons and copies of Mok and Yella.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the task systems kinda sucks, at least for the level 20 warrior I tried  :D. Maybe more interesting for other classes, but for classes that can't solo it appears to be a case of going from point A to point B to point C, and getting some cash and a decent glob of xp. I suppose it achieves the objective, but it didnt seem like a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
I loved the zones, they feel much more like places than many previous zones did, in the sense that they dont come across and big rectangular areas. Lots of nooks and crannies, caves and buildings, where stuff might be going on. Many of the zones are split into subareas, much like BB or LIO are, with variation of mob levels to match. So you could potentially have people with quite different levels of gear and abilities fighting in the same zone.<br />
<br />
My overall view of the xp was good, and I cant wait for Tuesday when it goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I've explained plenty of times, why Slow mitigation isn't necessary at all, unless your intent was to weaken the slowing classes and lessen their contribution.<br />
<br />
And no, they wouldn't have to hit harder at all(I have explained the difference between harder and faster hitting mobs, who generate the same DPS, to you on a previous occasion), just faster. Which is the same as when a Dev decides to create a zone were mobs are hasted and need to be slowed or dispelled to strip it. <br />
How come no one is complaining about hasted mobs, but everyone would complain, if mobs hit faster and didn't mitigate instead?<br />
<br />
I'll tell ya why. Because they made you believe they had to do it for the better of the game and to be able to balance mobs. That's the biggest load of crap we have been fed since the game went live.<br />
<br />
On another note. You are reporting how mobs have higher AC and last longer now. Wouldn't it make sense to have them generate less DPS considering that they are doing more damage overall? So what's the problem with keeping their delay and max damage the same and leave them fully slowable?<br />
<br />
Exactly, there isn't one.</div></div><hr />

-----------<br />
<br />
I agree 100% Giac, although it's probably more accurate to say that they were making encounters less dependant on slowing.  And yes, the only reason I can think of why Shaman were not retuned to compensate is that Ryan thought we were overpowered.  The last 6 months of limited input from Sony makes that perfectly clear.<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
PS: And although I agree that having a new slow that reduces the mitigation would be nice, there are so many ways to balance Shaman that we don't even have to get into that discussion which infringes on content balancing and will be difficult for Sony to impliment.<br />
<br />
I continue to believe that we don't suck as bad as peeps say on this board but we DO need a few &quot;housecleaning&quot; items fixed to get our groove back.<br />
<br />
1) Lower casting times on our nukes. eg: Druid cold DD is 6.35 sec<br />
2) Increase potency on our nukes. eg: Druid cold DD is 1800ish (2000 with ancient Omens) ours 1200ish.  We should be at about 1400ish IMHO. Poison to scale accordingly.<br />
2) 1/2 recast time on malos<br />
3) Add negative resist modifier on VP<br />
4) Add Omens AA skill to reduce VP recast<br />
<br />
In my opinion this is enough to balance Shaman (taking into consideration the Omens spells). We need a little more damage punch to compete with Beastlords/Druids and a little better CC to compete with Enchanters.</div></div><hr />

Clerics get hands down no contest best healing ability. It would be nice to have something near that in terms of slowing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I spent a bit of time in beta. So far the thing the best thing I'm looking at is the AA's. I never once saw a single spell althought I heard of level 67 turn in pieces dropping during raids. <br />
<br />
The new mob models are great, but they still have the craptacular god ones too. The zones are very pretty, but I was having a huge assortment of graphical bugs on my computer with a geforce card. <br />
<br />
The title system is fun, but nothing big. Tasks seemed pointless to me. The voice macros are horrendous, really really really lousy. <br />
<br />
Looks like everyone that isn't in time+ gear or doesn't have ep/kt access is going to be crammed into walls of slaughter for leveling + 65. Its a pretty sizable zone, but not big enough to handle that many people. Its going to be packed constantly. Did some yellow con mobs that hit for 700ish and hit extremly fast before being slowed partially. Still put out some good dps slowed, but not as high as a ldon hard or ferubi. <br />
<br />
I'm extermely worried about the availablility of spells personally. Its just scary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">my veiw o oow, after i tested it?  dont bother. it`s not worth your time to do, and even with the changes to focus some of our spells actually go down in level due to focus loss.<br />
<br />
it a high ish level expasnion for the most part, the best parts are elemental hard or above, but most mobs quad, which makes it slightly harder. forget what tug said its bollocks, they hit hard and fast even slowed, they started off lowish but they ramped it up, so from 400 odd to 600 + , 1k+ in the high zones. fight last about the same as god (aka 45 sec or so with time/god equiped poeple) and yeour right slow mitagation is to directly nerf shaman, nothing else. these mobs still hit hard and faster (cos they quad alot).<br />
<br />
several shaman spells dont actually work or dont what they meant to do , and unless they change our pet before live it still the 61 pet.  Spiritual serenity heals less that trushar at the moment. and we are still about 30% lower than we should be. most spells arnt worth even getting. the over buff is nice but does little, the best one was nerfed that was the stam over buff that was nerf to cap at 40 over. <br />
<br />
the new agil and str buff which are the % modifiers dont have any stats, so what?  well with the new stats caps you actually need them least for little while. champion is a great spell but dont exp to keep it up on more than 1 group, it eats mana fast.<br />
<br />
aa are pretty standard and i never had to use spiritual chaneling except to test it. when using it it wasn`t that bad, but at 36 mins to reuse and the fact that the only thing that really drain my mana was champian and the direct heal, and casting champ with spiritual channelling is a big wack of hp. you could kill yourself if you not carefull. most other spells was great you trushar yerself and cast it great, but you can still only cast at the slow rate, still have agro problems etc, you will regain maan over 3 misn but not enough to actually ease you mana problems if you have them.<br />
<br />
ancestrail aid is good. as is call of the wild, but hardly uber.<br />
<br />
i advise change class (although alot have problems too)  or dont buy it. i will not it just wasnt that great, at 65 i was almost as good as 70, except for the buffs.<br />
<br />
this is a horrible expansion for shaman. dont buy it, let shaman class drop quickly give it 2  or 3 months and they might fix us. buy it and watch the game die anyway after a month.<br />
<br />
that being said , this expasnion does look to be nice for war,cleric, druid, enc and bards(even with the nerf to to bard soloing)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, there isn't one.<br />
<br />
I believe we have gone over this before, but to recap, in order for mobs to be challenging they have to do either one of two things (a) have enough dps to realistically be able to kill a player; or (b) live long enough such that mana reserves are a factor. For this to hapen you woudl have to have very long fights, either with high hp mobs or high AC mobs. No one likes long fights, so (b) is unacceptable. That leaves us with (a). To be a challenge, the dps of a mob after debuffing has to be sufficiently high. However, if a mob is fully slowable, the dps it would put out before being debuffed would be such that the only way that most people could deal with it would be to debuff the mob prior to melee engaging it. Pre nerf IK was a good example of this (allthough in that case the debuffing was done by dispells rather than slows). There were certain mobs that were extremely unmanageable if they were not debuffed, and we all know how people felt about those. The only reliable tactic for dealing with them was to root them on inc and dispell until root broke. Imagine if you had to face that in every zone of a new expansion, imagine the howls of outrage there would be. That is the world that you would have us play in, either trivial beyond belief, or hard to the point where people wont play. Mitigation has to be in place in the modern game. The levels of slow put in place in the early life of the game were such that they were massively unbalancing, to the point where they make the game unplayable in its old age if something isnt done to alter its effect.<br />
<br />
One other thing, mobs which mitigate have tuned down initial dps prior to slow landing, which means that the level of healing required in that phase is also reduced. Since the hardest period for a main healer to deal with is this period, having mobs mitigate actually makes them more viable as content for shaman to act as main healers on. In your world the number of mobs a shaman could main heal on would shrink.<br />
<br />
Getting back to OoW, I don't know about Bara's comments, but when I was trying stuff out the things that struck me most were how frequently they mitigate and how pathetic their dps was. I was healing an unbuffed unhasted bazaar geared warrior with an unbuffed bazaar geared cleric against unslowed mobs in Nobles using HoTs for heaven sake! The fights took freaking forever and used up most of the clerics mana, but they still could do it. The fights were longish (and this is using Mok/Yella, a barometer I'm very familair with) compared to what I'm used to. I sent a fair number of 65 rogues to their deaths in the far reaches of the expansion as well, and even there, mob dps didnt seem horrendous. If they have upped that in the last few weeks thats a good thing, because it was far too easy when I was trying it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">ok just been on and they fixed spiriutal serenity to do more thn trushar now, 840 ish , and they upped our nukes a tiny amounnt not enough to make them worth casting yet. direct heals the same and dots about the same. buffs seem to work as said.<br />
<br />
vindictive spriti seems to do nothing.  and no u/fg to root, malos, dispell, sow, bear form, or a single cast champion though prehaps fa having the 10% added would be better then champ group version?  mind at 1500 champ still expensive, but it is the best spell we get now.<br />
<br />
our pet still hits for 60 and 2k hp as off a few mins ago.<br />
<br />
still not enough to make me want to buy this expansion. we are still way too weak, however that said alot of classes (other than the ones i said like this expansion ) are weak too, though shaman are firmly bottom. but the stats over buff impresses the foolish who still dont understand that only stam has any real effect. so shaman might be more wanted, which could work to our advantage , champion will be wanted and our over buffs, poeple will miss shaman and so if few bother to get oow, poeple will notice and ask and we might get our dps and healing fixed!<br />
<br />
the sad things is i would be happy with spells below other classes, just not this low (mainly nuke sand heals, but dots need a complete rework) and it wouldnt take that much to make shaman fun again, but at the moment SOE just dont want to go that far, i still say dont buy it and wait least 1 month for bugs to fix and maybe get shaman shorted. now is the time to act , bocout this expansion in force and we will get their attention.</div></div><hr />

Witha full group you can tear through nobles mobs, and do mutliple at one time. yes i can heal causeway, but a cleric can do that without slow. Without a full group then it does take longer, and you could use dots etc, but that is a group less than 4 people, the hp mobs have is little for a group but a fair amount for solo or  small groups. The higher zones where the exp is hit for more and more often such as walls of slaughter (600+) now 600 might not see high, but when you consider that when they do hit they usually quad it increase dramatically. still for a time/god geared group it is realatively easy, and most things died within 1 minute. however a beta buff pall or war was eaten alive, with a war being more effect due to disc. however the cleric went oom very quick.<br />
<br />
the higher again zones hit for 1k+ and names hit very hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I believe we have gone over this before, but to recap, in order for mobs to be challenging they have to do either one of two things (a) have enough dps to realistically be able to kill a player; or (b) live long enough such that mana reserves are a factor. For this to hapen you woudl have to have very long fights, either with high hp mobs or high AC mobs. No one likes long fights, so (b) is unacceptable. That leaves us with (a). To be a challenge, the dps of a mob after debuffing has to be sufficiently high. However, if a mob is fully slowable, the dps it would put out before being debuffed would be such that the only way that most people could deal with it would be to debuff the mob prior to melee engaging it. Pre nerf IK was a good example of this (allthough in that case the debuffing was done by dispells rather than slows). There were certain mobs that were extremely unmanageable if they were not debuffed, and we all know how people felt about those. The only reliable tactic for dealing with them was to root them on inc and dispell until root broke. Imagine if you had to face that in every zone of a new expansion, imagine the howls of outrage there would be. That is the world that you would have us play in, either trivial beyond belief, or hard to the point where people wont play. Mitigation has to be in place in the modern game. The levels of slow put in place in the early life of the game were such that they were massively unbalancing, to the point where they make the game unplayable in its old age if something isnt done to alter its effect.<br />
<br />
One other thing, mobs which mitigate have tuned down initial dps prior to slow landing, which means that the level of healing required in that phase is also reduced. Since the hardest period for a main healer to deal with is this period, having mobs mitigate actually makes them more viable as content for shaman to act as main healers on. In your world the number of mobs a shaman could main heal on would shrink.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tugela, I am gonna ask you to try to be unbiased(whatever the reason may be for this) and think hard when you read this reply.<br />
<br />
First, I honestly don't know what you are talking about. Never did I root any Ikkinz mobs to dispell or debuff them. We pulled the stuff, debuffed and killed it. Never did I face an &quot;unmanagable&quot; situation due to mobs being hasted. So that argument of yours is already invalid as I my group had no supernatural powers or something.<br />
<br />
Second, you claim that mobs can't be made fully slowable, because that would require them to do DPS that would be impossible to be healed, prior to Slow. <br />
So basically you are saying, that mobs that mitigate Slow currently, are designed to do close to 100% of the HPS(unslowed) a Cleric/Druid/Shaman can heal and that an additional, say 30% would require a second healer.<br />
How many mobs a single group faces in GoD, where mobs aren't immune to Slow, but merely mitigate, require 2 healers?<br />
<br />
Third, what is so wrong with Slow being more important, when a Slow resist or 2 represents a wipe for most groups in which the Shaman is the main healer?<br />
<br />
Basically, it is not acceptable that an encounter focuses around Slow to a degree(more than saving the Cleric 200 mana), but it's fine for me as a Shaman to accept, that, in case of a resist, my group will still be wiping to a mitigating, gimped mob(gimped for who, though, definitely not for me, the Shaman). Is having Slow supposed to be a bane?</div></div><hr />

OoW is an expansion for everyone, there is a range of content for everyone, from the bazaar equiped toon all the way up to the top, obviously its going to get harder as you get deeper in. What I take issue is your blanket condemnation of the expansion as being overpowered when it is pretty clear to anyone who tested it that it is not. Bloodfields, Nobles and Harbingers are all at a minimum blue cons to a 66, are very doable for even poorly equiped people. I was curious to see if much had changed since I last tried stuff there, which you claim is the case, so I took Yella to Bloodfields and soloed some stuff. No buffs or haste other than my clickies. No slows on the mob at all. The worse they were doing was about 30-40% damage to me. Most hits were min and the attack rate was slow. And I was getting ok exp to boot.

So you never encountered a pre-nerf IK yellow con Kyv Eyegorger? They have/had some sort of buff which resulted in them having extreme dps if it wasnt removed. Not sure if it is haste or some sort of accuracy buff, but the best way to deal with it was with dispell. Everyone who could would lay down dispells. It wasn't unusual for the eyegorgers to drop my warrior in seconds, or wipe the group, and they were greatly feared. They are not anywhere nearly as bad after the GoD nerf.</div></div><hr />

I haven't done the Ikkinz trials in 4 months and completed all 3 of them with the first group on the server, so yeah, I encountered them. We pulled them with dispell, since they were hasted and heals or the occasional DvA would buy me enough time to slow them just fine.<br />

I never did work out the recipe for such complicated things, but the basic idea is that you take say a 10 HP aug (and I doubt they'll be vendor brought as in Beta), and polish it to make it a 15 HP one, then do something else and so on to get it to 40 HPs. Alchemy's involved somewhere along the lines, and there's a title &quot;Alchemist&quot; available if you have 200 in Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Faced with levelling a betabuffed shaman through 65, I gave up about halfway through and fiddled around with the task system - they're generally a case of &quot;go to this room in Lower Guk&quot;, &quot;kill x mob and get 4 yyys in this area&quot; and so on. Not exactly thrilling, but handy I guess for classes that can't solo well.</div></div><hr />

Where does this &quot;no one&quot; stat come from? SOE spouted that a few months ago and now it is gospel? Who did they talk to? Or did they talk/listen at all? (rhetorical Q)<br />
<br />
Spending an hour getting to a mob that then takes a few minutes to drop is not challenging or interesting. It is just a long drawn out task to hopefully complete for gear drops or flags or something/anything except the encounter itself. Sorry, and maybe I am in the minority here, but longer, more challenging, strategically engaging fights are damn fun. Regardless, even if I am the only person who prefers these encounters to take some time and real thought out effort and team work, then the blanket statement &quot;no one&quot; is wrong. Don't want long fights, stick to X Box.<br />
<br />
To be a challenge, the dps of a mob after debuffing has to be sufficiently high. However, if a mob is fully slowable, the dps it would put out before being debuffed would be such that the only way that most people could deal with it would be to debuff the mob prior to melee engaging it.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that would pretty much suck ... having to have a shaman or two as absolutely necessary additions to a group to do the debuffing. It would be such a first in EQ play. Wait ... that isn't true. Clerics, warriors and enchanters have had that role for awhile now.<br />
<br />
Point, incase you missed it in the sarcasm: how is it a bad idea to make mobs require talents from other classes in order to take them down when they infact do require talents from other classes specifically, at the exclusion of other classes, to take them down? Why is the debuffing scenario stupid but the quick, massive healing and/or charmed pet coordination acceptable?<br />
<br />
There were certain mobs that were extremely unmanageable if they were not debuffed, and we all know how people felt about those.<br />
<br />
I think you are confusing issues here. &quot;Back then&quot; (before GoD retune) the problem was SOE design of content based on players being level 70. That, as difficult as it was, these mobs were still being beaten is a credit to players going above and beyond the physical limitations of the game to succeed.<br />
<br />
One other thing, mobs which mitigate have tuned down initial dps prior to slow landing, which means that the level of healing required in that phase is also reduced.<br />
<br />
Are you claiming mobs are initially in some &quot;relaxed&quot; mode initially and then their dps increases after X point of engagement? So how does this work? Mob A hits 3 times a second for the first 20% of incoming damage to itself then increases its dps by some percentage as the fight wears on? Please show parses on this. If you can prove it it will help in the get rid of mitigation argument. Afterall, if a mob increases its dps overtime then a slowed mob will actually be doing more damage at the end of the fight than at the beginning - reducing the effect of slow (since it is based on the rate at which a mob potentially inflicts dmg.)<br />
<br />
In otherwords, explain this better ... or, if you meant what you said ... get real.<br />
<br />
In your world the number of mobs a shaman could main heal on would shrink.<br />
<br />
Damn, there goes the trash in Crushbone!<br />
<br />
Getting back to OoW, I don't know about Bara's comments, but when I was trying stuff out the things that struck me most were how frequently they mitigate and how pathetic their dps was. I was healing an unbuffed unhasted bazaar geared warrior with an unbuffed bazaar geared cleric against unslowed mobs in Nobles using HoTs for heaven sake! The fights took freaking forever and used up most of the clerics mana, but they still could do it. The fights were longish (and this is using Mok/Yella, a barometer I'm very familair with) compared to what I'm used to. I sent a fair number of 65 rogues to their deaths in the far reaches of the expansion as well, and even there, mob dps didnt seem horrendous. If they have upped that in the last few weeks thats a good thing, because it was far too easy when I was trying it.<br />
<br />
Ok ... confused again. Playing a cleric using HoTs to counter &quot;pathetic dps&quot; makes me wonder ... why were you using one of the most mana intensive heal lines instead of complete healing? If the fights are taking forever the key is ... manage mana. I would understand your point if your point was the fight lengths sucked your mana dry when used in the most efficient manner possible. I am not seeing that to be the case. Toss in the pot the mob was not slowed and the toons gear was subpar (both of them) and I don't see that the issue is the fight takes too long. It is the toons should be back in PoP trying to get some flags to get to some zones and raids to get better gear. If the warrior was as bad off as you claim, his/her dps sucked. Your test subjects are poor for the testing scenario.<br />
<br />
As for killing off rogues in deeper level zones being in the same sentence with &quot;mob dps didn't seem horrendous&quot; ... one kinda doesn't support the other. If you could claim/prove a cleric/rogue combo could effectively duo these mobs then you have a point. Telling us you couldn't keep a rogue alive, but he didn't die &quot;that fast&quot; makes no sense.<br />
<br />
Then again, it is late and I may be missing just what the hell the point is you think you are making.</div></div><hr />

There are new Tribute effects. All classes have access to them, although certain ones (such as accuracy modifiers and double attack increases) won't be much use to shamans.<br />

There are also cap-breaking stat options, which give increases of 2 to the cap per tier. As you can see from the screenshot, extending the STA cap by 8 ain't cheap! (And perhaps that'll make our stat-cap-breaking buffs more popular by comparison).<br />

Mobs dps is such that is requires a healer pretty much always.<br />
<br />
How many classes can heal in challanging content.<br />
<br />
1.5 to 5 classes depending on group makeup and content involved.<br />
Cleric<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman<br />
Paladin<br />
Necromancer<br />
<br />
How many classes can slow in Current content.<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Enchanter<br />
Beastlord<br />
Bard<br />
Necro (Vrs Undead)<br />
Pretty much any meele through weapon procs / Poisen for thieves<br />
<br />
About the only classes that can't slow in one form or another are Druids, Clerics and Wizards.<br />
<br />
Why is it okay to have much more of a stranglehold on the game changing and encounter changing heals spells. But Slows ruin the game?<br />
<br />
SoE has sold people on a heavy handed and overly punishing game system. And it is crap. They have the ability to make monsters immune to certain spells. Something could be immune to turgurs (Say due to the size of the creature) But Tigirs could land by saying it was large enough effect to affect it.<br />
<br />
The developers are milking the game. Lacking in creativity or regard for thier players. Any other explination is tied directly with incompatance or mismanagment.<br />
<br />
EQ might be old hat for the people working on it But some of us, did and even sometimes still do, enjoy the game and to ignore us and our concerns while hoping we will purchase another of thier products is folly. And Prideful in the extreme.<br />

Does it work &quot;as intended&quot; as in you're lom/oom, you engage this AA and it directly uses your HP's at mana?  How long does it last and what's the reuse time on it?  Those two things would certainly make it a buy/no buy to me.  I've found myself in enough encounters where I've been oom from a mana-sucking dot (Barxt being the most recent, while I was healing my offtank), but remain at full health or close that this AA would truly shine in those situations.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">My long writeup from my point of view on Omens...<br />
<br />
Level Cap Increase - Great if you like the decent exp spots for the non-raider at 65 to light-blue out (see: Droga specifically, light blues at 70)<br />
Epic 2 - Unsure, those were never in beta, so expect them to be broken (but that was assumed) and some of the dragons in the old world zones were pretty mean, 1500 AE DD + 2 slot random dispell<br />
Guild Tribute System - How often does anybody use the individual one? You can't tribute no drop items anyway, which is what most guilds that would use the tribute, get anyway<br />
Task System - At 70, I got a whopping 1 task, no matter how many times I asked, which involved at least a run to FM and Droga. I remember one at 65 that required killing 10 slaves in Chardok though. They're supposed to be geared to be done solo, and at least the timers are removed, but they still seemed to be geared for groups, not solo.<br />
Custom PC Titles - not really custom, but the selection is quite numerous, but even with 200 alchemy, I could only get &quot;Journeyman Alchemist&quot; (which, adding &quot;Karaab Silverwind&quot; on the end of it, made my name insanely small and hard to read, even with the name drop-shadow)<br />
Extra spell slot - If you are level 55 and burn 3 AA for it (not 1, 3) - breaking nearly every custom UI in the process<br />
Extra buff slots - If you feel like burning 5 AA a piece for these, up to 5, ouch<br />
Voice macros - Not much to see here, pretty uneventful. Some of the voices are really well done (Gnomes, Vah Shir, Iksar, elves) and some seem a bit weird (Barbarians) - Dark elves saying thanks just rules (they say &quot;Thanks&quot; then this really evil laugh, it was awesome)<br />
Improved Graphics - If your card can handle them... if your video card is older than, say, a year... no shadows/water reflection for you. Further, the new zones on my Geforce 2 GTS were insanely laggy (worse than bazaar with traders on!)<br />
<br />
The zones were a bit better than Gates, but even laggier frame-rate wise. As explained earlier, they were easier to spell and were actually able to be pronounced for once! Most of the spells seemed fairly... lame. Group FA was nice (but was not MGB able, was TGB able though), but the best heal I was able to do with the non-Ancient 70, with all healing AAs, was about 2300. The 67 pet seems to be an identical copy of the 61 pet. New resist debuff looked alright at first, until I noticed it was poison/disease only (and added 18 disease counters, at least they aren't poison counters).<br />
<br />
Apparently, tinkering and alchemy will improve on the augments made by other tradeskills. (though I could never get into Abysmal to check on things for nearly the whole beta duration, nor did I have any cash on me) How so? I'm not sure, but considering some of the augments that have already been posted, and the handful I saw on beta, they are actually fairly decent, but, like all other expansions, expect the nerf stick. I did see one augment that was a slot 4 or 7, had 10 attack and 4 damage shield on it, which wasn't bad, though I suppose it depends on how much it costs to make and tradeskill difficulty.<br />
<br />
Most of the AAs seemed to be rehashes of previous ones, except for a few, but most of those seemed fairly lackluster too (and 5 per buff slot was a bit crazy in my opinion). However, the Omens AA costs are significantly better than those in Gates by a long shot.<br />
<br />
My final verdict: If I had the $30 for it, I'd be on the fence. I'd wait at least a week or two to get opinions from the general public and, by then, they should be done bringing servers/zones up and down ;). Unfortunately, my expansion money for now was spent months ago, on Gates. Additionally, I'd rather see one high quality expansion per year, than two half expansions per year.<br />
<br />
If you are on the fence and debating whether or not to buy it or if you should keep your pre-order, I say you should wait at least until this time next week to see what everybody's reaction is and make your decision based on that. Not to mention, by then, they'll probably have nerfs in :p</div></div><hr />

You can. I tried to kill myself a few times with spiritual channeling, to no avail.  If you don't have sufficient HP (stops around 15-20%), it starts taking out of mana.</div></div><hr />

So yeah, will be a little odd, but gee, 60hp/1.8 = 33.33 mana/tick from self regen.  As far as I can tell, passive FT 33 is better than any other mana regen we have.  And if I can get the cleric/druid to keep me healed, basically unlimited casting for 4.5 min.  Obviously, in that 4.5 min, the previously empty mana bar will refresh and be nice and full.

Very true.  I believe that it is merely a way of giving other classes without these items a way to get this very useful ability.  Granted, I'm glad I bought my spiritstone in the bazaar, a few pp at level 51, then have to spend 7 aa's at level 67 to get this ability, but for many classes, it will be worth it.</div></div><hr />

Actually, when I read about this I was very excited.  It is far from useless because you can use it naked.  Think about this: bind in your favorite solo or cash farm spot (make sure it's safe though!!) which you can Gate to whenever you like.  Otherwise, if you happen to die or something, you can Origin from your bind point to your home city and hike it from there.<br />
<br />
As for Spiritual Channeling, it's not quite what I was hoping for (high re-use time) but it's kinda close.  At least for almost 5 minutes I won't need to Canni and can chain cast every spell.  Hopefull Pained Memory will be actually attainable because both Spiritual Channeling with Pained Memory will be a great ease on the active mana regen annoyance.<br />
<br />
I'm confused about the buff slots though because even on a raid I still have 3-4 slots open (except when MGB heals start hitting of course).  Is this AA mostly for melee's and casters that have clicky mind buffs?</div></div><hr />

Perhaps not as big a benefit to those classes that already could gate as it is to those that had to buy potions to get out of tough places, but it still adds a utility to us that they don't get yet.</div></div><hr />

I guess it depends. With time + gear you can start getting numerous useful clickies or even before that. Personally i've got sow, 2 hps/mana a tick clicky, Jb bp clicky, 20 sv all clicky (form of endurance) and VoB for just self clicky buffs i like to use. I'd also like to pick up the ac 15 sv all clicky thats on a couple things like quarms ring that would stack with all those too. Add on standard raid buffs especially in a situation where you want multiple or all the resists like quarm and then add multiple ae debuffs potentially landing on you and up to 2 mgb Hot's landing on you and thats alot of buffs. Add on top of that some of the bard songs/clickies that will still take a buff slot and I could easily fill up 5 more even.</div></div><hr />

Our heal/mana ratio is somewhere between 4 and 5, compared to 1.8 for the self canni.  So I can spam daludas on a tank, and hit myself with every 3rd or 4th cast, for as long as the ability lasts.  Since you regen mana during that time you can probably double your heal spam time after some adjustments on working out the correct sequence of timing, when to can5 etc.<br />
From what I see my saved AAs will go towards the advanced healing masteries, maybe saving 9 for the rez when going to 0% AA till 70.</div></div><hr />

Yes I will. I constantly push the limits of my mana bar, and sometimes it gets me into trouble. Having this ability will make those times a lot fewer. 36 minutes isnt that long in the grand scheme of things, you aren't going to get seriously pressed more freqently than that for the most part, even if you are playing agressively with your resources. Obviously you are not going to be using it all the time, but then you dont need to use it all the time. Think of it as something like melee discs of similar refresh durations if you will. Those are hardly useless in the proper context, and you can't use them all the time. But, you are obviously a man who doesnt see that, so i'll leave you to your opinions.<br />

Sorry, I don't get this reply.  Can 5 is every 3 minutes with a decent HP to mana ratio.  Yes, if it were available more often, we'd use it more often because good shaman are always casting something.  SC has a 36 minute re-use cycle and offers a horrible mana to health ratio (uses more health per mana it replaces than a can5 converts hp to mana).  I don't see how with these facts in mind that it can possibly come close to matching can5 in usefullness.  I have to agree based on lucy description with Giac, it's a decent situational AA and only really &quot;great&quot; against mana drain mobs.  I don't see how this AA is going to get a shaman spots in groups, but in raids with AE mana drain mobs I can see some excellent roles for shaman.<br />
<br />
Again Tugela, you're thinking like a warrior and making the comparison to discs.  Yes, it can be usefull, but it's far from great on a day to day basis.  You have a limited HP pool, after that you die.  I guess the proof is in the pudding, but comparing it to discs doesn't actually make it any more useful.  I'm sure some discs get popped on a regular basis, others are more situational.  This more situational AA will not likely get &quot;popped&quot; like a more useful can5 every time it comes up.<br />
<br />
EDIT: changed a single word, added another to make it more readable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I actually see some use in this aa and don't think Tugela is wrong. Perhaps some people just like to belittle Tugela because they think he doesn't know how to play a shaman because he plays a warrior too? lol.<br />
<br />
I can't two box but I know some boxers who play both characters to a very, very high level. I don't think you can call someone who boxes a cleric/beastlord through tipt/vexd regularly as the main healer and main tank someone who doesn't know and understand both classes effectively (this is the two box partnership I see the most, as well as a chanter/cleric that boxes tipt/vexd well). <br />
<br />
So, in that mind why does everyone assume that because the Shaman is Tugelas second character that it just sits in the corner casting spells every so often.......<br />
<br />
It's one thing to disagree with Tugelas viewpoint, but to just out and out abuse him because you don't want to think that it's possible to play a shaman well if your main is another account is silly. <br />
<br />
So, with that said, I think this aa will be useful. If I am grinding in KodTaz as an example and the group is chain pulling I can be more effective if I don't have to manage my mana constantly by canni'ing. <br />
<br />
Last night for example we had two mobs in camp at once and I was conserving mana while backup healing. We killed both and I was at about 40 percent mana and full health. Canni V still had a couple of minutes of refresh. I would have happily clicked this aa to enable me to spend more time dotting/ raining than canni'ing between heals/slows until canni V popped again.<br />
<br />
/shrug - to each their own style of play, but this retarded hate is getting boring.<br />
<br />
And yes, it will be a more situational aa but if it's a useful aa then playstyle can be amended to cater to it if you want to get the most out of both health and mana bars.<br />
<br />
Ok, now shoot me and call me a retard because I decided to have an opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically what you are saying is that there will be rare occasions in which this will be useful. Hello?! That's what I have been telling you from the start.<br />
Anyway, you are either obtuse or just not bright enough, so I'll try to be nice.<br />
(listen well!) <br />
A melee disc(name one with a 36+ reuse timer that is frequently used or actually moderately useful btw) or a long-reuse-ability, which enable you to do something better or more effectively or new are great and may even be powerful despite the obvious limitation! But for gods sake, this ability will not give me more DPS, more healing or more anything, it will merely enable me to do what I have been doing for a tiny bit longer.<br />
Did the Shaman class need another &quot;slow and steady&quot; enhancement(does anyone for this matter).<br />
Again, the only time this is going to be useful is when you are facing mana drains and even then you are limited by the harsh penalty. Instead of canning for mana you will be casting an HoT on yourself every 3 or so spells.<br />
Whoever doesn't see this, doesn't want to.<br />
<br />
Edit: I don't hate Tugela at all btw.(the thought alone is ridiculous). I just don't agree with him, because he makes poo poo always look better than what it is, crap. He probably thinks I am negative, which is fine with me.</div></div><hr />

it really quite simple tug came here as a warrior that boxed a shaman, and made some post and replies that where so badly wrong  (we are talking black is diffinately right cos i say so type post) that his reputation has stuck, he has improved an aweful lot and sometimes does have useful comments (although rarely) , however , his views are still mainly from a warrior that boxes a shaman , rather than a main shaman, as such his view are still tainted in that he only likes and wants what helps his warrior out while boxing, rather than what is best for shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, unless this was changed(and they changed a lot during the past weeks), neither focus effects nor specialization was taken into account for spells cast when using this.<br />
While a 100 mana spell usually costs the Shaman about 70 mana(approximately, don't quote me) you will &quot;pay&quot; 180 HPs for the same spell under the effect of SC. 70 mana will basically translate to 180 HPs which is 250% the mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Again, the only time this is going to be useful is when you are facing mana drains and even then you are limited by the harsh penalty. Instead of canning for mana you will be casting an HoT on yourself every 3 or so spells.<br />
Whoever doesn't see this, doesn't want to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said in an earlier thread, I see this as an invalable pre-raid buffing tool. The new cann is based on hitpoints, so technically we could cast non stop as long as we are healed. In any normal situation, asking a second person to heal me doesn't make much sense - in what situation is my mana/spells more valuable than another casters? Should a cleric heal me so I can nuke? Should a druid keep me healed so I can heal someone else?<br />
<br />
I think it will be really cool while raid buffing, especially if our new group heal AA is mgbable. It's likely that our new buffs will actually be wanted. Instead of one shaman doing a MGB focus and another shaman taking a few random tells for sta and no one wants agi, we might actually be doing a lot more stat buffing.<br />
<br />
If I want to save my MGB, I would ask a cleric just standing around waiting to heal me, pop the new Can and buff non stop until it runs out. 4 minutes is a pretty long time, I bet I could hit 10 groups with Focus, and sta.<br />
<br />
I'm especially glad that someone confirmed that you can't kill yourself with this new ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">You may find some use for it while buffing. I can honestly say that I have never had a problem being done buffing by the time other classes(especially Clerics) have finished casting their buffs.<br />
The only time I'd have to do groupbuffs is when my HoT is needed. When my HoT is needed though, the Cleric's is probably too, which means that they will have their groupbuffs as well. <br />
<br />
I honestly can't see a Cleric being done buffing before me considering they have 3+ buffs to cast + the various singles like BoV and DI.</div></div><hr />

Except that there are (on raids anyway) one billion clerics for every shaman and the division of responsibilities should make for a quick job.<br />

Cool, hadn't seen those numbers yet, was working off an old comment I had thought I had read here, but can't seem to find now (sure sign I'm getting old).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In theory. <br />
In day to day situations you will find that Clerics will be casting a ton of single buffs on top of having to coordinate their buffs with Druids.<br />
Our experiences might differ, but I can't remember ever having the raid waiting for me even when I was the only Shaman and my MGB was down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Giac, I'm probably getting too personal, and I apologize for that, but I think that you are completely wrong about this ability. When I'm not raiding or grouping (with either mok or yella), I'm usually working on some project two boxing, or testing to see how far I can go and remain in control. I frequently run out mana when healing/debuffing, and that can be a problem when you get bad pulls, unexpected adds or if you are trying a named. The ability to periodically cast from your hp is a huge increase in power under those circumstances. Let me give you an example. Recently I was farming CoN for the drops required for Silverwings VP quest. Nadox pops in the same room as the quest item droppers, so he was up at the same time. I could pull around him without any trouble, so I left him up until the end of the session when I decided to try him. Unfortunately I didnt prepare adequately and went into the fight at around 90% mana, not knowing that he is only slightly slowable (or very little else about him for that matter  :D ). I got complacent because all the other stuff there could be healed against with replenishment. I ended the fight with Mok oom and Yella at 15% health. Another 10 seconds and Yella would have gone down. Basically a very close fight, but one where something like this ability would have made a huge difference.<br />
<br />
These sorts of situations dont happen all the time, but they happen frequently enough that one could make good use of the ability. That is why I look at it as the equivalent of discs with similar refresh times, they allow you to do things that otherwise you would not be able to do, or significantly reduce the risk when you do. I don't know what your play style is or how well geared you are, but I do know that Mok is probably one of the best equiped shaman outside of the 5 top guilds on my server, and if I have mana issues when doing things I'm pretty sure that most other average joe shaman not in those guilds do too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">btw, just something i found out the other day as i actually spent all my mana testing vindictive spirit (which still seems to do nothing but waste mana so far as i could tell) and champion, i tried spiritual chaneling again, normally i still had mana when i tested. <br />
<br />
anyhow botom line, and i laughed aloud at this, i couldnt cast a spell because i DIDN`T HAVE ENOUGH MANA!  yes thats right its bugged, so if you completely oom it doesnt work anyway you have to wait for you mana to become enough to cover the spell.. oh how i laughed:)<br />
<br />
still something you might want to check on live, could be costly otherwise. ad i did feed it back.<br />
<br />
other things you might want to feedback other than pet, is that the new %modifer buffs dont add stats so yo might have to buff 2 buff for agil stats and avoidance, and str /dex and meelee%, but that percentage doesnt stack with champion btw, though possible that after a bit you wont have too, but if you do even with the new buff slots vis aa you will have to click off buffs, and those that need stats wont have anyway. Our nukes are still way to low and with our problem with agro for dot damage , mainly that you cant cast more tha 2 really, i think our dd should be up closer to cleric dd at about 1600 (and 6.5 sec cast) for ice age and 1200 for poison dd. the heals arnt far from what they should be though i recon the anicent should be more 2200, and the normal 1800.  i aslos think that the rain spell should be what the poison nuke is at the moment 928, though it close 893.<br />
<br />
oh and ancestral bulwark could do with being %shield rather than ac.<br />
and no new malo, sow, dispell, root. but they hardly huge.<br />
<br />
dots? well i not sure depending if they redo them depends whether our dd should be u/g, however the other heavy dot class necro have a much improved dd roo.<br />
<br />
debuffs need to quicker to cast i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Volnaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">According to the last dev chat held on Stratics (I think) the new task System will only go to lvl 65 as they specifically said they want 65-70 chars to hit GoD and OoW for advancement.  This may have been posted already, but I have not read all the posts yet but had noticed several mentions of it going to 70 and it does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Again, unless this was changed(and they changed a lot during the past weeks), neither focus effects nor specialization was taken into account for spells cast when using this.<br />
While a 100 mana spell usually costs the Shaman about 70 mana(approximately, don't quote me) you will &quot;pay&quot; 180 HPs for the same spell under the effect of SC. 70 mana will basically translate to 180 HPs which is 250% the mana cost.<br />
<br />
/boggle.<br />
<br />
180hp's converted via canni is 100mana, 43% above the 70mana figure.<br />
<br />
If you were to cast a spell that cost 70mana, you could canni for 180hp to recoupe the mana cost.  With Spiritual Channeling, instead of using canni to recoupe the lost mana, you just pay the 180hp directly.<br />
<br />
I don't understand where your 250% comes from.  However, as for the 43% loss, it's mitigated heavily by our ability to efficiently heal ourselves.  One cast of Quiescence while this ability is active, assuming SCRM, would give you 2016 (2520hp from Q - initial hp casting cost), or 1120mana (virtual mana, perhaps? :)), granting ~4 casts of Spear of Torment without losing any mana and near zero hitpoints.</div></div><hr />
