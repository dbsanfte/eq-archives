<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have played a shaman once before twinked on my home server and didn't have fun because I played him fast and with KEI and /shudder Paudal Caverns<br />
<br />
I was wondering a few things about my newest shaman before I create him.<br />
<br />
1)  I am going to play on another server other than my home server (Tarew Marr) and was wondering what a nice server was with low prices on shaman equipment and a nice non-FUBAR all together, and nice people.<br />
<br />
2)  I plan on picking an ogre or troll shaman, I would almost rather do Troll because of regen and the cool green factor, BUT their newbie quests are FUBARed and I would have to go to Crushbone to get a good chance on the Brick of Crude Bronze drops.<br />
<br />
and finally<br />
<br />
3)  What are some nice old world zones to solo through,  I don't plan on playing this character loads and load, I just want a few places to get me through the levels and to experience what I didn't do before (namely dungeons).<br />
<br />
I thank you all in advance for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I fyou want low prices, go with Firona Vie, they probably have the lowest prices on low level gear since so much interesting stuff is tradeable there and not on other servers.   You can also make fair bank if you farm for tradeskills that suffer to the TLC.<br />
<br />
  If you think you may make it to the upper end and raid a bit, go with Rathe... somehow that server managed to put every mob on a rotation, so you can easily get a shot to see things.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If you want a server that is in general friendly... I should point out that you said you plan to solo and spend time in dungeons... you won't see anyone :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">old world dungeons...  low level  Black burrow and/or Befallen.  I think Blackburrow starts a little lower (like 5/6??? up to 15-20 or so ) and Befallen (about 10 to 20 or 25).  Bonus to blackburrow is faction in &quot;good&quot; city&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Unrest starting about about level 15.  I'm not positive but I think you can go up to 35 or more in here in the basement.  <br />
<br />
Upper Guk - 15 or so up to 25/30 I think.  I had a lot of fun in upper guk with my first character.<br />
<br />
Sol A - 25 up to 30 or 35 I think.<br />
<br />
Permafrost - I hear its a great dungeon but didn't spend much time in it.<br />
<br />
I haven't been to runneye post revamp.<br />
<br />
Split paw is higher level but people generally stay at entrance because too many adds further in.<br />
<br />
things to note - non-undead dungeons - runners so root root root (or snare necklace if you are troll).<br />
<br />
Almost all dungeons = critters are social and help each other so many cases single pulls are difficult iwthout a FD or pacify class helping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If rotations interest you, Karana might be good too.  There are still abundant FFA targets for those who enjoy the race.  The main purpose, in my understanding, is to give smaller guilds a chance at the most contested raid targets, especially those needed for epics.  As far as I know, the Karana rotation targets are Vox, Naggy, Venril, Trakanon, Severilous, Talendor, Gorenaire, Keepers, Zlandicar, Yelinak, Cazic, NToV.  Oh and Fear is also on rotation.  Hate used to be, until the revamp.  PoA is also on a slightly different system that allows people to select a few consecutive days.<br />
<br />
Every now and then there's a movement for going completely FFA and a guild or two runs around KSing for a while, but so far none have lasted more than a few months.  You can visit the homepage of the KGC (Karana Guild Central) (http://kgc.igz.net/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro) but much of it is available only to representatives of member guilds, to prevent FFA types from having any more information than necessary.  It's not a perfect system but is definitely a huge bonus to those who prefer smaller, less competitive guilds, like mine. :)  There is often a wait of a month or two between chances at a target, but you're guaranteed a 24 hour window in which to make your attempt(s) undisturbed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen Bricks of Crude Bronze drops in Blackburrow and Steamfont as well.  It seems to drop like candy in Steamfont.</div></div><hr />

Strom is, of course, the All New server. May be a thought.<br />
Lanys is my home, and I have no complaints. The people are friendly, and prices seem no higher than average and less in many cases basing off of Allakhazam prices.<br />
<br />
The Kobolds in the Warrens drop crude bronze as well (plus, of course, the orcs in Nektulous). <br />
I just started a new troll shammy last weekend and used my older shammy to gather everything except the bronze (New guy following along behind to loot). The only reason I didn't farm all the bronze was because I wanted to mostly do this new guy from scratch...minimal twinking. He can go to the Warrens with his Necro partner and collect the bronze easily enough. <br />
<br />
Without a higher level helping you farm, you may have to wait till about level 10 or so to get it all yourself.<br />
<br />
As for Old World dungeons...Warrens, Befallen, Unrest, SolA and Najena to start off.<br />
<br />
Warrens and Befallen till 20 or so (I got my original shammy to 22 in the Warrens)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all, I heard the Bronze isnt all that common off of the orcs, so I will head over to Warrens once I start playing.<br />
<br />
I went with Drinal because of a RL friend plays there, and since it was summer I kind of forgot about that &gt;_&lt;.<br />
<br />
I made my troll shaman with 25wis and 5sta, and will start playing him tonight, if my 7 day free planetside demo doesnt lure back to it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />
