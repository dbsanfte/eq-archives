<br />
Blasted Building in NY today (http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/04/25/ny.collapse/index.html)<br />
<br />
No fire or smoke seems to be present so that makes other more likely sources of the explosion improbable.<br />
<br />
Gas vein would have a fire trail.<br />
And Gas ovens would created a fire but not a sudden explosion capable of collapsing part of a building and then leaving no fire trail.</div></div><hr />

The teach welding there.  Could have been an accident with the Oxy-Acetelyne (sp?) containers.</div></div><hr />

Why attack a school like that, not enough people there.</div></div><hr />

hehe technical school just means they have more high tech stuff to accidentally blow up.</div></div><hr />

A police spokesman said plumbers were working on a boiler in the basement and that &quot;may have had something to do with it.&quot; &quot;<br />

Somebody flushed a cherry bomb.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrorists win if every time something bad happens, we get nervous, edgy, or fearful that it may have been deliberate. Case in point, an aircraft slammed into a 30 story building in Italy a few days ago. Equipment failure verified by the data and voice recorders, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

and what if I have a Royal hmmmmm?<br />
<br />
but yes, Way too soon to be saying it was an attack, reports indicate several diferent accident ideas, no bombs or such :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. The terrorists have won when we become complacent about things and stop questioning them and being surprised by terrorist actions. When they've completely stolen what little innocence we have left, and we're cold and jaded to disasters of any size - that it when they will win.</div></div><hr />

Yes they were doing work on them, but they hadn't even been used in over ten years.</div></div><hr />
