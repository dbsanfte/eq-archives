<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Temple of Veeshan - Halls of Testing<br />
Where: Otter Cheif camp on CS Beach<br />
When: 8:00 PM - 12:00 PM EDT, Tuesday, July 17 <br />
Level Range: 55+<br />
Requires: CS fang or ability to get self to CS and Dubious or better CoV faction.<br />
<br />
This raid will be limited to Four Groups. Others not selected are encouraged to meet at the Beach, however, to act as replacements if those selected do not make it.   Though the level limit is set at 55 and up, Level 54 healers are also encouraged to signup. <br />
<br />
Requirements:  Attendee's are encoraged to bring some DoTs for Symbol/Rune.  <br />
<br />
Objectives: The main goal here is to move to the Halls of Testing and pull MoBs for challenge and loot.<br />
<br />
Edit:  We have a number of people signed up.  Given my recent experience with the last SG run, rather than pick 24 people right now, and then end up with 18 showing up and the alternates already obligated elsewhere, Everyone who would like to come, be either on the SG beach at 8:00 or at a druid ring 30 mins before that.  This list will be used to form up groups and as soon as we have a four group force there and ready (at or after 8:00), we will go.  There will be CotH mages available and if people leave at 12:00 but we still have a viable force, we will call in replacements.  I will make that announcement in /gu at 11:30.</div></div><hr />

My only note is that this is a week night so lets all be on time so we can be in ToV and going before 9 EST.  It would be even better to make it before that, but an hour should be the max time if everyone camps in CS the night before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ack found out last night that we have moved the low level night to Tuesday permently.  So I will not be able to make this.  One of the reasons for this move was to make it easyer for several freinds to join us that are not able to on Weds. nights.  Another reason for this was most of the weeknight epic raids have been scheduled for Wed. night.  I like to attend these as do most of us that play and have higher lv Chars.  I have commited to play on the Low level nights to meet people from the guild I do not normaly get to play with and to meet new recuits who looking to join.<br />
<br />
I like the idea presented here but think you are going to have to vary the days you go on these raids.  Yes Dar you can not play on the weekends.  This is no different than me not playing on Monday nights or playing lowbies with my wife on Weds ( now Tues.).  There are alot more people who will be in the same boat becuase of agreements with thier sig. others or just RL constiants such as work and time zone factor. <br />
Maybe a rotating night would be a better idea.  ToV on Tues next week then Weds the following week then Thurs and so on.  The reason I have focused on ToV instead of SG is I consider ToV, Deep DN, Chardok Royals, Sky to be Guild Raid events.  SG is more of a Group raid event.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to finish by saying vary good idea Dar and Chmee.:) <br />

Don't worry about never being able to go.  The big reason for us doing this is to offer the guild a raid opportunity - one large one small - every week.  Next week we will likely switch the days they are being run on, and so forth.  I know that different people have different schedules.  The point of making sure these are run every week is so that people don't have to get all stressed about not being able to attend any one raid.  Days will get moved around, times will get pushed earlier and later, target locations and raid objectives will vary, but in the end, we want to be able to offer the guild a major raid and a minor raid each week.  Or maybe the experiment will show this is too frequent, and we will move to every other week.  The point is, we will get a raid up here on a pace that the guild is comfortable with and in doing so hope to take some of the pressure for people to attend every raid away.  Hopefully, with in a month or so, a pattern will reveal itself that allows for consistancy and enjoyment for all.</div></div><hr />
