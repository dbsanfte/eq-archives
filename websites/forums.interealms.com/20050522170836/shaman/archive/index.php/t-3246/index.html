<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what you think is the ultimite damage dealer ?<br />
<br />
i know we arent melee , but when you canna to 50%health and you go /g OOM !!  it would be nice to have a lil something to help out the group.<br />
<br />
I just picked up a Ice Grinder and im hitting for sometimes 60-70 a pop and it procs ice rend (30 DD) which is a nice change from hitting for 5-18 . I still dont hit as often with this thing , im hoping thats cause my 2hb is like 109 . But it got me thinking on what would be the best weapons/weapons for a shaman . <br />
<br />
so far this is my best bet  27 dam 45 delay proc ice rend (30 DD)</div></div><hr />

<br />
not bad stats at all . does it proc ?  what are the stats?</div></div><hr />

I remembered another item.  it is a barbarian spiritists hammer, mediocre stats procs a 263dd.  drops off a god i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just gave my GFG to an alt and picked up a BSH off a guild mate for 6k and a couple hours PLing his alts.<br />
<br />
22 dam / 43 delay +13 Wis +13 Int and procs the same spell as the JBB (winters roar).  Hits aren't as hard as the GFG but when you see JBB go off, hit for 30+ damage &amp; proc go off for a total of 560+ damage all in one swing it's fun.   Can't wait to out-taunt the tanks with melee :)<br />
<br />
Haven't had the BSH long enough to tell you what my max hit is but with 2HB at 192 my max hit with the GFG was 121 and an average hit would be 58.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a situational weapon, I LOVE my Poison Wind Censor. It's 2hb, and hits in the 60-80 range, but it procs a 122 DD poison.<br />
<br />
The drawback is that the DD is an AoE effect, so it hits you too, which leads to this item being referred to as a &quot;suicide stick&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, I have found that for fighting very large mobs, such as giants, this item is awesome. You stand at max melee range, and you are out of range of the proc, while the giant takes full damage, and it procs A LOT! I typically get 6-8 procs per giant with the item, and that's with an entire raid beating on him at the same time. I've often taken aggro away from our MA with this weapon (which gets me some rude /tells).<br />
<br />
Its just great fun to wield :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I truly love my whackamole mallet (Barb Spiritist's Hammer), but lately it's been getting displaced by a new toy:<br />
<br />
Tae Ew War Maul<br />
33 dam/36 delay, +65hp, +couple small saves.  No proc, but I regularly hit for 100.  So far, I've seen max of 110 with it with skill 170.<br />
<br />
But then, I've been fighting cold-resistant Velious critters quite a bit lately.<br />
<br />
In Maiden's Eye, I swear by my whackamole mallet.  With Harness up, it procs quite a bit.  I almost always get 3 procs during a fight, sometimes more.  My chain-proc record is 6 in a row.  Over 1500 points in crackling blue damage.  MMMMmmmm good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">while OOM shamans can do alot.<br />
<br />
i use 2hb on things that the JBB gets resisted on.<br />
its taw ew war maul  33/36 65hp's.<br />
<br />
also its nice to have things in you backpack.<br />
for example i take along:<br />
journeymans walking stick which procs TASH<br />
Howling harpoon which procs stun<br />
Di'zok Oracle Shillelagh which procs togors insects (70% slow)<br />
club of yakesha(sp?) which procs 75 dd.<br />
<br />
all of these things (and i'm sure many more)  can help group while your OOM.  and none are really uber which exception to the war maul.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so how much does skill really matter on how often and how much you hit . i have used 2hb and 1hb and peirce . for about 10 levels i didnt hit a thing cause it seemed all i did was heal . so right now my 2hb is 109 and my 1hb is like 90 i think and my pierce is 70ish<br />
<br />
if i get like 150 or 180+ will i hit more and more often ? cause i luv my ice grinder , but i dont land as much as i think i should .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is just my opinion but we will never outdamage or come very close to the same amount of damage that other melee's with double attack and dual weild can achieve.  With that in mind I prefer to use the Howling Harpoon for the stun effect, it may not be as damaging as the weapons above but by preventing the creature from doing damage it allows the real damage dealers to finish the mob easier.</div></div><hr />

Ohh Baby.   Stand back!   Bear Coming through! <br />

&lt;Laughs&gt; <br />
I know it isnt going to be all that but hell I am having fun dreaming. After playing a thief from Zero to 60 before getting to experiance the joy of Snoww, I know what real meele damage is. <br />
<br />
The amazing thing is some of the time if I want I could outdamage a thief. (Unless he assassinates) Torrent of Poisen followed by Ice strike with a couple procs of a barb hammer is pretty tough to beat. Esp if I get any Crits on the spells or procs (grin) Let me get Rabid bear and the asskicking will continue as before but with a new and improved Bashy bear--RAR!--<br />
<br />
Enjoy your shaman. You have the option to be almost anything in the game under the right light. From Main tank and puller in an XP group, to (as Gloriana puts it) a Rock star in a raid. To a fun person to be around with a goofy accent and a Mutt that sniffs people behinds.  Or if you are feeling a bit peckish just wander off and kick the crap out of something that looks at you funny.<br />

I'll have to admit, I kinda gave up the battleshaman gig when it seemed the ripostes I was suffering outweighed the damage I was putting out. I'm more inclined now to give a few bokes/bashes &amp; see if I get whcked.<br />

Knockback is too fun. If my group gets adds I just get on an add and slow them and knock em all over the place.
