<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Honest question to ask your self. I was bored at work and the site here was down so I thought I'd checkout playerauctions to see who's getting out of the game. I came across a very uber shaman who some of us may know from here who will go anonymous but seems to be quitting the game. <br />
<br />
I thought to myself wow, can't believe he's quitting and then I asked myself could I ever sell off my shaman. The answer is no. To me the time, effort and fun I've had playing my character is worth more to me than the few pennies it amounts to for the hours and hours that I've put into it. I couldn't imagine knowing someone is running around on my character doing things that I once did just because they had the money to buy it. When I log into Eq and play my character to me that character is a little part of me and just like a finger or toe no amount of money can buy him. <br />
<br />
When the day comes that I no longer enjoy Eq a simple click of the delete button will please me more than knowing some newbie is having fun doing what I once did. Just my two cents. What's yours? Fire away! lol  :D</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
I once thought as you did.  But if I could get a thousand bucks for my account, I'd probably do it.  Means all the years of playing (&amp; the expansions) paid for themselves, and I could afford to toss in a name change to salve a bit of the guilt.  Biggest thing holding me back is skepticism about a sale going through w/o getting scammed.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I always said I would never sell, but I've been saving up for a new roof forever. If I could get 1K for my character, I could possibly sell when I'm done with the game.</div></div><hr />

Just one thought about PA: With WoW coming out soon and now beta for EQ2 started plus all the other new MMORPG I think the prices will drop fast for EQ toons. Hornestly I see 1, may be 1 1/2 year for EQ. I don't like the look of WoW nor I'm sure I will join EQ2. Hopefully I will use the chance and get a full RL back (once done with EQ). And I could stop playing EQ! Everytime! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I could use the money. But Even with accounts cancled I can always come back If I want to see old friends. Even if the PC friends fade away, or move on to other games, I can always log on and head to everfrost, or smack fippy around one more time if I feel like it.<br />
<br />
Everquest Might be mostly dead for me. But the memories of the good times before it became a Arcade game are still very strong. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I ever considered quitting EQ and selling my account(not much chance of that, I have to much fun), it would be under 2 conditions:<br />
<br />
1)  I would charge enough to pay for name changes<br />
<br />
2)  I would sacrifice all my characters down to 50 so they would have to earn 65.<br />
<br />
So I guess no one would be interested =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Been there, done that. Wouldn't do it again. ever. still eats at me.<br />
<br />
Was in 'the' uber guild on my server, doing the insane level of raiding, with massive pressure from the wife and kids. When the word 'separation' was being bandied about, decided it was time to take forceful action. Sold my Shaman main account. Financial details will not be shared, but it was a quantity of money enough that when I started my new shaman account (within 6 months) that when people make fun of me for my 'computer game' I mention how much I made selling out. In the 'REAL WORLD' of folks who don't get EQ, they do understand cash and shut up about it real quick. <br />
<br />
I now play 'casual' and actually go a few days without logging on, and occasionally just quit for a month or more when I am bored with it.  I am not in a guild, although the urge is strong and hard to resist. However the point of this thread is around the afteraffect. <br />
<br />
When I see my former Shaman, I wish I had at least had his name changed. It is like seeing a ghost, and it mocks me. Mostly I wish I hadn't sold him. <br />
Most of my former guildmates eventually forgave my transgression, but it is still a stain on me, that I will never live down. They still refer to me by the name of my former Shaman, and will never change from that I think. <br />
<br />
However, I really like my Cat Shaman now, and my twinkie boy monk on a second account. I 2 box various places, and still hook up with old friends from the former guild from time to time. I don’t get to do a lot of stuff, like flagging and getting to the new OOH LA LA! zones, but I manage to have fun in the older zones, and LDON’s are nice for gear and xp for the ‘casual’ player. <br />
<br />
I will never sell again, because it just isn’t worth it in my opinion. Eq may beturning into  ‘just a video game’ but for many of us, EQ was a way of life. EQ players were people that we shared our time and interest with. We became involved in their lives, and became friends with many of them. ‘online friends’ is a term we all understand. <br />
<br />
For any that want to flame me ‘to get a life’. I have one thanks. And a part of it has become over the last 5 years, playing EQ with a bunch of folks that I consider friends, and came to care about. <br />
<br />
Peace out<br />

If i ever quit eq, my shaman is going into a nice retirement home to sleep off his aches and pains.  It's not even the time put in, but the fact that my charfacter represents ME to my friends and people i meet online,  i dont hide behind an online character so i can be anoymous, I just act myself.  In 5 years i have me a lot of people, and i have my own reputation, which is MINE.  There is no way everthat someone would get my account.  I wouldnt even give it away.</div></div><hr />

Anything else would not be worth it to me. Its only been a couple weeks since I have logged in to play my shaman.. not long enough for me to think about selling yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nope.  Not gonna sell.  Too many people know me, too much time invested, too much water under the bridge.<br />

The possible financial return just isn't worth it.  I'd prefer to know that my reputation isn't screwed up by someone else.  The character is an online reflection of yourself, and integrity is important to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I quit for over a year, I offered my accounts to RL friends (they took up billing) with the stipulation if I ever decided to return, they would be given back to me.  Two different friends took me up on each account and they used them all that time, and when I finally decided to come back, they were very gracious and returned them to me (almost identically equipped).<br />
<br />
I would probably do the same again and if no one wanted them I would just cancel billing.  I have gotten a great more amount of enjoyment playing them than any amount of cash I could ever get for them and would like a chance to get them back again if I ever returned next time I quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would sell my Shaman, but only to a guild friend.  The buyer would have to be someone I know because I don't want some mean jerk to ruin his good name.<br />
<br />
It drives me crazy when people buy uber toons from playerauction and do not know how to play them.  At least if he was a guildee the other guild members when grouped w/ him would be aware of the operators newness to the class and probably put up w/ a few more mistakes than the regular types.<br />
<br />
P.S. Just because you are an excelllent Bard, Warrior, Cleric (etc.) does NOT make you an excellent Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seven thousand vs. $200?  My, how times have changed.<br />
<br />
I wonder when it'll drift down to about ten bucks.  heheh<br />
<br />
A guy I liked a lot sold his account.  The guy who has it now is glum and unfriendly.  I don't want to get a reputation as a KS'er or a jerk after I'm gone from the game, or just be associated with that.<br />
<br />
You know what else is funny -- a bunch of people I know have given their friends and guildies accounts to play either permanently or for a while, for fun or for the guild's sake, and wound up yanking them off playerauctions just in the nick of time.  <br />
<br />
It's kind of funny when the &quot;bonds of friendship&quot; and sentimental memory that people think they're preserving by putting their character in the hands of trusted friends winds up in their treasured toon being put up on for sale within the week.  Ah yes, the memories....  Sorry, it's cruel maybe, but I have to laugh at least a little every new time I hear that story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm pretty much done with EQ and I have been contemplating selling my account for a while.  I could probably get $1500 for my account, maybe a little more.  I'm in college, so $1.5k goes a long way.  The only condition would be that the buyer change the name, which I would pay for.  I'm very well known on my server and still frequent my server's message boards, so I'd hate to see my reputation tarnished.<br />
<br />
It would bother me a little that some guy who didn't earn his way to the top was playing one of the best shamans on the server, but honestly $1000 would handle that guilt pretty nicely.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I can't think of any good reason not to sell.  I've gone innactive several times before, but this is really the first time that I've honestly though I was never coming back.  I just don't want to play this game any more, and if I could sell for $1.5k, that more than covers all of my expansions and subscriptions over the years.  I'm not worried about getting ripped off because the seller is at very low risk.  You just wait until you have actually recieved the money, and then turn over the account info.  I'm the original owner with the original CD keys and original CC #, so if the other guy tries anything I can reclaim the account.<br />
<br />
Anyways, since we're now sponsored by IGE, I figure this is acceptable:<br />
<br />
If anyone has $1.5k to burn and is looking for one of the best shamans that will ever be sold, shoot me an email or PM and we can talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Personaly if i knew i would never play again (unlikely as long as people i know are still around) i would likely give away what ever gear i am able (just about everything on fv) and let the shaman rest in peace.<br />

the more likely scenario however would be leaving him available as a buff bot for the guild and coming back on occasion when i have some time to kill...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Realize that many PA auctions end with the &quot;buyer&quot; bailing out.  Read their message boards - they're full of posts from people complaining about the entire process.  I seriously doubt there are very many people out there buying accounts for over about $500.  Yantis no doubt buys them, strips them of droppables, and sells off the account with only the no-drop gear left.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'll never sell my accounts.  When I'm done, I'm done.  <br />

I seriously don't think I could even cover expansions with my shaman, I've had alot of fun times, but have also seen alot of in game friends sell their accounts, come back, sell their accounts.  Seriously think Rodcet Nife has more player auction activity than any other server, either that or its the people I first got to know in the game. (I've never visited the website).<br />
<br />
I am so sick of the whole ebay bull that I get on people in the bazaar when they say they're paying cash.  Hell, if I ever get serious about leaving, just so damn fed up with this game that I plan on quitting and never comeing back, I think just spamming my account name and password in PoK for hours on end would work for me.<br />
<br />
Ya know when that day will come?<br />

Yea, neither do I, don't think its going to happen  though breaks do help.  I'm an addict, only way I'm going to quit is by flushing it down the toilet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">If/when I would quit EQ, then yeah, I would. This is just a collection of bits and bytes, what I do not own in any way. I have only spent money on it, without ever aquiring back anything material, so to say. Getting 1k$ for it back would be quite nice. Not that I would get 1k, I don't have such a char, but for conversations sake. At one moment, when EQ will be shut down (and it will be eventually, sooner or later), all your 'precious time spent on it' will end up in Recycle Bin anyway, figuratively speaking. No one from SOE or anywhere else will drop a tear about your time investment, it will go down the drain like a spam e-mail from your inbox folder. No one at SOE will even blink an eye before pressing that &quot;Delete&quot; on your char. Emotional value? Bleh, emotions, these come and go. Time investment? Yes, it is, and money investment, too, so why not to cash some of that wasted.. spent, I mean, time, back in, and money as well?<br />
<br />
Probably I wont be able to sell, due to technical issues related with Paypal and this region of Europe, but, really, if I would quit the game for good - i.e. move on to new game(s) I will play - sure I would sell. SOE has had a good life on my money, figuratively speaking, long enough, while screwing me over with &quot;All is fine with shaman class, and alchemy works as intended and Rabid Bear is really good AA skill&quot; talk. I'm a material person, I have no time for emotions, and the time and money I invested into it is good to get back, at least to some extent if possible :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">ive sold my accounts a number of times.  in early 01 I sold a couple of accounts for around 8k... but that includes 3 fungi tunics, a manastone and 2 AoN (think my bro gro almost 2k for the a la carte items from inventory on our 4 accounts).  my NTOV/sleepers/VP shaman was sold to a guild that was pre-kael so it was a good deal for them... my bro did the transaction believe i got 2-3k for it.  I sold another close to max shaman last year, got less than 1k for it, and I thought it was a pretty good deal for the time<br />
<br />
the worst thing about having sold a character is not being able to log him in if and when you start playing EQ again.  but on the other hand it's nice for him to continue to live and have adventures just because you yourself got sick of the game.  sometimes I log on and talk to the guys who bought my accounts.<br />

trust me EQ aint hard.  as long as they're active your character will be just fine and progress with the game.  what sucks is when you log on and you cant find your guy online ever.  no one's heard of him and he's dissappeared off the face of norath... but then again I suppose that would be the state of things if your hero commits hari-kari and follows you into the great unknown...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Sometimes people buy 'em and move 'em to different servers.  I've known a few people who go to stormhammer to get time keyed then come back to my own server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">When I announced my retirement two weeks ago in the three hours it took me to say all my goodbyes to friends and such I had three offers for Bethiana. The highest was $1400, and tempted as I was to do it, I'd rather delete her than let someone else play her. So I did. She was the first character I ever met the majority of my goals for, except for two. Time access and a Time's Antithesis. Pretty impressive for a character just over a year old.<br />
<br />
Plus, no matter how much someone paid me, it's for their own good I keep them away from paying the festering dungpile of SOE more cash per month. My End Billing and deletion was a great big FU to their company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets see...and if I was selling the account anway, I could buy some plat from our friends at IGE to refit the new shaman that I would make.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Beolvaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Sell my account, never!<br />
It's not for any nice altruistic reasons like I'm worried about my toon's rep after I leave, It's simply because all my bank details are on my account, and I don't trust some stranger not to rip me off once I've been paid.<br />
<br />
Check your billing details, because once you sell, that is part of what you sell - enough for someone to say buy a new pc over the intenet as I recall!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Money is a good thing. The idea of selling Tordail is tempting; I can think of a lot of things I could do around the house here with $1400 USD, and it's a long list. But selling Tordail is completely out of the question for me, for a couple reasons. I despise companies that sell in-game items and materials. I'd not want to be part of that, in any way, regardless of my frustration with SOE and EQ in general. <br />
<br />
And ... Tordail has taken me through some of my most thrilling moments in this game, some of my saddest, and even some moments that pissed me off so good I couldn't see straight. When (not if, but when) the time comes for him to be retired, I think he deserves something better than to have someone else at the helm, someone who doesn't understand him. Sell out? Nope.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Sorry folks. Offer me 1400 bucks for Snoww. I would laugh at you.<br />
<br />
My charecters will retire gracefully. Snoww is parked At the mouth of Halas. <br />
<br />
And maybe one day soon the old bear will carve a home out of the permafrost. And the howls of the wolves and the growls of the brothers in spirit would keep her company for the long night ahead.<br />
<br />
That is a much better end than a few paltry bucks. yeah money would be nice. But to all the people that I have helped and have helped me over the years playing Snoww it would be a diservice to have her run by anyone other than myself.<br />
<br />
Now my second account with my 65 SK and 65 chanter.. I would sell if offered decent money. The emotional attachment is not there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Bethiana was our guild's top Shaman, and one of the top 15 Shaman on Mith Marr HPwise. The offer came from a guildmate who wanted her for several reasons. Gear level, for one. I didn't progress with the guild. I did a lot of stuff with others, and while my guild was still in PoP I was playing in GoD with friends, which netted me and my Pally some nice stuff to fill in the missing EP gaps. I did almost take it, but there wouldn't have been a name change. The reputation was another thing he wanted. I've been known to cut loose on the Rants forums of my server, but I've always been a good Shaman with groups and others and would help anyone who needed it. Honestly, I'm Bethiana and, really, nobody else can be. /shrugs. If you can put a price tag on your goals and the amount of fun you had with friends, you go right ahead. But I wouldn't just be selling that, I'd also be selling the gear my friends helped me get, the three hour one-group Seru kills two boxing with a friend four-boxing, the two group Ssrae kills, the GoD runs, all of it. I didn't do it alone, and I don't need the money so much that it mattered whether I took it or not. I played a Paladin for years before I made Beth, and to come as far as I did in that short amount of time meant a lot to me. I didn't have fun until I made a Shaman. That's why I, for all intents and purposes, took her with me when I left for CoH. Empathy/Psychic defender. Heals and slows, for a class much like a Shaman, and I'm actually having fun again, not wasting several hours in some hideously executed GoD expedition.<br />
<br />
As for Sony not noticing and not caring: it was a sentiment. Whether they see it or realize it is up to them. I'm completely accustomed to Sony's indifference to its playerbase, which is glaringly obvious in their sub-standard customer service. If anyone other than a crack dealer treated their customers this way, they'd be out on their ass. I won't be buying EQ2, and I'll discourage others from doing so as well. Hell, anything with SOE in the production is going to be crap, far as I'm concerned. Customer Service is much a part of the game as the graphics and the content. <br />
<br />
I could go into some tirade about Sony this and Sony that, but it's all been said and done. The grass really is greener on the other side of the fence, and if City of Heroes adds some higher end content (which they've left the game open-ended enough for to accomplish easily) it has a LOT of staying power, no ****ty coding where 9 people crammed together causes my 2 gigs of memory PC to lag without spell effects on, and it feels like you're playing an arcade came.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He has been my one and only main.  No other 65's.   I know it is just a game, but I have developed an attachment to the virtual bugger and would never be able to get rid of him.<br />
<br />
I could never delete him either.<br />
<br />
If I quit, I will retire him somewhere in EQ that would match his disposition and mood in game then log off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Yantis offered me 200 bucks for my Time flagged/geared shaman...  200 bucks isn't worth it to me and I don't trust PA enough to openly auction the account off.  If it was 500+, I'd have been sorely tempted and in all honesty probably sold Sciek.  But it was a lowly 200 bucks. :p<br />
<br />
So, I guess a few friends in my guild will get to play Sciek till the 6 month billing cycle runs out then he'll just fade away.</div></div><hr />
