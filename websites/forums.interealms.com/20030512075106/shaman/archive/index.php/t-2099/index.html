<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TnT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The scorpions in Field of Bone have been giving me great exp.  I've been soloing heartsting and large heartsting scorpions for the past few lvls and the ones that are blue still give me from 1/3-3/4 blue.  Only problem is that I'm now KOS to any scorpion large and up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">FoB be very nice exp grinding zone for lvls 8 to 18 or so.<br />
<br />
You can fight in da &quot;pit&quot; and there is a smooth progreshion of <br />
mobs to kill as you lvl up.  Scorpions are very nice exp, easy to<br />
kill and don't run.  They have very bad loot thow.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having the Large and up size Sccorpions aggro - is a new &quot;feature&quot; that was put in after the last patch - not sure if it's intentional or an accident but it makes things a little more complicated. <br />
<br />
Sure gave my shaman a big surprise when I came back to farm some silks - nothing like seeing a 54 shaman with a dog and a million scorpions following all over FOB. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seriously, get your butt up to Kurn's Tower and find a melee partner, this exp is sick and the melee will love you.  Expect Paludal caverns type exp gains at lower teens.<br />
<br />
Exp slows at 16, cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>guima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agree,<br />
<br />
Kurns is best exp from 9-16+ I was hunting there even when most skelies were light blue. *Dungeon bonus*<br />
