<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love this ability. It doesn't do much for the fubar'ed dotting system, so you can still be the kiter at tables and increase crappy mana regen classes' (wizard/druid) dps. But at the same time, you can slow pretty much on incoming without agro problems if you have a good warrior, or mediocre/crappy knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would say its definatly worth it, and you already have some of the most important AA's...may as well get this usefull one :)   Being able to slow that much earlier on a semi poopey tank is nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i just know i saved raids several times by grabbing quick aggro over the clerics and giving them time to channel one or two more heals (or the encs to channel an important mez).<br />
I prefer dieing one more time to seing the complete raid wipe. This aa is certainly nice, depending on the playstyle, but i doubt i will ever take it.<br />
I mean, if you learned your timing on debuffs and slows over the years you shouldn't get too much aggro anyway  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think it's a pretty good AA, worth the points. I save more raids alive than dead, this gives me an extra slow attempt before the mob eats me.<br />
<br />
Even with SCS3 it's still very easy to get aggro if you really want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like it, but the price for SCS3 seems kinda steep.  I definitely notice getting summoned less on slows when the MT has not built up a lot of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's pretty good for slow aggro, noticeable. It seems to do nothing for DoT aggro however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over all it seems like the opinions have remained consistent.<br />
<br />
In other words, if you are thinking about getting it to reduce aggro from turg, then it will work for you, if you are thinking about getting it to reduce dot aggro, forget it.</div></div><hr />

i'm definately getting SCS before i get burning affliction .. at least untill sony fixes dot aggro<br />

It does excatly what meh got it fer; dat is reducin mah slow agro anda so not tankin raid mobs as much.<br />
Der was a sharp anda clear difference wit how easy it is fer a tank ta keep agro when slowin with anda with out da SCS.<br />
Inna GoD now when we is killin trash or exp'in, I kin Malos on Inc, slow it befores it hits da camp anda da tank normally gits agro right away.<br />
I kin also start chain nukin right away, anda da mob ignores meh, but den I figure dat is mostly cuz mah nukes blow.<br />
It does help wit DOT agro, but since DOT agro is so screwy, it dun help enough.<br />
If ya is a raidin type, I would strongly recomend gettin it, fer non-raiders well, more up to how much ya likes tank'n in exp groupers =-)&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">SCS is the one AA that I have no plans on ever getting, and I have over 650 AA.  There are days where I am the tank and I do not want to fight SCS to keep agro.  I have learned what I can and can not get away with over the years anyways.  With the tanks I play with, I can slow immediately, drop Bane and Anathma with CA3 and 40% focus, and heal as needed without stealing agro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For shaman, well for any DoTing class, SCS is really kinda broken.  It kicks in only on the initial spell cast, and lowers the cast agro.  For us, that means its lowering the aggro caused by the poison/curse/disease counters....<br />
<br />
<br />
Works well enough for slow or malos...but doesnt help us do extra damage at all, since hate is also generated by the damage per tick of the DoT...net effect is much less beneficial to shaman than one would think<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Any shaman that plays as tank - or has any need to snap agro - should NEVER get SCS.  As Ghwerig posted, I have saved raids by grabbing adds off of clerics - with SCS I would have either not been able to or maybe able, but too late.  SCS is on the absolute bottom of my list of AAs to pickup - UNLESS they make it /toggle-able.  If they made SCS turn on/off, then it would be the next AAs on my list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wish I could enable this on raids and deactivate it for groups.  I often take charge of groups and pull and/or OT if necessary.  Like someone else mentioned, I'm willing to take on agro to save a group or raid in certain situations.  This weekend, I was pulling a Rejarkian LDoN with Turgur's (of course) and a few times the mob went right for sitting casters.  I had to click the TA or pants to get agro again.  This never happened before SCS(3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">SCS  is very nice.  If you're a raiding Shaman you'll notice you die way less on raids.  Also, if you're a raiding Shaman there are lots of off tanks to grab aggro from clerics, so having less aggro is good.  I don't know about others, but even at 7.3k hps I can't off tank mobs very long on raids.  I'd rather leave that to the knights, so I can concentrate on slowing more mobs or patch healing.<br />
<br />
I can understand the argument against SCS though, if you tank a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am a raiding shaman and I use the agro snap (which SCS removes) to save the healers often enough.  I rarely die on raids due to slowing any more... typically, if I die, some/all of the raid is dieing too - due to over pull, under-preparation, or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Any shaman that plays as tank - or has any need to snap agro - should NEVER get SCS <br />
This is just absolutely false. I have had SCS3 since when GoD came out and it is still trivial to take aggro if and when you want to. You just need to know what tools to use.<br />
<br />
The benefits far outway any sort of negative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well - since I don't normally have Weaken memmed during a raid (can't spare the gem slots), and I don't want to use a DoT due to the potential of a MOB being Mezzed and my DoT breaking it, then please tell me, what &quot;tools&quot; am I not using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">disempower. cripple. i can gank agro any second of any day chaining disempower</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">how often do you have disempower loaded on a raid... and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If it's a vital part of your role in a situation to draw aggro, what tools that you currently have in your repetoire would suit that purpose? Turgurs? Slow casting time and unless you have a click stick has a recast time of 6 seconds. I would say that is rather a useless tool for on the demand aggro ;)<br />
<br />
I can't agree with the argument that not getting SCS is beneficial to us on the basis of needing to draw aggro. You need to draw aggro because you are tanking, you will load a spell best suited for that. Cripple probably would suit that purpose best if you don't want to use a dot. With a cast of 2.25 and recast of 2.25 (which is instant in regards to spell gem refresh), it's far more reasonable for quick aggro than ANY other spell you would have memmed usually.<br />
<br />
On the note of if SCS is usefull for shamans? Hell yes. The times you want to draw aggro are far far less than when you don't. As often as you could save a raid by drawing aggro of a cleric, you'd wipe a raid from doing your full potential on a mob without SCS. Also, clerics have far better tools to help themselves not to die due to aggro than using us as a speed bump.<br />
<br />
Also, all this depends on where you hunt. While I'd say that there really is no raid that not having is better than having it, there are quite a few raids that having it makes a huge difference.<br />
Hunt in Uqua or above where getting a slow on a mob without drawing aggro is imperative, where resists can run high and chain casting slow is required, then you understand the power SCS has for us. Because, in these raids drawing aggro will mean a raid wipe more often than not. Mobs that one round you more often than not then spawn adds when you die are no joke. <br />
<br />
Get SCS, while not as beneficial to us for all of our spells (dots), it's definately a huge boon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It even works in just plain groups. Slow in incoming in BoT, for example, would get me a quick round of smacks  (unless SK was pulling and tanking). With SCS2, Slow in inc never gets me smacked; if it bounces, by the time I recast it, tank has agro pretty well locked. And yeah, Cripple agro is out of sight, although I'm not normally in situations where I want agro.</div></div><hr />
