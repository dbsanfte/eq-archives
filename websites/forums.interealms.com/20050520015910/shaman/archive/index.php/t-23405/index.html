<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is getting close to Time enabled, in fact its all happening faster than we thought it would.<br />
<br />
So, I have decided to be pro-active and start researching Time now. (I used to be a Boy-Scout), but I've hit a snag....<br />
<br />
Theres crap-all usefull info out there about Time and how things work there, I'm interested in the instances, how often they reset, how the progression is laid out, are there mini flags between instances, and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
I thought google was my friiend, I even thought I had finally starte to maintain a credible relationship with this search engine, but alas 'tis not so...is anyone able to help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't have time to comment on the instancing and time limits in Time, but I will say- start saving all those LDoN points for type 8 augs  :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok if ldon is instanced content version 1.0 and GoD is instanced content v 2.0. Time is like instanced content .95 beta.<br />
<br />
It's kinda sorta instanced but not like any other zone your used to. It just kinda automagically keeps track of what each guild kills and unless things stop automagically working pretty much behaves like any other zone other than you need to be in the raid to zone in.<br />
<br />
Essentially respawn on phase 1 is 12 hours any other phase is 5 days. For phase 1 if someone has done it and gotten loot in the last 12 hours (euro guild during the day for example) you won't get any loot and will get place holders instead of named. AKA shadow of named bob instead of named bob. Same goes for any loot dropping named you kill in phase 2 or 3 if you don't totally win the phase and have to do it again. Phase 4 and beyond any god you kill stays dead no shadows anymore.<br />
<br />
I don't know what your server is like but on ours we have a time rotation. Yes a rotation on instanced, sorta, content. Only 1 instance can be up at a time so only one guild can be raiding in time at a time. Otherwise the respawn is essentially 5 days. Currently for us it's about 2 weeks from the start of one clearing of time to the start of the next with our rotation.</div></div><hr />

Ohhh time is nigh.<br />
<br />
As Emily Litella used to say, &quot;Never mind.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Barb, you guys down Xegony with any regularity yet?  We got a recruit who's a close RL friend of mine that needs that flag to finish up her Time flag.<br />
<br />
Anyway, about time.<br />
There's 6 phases of Time.<br />
Phase 1 has 5 trials that all need to be completed within 1 hour; earth air fire water undead.  Named drop loot if no one (your guild or any other guild) has done phase 1 within the last 12 hours.  It's kind of annoying that if someone else does time before you, you can't get your phase 1 loots, but once you've farmed time for 3+ months, you don't much care about phase 1 loot anyway.  It's all recruit and applicant and alt gear by that point really.<br />
You cannot bring any more than 18 people into a single trial area.<br />
Phase 1 is special in that if you ever run out of time in your instance, you have to re-clear phase 1 before you can resume clearing whatever phase you have left.<br />
Phase 2-5 has a ~5.5 day respawn time<br />
Phase 2 has 5 sections of mobs to be cleared (earth fire fire water undead), but there 2 sets of 2 sections can all be pulled to the same area (like, earth and fire can both be pulled to the earth OR fire trial), though I don't know which of the sections are together (undead is separate).  Named drop loot always.  1 hour to complete this phase<br />
Phase 3 has a lot of mobs to clear.  When you clear the mob type for a particular god, you get a new wave of mobs to clear for the next god.  Named randomly drop loot (about 33% of the time I'd guess).  1 hour 15 mins to complete this phase.<br />
Phase 4 has 4 gods to clear.  Terris, Saryrn, VZ, TZ.  4 hours to complete this phase (-1 hour for each god that you've already killed)<br />
Phase 5 has 4 sections of trash mobs to clear, then 4 gods to clear.  Rallos, CT, Inny, Bertox.  4 hours to complete this phase (-1 hour for each god that you've already killed)<br />
Phase 6 has Quarm to kill.  2? hours to complete this phase.<br />
<br />
You form your raid up in Time A.<br />
When you are ready, you zone into Time B and begin your raiding.<br />
There's a graveyard in Time B that you can enter if you are not in the raid to get your corpse/res etc.<br />
<br />
The zone is semi-instanced.  If say, Watchers is raiding Time, then no one can zone into Time B until our raid has left the zone for whatever time period needed for the instance to expire.  While our instance is up, only people in our own raid can zone in.  While our instance is up, the zone remembers what mobs we've killed (the gods or the phase we've gotten to).  When we return at a later time, the instance will remember our progress, and let us continue where we were before, sorta.  When we leave the zone, then say, you guys are raiding afterwards, you get a completely new instance to raid.<br />
<br />
As an example, Watchers had Thursday and Saturdays as our 2 days in the week to raid time (we do it all on Saturday now, but pretend we still need 2 days for this example).  I think Alarius has Friday as one of their days to raid time:<br />
Watchers raids Time on Thursday.  We finish clearing phases 1 2 3 and Saryrn and Terris thule in phase 4.  We leave the zone.<br />
Alarius goes into Time on Friday.  They have a separate instance.  All of phase 1-6 is up for them.  They clear the zone in 1 day.<br />
Saturday comes around.  We zone into Time, and have to reclear phase 1 again.  After that, we can run straight up to phase 4, and kill VZ and TZ, then carry on with phase 5 until we clear Quarm.<br />
Carry on through the week until Thursday comes around again.  We zone into Time, and clear phase 1 - 3 and clear terris and saryrn as they are the only ones up.  VZ, TZ, phase 5 and 6 haven't respawned yet.<br />
Alarius does their clearing on Friday with their own instance.<br />
Watchers goes back to time on Saturday.  We clear phase 1 as always, then clear the VZ, TZ in phase 4, and clear phase 5, but suppose we screw up and can't do quarm.<br />
Carry on to Thursday.  We zone into Time, clear p1-3, and Terris and Saryrn, then run through phase 5 because it hasn't respawned and do Quarm.<br />
When it gets to saturday, we will have to do p1, VZ, TZ, then phase 5, then we'll be done for the day since the other stuff hasn't respawned.<br />
<br />
As it is, I think Sojo on our server raids before Alarius does on their 2 days.  Unless maybe Sojo has taken over our Thursday.  I'm not sure.  Sojo could zone into Time at say 6:00pm on whatever day they raid it, clear phase 1 2 3 before 10:00pm, then zone out and let their instance expire for the day.  When it expires, Alarius could then zone in after them, do their own instance as far as they can get, and there isn't competition for the mobs.  The only competition that happens is for what guild gets time on which day.<br />
<br />
You'd have to talk to some of the officers of Enshadowed/Watchers/Alarius/Sojourners to find out what the Time raiding schedule currently is.<br />
I know Watchers does Time 1 day on Saturdays now, thus giving up our Thursday quite soon, if we haven't already done that (only 2 1-day clearings so far)<br />
Enshadowed as Time on Monday/Tuesday I think.  Alarius I think had Time on Wednesday/Friday.<br />
I think Enshadowed took over Sunday when SR left the zone so they could do Time in 1 day like SR used to do.<br />
Sojo has probably taken our Thursday spot, or taken Sunday if no one else took it, or raids before Alarius since Sojo starts very early, and Alarius starts very late.<br />
I don't know how you guys will fit into the zone, but Zenith is Australian or Asian or Japanese time, is it not?<br />
You guys should be able to prety much raid whenever you want to.<br />
You'll most likely want to raid about 12 hours after Sojo, since they start raiding so early that when they nab the phase 1 loots on their day, the named will have respawned so you can get their loot again when you go in about 12 hours later.</div></div><hr />

We are not doing Xegony yet, but he is next on the list so I'll let you know in game, or your friend could simply keep an eye out in our forum for Xegony raids...we are going to visit some of his mini's on Sat I believe.<br />
<br />
Get your friend to post in the General area and I'll ensure he/she gets help if we can provide it.<br />

Xegony isn't exactly hard.<br />
In fact, she's really a sissy.<br />
The problem with her comes from the fact that if your main tank dies, you wipe about 99% of the time because of cleric healing aggro after 30 minutes of chealing the main tank.<br />

gluck to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah like juujuu said if you haven't even tried xegony yet your still several months away from PoTime. Don't forget you need to do all 4 events to get at least a few of the right people keyed for xegony's island too. Corniav can be a really pain to get if other people are doing him too just because you can't try multiple times in a row multiple nights in a row. Way back when we did xegony for the first time we get setup there and would get 1-3 tries depending on how quickly things went south and then everyone camped up there and came back the next day. Wanna say it took 3 days of that before we got her on our second try on the third day. Rathe was a simular situation, camped there and tried for days in a row. That really made learning the encounters more viable especially since it can take a while to setup either encounter. Can't do that with cornaiv and if other people are doing him too it can be weeks between tries.</div></div><hr />

In your example you gave  guilds who were alternately raiding time (they can't raid at same time as you explained) but each of them was getting different content (due to repop rate in each instance).<br />
<br />
Is there any limit to the number of guilds that can be doing this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In theory, no limit.<br />
<br />
We were in a situation on Brell for a while that it *seemed* like there were too many instances running which *might* have been causing the first guild into Time on our server to get locked out from any instances at all.  For 2 or 3 weeks they couldn't zone in, while everyone else was ok.  We shuffled the times we raided in the week a bit, and it seemed to fix the problem, though we don't exactly know we were causing it in the first place.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Players don't really know. Sony hasn't given any info out and since the whole process just happens automagically it's hard to say whats going on. Things do get broken sometimes tho. Just rescently we had 2 guilds that some how seemed to end up using the same instance. Guild 1 went in and had some wierd issues (couldn't change groups or bring new people in I think) and ended up leaving phase 5 and quarm up. Guild 2 goes in and clears normally. Guild 3 goes in does phase one and then ends up going straight to phase 5 on what was thier first day on thier clear. Phases 2-4 weren't up. So how they seemed to be on guild 1's instance and later on in thier rotation they got the earlier phases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sony really needs to get off their asses and make the entire zone instanced, like an expedition.</div></div><hr />

So you have the confidence they can do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They probably just don't care.  Who's going to go through the pain of flagging to get into a zone that gives out focus effects that stop working properly at level 65?  Darn shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They probably just don't care.  Who's going to go through the pain of flagging to get into a zone that gives out focus effects that stop working properly at level 65?  Darn shame.<br />
<br />
Because there is more to Time than just focus effects. I doubt most guilds will be able to beat Uqua in just Elemental gear.  They'll at least need the HP/Mana from Time items to get into Qvic.  Also there are weapons and other non-focus items in Time that are well worth going after (TA, Darkblade, Veil of the Inferno, Prismatic Ring of Resistance, Eye of Dreams, Symbol of the Planesmasters, Shawl of Eternal Forces, etc)<br />
<br />
And &quot;pain of flagging&quot;?  Shouldn't be nearly as hard when your raid is now level 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">SOE doesn't want to make it instanced like an expedition, because then you could pharm the early phases forever, or even the whole thing.

<br />
Thanks for the overview, Juujuu.  I can't give you a rep bump because it says I already gave you one for something else :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm pretty sure that after the congregation they did of high end guild members a few months back, they wanted to make time fully instanced like an expedition.  They don't have it like that right now because of exactly what you said.  They need to implement something that remembers what mobs are up in the expeditition.  At least instances expiring right away is a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">SOE doesn't want to make it instanced like an expedition, because then you could pharm the early phases forever, or even the whole thing.

<br />
It would be instanced like Tacvi:<br />
<br />
Finally, I've laid the groundwork for a change to how the zone works. Although this is the least noticeable of the changes, it's also the biggest. Tacvi currently works like other dynamic raid zones. Players gain lockout times based on their accomplishments in the zone. I'm in the process of changing Tacvi so that it will remember which bosses you have killed recently. Then, the next time you start up the dynamic zone, the zone will only spawn those NPCs that would have respawned since you last killed them.  This will negate the need for lockout timers in Tacvi. The code to support this change is brand new and doesn't exist on live servers yet, so this change must wait until the next full patch to EverQuest before it can go in. In the meantime, the most noticeable difference you'll see is that all of the bosses in Tacvi are now up as soon as the zone spawns. <br />
<br />
Thanks all, <br />
<br />
Rashere<br />
<br />
If you clear phase 1-4, when you zone back in phase 2-4 won't be up, and phase 1 will not be dropping loot unless its over 12 hours since you last zoned in.<br />
<br />
You can't farm early phases over and over, cause they won't be up again till the respawn time is up.  You won't be able to farm it any faster than you could normally, but now the issue of having to work out time sharing with other guilds would be eliminated.  Multiple guilds could be in Time at the same time, each instance would be just like the GoD ones, completely independant.<br />
<br />
Now they need to get off their ass and do it, as well as change Ikkinz, Uqua, and Inktu`ta as well.   Having to wait days after a failed Barxt or failed Cursecaller event sucks.  Let us go back in to the zone as it was when we left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bingo, you are right Jaradis, this is exactly what they would need to do for Time to allow it to be instanced like GoD expeditions.<br />
<br />
Next question, in what decade will the pencil pushers allow the live team to retrofit this to Time...</div></div><hr />
