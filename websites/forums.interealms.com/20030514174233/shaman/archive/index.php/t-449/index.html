<br />
I'm approaching the point where I'm going to have to throw my hat in the ring on the vox/naggy raids, and i wanted to get a little information on tactics and such.  I have a few levels to go, but at the rate they're banging out, it won't be too much longer.<br />
<br />
I understand that our primary responsibility (besides bufflines and such) is run in, malo, slow and then get eaten.  Well at least sometimes, and I wanted to get an idea of how it all plays out from any of you who have done this before.  Things like tier casting mal line until one sticks and such, does anyone have an account of how they did what?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>baddwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't recall for Naggy, but forget to malo or slow Vox as it won't stick.  I heard from my Guild that only AE spell from high level player will stick, targeted Tash or slow won't, maybe lev 60 malo will but you better be faster than banishment.  For my 3-4 Vox raid, my role was:<br />
- make crap buff so AE dispell don't remove important spell to fast<br />
- Buff Sta, Agi, resist, HP, Str...<br />
- Heal my group and have a eye on the chanter (very important class to keep alive in the fight)<br />
- Die to Vox at the end of fight when all are dead and i am OOM<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've led 2 vox raids and particiapated in a total of 4 and this was the role I filled:<br />
<br />
<br />
Crap buffs for group.<br />
<br />
<br />
TGB Tumultuous str if we didn't have a 49 shammy or higher<br />
Buff Tuna in that case as well<br />
Go with the chanters as their healer.<br />
Heal and melee as I needed to.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I'd thought about it maybe I'd use a Morti Staff but I'm too cheap to pay for a low use item.  Vox, honestly, should be a cake walk if you get enough support.  She isn't all that tough compared to the gear I've seen most people with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but I slowed Vox twice in the same fight at 52.  Of course she AE dispelled it both times, but you shoudl be able to stick it, just don't count on it at lvl 46.</div></div><hr />
