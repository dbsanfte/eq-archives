<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a god site that describes the mechanics of the game? I know that no one knows, and that most/all the info out there is from people looking at and comparing logs, but I wuold like to see some educated guesses.<br />
<br />
If no site exists, can this group help me with &quot;facts&quot; or own experience?<br />
<br />
The things I would like to know are:<br />
<br />
Spell resists? How does my lvl, mob lvl, mob MR and the lvl of the spell I'm using affect resists?<br />
For example. If I cast a spell that is lvl 14 and I'm lvl 29, does that have a better chance of not beeing resisted than a lvl 24 spell?`<br />
What is most important in a mob its lvl (relative mine) or its MR?<br />
<br />
AC? How much AC is needed to tell the difference at low lvls?<br />
Example. At lvl 29 I have 500 AC. How much do I have to add to that to see a difference?<br />
<br />
I have not done any scientific (or any other kind) of studies myself, but to mee it seems that the all important thing is my lvl compared to mob lvl. My AC doesn't matter all that much (at least not if it is 500 or 550), and the resists are also purely based on the lvl of the mob compared to my lvl.<br />
<br />
Is this true? Is the lvl difference between me and the mob the MAIN component in calculating how much damage I will take and how well my spells will hold?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The short answer is yes, level is everything in EQ.<br />
<br />
The long answer ... well, things like resists and AC obviously do make a difference. The question is: how much AC is another level worth? or how much resists?<br />
<br />
For example, a level x person with 100 FR might resist a spell from a level x mob equally well as a level (x+1) person with only 80 FR.<br />
<br />
Verant, as far as I know, never releases this sort of information, so it would have to be deduced, as you say, from huge amounts of carefully controlled logs. And never forget the effect of the infamous EQ random number generator :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know about resists- it's something I'm pretty curious about myself.  I asked in this thread:  http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4362 but got mostly anecdotal evidence.  What I know is that each spell has an assigned resist characteristic, and that your number of levels above the necessary level to cast the spell comes into play.  It's a lot easier for me to get Togors to stick than Turgurs.  Check out http://lucy.fnord.net for up-to-date spell parsings.<br />
<br />
On the AC issue, here's something I dug up awhile ago (from http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1922 - lots of game mechanic'y stuff in that thread.)<br />
<br />
Warning:  This is pretty &quot;wonky&quot;.  :)<br />
-------------<br />
This is a description (from parsed logs) of how damage is computed, both for mobs and players. In the thread are a collection of values for mobs- and it seems many others could pretty easily be determined through parsing. <br />
<br />
One of the results of this investigation was an understanding of how AC soft caps come into play. Given that AC is one of the most important stats for a shaman (along with WIS and HP) understanding exactly what it's good for can be helpful. <br />
<br />
Here's the original thread: <br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelw...start=1&amp;stop=20 <br />
<br />
I'm enclosing the two important snippets. The first describes the basic mechanics. The second (way below) describes how these mechanics explain the &quot;soft AC&quot; cap phenom. I'll also throw in the mob numbers from the thread. Note that the mechanics can also be used to explain mathematically at what point will the damage bonus will make a faster inferior ratio weapon overtake a slower better ratio weapon (e.g. &quot;when will a Lammy overtake a Wurmslayer in effectiveness&quot;- not necessarily a shaman topic, but good to know nonetheless.) <br />
<br />
The snippet below is taken from the fourth page of the thread, and is a nice summary. <br />
<br />
============================================== <br />
<br />
Mobs do damage based on the following formula: (found by Joimster) <br />
<br />
Damage = Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x) <br />
<br />
Where: <br />
Bonus is a number assigned by VI <br />
Damage_Rating is a number assigned by VI <br />
x = integer from 1 to 20 <br />
<br />
*Warriors Defensive Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 10. <br />
<br />
*Monks Stonestance Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 2. <br />
<br />
============================================== <br />
<br />
Base damage for Characters is calculated from the weapon: <br />
Damage = round/truncate[Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x)] <br />
<br />
Where: <br />
Bonus is the Damage bonus listed on the weapon <br />
Damage_Rating is the Damage listed on the weapon divide by 10 (result is non-integer) <br />
x = integer from 1 to 20 <br />
<br />
*Some irregularities and possible explanations. <br />
<br />
1. Effect of High Strength on damage? <br />
(*Test in extreme strength differences of 75 or less versus 200+ to see more obvious differences) <br />
<br />
Q: Does extra damage from Strength add simply to the damage bonus of a weapon therefore increasing damage bonus and therefore increasing both max and min hit? <br />
A: Easily tested by using a character with Low strength and parsing min and max values and then buffing strength to very high and parsing min and max values. <br />
<br />
Q: Is extra damage from Strength added as an integer? <br />
A: Easily tested by the above method and seeing if the increase to min damage is the same as increase to max damage. If they are the same then damage from high strength is added straight onto the weapon damage bonus. If they are different it is possible that the extra damage from strength is added to the damage rating of the weapon and is therefore multiplied by <br />
20. This would mean that it may add 1 to your min damage and 20 to your max damage although it need not be integer values such as these as they may simply be rounded before damage is displayed on screen. <br />
<br />
<br />
2. Effect of higher level characters on damage? <br />
<br />
Q: Is this phenomena caused by higher ATK ratings, damage tables for higher levels or both? <br />
A: ??? Research and logs at each level required. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. Calculation for offhand damage? <br />
<br />
Q: Is the formula the same as the above with the damage bonus simply defaulted to 0? <br />
A: Put a fire beetle eye, lightsone in main hand and weapon in off hand and parse damage. Put same weapon in main hand and the fire beetle eye, etc in off hand and parse damage. What is the difference in min and max values? <br />
<br />
============================================== <br />
<br />
On the subject of Avoiding and Mitigating damage taken from a mob. <br />
(particularly mitigation) <br />
<br />
The raw data listed by Aauminki while tanking Seneschal Aldikar show that hits were indeed mitigated to min damage five times greater than the average and hits were also found at max damage two times greater than average. <br />
<br />
Indeed 37% of all hits that landed fell as either max or min damage. Note that the fact that this is a single set of data makes this unreliable but does point at an avenue of exploration. <br />
<br />
An initial hypothesis is that x (as used above in the damage by mobs formula) is not initially calculated as an integer between 1 and 20 but is truncated and/or rounded to this in the final steps of the algorithm. <br />
<br />
Example: Mobs ATK is compared to your AC and the R.N.G. is also used somewhere and comes up with a number. That number is then truncated/rouded and made to equal 1 for any number lower than 1 (therefore mitigating damage to a min. hit) and made equal to 20 for any number greater than 20 (making sure that the damage does not go above max damage). <br />
<br />
*Your AC is much higher than the mob's ATK: <br />
More x values are lower and in quite a few cases are negative values and therefore made into an x value of 1. Comparatively few hits are for max damage. <br />
<br />
*Your AC is much lower than the mob's ATK: <br />
More x values are higher and in quite a few cases above 20 and therefore made into a value of 20. Comparatively few hits are for max damage. <br />
<br />
*Your AC is almost even with the mob's ATK: <br />
The x values have a fairly even spread between most possible values except for the min and max which have more occurences than the others. Reason being that x may still have been in a bigger range than just one to twenty, i.e. -15 to 35. <br />
<br />
This snippet describes how these mechanics explain the &quot;soft AC&quot; cap phenom <br />
<br />
Then we can infer that if your AC is high enough that the non-random part of hits is mostly BELOW N = 1, you will get the largest spike at minimum damage. This represents a ceiling on mitigation AC, since the random component will always put SOME hits over (N = 1) and reducing hits further below (N = 1) doesn't help. If the random component continues to be reduced even when the modal hit is far under (N = 1), this becomes a soft <br />
cap. <br />
<br />
Secondly, we can infer that as the modal hit moves through the range (N = 1) to (N = 20), we see the 'sharp dropoff' effect that so many people have reported in the AC 700 to 1200 range. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, we can infer that if the modal hit is often over (N = 20) most times, you see the big spike at max damage. This represents a floor on AC, which has been observed but never really commented on. Since at (N = 20) the random component will ALSO be large, we find that the floor is softer than the ceiling. <br />
<br />
Here are the values from some mobs- pulled from the thread: <br />
<br />
Mob: DB, DI <br />
Cazic Thule: 200, 20 <br />
Doomshade: 110, 15.5 <br />
Gozzrem: 180, 15 <br />
Kromzek Captain: 60, 10 <br />
Lcea Katta: 160, 20 <br />
Lord Nagafen: 75, 7.5 <br />
Vessel Drozlin: 75, 12 <br />
Yelinak: 100, 25 <br />
Sontalak 125, 15 <br />
Avatar of War: 254, 45 <br />
Innoruk has: 20, 1 <br />
Phin Esprinap: 254, 5.1 <br />
Priest of Discord: 254, 5.1 <br />
Ssra - Elite Temple Guard: 151, 15 <br />
Ssra - Temple Guard: 99, 9 <br />
Vorash (LoIO final monk fight): 60, 6 <br />
Xenovorash: 70, 7.5 <br />
Velks Lab regular spiders: 20, 4 <br />
Talendor: 120, 19 <br />
Kael - Staff Sargeant Drioc: 45, 4.5 <br />
Kael - Dlammaz Stormslayer: 80, 21 <br />
Kael - the Sentinels scattered around Tormax's Castle: 80, 10 <br />
Kael - Yetarr: 110, 16 <br />
Sebilite Juggernaut: 55, 6.1 <br />
Froglok Reet (Insert Name Here): 45, 5 <br />
Myconoid (Insert Name Here): 45, 5 <br />
Trakanon: 120, 25 <br />
PoA - Thunder Spirits: 50, 5 <br />
PoA - Sirran the Lunatic: 256, 90 <br />
PoA - Azaracks: 55, 6 <br />
PoA - Gorgalask: 50, 11 <br />
PoA - Spirited Harpie: 60, 9.5 <br />
PoA - Watchful Guard: 50, 12.5 <br />
PoA - Heart Harpie: 75, 15 <br />
PoA - Avenging Gazer: 75, 14.25 <br />
PoA - Shimmering Meteors: 113, 8-11... depends on which one you fight <br />
PoA - Keeper of Souls: 1, 20 <br />
<br />
So, Cazic Thule can hit for 220, 240, 260, ..., 580, or 600. It turns out that kick/bash damage is DB + some integer, so CT could kick for 201, 202, 203, .... <br />
<br />
The min hit is therefore DB + DI, and the max hit is DB + 20*DI. <br />
<br />
It becomes apparent that we can derive these numbers from a max and min: <br />
DI = (max hit) - (min hit) / 19 <br />
DB = (min hit) - DI <br />
<br />
Good stuff!</div></div><hr />
