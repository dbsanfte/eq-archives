<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, not to polute too many other threads.   I'm just starting this one as a place to talk about just the problems with the new swarm pets introduced with GoD.<br />
<br />
As I understand it the probems are:<br />
<br />
1.  Too low of HP<br />
 <br />
     - They go *Splat* faster than rats in East Freeport.  (exageration, I think they were clocked at 400hp, right?)<br />
<br />
2.  Damage output is horrible.  <br />
<br />
     - First level of spell does LESS outgoing damage than preceeding required level of old Swarm damage.<br />
<br />
3.  Spell line replaces the original spell line as a Hotkey.   <br />
<br />
     - We lose the 'sled dog' team that has become indispensible for adding extra 'push' in many mob placement situations.  (also 'push' and more hits helped with Mob casting interrupts in a few situations)<br />
<br />
     - The new line would be good as an NEW AA hotkey that shares a refresh timer with the old.  Allowing for us to choose between &quot;many pets, more push, but less damage&quot; and &quot;fewer pets, less push, but more damage&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any others?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to reinforce what you said, the first level of this AA needs to do more damage then the full spirit call AA. And ieven if these are not supposed to tank it would be nice if they could survive a single ranger nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Brenlo already knows the spiritcall AA4 and 5 is broken, and has promised a fix (the hitpoints being set too low, for one).  I don't know how much of a fix (the damage is too low as well) but hey, it's a start.</div></div><hr />
