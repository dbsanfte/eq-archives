<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maltus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've recently picked up a 3rd account and paid to get my 49 shammy moved over to it....I plan to 3 box LDoN my SK (currently 54) my cleric (56) and shammy (49) once I can get the shammy and sk to 56. The SK is close so I'm not sweating him, but the shammy is still a few levels out so I'm concentrating on him atm.<br />
<br />
I have 2 options open to me....I can group the shammy with my main (65 Rogue...on same account as sk) and have him plow thru green mobs that are at the shammys level (did this in Lower Guk factioning the other night and it was ok but still kind of slow) or I can just old-fashined PL the shammy with the cleric someplace.<br />
<br />
Couple questions.....<br />
<br />
A) Which method will be faster? I like the rogue method because it's a lot less work but would be willing to go another route if it would be faster.<br />
<br />
B) If I do it with the rogue, would it be better to group the cleric with them for a group bonus or would it be faster just rogue and shammy? I tried it both ways in Guk and it seemed to go a little slower with the cleric grouped.....Not sure tho really.<br />
<br />
C) If I do that (considering these new &quot;Hot Spots&quot; ) where should I do the PLing?<br />
<br />
D) If I just solo the shammy with the cleric healing, where should I do that?<br />
<br />
Either way, I've been thinking dulak, oot seafuries, or CoM, but not really sure.....SURELY there are other spots for these levels with decent zone exp mods, no?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MMshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Loy will probably be your best option for pling. find one with around the level of your shaman, there are lists all over the net of the new ZEMs and level ranges. I would try and choose one that is barely dark blue to the shaman, ~level 35-40 mobs i would assume, rather than level 40-40 mobs. I have found in PLing my shaman that it is much faster with lower mobs.<br />
<br />
As for what to use, i would have the cleric and shaman grouped, and the rogue doing the work. Although it is a little bit less exp per kill, overall you are leveling two chars at once, and its always nice to have a cleric that is higher than the group (56 they get 96% rez too), so you are doing the same amount of work but getting more overall exp. Once the cleric is 56, i would drop him from the group and focus on the sham.<br />
<br />
Nurga and Droga were really quick exp for my shaman as i PLed him from the 40's to 60's, using any mix of 65 warrior/rogue/mage/cleric/bard/wiz/ranger.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and happy hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a heads up, once you hit the mid 50's...you will not be able to kill fast enough for even the collections.  I have a Shammy/Cleric combo and a RL friend has a SK.  There just isn't enough DPS, so we were forced to PL a Druid on his second box to make up for it (Also a good way to get the SK out of there w/o running everywhere).<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, a flawless run is always successful with about 5 mins to spare.  But, your trio is built for long fights, not DPS.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sadinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love LoY, I wish it were around when my shaman was in the 50s  :( <br />
<br />
I would go to Dulak and City of Mist for quest reasons....Dulak has spells (Stocisim and Temp) and City of Mist has &quot;pages&quot; that drop for Shaman's epic. <br />
<br />
Otherwise....<br />
<br />
I'm told Solb and The Hole are good, but I haven't tried either.<br />
<br />
Velks, the mines zone off of Dulak, Bards and nobles in HHK (few spawns though).<br />
<br />
Thats all I can think of at the moment. I would not recommend OOT though, it is good for solo exp but for grouping there at 49+ or even PLing it kind of sucks especially if someone else has the same idea - but it IS good for cash.<br />
<br />
In most cases I would recommend Rogue pulling for shaman with cleric  healing and maybe a little extra DPS. I've done a bit of PLing in my day with my shaman and my druid, it seems EXP is best when getting it solo even if you're killing faster grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">COM castle and skywalk(if u can get past the Breaver, perhaps fd it out of area with sk) most mobs here are 44-46 and have very low hps: they die FAAAST!   Theres 2kish loot off the named mobs that now rand pop in this area.<br />
<br />
Try grinding thro charasisi west wing, bit harder but not too bad.<br />
<br />
In theory city zones have a higher zem than many dungeons of this lvl.......depending on faction you could try felwithe guards, or dorfville near castle(dont pull the king tho........sumons 2 very MR bodyguards)<br />
<br />
POhate entrance is fun spot too........hmm u could fear kite mobs in POM, loads open space, and rogue backstabbin is worth a try!!</div></div><hr />
