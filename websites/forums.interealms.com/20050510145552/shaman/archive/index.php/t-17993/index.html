<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This may sound like a clueless newbie question, but I've been reading on this and thinking for a while... but I'm still very unsure on what to do.  I would rather get advice than guess, second guess and regret it.<br />
<br />
I'm almost level 58, with 6AA spent.  I belong to a smaller non-raid style guild.<br />
<br />
A guildmate has topor/malo waiting in the bank for me (was floored to hear this).  I do not have CannIV, and I'm not having much luck finding it.<br />
<br />
I 2box with a level 57 palladin and sometimes a handful of other guildies... when I'm alone, lack of DPS has been an issue for me.  I got LDON last weekend, so running adventures is no a possibility for me.<br />
<br />
My gear is ok, with very little work I could get my HP high enough to support cannV.  My wis is a little low ~150, but its not a priority for me yet.<br />
<br />
The obvious options are:<br />
<br />
1.  Get 59 then grind for CannV for the mana regen<br />
2.  Get 60 for topor/malo, then go for CannV<br />
3.  Get 61 for the cheap pop spells, then go for CannV<br />
<br />
The tempting choice is to go all the way to 61, but if I do that then if I will cross the 60 barrier into a tougher level of LDON adventures and I'm concerned that I won't be strong enough to run them for a while.<br />
<br />
Im dealing with several new issues at once here, any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">None of the above.  Get to 65, then go for AAs.  After you get 65, you never have to make the choice of exp or AAs again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">get to 61 cause 60-61 is about an hour of grinding :) fos rocks so does your pet both 61.. malo+torpor is sweeet.. so between your choices I say 61 is best :) getting to 65 too soon sucks if you leaving your guild behind... trust me you'll miss your friends that are still 57..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd probably go for 61...  60 is a pretty small level exp-wise, so you can probably blast though it in no time, and having the 25hp/tick regen and vastly improved pet from lvl61 will help you crank out the AAs faster.  With malo/torpor waiting for you, I'd definitely go for 60 at the very least, but I think going for 61 will get you enough of a bonus to justify that as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, my situtation was similar to yours, except I did not have Malo/Torpor banked. I went to 59, and worked on AA while I saved cash to buy Malo / Torpor. I ended up with Canni5 before I completed my spells for 60, and I have been very happy with the results. Canni5 is a game changing ability for me, I seldom even get low on mana unless I am close to dead as well (which fortunately is not a frequent thing).<br />
<br />
My vote would be do what fits your play style best. I have Malo and Torpor now, will be dinging 60 as soon as I can get a new PC (mine is headed rapidly to la-la land and has not been able to run EQ since Sunday).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't go for CannV until you at least 60.<br />
No one else has said it but I will. Unless you have stocisim or Torpor, CannV will be little use to you.<br />
I mean, your either going to be relying on someone else to heal but the 1900pt damage you take from it, or your going to be sitting regening it back, or casting a more expensive heal to cover the damage... all the above aren't really options.<br />
CannV was designed for torpor... Simple as that.<br />
Now with that said, with only six AA's you still have a ALONG way to go, or at least it feels that way..:)<br />
Until I had about 70 aa it felt like each one was such a pain...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would say go to level 62 (Much better spells) or do the BOT key quest in storms. Get your friends to do it as well or have them get to 62 as well. Grouped in BoT you will get canni V in next to no time. You should be averaging an aa every hour or so there. This way you can still make use out of torpor. I assume that you are unable to get Q? If so, just stop at 62 to get canni V before hitting the grind to 65. I did it, and I would do it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">62 so you can get into BoT and HoH. AA comes closer to about an hour and half, but still...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get 60 for malo+torpor, go group in POV/POS.  Yes, 61 gives you better stuff, but you get slightly less experience per kill and the extras you get at 61 really don't make the group that much more efficient unless you happen to be the healer :)<br />
<br />
I got through canni 5 aa pretty quickly at 60 then moved on to 61 for all of the fun POP aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have stopped at 61 to aa, but since I found out that the aaxp doesnt change at level 62 in FG I've decided to move up one more level before AAing in BoT/HoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have Torpor in the bank, don't even THINK about turning on AA experience until you are 60. You can't even imagine how much it will change your game. From there it's up to you, 62 to get into the higher planes isn't bad, but getting 65 done once and for all is a wonderful feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You guys are at least making me feel better about wrestling with this decision :)<br />
<br />
Craig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">go directly to 60 for malo/torpor.  At that point, I'd say if you solo, go to 61 for the new pet, then grind out your AAs.  If you mostly group, I'd go to 62 if your friends hang out in tier3 pop.  If they don't, I'd just stay at 60 and grind out AA at whatever camp you like the best.  PoJ basement is decent.  Lots of ethereal parchments drop there, so by the time you have some of the AA you want and are ready to level up, you'll probably have all your 61 - 62 spells banked anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your situation: a friend has Torpor and Malo banked for you. But you are not L 60 yet.<br />
<br />
The ONLY rational response to this situation is to get to 60 as fast as you possibly can. Stopping to grind AA at 59 would be foolhardy in the extreme. Why? Unless this guy is your brother (and possibly not even then), you CANNOT count on him holding those spells for you forever. What if your guild breaks up? What if he decides to leave it? What if he just ups and quits the game? There is a myriad of scenarios, all unlikely, perhaps, but all entirely possible, that would result in you never getting those spells from him. After all, they're sitting in HIS bank and not yours for a reason. He doesn't want to give them to you until you can scribe them. That's fine, it's quite generous of him regardless. But I'd make darn sure I got to 60 and got those spells scribed. <br />
<br />
After that... I'd go to 61 for the new pet and regen at least. Maybe 62 for Tnarg's mending and BoT/HoH access. <br />
<br />
Cann 5 is very nice, but I think you'll STILL want Cann IV after getting it, so it won't enable you to skip that search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Get CanIV, then get 65. I didn't waste a single exp point into AA before 64.  You will get groups based on your level, not on your AA.  Your can 5 won't do you any good if you keep bouncing the slows due to lower level.  Plus you can do your experiecing in BoT and start collecting ornate chain, giving yourself a great equipment boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bear in mind that as a rough rule of thumb, 5 AA's between 60-65 are about equal to one level.  If you have zero AA's now, you are looking at 27 to get to Cann V.  27 AA's for a level 60 will put them at level 65, EASILY.  So it comes down to a choice between 27 AA's and level 65.<br />
<br />
So... <br />
<br />
If you ever LFG, you want level 65 first.  Nobody picks a level 60 with Canni V over a level 65, although maybe they should.<br />
<br />
If you raid, you want 65 first.  Fewer resists and you're not the mob magnet.<br />
<br />
If you ONLY SOLO, or group with friends about the same level as you, and if you really can't wait, then it's up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Do NOT underestimate the amout of pain involved in getting Canni 5.  <br />
<br />
I stopped at 62 when I was in your situation (6 AAs, Malo and Torpor) and it takes **17**  AAs to get from there to Canni5.  If I could go back and change it, I would have waited until 65 to grind for those AAs.  It was THAT painful. <br />
<br />
I was able to stay grpd with friends, and accumulate many spells...but grinding for 17 AAs with NO measurable gain was EXTREMELY frustrating.  You will waste 12 AAs for 3pts of mana regen that you will never notice.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 is great, but get Canni 4 and dont worry about it until you get to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Getting canni 5 is PAINFUL...  It is nice to have but it is painful...  Yes you *DO* want canni 4 -- and torpor will let you actually canni correctly...  But being 58th you have no idea how good things become just by having canni 4 and torpor...  <br />
<br />
One other thing to consider with canni 5 -- do you have enough hit points?  Most people at level 60 would come very close to death using canni 5 at full hit points self-buffed and lose quite a chunk of hit points even fully buffed.<br />
<br />
Get 65 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">....a great equipment boots.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for my great equipment boots to drop in pov at the razorfiends, am I camping in the wrong spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For all those that think grinding 17aa's with no return is bad, go play a ranger.  We dont get our prime damage AA until 45 (AM3).  We have to do the 18AAs before class AAs and then another 27 for EQ/Am3.<br />
<br />
As to the question, if you have malo, get a ExtRange3 or 4 item.  In bot/hoh groups just try and cast malo asap and slow should hit 98% of the time.  At 65 I still get slow bounced on mobs that have been malos'd.  Go to 62.  When you ding, set your aa slider to 90 aa so you can build a death buffer and grind out Canni5.   At lvl62 you shouldnt have a problem getting a bot/hoh group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I really dont think stopping at 59 is wise. With torpor and malo waiting for you i dont know if you could convince me otherwise. My thought is get to 60 than decide your next step after that. 60 is nice , malo is sweet, and torpor is grand. 59 is .....well 59. More so since your not having to buy the spells. Grinding at 59 without malo and torpor is more painful than it needs to be more so when your not going to have to pay for them. With those two spells you can stay whatever lvl you want and makes getting malos and Q less of a priority. AFter 60 and scribing those spells you can choose when to grind lvls or aa's after that with less pressure. Griding to cann5 or 65 will be alot easier regardless of your choice with torp and malo. Staying at 59 is just torturing yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Unless you have access to level 65 spells, level to 64 first then AA. the 61-2 spells are rediculously cheap and powerful, the 63-4 spells will help you out and being level 64 will help you get groups. This is what I did and enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
But to answer the question on what you should do ask yourself 1 question, where will you be gaining these AA points ?<br />
<br />
If the answer is<br />
<br />
a) PoP with friends then do it at level 62 ( access to higher zones + our heal ).<br />
b) PoP with Pickup groups then hit 64 ( or 65 if you have at least 1 65 spell ).<br />
c) Grouping outside of PoP, then level 60. the difference in AA gained outside of PoP of level 60 vs. levesl 61 on is a large difference. at level 61 grouping with friends in UP, my level 60 friends got almost twice the AA I did.<br />
d) If Soloing outside of PoP 61.<br />
e) Soloing in PoP 64 for BoU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm about 1/2-way through 61 at the moment and plan to ding 62 with a buffer before switching to AA all the way to Cann V.  62 spells are a nice improvement over what I'm using at the moment (Focus of Soul, Group Wrulan, Boar, etc) and will be nice to use when I do get a chance to do events or LDoN with my guild.  But usually, I two-box my monk and plan to farm plat for a good long time to buy spells for Aemon and much needed equipment for both.  My play times tend to be sporadic and it's typically easier for me to just play as a duo for an hour or two than to try to get into a pickup group (which I avoid regardless).  I'll be AAing at the time, but the xp will just be a side-effect of getting plat.<br />
<br />
Essentially, I just want the spells available at 62, otherwise I would have stopped at 61 for AA.  My monk is gonna sit tight at 60 for a while to AA as well.  I'm just tired of my xp bar creeping along on regular XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As you can see, the answer to your question is different for each player.  It&#8217;s extremely situational.  If you plan to hunt in places like BoT then leveling to 62 first might be your best bet.  But if not then it&#8217;s not such a big deal.  As for leveling to 65, it works well for some people and sucks for others.  If you plan to group with other level 65 characters then you might want to go for it.  But if you group with lower level characters this can be a mistake.<br />
<br />
For myself, I leveled to 61 and then stopped for Canni 5.  I wanted level 61 for our new pet.  And I don&#8217;t regret that at all.  Our new pup is a lot more powerful than our earlier one and he&#8217;s helped me out a lot in both xp groups and when farming for tradeskill supplies.  My guild is very small so I didn&#8217;t expect I&#8217;d set foot in any of the higher zones, like BoT, any time soon so I wasn&#8217;t worried about leveling past 61.  During my seemingly endless quest for Canni 5 I managed to pick up Torpor.  I would suggest placing this spell high on your priority list.  Casting Canni 5 without Torpor is like eating pancakes without syrup. <br />
<br />
I only recently leveled to 62 and I&#8217;ve stopped again 1% away from 63 for more AAs.  My regular LDoN group are all level 62, so this works out very well for me.  As someone else said, do what works best for you.  You&#8217;re the only one who knows what will work best given your current situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">60 at least, but 61 is very nice for the Pet and 25pt regen.  FORGET getting to 65.  You already stated you are in a small, non raiding guild.  SO, getting to 65 has little importance to you because you group with the same folks night after night, right?  Yeah, I thought so.  Running to 65 is a major mistake for non raid oriented players.<br />
<br />
Personally, when I hit 58 a guildie came to me and gave me Torpor.  So, we're in similar situation.  I had 6 aa spent at that time (run3, regen3) and was working toward Can5.  After picking up my jaw, I immediately went 90%xp/10%aaxp (personally, I think there is a bug with going 100% in either category, but that's another story altogether) and ran to 60 to scribe Torpor.  I then changed to 70xp/30aaxp and level 60 just flew by.  Getting to 61 is SO much easier than getting to 60.  At 61, I went 90aaxp/10xp until I got Can5.  I don't regret it one bit and would recommend it highly.  Getting Can5 means you don't need KEI to keep up with LDoN groups or soloing.<br />
<br />
Take it from someone who's been in your exact (nearly) shoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I stopped at 61 (for new pet), have torpor, and now have Cann5.<br />
<br />
All I can say is ... OMG ... I NEVER run out of mana now. NEVER. I put AA exp on 80%, and when I got Cann5, I was 50% through 61, with an unlimited mana pool.<br />
<br />
I am quite happy with the way it turned out. There are tons of places to solo at 61, and LDoN adventures (with 60ish groups) net about an AA an adventure. Its fun, and you dont even notice the grind.<br />

Your milage may vary. :)</div></div><hr />

First thing I would do is get the spells from the guildie.  If he's holding them for you, why not just put them in your grubby little mitts?  It's not as though you have to be 60 to have them in your bank.   ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was a very helpful thread that I've read several times.  I thought it fitting that I come back here and provide an update.<br />
<br />
About three weeks ago, I finally saw cann4 for sale in the bazaar at 7k.  It was painful (I had seen it for 1k at level 55), but I borrowed 5k from an ex-guildmate and bought the spell.  I ground cash and paid my friend back two days later.  <br />
<br />
This weekend, I dinged 60 with my shaman.  The next day I caught the guildmate online and he gave me the malo, topor and several other spells I was missing.  I had not asked for the spells up until that point in time...  Some had suggested getting the spells ahead of time in case my guildmate changed his mind...  I didn't see that as likely, but in the event that it happened... I valued the friendship more than the spells.<br />
<br />
In doing the research on what's next for me I've found that the decision on 60 vs 65 is less painful than it used to be.  With LDON, the increased exp range, and plenty of &quot;revamped&quot; zones having higher level mobs, there are plenty of places other than POP that a 65 can grind at.  My concerns about having to equipment grind in green zones was dealt with by noticing that most of those situations were either already green at 60, would continue to be dark blue after 60... or the equipment was obsolete and I no longer wanted to camp it anyways!<br />
<br />
My current plan is to go straight to 65 with my paladin, and stop at 62 with my Shaman to grind AAs for cann5, as well as to look for a place that I can 2box and get spectral parchments for my 63/64 spells.  POJ basement has been good to me, and I already have the important 61/62 spells with 11 extra parchments banked.  <br />

Do yourself and your guild a favor and get 65, then all you hAve to do is work on AA's period. This way you have almost everyone option at your disposal. Itll be worth the wait. Canii 4 is fine until 65. With a KEi I hardly ever have to Canii as is in LDon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Another thing to consider is, what is the attitude of the people you group with on need before greed?  In most of the pickup groups I'm in, people are only in on rolls if they can use the item immediately.  So, if you are only level 60 and a parchment drops...if there is a caster that could use a 61+ spell now, they get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The only reasons for a shaman to stop exping and AA are (1) stay with friends in level and (2) Can't buy spells.<br />
<br />
I AAed at 62 some at the advice of friends, then got sick of AAing and zipped to 65.  AA is much faster at 65.</div></div><hr />

Malo MAKES you a raider. Unresistable debuff.  C'mon - who remembers their NTOV days and the difference Malo made?<br />
<br />
AA v level. <br />
<br />
Depending on YOUR play style there is no reason to stop at something less than 65. Oh sure you will have equipment worries, exp concerns, yadda yadda. <br />
<br />
But if you're playing with guildies - the power of a 65 Shaman is not to be denied. Even if you don't have your spells, as the top dog Shaman you're going to be first in line.<br />
<br />
AA's are like the icing on the cake. They are sweet, they taste good, but they are just the icing. Level is the cake.<br />

Oh and you owe that guildy who gave you Torpor and Malo. H-U-G-E.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I stopped for it at 62 so I could aa in BoT/HoH. Didn't have a problem getting groups in either zone at that level. Contrary to what everyone's been telling you stopping before 65 for aa's doesn't destroy your character or cause it to rain fire and brimstone or anything.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what YOU want to do. Heck I even knocked out the first rank of spirit call for something fun, and got the first rank of healing gift and scf at that time...don't regret doing either.<br />
<br />
Screw the cookie cutter aa plan everyone tries to force feed, it's your character not theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Finished canni5 at 62 and exp is back on to 65. For me I just couldnt wait any longer for canni5. Plus you stand a little taller when you have it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kusala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Get 65.  AA's are nothin compared to level and AA's come alot faster at 65.  Dont waste time on AA's.  GET 65 first level is everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Go for 65.  Doing AA's at 61 means 1pct AA per kill.  At 65, you will be able to handle mobs that give 5 to 8 pct per kill.<br />
<br />
I have a friend that went the AA route at 61 and the other leveled to 65 first then AA'd.  The 61 guy was getting an AA every 2.5 to 3 hours grinding hard and had 20 extra points by the time my other friend hit 65.  Once the 65 guy started working on AA's, he was making 1 point per hour and eventually closed the gap then pulled away.  That's when the 61 guy decided to go for 65.<br />
<br />
When I came to that point, I didn't even bother looking at my AA sliding bar.  65 all the way.</div></div><hr />
