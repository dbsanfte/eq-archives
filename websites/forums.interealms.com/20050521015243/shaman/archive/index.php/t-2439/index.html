<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a nice set of legs for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm level 49 with fair gear.  Though my AC is rather low for my level, since I need some Defense skill upping.<br />
<br />
I'm at around 750AC and around 180wis.  Will easily sacrifice some wis for some AC.<br />
<br />
head - Jaundiced Bone Helm<br />
Ears - Forest loops<br />
Neck - Ivory Collar<br />
face - Wyvern Mask<br />
Shoulders - Those shoulders from chardok sham only (help me here)<br />
Arms - Jaundice Vambraces<br />
wrists - RMBs<br />
Chest - Fungi (joo know joo want it)<br />
hands - Coldain/Jaundice (I only get 1 AC from the Jaundice, but mucho HPs from the Coldain skin gloves)<br />
Rings - 1 Velium +7 wis and the other Silver jasper (ya I know)<br />
Cloak - Acrylia<br />
waist - Smiters girdle<br />
Legs - gatorscale (I need improvement)<br />
feet - tribal warboots<br />
Shield - Spider web shield<br />
Melee - Spinechill<br />
Range - Some Luclin spear rogue/shammy adds wis cant remember the name)<br />
<br />
Anyone suggest something...especially for legs.  I'm looking to swap out the rings for some 6/65 rings in a bit.<br />
<br />
Oh.  I have about 5k to spend.  Not really twinked.  Just a good trader :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yer level 46, go get some PoH legs..free</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do Kromrif Military Leggings quest from Thurg, or Sebilite Scale Leggings, or Jarcrap leggings from KC.  All are a MASSIVE upgrade from Gatorscale.  Only ones that can be bought are the seb scale, but they're fairly cheap.  Out of the 5k you should have enough left over to buy a REIF (Rune Etched Icewurm Fang).  Use that to melee **** down and work on your defense.  Do it before 50 cuse after that mobs start hitting too hard for your to raise defense easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kromrif Military Leggings: Wt 4.00. +14 AC, +6 Str, +5 Wis, +5 vsCold, +5 vsDis, LORE MAGIC NODROP   All Classes. All Races, found via quest<br />

<br />
If you're a really good trader, buying a MQ of the Thurg quest legs would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your biggest power boost would come from a JBB, and if you spend a lot of time outside, a horse.  :)<br />
<br />
If you're looking to buy legs, dragonleg breeches are the way to go.  They're becoming more widely available, and have great AC.<br />
<br />
Off to a meeting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, dragonleg breeches. Nother vote here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rygorr is an improvement over Gatorscale (BLAH!), PoH legs, Seb Scale, JB, Jar-Jar legs, hell even Totemic are better than GS. <br />
I would do Kromrif Leggings quest, they are free. Speaking of which does anyone know the details of the Kromriff Military Leggings quest ? I tried searching on Allakhazam for it but only found Kromrif Wristguard quest. <br />
<br />
Another vote for Dragonleg Breeches here !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are up for a little more trading, you could work your way up to JB legs.  Think they are only about 20k or so.  I agree that a JBB would offer much more ban for your buck than anything.  Otherwise, I would agree on the Kromrif legs quest, basically the same stats as Hate. <br />
<br />
Get those 6ac 65 hp rings asap!  Also, goranga idols are basically free now and med totems are pretty cheap for some ac in your range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shield:  Get a better AC shield.  SBS<br />
<br />
Range: Goranga Idol<br />
<br />
Feet: JB Boots.  Better AC.. MUCH better ac.<br />
<br />
Hands: Coldain over JB, definitely<br />
<br />
Rings: HP/AC<br />
<br />
Legs:  Either MQ Dorf (if you can afford them and with a Fungi I'm guessing you can) or Even Rygorr is better than those.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest, improve the ac/hp as you can afford IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't forget your bracers. For 5k you can get 2 ac6/65 rings, a sentry bracer, a goranga idol, and an SBS probably. talk about some serious improvement for 5k.. I agree the legs need to be upgraded, but might as well improve 4-5 slots than just 1 (for this price)&gt;  Kromriff legs seem like a good idea.  I wore Barbed Legs/Dragon legs up until I got the POG ones.<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even Totemic bracers have better AC than RMBs - even with the new focus effect on RMBs (reagent cons. 3) mine are in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">These would be a small boost from gator legs and not hard to get if you hunt revs in Scarlet Desert, I've probably gotten one pair every other trip there:<br />
<br />
Sun Lord's Leggings AC 13 +5 Wis +5 Int +10 hps. <br />
<br />
Wold say it's more geared to a druid but it beat's the hell out of gatorscale. The guy that drops these is at a revenant camp I think just to left of the grey zone, maybe at the one just to right of Twilight Sea. Every revenant camp has at least one or two 'rares' most of which drop items for twilight sea quests.<br />
<br />
Bang for buck jasarth and Kromrif quest are best since.... they are FREE! :)<br />
<br />
Dragon legs are nice but they still seem to be pretty expensive relative to other dragonhide pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Loved my gatorskin pants..was sorry to let them go.<br />
<br />
How many other Iksar have you seen running around in pink hot-pants? :)<br />
<br />
--get Hate gear or Arctic Wyvern pants--first is free, second is cheap and you can make exp while collecting the parts for your tailor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another vote for Dragonleg breaches<br />
<br />
/rude Hate and /rude Kael.  30+ trips between the 2 of em, and I think I had all of 1 bracer from hate, and boots and gloves from Kael.<br />
<br />
I think my my progression went something like <br />
<br />
Patchwork - Ringmail - Totemic - Kromrif Military - Heavy Dragonleg<br />
<br />
The Kromrif were nice pants.  Hated, hated the leather look though.  I really like the 23ac and 8 stamina from the Dragonleg though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since shamans have a sum total of ONE spell that uses a reagent (not including imbue spells, which reagent conservation doesn't work on), the focus effect on RMBs is not exactly overwhelming in its utility.<br />
<br />
Getting totemic legs at 49 would be trivial. Rygorr would not be much harder, and pretty good xp.<br />
<br />
Camp the Karnor basement when you get to 51, no trains, and the jarcrap legs are the common drop of the jailor, who isn't all that rare (I once had 2 jailor bodies sitting side by side, 1 with jarcrap, 1 with the myrlo boots).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For Tribunal's sake PLEASE rid the world of another RMB wearing shaman... PLEASE!  At least your not wearing Banana Feet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If yer an iksar, Sebilite scale leggings are great! <br />
16 ac 6 wis for starters with other stats in there too.<br />
<br />
Also, the Specter Spiritualist in South wing HS drops Kylong Legs as his rare.  I get one like every dam time I go to HS I swear.  Sold last pair for 500pp.  Counted myself lucky to be rid of em.  All chain/plate classes can wear, 16 ac 4 str.  <br />
<br />
The Rev legs sound nice for a shaman coming up in the world.  Good suggestion Maboun!<br />
<br />
As for myself, I wear Wolfcallers.  In the bank are Jaundiced bone (fashion), Spirit Weavers (ugly as hell, dunno why i kept em), and Jarsath (thanks memories).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kylong was just made barb,troll,ogre and vah shir wearable I believe.  That might be another choice for ya.<br />
<br />
Think the leggings are ac16 4 str.<br />
<br />
Probably just better off getting jarsath or the kromrif military leggings.  At least they are free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Arriana - wrong! We have 2 :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just picked up Heavy Dragon Legs yesterday (23 ac, 10 dex, 6 sta)...quite happy with those.  Another viable alternative on hands would be Crystal Chitin Gaunts (20 ac, 10 str, 35 mana).  I agree about the goranga in range.....<br />
<br />
