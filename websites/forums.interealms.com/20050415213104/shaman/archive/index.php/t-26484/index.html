<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is more likely to land on NPCs now.*<br />

Cool. <br />
<br />
However, if this was supposed to be a blinder to dumb down the ridiculous panther nerf.. well, we all see how much of a blinder it was.<br />
<br />
The two issues in the title were largely neglected due to the huge cock-up with panther, i fear all too much that the blinder that is the panther nerf (which can not go through with the amount of feedback given) has blinded us to the fact that now we are, after this patch, lined up to be outhealed by paladins. <br />
<br />
To all shamans out there: (hi, how are you today? good? swell) This is NOT a good thing, never have paladins ever been dreamed to be anywhere near being the equivalent of shamans in this domain. So god damn it, if they are going to double nerf us with panther, let us not sit here idly and take the trifecta with an effective heal nerf (raise EVERY other heal class bar clerics).<br />
<br />
This patch has more doom than we once thought it contained. Now we do not fight for advances, we fight to remain as we were. This is sad, this is frustrating. Even if we get our wishes, we are no better off.<br />
<br />
To remain civil i've excluded the paragraph with swear words and colourful insults, but it deserves to be here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that this has just happened because they are looking at the healing of 2 groups of classes....Priests &amp; Hybrids.<br />
<br />
SoE in their wisdom have deemed that Hybrids are the easier group to just make a quick change, whereas Priests need to be looked at more closely.<br />
<br />
Obviously however they havent considered the time between the Hybrid healing going live and priest healing being looked at.....but hey that SoE.<br />
<br />
I have no way to confirm that the above is the case, but as they have made no change to the healing of Cleric, Druids or Shaman this looks very possible.</div></div><hr />
