I do agree that ToA should have the same haste % as SltW, but it's not a huge issue with me.  If a tank has a 41% haste item it's no biggie one way or the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree that Sony needs to take a closer look at our group spells and spell upgrades.  I don’t feel it’s unreasonable for a group spell to be at least the same quality as the single cast spell.  Nor do I feel it’s unreasonable for an upgrade to be an actual upgrade.  I just dinged 62 and finally scribed the spells that had been sitting in the bank for ages.  I was rather surprised to find that while Talisman of the Tribunal does increase the group’s disease and poison resistance from 55 to 65 over Talisman of Epuration, the duration drops from two and a half hours to about an hour.  Granted, this isn’t a game altering reduction, but it is very annoying.  I still have Epuration in my saved spell list.  With its much longer duration its one less buff I have to worry about refreshing while in an adventure.</div></div><hr />

Umm there is a big difference... 91% vs. 100% (capped). Thats like saying theres no diffeence between a RBB and 41% haste item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">-Group spells should affect all pets in group too<br />
The issue of group spells and pets was mentioned at the Chicago FF.  Apparently there is something fundamentally incompatible between pets and group spells, which is why you can't even cast a group spell on a pet if you have the pet targeted.  So a fix along these lines isn't likely any time soon.<br />
<br />
I would LOVE to see Talisman of Alacrity bumped up to SLtW speed....</div></div><hr />

This makes it a pain in the ass to rebuff people on raid, or to target beast lords.     They just recently &quot;Broke&quot; this too, not sure why.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">blood of nadox and tinny terror aren't buffs.  That's the technical reason for why they can't be /tgb'd.<br />

I personally think it sucks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Could be worse.  I am personally glad I got group haste I dont have to refresh every time I blink.  I have not heard anyone bitch about 91% haste vs 100% haste.  Most melee I know think along the lines of &quot;some haste &gt;&gt;&gt; no haste&quot;.  I use FA a lot, and that keeps the melee happy regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't say NO difference, said NOT MUCH difference.  And there's not.  It's about 10-12 dps most likely, or maybe 900 damage over the life of a 90-second fight.  Reasonable tradeoff for the convenience IMO, unless you're really up against the wall and staring a wipe in the face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with you weissblau. I guess I am just a 'lazy shaman' because I do ToA. But I would rather nuke and dot and melee than cast SLTW all the time. I usually group as a main healer with 5 melees and you are insane if I am gonna SLTW 6 times (pet). ToA has made many melees I group with happy. I used to make them /ran 100 for haste. Highest one got haste. Pretty funny when the cleric won it.</div></div><hr />

yes, this is outrageously annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>zakga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would like to say my understanding why we will not get group 60% haste.  Having owned the game for a couple expansions any time one class gets an upgrade or edges in on another classes grounds some one cries wolf.  For example how many people are complaining about bl's slow?  Therefore if you recall at one time group haste was a mythical thing. Heck ask any chanter that played during any of luclin and ask them if they had speed of brood?  What is speed of brood well it is one hard ass spell to get. Even harder than Remove Greater Curse in my opinion,(prior to ldon).  The best way to think of speed of brood is like torpor but reduce the drop rate by 85%, now I know someone is going to say but we had like 6 drop in one keel. YEAH right, what you smoking.  So how does this effect us, well we have group 50% haste, as an upgrade, btw, was an after thought for what we feel was screwing us with single target buff spells that did not stack with focus. And might I say is really not hard to get at all compared to kunark spells. or that dang levitation, or everlasting breath.  So Sony is kind enough to give us group 50% haste and well all i can say is thanks GOD!. Yes with ldon sltw might be better dps and some times i do, but I can always group haste and rehaste with sltw when I have mana or am in the mood.  But who would like to go back to only having sltw and fa ack, that thought just makes my skin crawl.  SONY is trying to keep some things for classes that make us different, with group 60% haste, that would just lessen the the enchanter, at least from their view. So be happy they gave us group haste, else we would all be complaining for them to take the dang spell out of our books or give it to another class.<br />

10 dps each personwhich could be gotten at the expense of not slacking off...</div></div><hr />

MGB blood of nadox would be especially useful in some encounters.<br />
<br />
Actually clerics pallies and druids can not mgb group heals. Clerics, druids and bst can mgb group HoTs (heals over time) aka buffs that heal like torpor or q does. Paladins don't have anything they can mgb other than brells or thier group aego like spells. Clerics can not mgb any of thier group heals like thier group ch. If it doesn't have an icon you can't target and you can mgb it because it isn't a buff.<br />
<br />
Wizzys and mages do have a couple ae spells but those are just innate to those spells and not related to mgb.<br />
<br />
Mass group BUFF only works with buffs. Blood of nadox and tiny terror are not buffs. The same goes for TGB, target group BUFF. If it doesn't have an icon it's not a buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm annoyed by the fact that I can successfully /target someone. However, if I then cast a group buff on them via /tgb they are out of range.<br />
/tgb should have enough range that if I can /target them, I'll hit them with a /tgb'ed spell.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I thought of that after I posted.  Touché and don't tell my melee, hehe.</div></div><hr />
