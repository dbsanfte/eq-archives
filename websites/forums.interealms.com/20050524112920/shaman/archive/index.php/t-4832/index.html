<br />
And yes, even though I did Woe and Envy many times, I did all the steps in sequence, including the Hole and Neh'Ashiir.<br />

If you skipped the steps by doing Woe and Envy I think that you'd find that you missed a goodly amount of fun content.  It's very gratifying to do it from start to finish the way it's meant to be  :)<br />

still working on mine, need Neh, Tear, and Rak....no skipped steps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I must clarify.  I did all the steps of the quest, start to finish (including the Hole, and Nah'Ashiir, and the tear I looted during a guild raid in Fear).  I just repeated Woe and Envy to be sure of my faction on the final turn ins.<br />
<br />
And no, the clicky thing doesn't yet work.  From what I've read its at 51, so just a few good hunting sessions away.<br />
<br />
I was still shaking when I posted.  Now I get to swap out more of my low AC wisdom gear for my high AC.  Thanks all.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great news!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">im jealous , i hate to admit it , but im truly jealous. im 52 and still no epic :(<br />
<br />
but... this isnt about me. Gratz my brother it looks well on you !! ;)<br />
<br />
on a side note , what tunic is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">btw , any tips on Hole and Neh ?  IM about to do hole with Neh right after ( maybe same night )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Congrats!  Getting the Spear at 51 was the best thing that happened to me, it made a huge difference in soloing Luclin--and other--mobs.  49 Pet+epic+ebolt=dead d blu thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">is epic insta cast ? Also is it resistable in anyway ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks Litgruv... its a froggy BP.  Nice AC and the wisdom.  The iksar bp is for when Cann dancing is called for.<br />
<br />
And according to the stats, its an 8 second delay on casting.  Definitely NOT an initial pull item.<br />
<br />
As for tips from the Hole, we pulled together 3 groups of upper 40s to upper 50s and just fought our way down to where the Hole mob hangs.  I died, the rest of my friends chewed him a new one.  Its in the same area where the enchanter epic mob hangs, so best to try and get an enchanter down there with you.<br />
<br />
As for Neh, the puller brought the Reaver that spawns Neh into the enclosed room before her lair.  When she spawned, my controls started to go nuts and I ended up attacking her, then as her pet.  Soon after a bunch of us went LD... <br />
<br />
Fortunately all was still recoverable when I got back, and I turned in the ring, she died, there was much rejoicing.<br />
<br />
Gloriana has done several very good walkthrus on the CoM parts, and I refer you to those.  We set up on the left side for Rak'Ashiir, and one of the enchanters there mezzed him soon after spawning.  = One dead enchanter, and I was along side him.  Death number one of the night for me =P<br />
<br />
We had 3 Mages, and all were stripped of fire resist gear.  We used 49 level fire pets, and according to the clerics they never used a CH.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I do understand the feeling Litgruv.  My ranger has been waiting about a year for his last drop in the plane of hate for his epic, and I still see younger rangers with both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Congrats on Epic.  As mentioned above, I haven't finished my epic as of yet.  Working on getting guild to go down to the Hole, 2 shamans in guild are at the same point as me.  Then off to CoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">is epic insta cast ? Also is it resistable in anyway ?<br />
<br />
Around 10 second cast time, resisted very rarely (although useless on mobs which are completely MR, of course).  The nice thing about the epic is that it does very little damage on the first tick, so during 2 mob fights, I like to start casting it on a mezzed mob while the tanks are finishing off the first mob.  Considering the cast time is so long and it takes a long time for the dot to do significant damage, I like to waste that &quot;dead&quot; time on a mezzed mob.  Did that make sense?  <br />
<br />
Heh, I just wonder why an enchanter would attempt to mez a newly spawned Rak considering he is indifferent until quest turn in!</div></div><hr />
