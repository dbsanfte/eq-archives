<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">after failing about 30 times on exe and one or two times on the other ones I am at the end of my rope.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate all and any pointers as how the hell one gets past this nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DPS!!!<br />
Did it last night for friends, went like a breeze.<br />
Group was : me 65, a monk 60, a rogue 61, a chanter 65, a bst 65 and a cleric 63 (botted by me)<br />
Key was : chanter stuns / mez, Bst Slows, rest dishes out. With all melee having fungi and regrowth, till the boss, the only real problem in healing was taking care of the chanter (thx thx Supernal remedy) and topping off everyone between waves.<br />
Also, we kept ALL of our peeps in melee range, which avoided some running.<br />
I tanked the boss without any problems and it was a very smooth thing. Only problem was on a wave with a named which we didnt take down first, had to have the melee use their damage dis. On boss, I began with WS till slow landed and afterwards, was fine. Finished fight with my ranger and cleric both at 40 mana.<br />
And our DD against summoned simply rules against the rock thingies. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telkontar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did exec trials 5 or 6 times before I made it. U know at the first wave if the group have enough fire power or not. DPS is what its all about but heres a few other things I learned.<br />
<br />
First of all u need a good chanter for quick mezzing. <br />
<br />
Have the main tank stand in the middle of the room to get agro. The rest keep to the wall<br />
<br />
Quick targeting by the tank is very important. Assist as fast as possible. <br />
<br />
Get a Mage to join. They can banish those rocks. And mem Exile Summoned to use if more than one pops in a wave or if the Mage get resists.<br />
<br />
Use your Calefaction, DS the tank, kick and do everything u can but trough the sink at the target cuz it at all counts. :D <br />
<br />
Have cleric med during the ever so short breaks between waves cuz its nothing more frustrating than to fail on a last CH.<br />
<br />
Hope this can help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is only one thing that matters in the Executioner trial, killing a Mob before the timer goes off.  I know, that's kinda like saying &quot;get MobX's HP to zero before your HP&quot;  but it really is kinda key.<br />
<br />
This means you need some DPS.  You can get it in steady amounts (Rangers, Rogues, Warriors, Mages, Beastlords etc) or in bursts (Wizards, Druids, Mages, discs etc).  Burst damage is great if people know the timing, nothing kills a trial more often than a bad streak for all the melee at the wrong time.  Steady damage is your staple as otherwise folks tend to run out of mana.  Damage Shields are invaluable as they are casted ahead and potions, poisons and other bufflike things can make a big differance.  Keeping transition times to nearly zero is absolutely key.  Your biggest threat in any wave is the first Mob, think about the spawns and position everyone properly.<br />
<br />
Now, the only other thing to worry about is keeping people upright.  I've done this through CC (Enchanter/Bard/root) and healing or through slowing/healing/DA/kiting.  ANY method is just fine, you just need to keep folks (and hence damage) alive.  AE slows/tashes/HoTs and such can be very potent in some groups while in others you want more traditional methods.  It really is not a normal camp situation, think about getting HoTs in ahead of the waves and consider using runes and non-tanks to focus the healing properly.  A Shaman tanking all the time in an exp group is a recipie for disaster, in a trial it might not be.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, think about who you have with you.  I've now been dragged to this trial more often than I like to think about and I've seen wins with the oddest combonations of players.  Everyone can contribute, it is simply a question of solving the basic premise.  You must do X amount of damage to any of Y Mobs in Z time.  Then you must repeat this without getting overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
As to the 'boss'?  When in doubt simply kite him around until mana permits a good beating.  He is trivial at that point as long as one healer and one damage dealer survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Andric d'Regor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rangers with exile summoned, mage speed and damage focs can put down rocks fast especially if mage or druid is also exiling- banish is resisted to often ou rmage said. with 61 hybrid casting bonus/mage items I was casting over 800damage in 2.6 seconds on the rocks. With a mage in there they went down so fast it was sad. Once they are down put full damage into the fiends, a good nuker helps here to finish off fast.<br />
as others said tanks in midle for start of each round, others over by the stage out of pop agro range, then all run into middle as tank will get agro on pop. Get good regen/damage shields etc, self heal between bouts. <br />
<br />
Things that break it:<br />
Casters MUST NOT PingPong<br />
Fast target selection - if tank selects 'wrong' one just kill it anyway - do not waste time re-selecting targets. also chanter/slower shoud be close to the action to avoid tanks chasing mobs chasing them - tanks do not have time to do a load of taunting pre-mes break so chanters shoudl stay close and take a few hits on the runes.<br />
Over healing clerics dying. Heals need to be conservative , hybrids heal in down time etc.<br />
<br />
Sure there's more but thoe were main ones I saw for groups failing when they had enough dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Utendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cleric to heal, either SHM/BRD AE slow or have an ENC chain stun, any melee to tank Executioner, 2 WIZ or other classes that have effecient AE/Rain spells+1 other any class.<br />
<br />
Put your Melee at middle of room before mob spawns, upon engage have everyone run near your MT. This part is very important as you want the AE to hit all the mobs. Cleric should use group elixir prior or at point of engage.<br />
<br />
All 4 mobs per wave should die well before the Exe even reach the platform. You'll get plenty of time to med back the mana after each wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dangoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2 AM 3 Rangers do quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks :)<br />
<br />
what about trials other then exe ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianwan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your haveing trouble with the cleric getting owned because of heal agro make the cleric use elixir heals only.<br />
Dont bother messing the mobs doesnt hit THAT hard, and all that accomplishes is that one resists the chanter gets chewed and requires alot of insta heals that makes the cleric get chewed ect.<br />
Paladin is an awesome tank for the trial since they can both heal the group(gets agro and keeps ppl up) and can tank good enough to not die.<br />
Other than that, kill X mob before timer runs out ;)<br />
and imo kill rocks first, their dispelling / tashing / slowing ect. can get annoying / serious, especially when they dispell aego / virtue off of the main tank.<br />
The boss is quite easy to kite when you know the trick, you can run him around the table all day, just notice when he turn to run the other way around the table so you dont run into him ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You have probably already looked here but some useful tips in  this (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14034)  thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One other thing I would recommend is to cure the Tash's between rounds with Cure Poison for the group.  This will help minimize the chance that anyone will get slowed and thus possibly make you loose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Seen and grouped with lots of mokb in pov so you must just have bad luck.  Try stacking the group as much as you can. Use a pally to cast prexus and get aggro on spawn.  Then have a chanter to mez them, cleric to heal, 2 rogues and yourself. you should own executioner with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Passed the exe trial today :)<br />
woohooo !<br />
<br />
wizard, mage, enchanter, paladin and wizard's cleric bot.<br />
<br />
had to kite the exe for a while till cleric got FM.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for the advice guys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You actually have about 5 more seconds to kill the first mob then the other three in each wave. This is because the exe starts off walking from the corner of the room instead of from the middle of the back wall. Using this info, instruct your nukers (if you have any) to save their mana for mobs 2, 3, and 4, in each wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">and use those 5 extra seconds by having tank grabbing the named in a wave, in case a named pops. They usually have higher hp. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Monyah Abacs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The secret are AE.<br />
Skip enchanter if you can and take a bard with ae songs. Keep all mobs near the bard and just kill as fast as you can. Wiz or mage also stands close to the bard. The bard will keep aggro I promise. Also make sure that cleric do the heals before next wave for avoid aggro. Best are heal on the last mob in each wave. Rangers snares frequently to help keep aggro. Take new target FAST !<br />
<br />
I have done all trials, and the AE works fine on all of them. Read also the specific tips on each trials so you know  what order to kill (Kill suffications first in hanging i.e)<br />
<br />
You also need focused ppl and not under lvl60. I also recomend not to 2boxing. Do the trials twice instead with one of boxed char at time.<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jezekiell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I havent completed a trial yet without me as main tank. On the other hand I've completed the execution trial about 8 or 9 times now getting other players flagged from my guild.<br />
<br />
I do this with a bard in the guild whom is now lvl 63. He handles mezzes, and slow/dps when there is two mobs left in each wave.<br />
<br />
Tangling weeds is good here with it's fast cast, and high arggo. Frozen Wind, Brushfire, and Exile Summoned are valuable spells aswell. Just burn your mana on nukes throughout the four waves, dont bother saveing much for the boss. And a ranger can easily tank the boss aswell.<br />
<br />
When I did it yesterday we had me, bard, mage, monk, cleric, warrior. And cleirc was pretty much at 80% mana between each wave useing mostly supernal elexir. And had about 20 - 30% mana left after boss was dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Taluvan Winterscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I MT yesterday for execution trial and with only a druid as healer =) Succeeded too (without me dying) =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calador Stormblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The absolute no fail group we've had is:<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Cleric<br />
Bard<br />
Ranger<br />
Rogue<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
The only time that configuration has failed for us was one time when earthcaller flat out refused to proc on the boss.  We've completed exe at least 10 times with that configuration with just different people.  Kiting the boss mob to give your healer time to med is a very good idea as well, you aren't on a timer on him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Only 30 times?  I grouped with a monk this week that eventually succeeded on attempt #76.  Sick that she even counted it if you ask me. :)<br />
<br />
Executioner is all about the DPS, many ways to get it high but that's all you need here.  At the end if you'e casters are near oom, just use tangling weeds to agro the big guy and run him around the platform - you can do this all day long.  On the trial I did, I tanked it and relied on mages/wizzies for max DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Locz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've won this a bunch of times helping guildmates.  We got to the point where we can win it 5-man, and cycle through anyone as a sixth (this is not recommended, too time consuming).<br />
<br />
Assumptions:<br />
NToV/SoL/primal gear, the BST has the spell &quot;Sha's Advantage&quot;, the cleric mems abolish poison and abolish disease and immediately de-Tash's and de-slows melees, the melees make hotkeys when they need de-tashing and de-slowing and use them.  Assume the ranger maintains a DS on everyone, buffs, and nukes often.  Only CLR/RNG/BST buffs are needed.<br />
<br />
Best winning team for the executioner with everyone at level 61:<br />
War/cleric/rog/bst/XXX/YYY  where XXX = rng/rog/mnk and YYY = any class (or empty, the trial can be 5-manned with this group)<br />
<br />
A well-played beastlord is the best secret weapon to winning a trial.<br />
<br />
We once even won a trial in which the cleric expired in the beginning of the second wave, leaving the only healers as the ranger and the beastlord.  We won another trial using a paladin as a healer.<br />
<br />
If you dont have a beastlord, the next best choice for that slot is a well-played bard, then a chanter or shaman.  But in these cases, the sixth person will have to contribute some dps to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am up to 29 attempts now myself. I hate this crap, have tried with just about every group combo imaginable, sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Cleric, druid/mage, chanter, 2 primal AM3 rangers, and a tank  of some description makes it very easy indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you find your casters running out of mana, grab them a rod, and have them click it after first and third rounds. It's a nice little help.<br />
<br />
If this was already suggested, my apologies :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">1. Everyone has to be able to target and assist lightning fast. Don't wait for an assist call. Just mash your /assist key until you get a target. Use /assist on. When the mob dies the MA needs to hit F8 and start attacking the next mob within 1 second. Everyone else needs to assist within 1 second. If that's too fast for you then you aren't meant to pass.<br />
<br />
2. Have all six people create a campfire around the mob so that when the mob switches (and they will seeing as how you dont have the time to taunt before breaking mez or cast agro spells such as ensnare/flamelick) they don't go running all over = lost dps.<br />
<br />
3. As a ranger, at least get level 61 so you can use your new anti summon nuke which does 725 damage I think.<br />
<br />
4. Have the cleric cast elixer before the waves starts to avoid a bit of agro.<br />
<br />
5. If you get to the 5th round then kite the executioner. A lot of teams will be oom at this point.<br />
<br />
The real key is #1 and #2 above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nalyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yea, I've made several attempts also, havent succeeded yet, most of the time its either due to a slow enchie, or a warrior who doesnt simply go from one mob, to the next, to the next, to the next.  It's ****ing amazing, it never fails, the trial starts and someone does SOMETHING stupid.  Whether its the cleric who decides to wait til the tank is at 1 bubble to start a cheal, or its the warrior who wants to take 10 seconds to get a few taunts off, someone always does something stupid.  And the best part is when we finish off that mob they always say something like &quot;did we lose?&quot; The funny thing is the game tells you, the prisonor has been executed, you have failed.  Oh, one more thing that never fails, the tank in the group always, ALWAYS takes brells over SoT, and I always want to smack the person, an extra 100 hp IS NOT going to make a difference, but an extra 2 dps WILL be the difference.<br />
<br />
I personally, have never gotten past the 3rd wave, I've just given up, and decided to get 65, and work up my tradeskills for the coldain shawl quests, and 9th coldain ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Locz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A little advice.  Group with a 60+ beastlord, and replace the chanter and shaman with melees.  Now you will have to try hard to lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eldakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Up to about 55 trials myself.<br />
<br />
Gotten to boss mob twice, had health on him to 15% and 5% b4 wipeouts, both times the cleric died while other people still up, but not for long after cleric died heh.<br />
<br />
The group that got him to 5% had a 60 and 62 rogue, 63 warr, 61 cleric, 60 chanter and 63 ranger (me). But we often had some bad luck, such as 3 slows in a row when we had 3 rocks spawn, etc. I'm considering trying again with a 65 bard friend replacing the chanter.<br />
<br />
Frustrating as hell, but i'm more determined to get through now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Denrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">All I have to say is armor break sucks 7 different kinds of @$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">DPS is pretty important, there is kind of a make or break point you need to reach that some groups might not have. One group I was in had just barely enough damage to win even if flawless, another group that was almost identical except everyone had primal (instead of epic level gear) made it much easier. Doing the trial right (quick assists, no ping pong, etc) is important regardless of how &quot;good&quot; your group looks, but if don't get a minimum level of damage, you're going to have a lot of trouble.<br />
<br />
Get full buffs before going in, even if you have to beg/buy them off an ungrouped shaman/enchanter/whatever. I've won with both an enchanter and shaman (but not at the same time). I'm sure bards and beastlords can do fine too, but go with what you are comfortable with. If you don't hunt with beastlords regualrly, here isn't the best time to start.<br />
<br />
Personally, I didn't like using archery here. Damage is too inconsistent.<br />
<br />
Exec is a wuss. Cleric started fight at 1m, had gained mana by the time he died with ranger tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Its only about dps, or at least the most common trial is. Every cleric can heal good enough for it, but you need dmg.<br />
<br />
Ranger 62 - 50 AA - BoF+SW<br />
Warrior 62 - 50 AA - BoC+Render<br />
Mage 65 - 150 AA<br />
Cleric 61 - 0 AA<br />
Shaman - 63 - 25 AA<br />
Monk - 61 - 25 AA - Epic<br />
we had no prob at all. Well when we realised what to do :) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>GeraltRiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">This was great fun!  Took us 3 tries and I wasn't sure if we had the dps, but we did it easily.<br />

We would have done it on the first try but I screwed up and died to the Executioner.  Second time, the chanter got many bad resists and cleric caught too much aggro when healing him.  Third time was flawless even with 2 named popping.  I have to say the key to our success was the chanter and the wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Did this 4 times in a row last night, and only got past the first wave once.<br />
<br />
Our group for the first 2 tries - ranger 60, ranger 65, shaman 61, druid 60, sk 61, paladin 60/warrior 65 (once each)<br />
<br />
Our group for the second 2 tries - ranger 60, necro 60+ (forget exactly the level), cleric 62, paladin 60, druid 60, shaman 61<br />
<br />
We got to the second wave once, on our 3rd try, so with the second group listed here.<br />
<br />
We had full cleric/shaman buffs, paladin or ranger buffs as appropriate, shaman haste for the later 3 attempts (enc haste was given to us for the first), and Trods supplied by a friendly mage for all four tries.<br />
<br />
We are frustrated. Either a key person (shaman or cleric) died, MA got charmed, or our DPS was just a hair under what we needed (prisoner died literally a hair before the mob we were on).<br />
<br />
Suggestions on how we can improve? I really don't want to be one of the people with 50+ tries on this :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">i tanked exe at 60.<br />

Katalaeia your problem is simply you are too light on DPS.  Get a rogue in there to help out.<br />
<br />
there cannot be any delay in getting a target and inflicting damage on him.   you have to pick your targets and start kicking their butt instantly.</div></div><hr />
