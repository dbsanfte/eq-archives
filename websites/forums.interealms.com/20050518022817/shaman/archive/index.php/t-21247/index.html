<br />
Don't tell me you're one of these STampa Cult members...:D.</div></div><hr />

MacDill ****ing owns. I went there for an air show a few years ago, loved it.<br />
<br />
No point to this post, really, just felt like commenting =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I liked the place.  I loved the community.  I hated working 12 - 14 hours 6 days a week for the last three years.  If I ever left home again, I'd go back to Tampa.</div></div><hr />

At least there's Ybor to have fun at - my preference for college will be to head north. If I can get in Northwestern I'm definitely going there, right near Chicago.<br />
<br />
Of course, a full ride to UF would be the win, Gators own all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ybor?  did they finally clean that place up?  When I lived on MacDill (about 12 years ago) everyone was told to stay out of Ybor.  It was one of those places where your parents made you lay down in the backseat and the doors got locked and windows rolled up.</div></div><hr />

Somewhat redone, still not totally safe during the dead of night, but definitely the party spot for Tampa nowadays.</div></div><hr />
