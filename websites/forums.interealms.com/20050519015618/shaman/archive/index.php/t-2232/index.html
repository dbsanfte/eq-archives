<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My finger is a twisted, cramped little digit, but I got from 7 to 175 Smithing in 4 hours for just 500p ;)   251 Wisdom and 254 Strength sure helped ;)<br />
Hopefully good enough for the 8th Shawl when I get there.  Now I just have to get my Tailoring, Fletching and Jewel Craft up. :P<br />
<br />
I even got 15 Alchemy skill hits on Grow potions this morning (for 2000p ;P ).    Can only get my Dexterity to 141 now since I can't stack it with Rage or HoS. ;(  But not sure if Dex is a secondary for Alchemy or not.   Was just afraid they're going to take away our cheap(ish) Grow potions for getting to 180.  Not to mention I'm optimistic that they're going to make it worth it to get to 180 skill someday!  Up to 157 skill and couldn't bring myself to throw away anymore Plat.    Much better than my last try really, which was 5 skill hits for about 2k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dex will stack with dex stat potions. That's another 25. That's what I been doin to max out my str for smithing. Got up to 201 before patch. Now to see what I gotta farm to get another 20 or so skillups so I can making da uber weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i'm still at 196 smithing, never hit 200 pre patch =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Helped a friend farm pelts and spiderling silks for days before she did her mass smithing tonight.  With about 100+ attempts, she went from 190-194.  She was kinda disappointed, but I think that's great considering how bloody hard it is to raise even four points around that skill level.<br />
<br />
And I think this smithing nerf's bark is going to be worse than its bite, but we shall see.  Maybe the new recipies will make it all worth it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I jumped mine from 175 up to 226.  Powerskilled on Ornate Chain to 222, then slowly hit Fine Plate...  at an average of 30 combines per skill point, the need for Leather Padding really slows you down.  Still, wonder what the new recipe's are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trivials on 8th shawl are 190 smithing.  I hit 190 and promptly quit.  Tradeskills are the debil!<br />
<br />
Only reason I went to the trivial level in smithing is in the hope that I can avoid having to use more soft leather padding.  The F***ing hound fur is rare, and then there are the F***ing farmers in WW now that are tracking down all the hounds and trying to sell the fur for 1000pp a fur.  They make me sick.  Since all the mobs are on a spawn table, and these tracking f***ing farmers are only killing hounds, 3 hours after a patch there isn't a hound in WW.  They kill the hounds, and eventually an elephant or cragworm spawns in its place until there are none left.  Then you have to start killing everything else and taking faction hits.<br />
<br />
In case I haven't been clear, I particularly loathe people that farm quest stuff to get them plat.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I just had the problem with the Hounds explained to me yesterday.  A number of my guildmates want to go and camp hounds in WW right after patch and I was like 'isn't there more exciting things to raid??'   <br />
<br />
Kinda like the old Hill Giant problem where no one would kill the junk mobs to make more spawn.  But a bit more serious as the mobs are alot harder and give faction hits ;/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh.  I went off on a rant and didn't finish my thought.  Tailoring trivials for the soft fur padding is like 172 or 175.  I'm at 155 from the 6th shawl, and I'm simply not going to go any higher unless it's on a combine for the fur.  Tailoring is even worse than having to pay out the rear for fur.<br />
<br />
I just wish I could pay someone else and not perpetuate some sick pharming bastige!  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Velium hound furs are 2k+ where I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">100+ combines for only 4 skillups? That is better than average. Average is about 25 combines per skillup at those skill levels.<br />
<br />
I went 212 combines of FP bracers and ornate chain tunics to go from 187 to 188 smithing...with 255 str and 175 wis.<br />
<br />
Took 187? combines to get to 189, then 8? more combines to get 3 more skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">After 4 days of intensive smithing I find myself much much poorer.<br />
<br />
But I moved from 176 to 242.<br />
<br />
Did Ornate Chain to 222.  *the sound of much plat being flushed*  A big thanks to the wizard who discintegrated the HQ ore merchant for me.  &quot;The penalty for running out of ore is death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then fs to 242.<br />
<br />
A big big big thanks to the many friends who ran around collecting cat pelts and spiderling silk for me.  They put together close to 25 stacks of padding for me, and dug another 5 stacks out of random folks inventories.  <br />
<br />
It was a big race, but I hit 242 with 3 hours to go to patch.<br />
<br />
Now all I need is a massage to uncramp these fingers.<br />
