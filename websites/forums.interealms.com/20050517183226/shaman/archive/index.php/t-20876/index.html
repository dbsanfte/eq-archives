<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ordee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
  I am going to ask a question that probably cannot be answered due to safeguarding secrets. I know the nerf bat swings rapidly in this game but I want to know this. How do players get a new character from level 1 to 65 so fast? I can see using damage shields and stuff but the Berzerker story just blows my mind. Level 65 is 3 days played is just unthinkable. Do they have a player on the keyboard at all times and just switch off for night and day play cycles? Do they have a entire team of players behind them to bring the creatures health down low and then memblur for quick kills? I know for a fact this question can not be clearly answered for many reasons like keeping the secrets safe from the nerf bat. I just would like to know in general how they are doing this.<br />
<br />
  Trumpy Tonics were a perfect example of a fast experience quest that went public and was destroyed soon before I found out about it. The coin quest in Lake Rathe got my Druid from 10 to 24 in amazingly fast time. The fast exp facts were relesed to the public and it was destroyed as well. I guess I am just wondering how players are making these huge level grinds so trivial in todays EQ? This is a question I know will bring allot of scowls or just be ignored completely but I am really curious on how they do it. <br />
<br />
Thanks and please be gentle with your responses,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some guilds all play the character 24/7. Once you get the character up to a point where they can enter some some PoP zones, the rest of the leveling process becomes trivial. Group with a necro/enchanter or some good soloing class and just leach exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Multi-boxing helps too. Most of the people I know who have high level berserkers had some high powered toons do the real work while the berserker reaped the exp rewards. Some questing was probably done, but having a high level character do all of the work cuts down on a lot of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It kind of depends on the class. I can get any class with an ae spell to 30 in 10-12 hours tops with just a ds from my 58 druid. Probably faster if I don't stop to practice spells. Once a toon is 46 just park em in a group in PoP and slaughter mobs, going up through the tiers all the way to BoT if ya got friends who'll help. Of course a druid with dire charm can dou/pl a toon all the way to 65 all by themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh yeah, well of course they are PLing him with high level characters. Melee classes are simple to PL. Use DSes, buff with high level buffs, debuff the mobs with high level debuffs, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a 51 War with 4 days played. One part of PLing that people have not mentioned is take the toons into dungeons for the XP bonus. I ran him round in Black Burrow till mid teens making trains, then just had my shammy heal and keep him hasted. After that it was off to Warrens, PC, Netherbain, Nejena, CoM, and KC.<br />
<br />
I still take him back to warrens on a regular basis, there are clicky snare items you can get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used my lvl 60 ranger to PL a gnome rogue to lvl 20 last week (got tired of finding tinkers to make stuff for me, so I'm just gonna make my own tinker, and gnome has to be 16 before you can raise tinker level).<br />
<br />
Started in Qeynos newb yard: DS the rogue, and get a cleric to throw Temperance on him. Then have him run around the yard tapping everything he sees that is white or yellow to him. Once you have about 10, drag them all back near the castle. Proceed to let the mobs beat themselves to death on the DS. If things get hairy, you can always run to zone real quick, but ranger heal keeps him alive just fine (and with Temperance and twink armor, he has well over 1000 HP anyway). Each pull netted at least a level, if not more.<br />
<br />
At lvl 5, move out into Qeynos Hills. Same tactic, pulling red bats, wolves, etc. Lvl 8 in about 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
At lvl 8, moved into Blackburrow. Pulled half the zone at a time, basically. Only trouble there was that the gnolls tend to run when they get hurt too bad, so ranger had to snare some of them. Another 20 minutes work.<br />
<br />
At lvl 12, moved to Paludal Caverns. Up past the loop a bit, pulled 4-6 mushrooms or bugs at a time, all red. Spent probably 75-90 minutes there, rogue level 20. Could have done 4-5 more levels there, if I had wanted to move down and do hoppers, but I didn't need him any higher anyway.<br />
<br />
PLing is easy. Just use the zones with the highest ZEM, throw the biggest DS on you can, and have a healer stand nearby. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The PLer can use the DS rather than the PLee too, also works fine. At higher levels, charm becomes an effective tool for resetting the damage so the PLer can finish off the mob, and from 46+ duo in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">(This guide assumes you have HUGE amounts of Plat and thr resources to handle 3 toons at once,  and can afford the best twink gear plat can buy.)<br />
<br />
Step 1.  Get your hands on a 65 Shaman and a 65 Druid.<br />
<br />
Step 2.  Make a melee toon.<br />
<br />
Step 3.  Buff Level 1 toon  (Dru/Shm HP Buffs, Chroloplast, Alacrity, SoW) and put the highest possible Damage Shield on that toon.   Then run around the Newbie zone killing everything you see at lightning speed.  Do not slow any of these mobs as Regen and DS will kill them faster and keep you alive.<br />
<br />
Step 4. (20 minutes later)  You should be level 5-6.  Port to West Commonlands and go to Befallen.    Appropriately Buff said toon like you did before... Have the Druid train EVERYTHING to the zoneline with AE Snare.   Zone Druid out and let the Mayhem ensue as the level 6 Supertwink aggros all the mobs and tags them for 1-2 hits each as they punch themselves to death on your Damage shields... Have Shaman heal as Necessary as Druid keeps DS refreshed.<br />
<br />
Step 4.  Paludal Caverns.  Do what you did in Befallen until about level 20<br />
<br />
Step 5.  Dawnshroud Peaks - Same thing at the Mushroom infested Ruins until 26ish.   Then move to Higher level wolves and Zelniaks....  Proceed to level 30.<br />
<br />
Step 6.  Kaesora...  Repeat the Befallen Process. Until about level 45.<br />
(you will be buffing your twink with all the beneficial HP, Haste, Regen and ATK you can, as well as Druid DS, around level 40 it also becomes beneficial to begin stacking Shaman DS potions with Druid DS. - Expensive, but effective)<br />
<br />
Step 7.  Dawnshroud again...  Druid Trains Rockhoppers onto Twink.  Shaman slows them ( NOTE, Until this time, you have not used slowing AT ALL!   This is when mob DPS/HP outweighs the benefits of Regen/DS tanking.) This is good till about level 50<br />
<br />
Step 8.  Old Sebilis, Disco Camp...   Lotsa LOW HP Mobs.   Train the twink like mad...  AE Slow with Shaman, and keep DS's up.<br />
<br />
Step 9.   Around 58, you want to move to Planar zones (Justice is good)<br />
<br />
Aternative - If you are in a Planar/Elemental Guild....   Get the Twink Flagged for Elemental Access (Plane of Fire)...   Begin PLing Twink there with Shaman/Druid after 60.<br />
<br />
The levelling after 47 or so will slow right down... but 47 should take about 30-40 hrs played. Also, if you wanna really amp up the levelling.. Add a Cleric and a pulling class to the mix.   Add Cleric HP and AC buffs... don't slow a thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can also easily twink almost any class without a helper. There are DS potions, good fast weapons, and Fungi for classes who can wear it (makes leveling tanks really trivial, clerics too). Temp adds like 800 hps, you can get another 300 hps with about 1K in the bazaar, shrug. Druids make it go lots faster though, DS and regen are pretty large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">traditional path has been to use druid DS plus full buffs to power you to 46.  i've often done that in less about 2 days' grind (I think anywhere between 15-20 hours played)<br />
<br />
with pop after you can enter planes it's quick to 65<br />
<br />
the fastest way I've found however is to crank up the DS on my bard and just go to town on the mobs.  hit the mobs with an AE for damage on the twink and even as late as mid 40s in velks or whereever it's a level every 3 pulls or so.  after that switching to AE kiting in pop will give you a level every 40-60 min or so all the way up to 60.  this is what I did with my BL.  although skills will suffer if you're not hitting or getting hit on your character<br />
<br />
the hard part is getting the AA's and good gear... assuming you actually are going to play the toon.  65 with no AAs and bazaar gear is like playing a lvl 50 toon in Kunark.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1-12 Qeynos aquaducts. it will slow down a bit after 10 due to lack of pulls.<br />
PC after the aquaducts, cant beat the exp bonus.<br />
HHK, still the best zem you can find for the 20+ crowd and you can exp there til 50+<br />
Mistmoor is a nice option for the pbae classes, a druid can yank most of the zone in one pull and just heal while mobs kill them selve on the ds, pbae class pops off a few to make sure and hit all mobs.<br />
with a druid taking the aquaducts/pc route you could be 20 in a few hours...litteraly.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh yeah high lvl quests, if you farm up the stuff for high lvl quests you have a big exp advantage. I have even used the pofear armor quests for that purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Druids + twink = fast levelling to 50.<br />
I have a bard I've levelled up relatively fast.<br />
Druids can give you their level 44 or 49 hp buff whatever level it is, and their 49 dshield.<br />
If the druid has the AA heal over time with dshield component, that's an even bigger benefit.<br />
If the druid has the AA that gives you a 600 point 1 shot dshield, that helps too.<br />
<br />
Level up to level 10 or so in whatever newbie dungeon like crushbone or blackburrow or whatever.<br />
Then, go to Paludal Caverns, and have the druid pull AE trains of mobs for your twink to kill.<br />
At level 25, a single pull of about 15-20 mobs would give 1/2 a level roughly, which takes about 15 minutes to pull, kill, and med back up.  (can't remember specifics.  it's been a while)<br />
At level 20-25 range go to sola and pull ae trains there too.  You level once every 20-30 minutes.<br />
At level 30, head to lower guk, and do ae trains to the bedroom area.<br />
My bard could handle trains of about 20 mobs at a time.<br />
If the AA heal over time dshield was up on druid, I could just barely handle 30 mobs.<br />
You can pull an AE train of about 20-30 mobs every 8-10 minutes with kill time and medding.<br />
At level 40, head down to the safe hall, and do AE trains of everything from the BR loop down to the Frenzy area and up to where the dars start spawning.<br />
You get a level roughly every 45 mins doing this.<br />
At about level 45, you can start ae pulling bloodthirsties and dars since the wans will be going light blue.<br />
<br />
Hit level 10 in about 1 hour.<br />
Hit level 20 in about 1.5 more hours.<br />
Hit level 30 in about 3 more hours.<br />
Hit level 50 in about 5-8 more hours (depending on stupid deaths).<br />
Ding, level 50 in about 8-12 hours time.<br />
<br />
From there, I'm not sure what's the best xp.<br />
You can probably go to nightmare, and dshield kill the mobs for good xp.<br />
Another possibility is to duo with a 65 melee with huge weaponry and tri-comp a healer out of group.<br />
You might just want to go somewhere like the hole where there's a big xp modifier and level up there.<br />
Old zones like SolB and Chardok are good places too due to no population of other people to train you and kill the mobs you want.<br />
You might also take an hour out of your xp time to do a poj trial, and go straight to pov to get even better xp than pon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I made a pally twink to 2box a few weeks ago. was really simple to level. I used a friends 54 druid and stuck him in PL til he was 20 (few hours tops). then I went to kaesora and just slowed and let him kill (had a fabled ghoulbane).<br />
<br />
right now hes 40 with under a day /played. if I was using a higher level druid. or could play 3 classes at once (not that talented) I could probably get him to 50 in 30 hours /played im guessing.<br />
<br />
another PLing tip if you want to invest some time/money. go to WL in velious and kill as many hogelrish(sp) as possible. get as many PBAoE mojo sticks as possible. make a bunch of DS potions and take your twink to some place like sola. train as many mobs as your shammy can take and stand in a corner. just chain heal your self to get firm aggro. have your twink use a charge of the mojo stick when they are at about 50%.<br />
<br />
depending on gear/AAs you can get a char into the 50s doing that easy very quickly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ordee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heya Juujuu,<br />
<br />
  It's early in the AM so I probably missing something in your post. I am concentrating on casters now when I PL so the method you used probably wont work for them. You have 20 something mobs pounding on the lower level guy you are PLing? How do you keep him alive with all thos things beating on him? I have tried 3 mobs and always get them on me when I heal the little guy I am powerleveling. I have problems casting though 3 Lower Guk level mobs pounding on me after I toss the twink a heal or 2. I am probably goung to use the DS potion and Druid 49th DS to PL my 51 Druid up a bit. I get the mobs and kill them with the Shaman while grouped with the 51 Druid. Druid just sits grouped up with the 65 Shaman and gets the exp for me killing. It seems to work ok in City of Mist currently. I used to use the higher level Monk and the lower player trick allot but runners with no snare makes life hell for the twink. Slowly running after the mob whiffing and getting resisted while he gets closer and closer to his friends in the other room heheh. Thanks for all the insight and I will try out some of the suggestions. I have a Manastone and a Fungi Tunic for the PLing sessions so it's kinda nice up to the LGuk and Sol B levels. <br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For powering a Wizard, or any other class that has a point blank AE spell, load up the fastest casting AE spell you have.  You only need to do 1 point of damage to a mob from the AE to get the xp if zero other non-dsheild damage is done by the pulling druid.<br />
<br />
If you don't have an AE on your twink, you can have your twink do the pulling (though it will be smaller pulls).  The twink runs around and melees each mob for 1+ damage before running along to tag the next mob.  As long as you have sow you should be safe to tag a fair number of mobs.  Bring the train back to the druid, and when the druid heals the twink, heal aggro should suck most of the mobs onto the druid who stands and tanks down all the mobs.<br />
<br />
Gear on the twink and the druid matter a lot as well.  My bard I was levelling up has about 2k hp unbuffed at level 50.  His gear is mostly tradeskill made cultural armor, epic, 40-50hp earrings, 55-65hp rings, cof, fungi, etc etc.  The druid I was using is full elemental plane armor with a bit of time gear here and there.  If you don't have the crazy gear like that to tank masses and masses of mobs, pull smaller trains.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are AEing stuff, pull mobs that are blue cons to the twink.  Red cons will hit your twink almost every hit, interupt most spells, and do loads of damage.  Blue mobs are pretty pansy compared to twinks when you are in the old world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember doing War Braids in OT for HUGE xp chunks during the 30s of my twinks. Outdoors, so a druid can easily PL you on the Sarnaks. As your faction goes up, I think you get more and more XP for the turn-ins, as well. If your an evil or neutral race, this is dynomite double-XP (once for the mob, and again for the braids). Also, its nice to get the faction for the OT hammer. Its &quot;Gate to OT&quot; for non-gating classes, pops you in close to the PoK stone, and they moved it so you dont aggro anything now.</div></div><hr />
