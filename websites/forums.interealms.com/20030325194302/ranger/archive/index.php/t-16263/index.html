<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lanx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cleric says DB (divine barrier) Does not stack with SoT, i logged on my twink and sure enough with SoT on, DB<br />
'does not take hold'<br />
<br />
i had other buffs on and no horse up, but had more than enough slots, anyone else hear this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Motius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My wife's cleric had been having this same problem, and I finally narrowed it down to Call of the Rathe (and Call of Earth) which is the problem.  The DS component does not stack with Divine Barrier (according to Lucy).  Its a real shame that a couple of pts of DS causes this to not stack :(<br />
<br />
SoT appears to stack fine with DB, however it does not stack with Yaulp (atk conflict).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zmek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same Thing happend to me today, Cleric Was Pulling HoT, also was Raid leader ,Pick up raid. I was almost booted from the raid becase she has SoT cast on her.  She said that her DB spell would not stick.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Motius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did some more testing of this today with my wife's cleric, and it seems like DB does not stack with SoT *OR* with CoTR :(<br />
<br />
I looked at lucy, and I cannot understand why SoT would be blocking DB.  It might be a stacking bug, going to /bug report it to VI tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dumahim Ashenbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Point being, SoT/DB is Fubar.  CotR/DB should be fixed.  There's ZERO reason for DB to have a damage shield.  you're invulnerable.  You're not going to get hit for the DS to do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea this is lame. I've had clerics complain about it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KelaanNorgale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Really hoping this gets fixed tonight, I'm getting very sick of having to warn clerics about it and then having to explain that &quot;it's just a bug that VI don't feel like fixing yet&quot;.<br />
<br />
Such a stupid pair of spells to have conflicting like that ...<br />
