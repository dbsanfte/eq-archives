<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or if I am in a party with a 62 Pal, a 65 Warrior, and a 60 SK, that if I am getting aggro on slow even after waiting a little bit that someone isn't doing their job properly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess is that since agro is going to get messed with for the next 2 months or so just snag the agro and find away to deal.  Err, find a way to deal, then snag the agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, someone is slacking.  Both the SK and the Paladin should be able to agro it off you without even blinking.  Its not the warriors fault though, they don't come close to knights in taunting anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chewy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I havent had a problem with aggro since patch, so I'd say it was your tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pally and SK are probably going low aggro to let the warrior tank, but warrior can't outtaunt cheese.<br />
<br />
   Talk with the group, get them to agree on pally or SK tanking while you slow, then transfering aggro to the MA.   If SK snares, or Pally stuns it on inc, then you can get out a slow and still not have aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know I'm not alone here with this thought. . but isn't it a tad messed up that the Tank IE meatshield IE Warriors aren't given the ability to keep aggro over the SK or Pally?. . . . hope they fix that some time. . seems real wrong tah me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, welcome to the living hell that is the warrior's lot.  They are pretty bent out of shape about it as well.<br />
<br />
Although I must say that if a 65 warrior can't hold aggro he's probably doing something wrong anyway.  My wife's warrior is only 61 and can usually hold aggro (or get it back very, very quickly).</div></div><hr />
