<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off Id like everyone to understand that this is my opinion and while you may feel the need to slam/roast me try to do so in a constructive manor..My view of shaman is slightly different from others..This is how I see the Shaman and I welcome your ideas.<br />
     To me, the shamans first and foremost job should be to buff his party members and himself.  Once the buffing is done, he should conscern himself with doing as much as possible to reduce the ability of the mob to inflict harm upon the party or shaman himself..To me this is where the shaman is hurting the most..I would like to see spells that truely do just that..<br />
1. A blindness spell that actually works and lasts.<br />
2. A silence spell..A castor cant cast if he cant speak the words of the spell so to speak..That would rock.<br />
3. A better slow, one thats less reisistable.<br />
4. A cripple spell that really makes a difference.  <br />
     The bottom line to this line of speak is just that a melee type mob that is slowed, and blinded and even &quot;crippled&quot; is going to be much less a threat to the group.  A castor mob who cannot speak ie is silenced is going to have to resort to melee and thats a tanks dream come true..Caster Vs Melee in hand to hand...You do the math.<br />
    Thirdly Id like to see mana effecinet nukes or DoTs that hit hard and fast, to keep track with the new game play that seems to be what EQ is shifting to..<br />
     And lastly, and this is where Im probably going to get flamed is healing..  Personally, I dont want to be the MH, or AH..I like to have healing when I need it and from what I have now at 63 Im fine with it..Its seems to serve my purpose well..If I were to keep my healing and get the affore mentioned Id be one happy camper..  Better DPS would be nice but IM not holding my breath..<br />
     To me the shaman should Strike fear into the hearts of the enemy when he see's me take the field of battle..But, then again..This is my humble opinion and I welcome constructive feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2. A silence spell..A castor cant cast if he cant speak the words of the spell so to speak..That would rock <br />
THAT would ROCK~<br />
<br />
I have never had the guts to post my opinion on the sham because i have always felt that i would either get flamed or there are other more well spoken people out there who pretty much say the same things i am thinking.  Here is my opinion though (you inspired me :) )<br />
<br />
1) Like i have seen many times before (just saying i agree with it) an AA or some innate abililty to 'strike through' a mobs mitigation, once again giving us an upper hand on slowing.<br />
<br />
2) Faster more hard hitting nukes that are WAY less resisted (after malo(s) at least)  Im so tired of getting 1 nuke maybe 2 on a mob if im lucky in most groups from hard LDoN to GoD. (like 1200 pt nuke in a cast time of 5 secs? is that reasonable?)<br />
<br />
3) Not a better slow per-se...but make tugur's faster casting, keep the 75% where it is, that is great, but make it more like a 2 sec cast so it is actually effective (at least a little) in the faster content of the game today.<br />
<br />
4) This i might get flamed on, BUT when slow is resisted, IT NEEDS TO RE POP FASTER (imo at least) i hate spamming the gem till i can re cast while the tank is being eaten alive by an un slowed mob, OR the mob is mostly dead by the time slow lands because of the 6 sec re pop, make it re pop like the rest of the gems (what is it, 2.5 secs or something?)<br />
<br />
5)  Ok, im having trouble figuring out how to word what i am thinking.  Here it is in rough form.  Make slow almost un resistable by reg xp mobs.  SO we can get the mob slowed in the first few secs rather than 10.5 secs into the fight (malos casting time+re pop+slow casting time 5+2.5+3=10.5) when the mob is almost dead.  <br />
I am not saying there that all our spells should be like this or that malos should not be needed at all, BUT if our slow were to land that much sooner into the fight we would be so much more useful in the world of 30 sec mobs.  Keep malos needed for things like making nukes and dots land and stuff...just make slow way less resistable. (i hope that made sense at all, i know what i am thinking in my head..its just hard to get it out in typed word)<br />
<br />
6) IF you insist on malos being needed then PLEASE make it faster casting.  <br />
<br />
I cant think of anything else atm...really tired from lack of sleep and stuff...Please feel free to disagree or what not..critisim is always welcome as long as you're not mean :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They tried this with a paladin silence spell some time ago. It was so broken, as in cleric CH BP from Kunark broken, that they took it out a week or so later.<br />
<br />
3. A better slow, one thats less reisistable.<br />
<br />
Check the GoD slow, -40 MR mod, faster cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those GoD spells are for those who are at the higher level and are very very difficult to obtain..We want fixes that are attainable to all shaman without having to wait till 65 to make em usable..As for the pally spell, just becuase it was broken before doesnt mean it cant be made to work now.. If we dont ask we will never know what we can or cannot have..Personally Im not looking for fixes for just the 65+ community, but rather for shaman in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For the most part, generally speaking, if slow was put back in the game &quot;as intended&quot; and encounters were redesigned with fights lasting longer with less mob burst dps, then shaman healing problems would be over. What we have would work. Strange how SOE doesn't see the ripple effect of negating slow usage to shaman healing inefficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2. A silence spell..A castor cant cast if he cant speak the words of the spell so to speak..That would rock.<br />
<br />
<br />
I LIKE this.  Some mobs can do this already.  I think it would have to have a timer with a per-tick resist check similar to the root line of spells.  Giving it a fixed duration might render a lot raid mobs laughable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would be nice if I knew that the devs might be looking at this.  Some of these spells may have been tried before but they can definatly be tried again...Exspecially that silence spell..I remember plane of torment vividly and those birds still irk me..lol..</div></div><hr />

Keep your disposition about you and present yourself clearly and you're fine. The 7th boards are where I'm free to be an *******, I try to be helpful here :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2. A silence spell..A castor cant cast if he cant speak the words of the spell so to speak..That would rock.<br />
If not a silence then a mumble spell.  Maybe something that would increase the &quot;chance of fizzle&quot; rate or extend the cast time of mobs spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had an idea, not sure how workable it is, but a cold based dd with a slow on it. I mean, it would be something completely shaman, it would allow us to do damage, while slowing, and it could have a say -40 cr check on it so it lands. The slow dosnt need to last long, because if the DD is high enough, it can be something you would chain cast and keep the mob slowed.<br />
<br />
It also kind of works with the idea of a cold nuke, if something is covered in ice, why the hell wouldnt he move slower?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like the idea of a mumble spell and really I would liketo see more curse based spells. Somethingthat lowered the effective casting level of a mob would be cool too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dunno about you but a DD and a Slow is kinda lots of aggro.. like if you proc on your weapon right after a slow lands you usually get aggro..<br />
<br />
And then you have to mem 2 slows (for those non time shaman).. because if you mez the mob a dd is no good.<br />
<br />
I think of insane spells as being cool.. like a dd 600dd -50cr 5 second casting time heals 1000 to targets target. I could nuke and spot heal woah :) numbers don't necessarily have to be those but you get the idea..<br />
<br />
Some situational spells could be cool too... or a way to link 2 spells. a 1.5second casting time canni 4 (or similar) that also casts root on target for those soloers :)<br />
<br />
Or a DD that roots.. dd hits first then roots ooh lol broken.<br />
<br />
Or canni 6, 6 second casting time, keep same ratio say -4000hps for 2400 mana that heals for 600hps/tic for 6 tics self only. <br />
<br />
You know your ass is going to cast a hot so why not integrate that thing into 1 ability. Can even be AA canni 6, aa self only uba hot, aa combine.<br />
<br />
or hastened poisioning, something that makes your dots go at twice their rate (2 hit/tic) for an amount of time like 2 min reuse 10min..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't want to be a killjoy, but NOBODY who posts ideas for new spells ever gets results.  <br />
<br />
All we can hope for is upgrades to our current lines of spells that are more in line with what we need (effectiveness wise) to contribute in a group.<br />
<br />
The magic of discovering a new type of spell and learning to implement it is gone.  <br />
<br />
HoT line, Focus line, Avatar Line, Stat line, Slow/cripple Lines, Haste line, Canni Line, DD Line, DoT line, Heal Line, Utility.  I'm sure I missed a couple, but I'm tired...<br />
<br />
Look at the new Omens spells, you don't see any new nifty damage mitigation buffs or &quot;Silence&quot; spells... your best bet if you want to see this kind of innovation is to join a game that is just starting up.<br />
<br />
Omens is their one big shot to add in some up-to-date spells with more revolutionary stuff such as mitigation buffs, endurance regen, etc... and based on lucy list, all they are doing is upgrading the current lines.  They should cut to the chase and call them ShamDD I,  ShamDD II, ShamDD III, ShamDD IV, etc... because other than names and spell hit messages, that's all they are... statistical upgrades to keep pace with stronger mobs.<br />
<br />
I see so many good ideas (well, mostly bad ideas, but a few good ones)... but all they do is make me sigh and lament that they will most very likely never come to be :(<br />
<br />
And Grizlor is most definitely right about posting.  Nobody should feel like they can't speak freely, it's just all about introducing those ideas in a friendly, constructive manner, and making sure you've thought them out, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1. A blindness spell that actually works and lasts.<br />
Have you tried throwing a Malo on your target and Blinding it?  Our Blind spells work fine.  The reason most folks don't use it is they don't want their target running off and grabbing a half dozen friends to come over for tea and crumpets.<br />
<br />
3. A better slow, one thats less reisistable.<br />
Now, someone already pointed out Balance as the solution.  Additionally, as a Shaman at 63 . . . where are you seeing undue resists at?  I don't have any problems sticking Turgurs in BoT after a Malo.  I can almost get away with just straight up Slow in PoV now.  At L62.<br />
<br />
I like to have healing when I need it and from what I have now at 63 Im fine with it..Its seems to serve my purpose well<br />
Once again, someone who isn't really reading or understanding what most of the folks here are talking about.  It would be difficult to find a Shaman anywhere that will argue about our class balance from L1-64.  Seriously.  We are fine for the first 64 levels!  I love us from 1-64.  It's post 65.<br />
<br />
Have you run up against that mob that quads for 1000 and is only slightly slowable?  How good is your healing against that?  It's not even enough to save a Cleric who grabs aggro.<br />
<br />
No one will flame you for having an opinion.  What you will be chastised for is not understanding the issues.  You'll find that the most frequent targets of flame are the ones who simply don't understand the issues.  It is difficult to do so without having been there.  I am somewhat fortunate in that I have a RL friend who is far more advanced that I am in his character.  I've seen those 1000 quad mobs and what they do to his Warrior.  I've seen BL's and Ench's try to slow them.  I can see what is in store for me.</div></div><hr />

First off and formost I fully understand the issues that shaman deal with..You ask me how is my healing? My healing is fine..Im one of the &quot;those&quot; would would rather see the shaman move toward being a more offensive type class, better dps, better dots that cost less and cast faster, that sort..EQ has enough healers IMHO and doesnt need any more..If I wanted to be a healer per say Id have made a druid or Cleric..I slow, I debuff, I buff, I dot and I heal...Thats pretty much my priorities, with the exception of buffing which is a given..I dont mind the ability to heal in a pinch Im fine with that.  I have two other 65 lvl toons who allthough they arent E-flagged have been around the block so to speak..Just becuase I dont agree with the class fixes, doesnt mean I dont understand or comprehend the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;If I wanted to be a healer per say Id have made a druid or Cleric.&quot;<br />
<br />
When many of us made our shamans, shamans healed fine, and choosing a shaman because you wanted to play a healing class wasn't off the agenda at all.  Far from it.<br />
<br />
So some of us have every reason to value the shaman's ability to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I want to keep bringing to the table what I brought to the table in the old world, Kunark, and every expansion up to later stages of PoP.<br />
<br />
I want to be the lifejacket of the group. Without heals that make a difference that is impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I respect those opinions, and they are very valid.  Some chose the Shaman to be healers.  I chose the shaman for different reasons all togethor..While the healing is a nice perk its just not as important to me, as it is to others.  Id still like to see shaman get faster, cheaper casting DoT and debuffs and nukes..That and an improvment in dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you wanted those things, you should have rolled a Necro.  I almost did.  But in the end I wanted to be a healer.<br />
<br />
No matter what, Shaman have never, ever been about DPS.  Sure, there was a point in time where we could bring respectable DPS to the table.<br />
<br />
But let's talk about today.<br />
<br />
DoT's are worthless in today's EQ.  No, really, they are.  I suppose if you are soloing, they are worth something . . . but again, if you are soloing the DoT's we have now are fine.  I mean it.  They're fine.<br />
<br />
Adding new and different debuffs will cause imbalances in the content.  Look at the trouble Slow has caused.  You think the Dev's want to open ANOTHER can of Turgurs?  Me either.<br />
<br />
Adding nuke power to Shaman is pretty much off the table . . . too many other classes already nuke.  And frankly, we don't have a leg to stand on for getting nukes.  We've *never* had them.  Our damage dealing has *always* been DoT's.<br />
<br />
So that really leaves only one viable path to improving our class, and it takes us back to the roots of Shaman . . . healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I guess Ive just never been one to settle for the old line of &quot;Its allways been that way why change it.&quot;  I know Im not the only shaman out there who list the ability to heal as not The most important attribute associated with the class.  I accept that healing is only 1 factor to conscider..As for the soloing..Our dots are mana expensive and very very slow casting..Id much rather have faster casting more mana efficient DoTs and better DPS along with cheaper nukes..Not saying change the onese we have just ease up on the cost a bit.  If we happen to also get better healing along the way then kudos to us..Its not what Im after but I never turn down a freebie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one thinks if shaman as dps that's how it should be. When I think of shaman I think of defensive powerhouse. You can't beat it? Bring 2 shaman and wreck it. Until we get better heals that's not the case, you can't beat it? get more clerics or druids cause the shaman can't keep up with half a round from that guy...<br />

<br />
That's a good point, and I saw on the EQLive boards using Brenlo tracker, in a reply to the thread about the Shaman Summit responses having the poster worried, he noted that by giving a substantial upgrade to any form of mitigation of mob damage to one class would spread to the other classes wanting it, which would spread to them having to in-turn increase mob DPS to compensate and retain challenge, throwing the whole thing into a nasty cycle.<br />
<br />
Still, I think that they could have the buffs mitigate damage or increase avoidance by a percent large enough to be useful, but small enough to not be imbalancing.  I mean, come on, a 75 percent slow is a GIGANTIC cripple to mob dps, and I'm really not sure what they were thinking when they implemented that... I can't imagine, from a design standpoint, putting in a slow any stronger than 30 percent.  It got to the point where slowing was almost a necessity, and therefore, other classes received versions of it.  I wouldn't compare a theoretical 5% damage mitigation buff, however, to a 75% reduction in mob attack speed... they are vastly different quantites.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Picture what Warriors felt like with the release of PoP.  Knights started tanking non-PoP raids because of faster aggro and the lone Warrior on the Raid got his shot when you hit a boss mob.  Even better, sometimes you needed a second Warrior for Rampage or a failed healing rotation.  At best, you needed 3, just because it was safer to have a Tertiary.<br />

     While I appreciate most of the feedback I got, with the exception of the one posted above, mostly do to the fact that opening a reply with a direct insult usually turns most people off from the beginning..  While I agree with some, and vehemently disagree with others My origional idea was a fresh shaman out look..Not an old school one... Still I want to thank those who responed in a constructive way..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I had an idea, not sure how workable it is, but a cold based dd with a slow on it. I mean, it would be something completely shaman, it would allow us to do damage, while slowing, and it could have a say -40 cr check on it so it lands. The slow dosnt need to last long, because if the DD is high enough, it can be something you would chain cast and keep the mob slowed.<br />
<br />
It also kind of works with the idea of a cold nuke, if something is covered in ice, why the hell wouldnt he move slower?<br />
<br />
Um DD plus slow in a single spell = Rez please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I do agree with the original poster, I have seen shaman more of a buffer and debuffer role than that of a main healer though I guess everyone has different visions for shaman, and the most popular one seems to be to have shaman as a main healer<br />
<br />
There are so many ideas they can add, and I like some above. I mean another one they could add is a confuse, in ff8 this confused a mob and attacked another one. Although arguably this could be seen as the same as charm. <br />
I don't think adding a 2nd debuff role will especially be hard, I mean they could make blind miss a person more and noticable. Then when mobs mitigate we have another option. Sure you may argue that those mobs are meant to be harder, but I think we should still retain the ability to add an effective debuff.

Look, you see what happened to our greatest debuff . . . and you can be assured that any meaningful debuff we receive will go the same route.
