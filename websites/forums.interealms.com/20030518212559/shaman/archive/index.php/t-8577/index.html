<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know you need to be level 60 to single pull, but what level group can hunt here?  My guild was interested in hunting here to try to get a bandit ring or three.  We have a 51 War, 51 Shaman (me) 52 Necro, 2 54 Wizards, 51 Chanter, 52 SK, and our highest clerics are 44 and 45.  We also have a 49, 48 and 45 druid and the Sk also has a 51 rogue and we have a 47 rogue who also has a 52 ranger.<br />
<br />
Is it doable with a group of these?  Or is this a 55+ zone primarily?  Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the bandits arent all that hard per se, but you need a monk to get them solo.  i dont believe the bandits are single pullable even at 60, thats only for mushrooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've hunted bandits at lvl 52 - 54ish.  Hardest part is pulling them...we tried with a paladin and a monk and neither one could single.  Usually got 4 at a time, which made it more fun anyways.  Make sure you get a good CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I pull bandits solo with my 55 monk or my 55 chanter.  Of course, the chanter has to use Wake of Tranquility, hehe.  Shrooms can be pulled with Lull before 60.  Now that Lull spells are based on CHA, I have not had a single aggro with my chanter.</div></div><hr />

Its indoors, correct?  So harmony won't work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Harmony will not work in this zone, correct.  But Wake of Tranquility (ENC 55) is an AE-Lull that does work indoor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lull does wonders in here. Duo'd with a 58 Bard last night, had almost no problem getting singles, with the rare double, usually a repop that chain aggro'd. <br />
<br />
Fun place!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How is this zone for exp? I'm looking for a place to go other than HHK and the same old places I've already tried. I'm 54 btw.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and doesn't shadel bandit rings drop here? I could really use one but I don't have the money to buy one(saving up for a horse).</div></div><hr />
