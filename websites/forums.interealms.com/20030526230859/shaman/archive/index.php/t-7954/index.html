<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been soloing guards in HOH, and while cripple has been pretty much for the most part usless in soloing in the past. In HOH ( and probabaly in POP period ) soloing it seems to make a noticable difference. Ill probably run some parses later to see if its true or it all in my mind =)<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice same thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i know my clerics complain when they dont see me casting it in POP now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know that when I was in KD arena on the weekend, as No.3 shaman on the raid (overkill heh heh), I decided to cast cripple (No.1 did malo, No.2 did turgurs, enchanter was tashing), just for fun - let me tell you, the mobs just don't like it - I think I was getting summoned as much or more casting cripple than I do when I am casting turgurs/malosi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know, I know it reduces the mob's stats - but I'm not sure it actually affects the mob's dam output. I never seem to notice a decrease in damage afterwards.<br />
<br />
Like, if you give your pet focus, he's not going to hit harder than his max damage. (Dex does make him proc more).<br />
<br />
Add to that the nasty aggro cripple gets, and I'm just not sure it's worth casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dunno if this has any bearing on the question, but I know for a fact that you can snare mobs by reducing their strength enough.<br />
<br />
Chanter friend snare kited dorfs in Butcherblock when he was low lvl using this, just to prove that he could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cripple seems to be most effective mitigating a level desparity.<br />
<br />
First, as many have noted, using cripple on lower level mobs seems to have no effect.<br />
<br />
But, in the low 50s, my 49 pet + spear dot could kill a crippled IG when if I did not cripple, dogdog would die. When I duo'd, tho, cripple didn't seem to help the melee. To me and the melee, the IG was blue, but to my pet, the IG was red. <br />
<br />
I have assumed, based on those observations, that that phenomenon had to do with the fact that your level verses a mob's level is a huge factor in how hard you hit and how hard a mob hits you. In lowering AC etc, cripple seemed to help mitigate a level desparity - in this case, between the pet and the mob - while doing nothing for me or the melee. Somewhere I have an old parse that shows one specific Sea Fury hitting a 38 ranger (even con) much harder than me at 51 (very blue) even tho we had the same AC, to bolster this.<br />
<br />
So, based on what I know about cripple and level difference, I would guess that the mobs you are fighting are around even con and up, and that cripple might actually have a noticable effect.<br />
<br />
People also surmise cripple lessens rampages - tho I don't know this to be true (tho I cast the spell /shrug)</div></div><hr />

Cripple is exceptionally good for stopping or significantly lowering the regularity of:<br />
<br />
flurry<br />
rampage<br />
any other proc<br />
<br />
(yes, flurry and rampage are procs)<br />
<br />
remember the giants in PoS that proc that nice 1000pt mana drain? cripple em and feel the difference :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slayerfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I duo, I cripple the Mobs. Not for the Tanks sake, Lord knows he doesn't need it, but he's a SK and our combined Pets really enjoy the Cripple. The Mob does NOT, so I try to time it to not get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buffy_Toon_Slayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I 2box my paladin and my shaman.  paladin level 58 and shaman level 54.  I have started using cripple almost all the time.  <br />
I was killing sun revs in The Grey the other night.  After Slow and malo i then cripple.  MY paladin has no problems keeping the agro with stuns and a shiney new axe :)  Anyways.  If not crippled the paladin would loose health faster than if crippled.  I would have to heal 4 times(sup heal) without cripple.  With cripple 3 heals would get it.<br />
<br />
Just my 2c worth.  I will always cripple(if i dont de doing it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As far as I've seen in PoP Cripple is a great asset. Pet is able to do considerabley more DMG and combined with Turg it keeps thier hits for max DMG and procs way down.<br />
<br />
#1 problem with Cripple=ubertaunt. <br />
<br />
I generally slow when a mob is at 90%. Cripple when they're at 80ish. I get aggro 3 out of every 4 times. Even waiting until mob is 70%... aggro.<br />
<br />
I don't mind, as the tanks I group with generally have a real good handle on getting aggro back.</div></div><hr />

Well its true Focus or HoS won't increase his max damage if im not mistaken Strength affect chances to hit for max damage. Ive seen it, pet is hitting for 53, 23, 12, 12, 12, 30, 53.  After Casting HoS on him 53, 53, 43, 53, 24, 53, 50.  So over all DPS is increased makes it worth it to me to cast it. Also cant see where stamina makes much difference on pet maybe its just me, but when i cast on myself i get a open space on red health bar cause stamina increases hp's but wont heal them,  Cast on Pet Bar never moves.<br />
<br />
Now if there was a way to use a potion while targeting Pet, would love to be able to put a damage shield on my puppy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">on a side note, when you get into higher end raiding.  some mobs rampage (hit an extra person/people).  Cripple really reduces this.  also it can reduce the amount a npc will proc something (Exiled's DT for example in ssra).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does cripple reduce the probability of mobs Enraging?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">no, mobs always will enrage if they are designed to at 10% hp from everything i've seen.<br />
<br />
If you have a % target hp (im sure majority do) it makes it very easy to predict the oncoming enrage so people don't die :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Warguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It is very useful on some PoP mobs even if they don't rampage / flurry once this has been casted on a few mobs they became total wimps.</div></div><hr />
