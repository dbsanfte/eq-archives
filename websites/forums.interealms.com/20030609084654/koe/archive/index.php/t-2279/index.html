<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nurga will once again be our target for the Tuesday night crew. The bulk is 29 and 30, but others are welcome as long as you fit in this mix. <br />
<br />
We usually have about 12, but this last week, we would have exceeded that. This is not a problem, but I got a lot of singles after we had formed up and moved and we were very short of healers (had a couple of regulars not make it). I apologize to those of you for that.<br />
<br />
I was very pleased with the mix of KoE, friends, and petitioners that came.. I think everyone had a rocking good time for the most part.. :)<br />
<br />
We will try to do a better job of getting all who wish to go into a group for some fun. <br />
<br />
We are considering a change of venue for a couple of Tuesdays up to Dalnir in the near future.. (probably end of August). Stay tuned.. <br />
<br />
As usual, we will form on the FM side of the FM/LoIO zone at 645 CST and move to Nurga. You can meet us at Nurga just inside the zone at 7 CST if you wish. This raid generally goes 3 hours if not a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im there had alot of fun last time..  I dont mind at all playing the single for a while again if need be..<br />
<br />
Hmmm healers aye..<br />
<br />
Looks at his cleric , Well my boy might be time to work on you.<br />
<br />
what you guys thing a lvl 12 in unrest could get a lttle EXP!?!!?<br />
<br />
hmmm we will see??<br />
<br />
anyway Malbik will be there thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can Probably help out a little with your Healer Problem...   I have a 32 Druid that will probably be able to help out in this one.<br />
<br />
I will be there as early as possible with Sarrick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe.. don't get me wrong about healers.. that was for this week. We have also been very short on tanks at times too.. It just depends on who shows up. <br />
<br />
The only thing I have seen us be consistently short on is porting and also nukage (no mages or wizzies have come that I know of).<br />
<br />
If we do go to Dalnir in the near future, extra portage can be handy there.. It will come in really handy as we grow and explore other places.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkcast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looking forward to Tuesday as my level 29 wizard (Zapster) is primed and ready to well .......FIRE hehehe:) See ya all then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll be there with my monk Aeriela.  She's level 31....still.  *grumbles about post hell experience loss* Lost half a level in two deaths the other day.  :(   Anyway, looking forward to joining you all in Nurga...had a blast last time.  See ya there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mydain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am camped in Nurga now soloing the spiders.<br />
<br />
I will likely be there when this is happening, so let me know if there is any way I can help out.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
The spiders are MINE!!! ALL MINE!!!  YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM!!!!<br />
<br />
hehe.<br />
<br />
I think I am too high to join you, but I can help if you need it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow!<br />
<br />
Looks like we should have a good turnout.. <br />
<br />
Yes Mydain, I am afraid most of the characters we have are 29 and 30, with some below that and some just above. <br />
<br />
We have been working up front more (the gobs), which are plenty red and yellow to most of us.. The spiders are higher and I think would be quite nasty for us to try to handle at this point..  Still would be good to see you.. :)<br />
<br />
See everyone there! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mathilde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ill be there if I can get a TP for Malaen to DL for the run</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DOH..<br />
I can't believe i forget that today is my 2 year anniversary and to insure a 3rd I'm going to have to bail.<br />
<br />
Sorry about that . . . . (( No EQ for me tonight))<br />
<br />
I was there last night with Pendy, dexail, cohenyk, harrek<br />
<br />
we all got a level so it was some sweet EXP.<br />
<br />
Good hunting to you all, once again sorry about bailing on ya so late.  <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I might have a problem. Kly was part of the wipe in ToV last night and while his corpse is in a position I can get to it, I am trying to work out a rendevous with a cleric, so what I am saying is I might be late..<br />
<br />
I did notice we have at least one chanter that will be there, so we are covered in that regard. I will try to be there as soon as I can..<br />
<br />
Griss/Bearan will be the main point of contact and also there are some others there that can help and there should still be a rip roaring time to be had.. :p<br />
<br />
See all as soon as I can..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heya Kly.  If you are havin a hard time getting a res (and don't mind a 49 res), let me know....Eliyra is in Thurgadin but she's still bound at ToV.  Wouldn't be a problem to pop over there and res ya quick.  I should be on fairly early tonight in one persona or another.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kly, <br />
<br />
Rizz has a rescue mission to ToV planned for 5:00est this afternoon to help get zadu's bugged corpse summoned and ressed (thanks apprentice guide).  Maybe they can help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hope it's not too late to sign up 2 more... <br />
 <br />
<br />
I can bring my 28 (almost 29!) Warrior, Cohenya... She rocks ;)<br />
<br />
and Xunie can bring his 29 Bard, Cohenyk.. He's a'ight :D<br />
<br />
LOL hope to see you all there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The more the merrier..<br />
<br />
Thanks for the offer of assistance Eli.. will just have to play it by ear and see what happens.. :)<br />
<br />
See everyone tonight (in one form or another)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, all I can say is WOW! What a turn out!<br />
<br />
We had 18 last night (and were missing several regulars).<br />
<br />
I was beginning to worry about healers as at one time we had a druid and Timbo's shaman came and went LD and never came back. <br />
<br />
Beridian made the switch to his Shaman and Bomar and Weezee showed up and we also got a couple others and we were off. Took a bit to get organized and get many of the new people to Nurga. Goblin and spider killing commenced in earnist along with the occasional Iksar. <br />
<br />
Hopefully a good time was had by all. I know we had a blast in our group.. :)<br />
<br />
Next Tuesday is a bit up in the air as I will not be there. We have discussed doing some faction to get the several Iksar &quot;fixed&quot; and that might be a good Tuesday to do it. Griss will be posting on that one and we can go from there..<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the turnout and being patient.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The spider group did great. It's a good thing we had Grinric's druid though. There is no way one Shaman can buff, slow, haste, and heal. We had 4 melee, 1 druid, and one shaman. As it was with clarity I had to hold off haste for long periods of time. Not like we really needed everything but man that was a workout and fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I had a great time last night pullin spiders for group 3.  Especially pulling from the room with eight spiders! :eek:  Didn't get anyone killed, which is always a bonus...hehe.  Great group, great experience, and lots of fun!  Looking forward to next time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sorry 'bout my LD guys.  Glad to hear things went so well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aseid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was in group 3 laying waste to the spiders, it was a blast.  Nurga and Droga are quickly becoming two of my favorite mid-level zones, experience-wise.  Aeriela did a great job of faking out those 8 spiders and pulling.  Thanks for having me along!<br />

It's hard going from caster to melee, so I learned a lot thank god! :D I died once, but it was totally OK with me, dyin is a part of playin the game, and who cares if I lost exp?  The groups we had were GREAT and it was made up in no time.  <br />
<br />
Good old fashion fun, laughs and GREAT pullin by the awesome Griss!<br />
