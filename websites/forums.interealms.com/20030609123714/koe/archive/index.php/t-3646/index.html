<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was checking Zyhri's gear and I noticed he still had platinum jasper rings.  I was wondering if I could get someone to make a pair of velium jasper rings for him, the extra 2 wis a pair will give will allow me or sarc to possibly upgrade another piece of equip for better resists ac mana etc.  Not sure how much they will cost, but that's not the problem, I'll pay whatcha need to get the rings made.  Thanks, contact me here or in game. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can do it for you NO problem. I have a 250 in jewelcraft. Just bring me the bars of vel and the gems. You may want to give me a tell first as I don't carry a jewelbag with me. Having a general slot wasted for a 4 slot container makes me shudder:)<br />
