<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I do a lot of soloing.<br />
Presently, I am in HK killing nobles trying to hit 56.<br />
I am using a JBB and happen to have like 10k I can spend on stuff.<br />
 <br />
I keep reading about horses and how useful they are for soloing.<br />
The question is, those of you with horses, are they worth it and does it matter which one I get?<br />
<br />
I hear you can med while chaincasting JBB type stuff and with horse models turned off, you can run at normal sow speed.<br />
If I do get the horse, I'll probably turn off the models, so I probably don't care how it looks, or the speed. <br />
Is there a difference in horses?  How much would the lowest end horse be?  <br />
<br />
Are they tough to use?  Like mounting/dismounting all that crap?<br />
Or does that stuff even come into play with the models turned off?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, very much worth it.  Second, just for soloing no it doesnt matter and you should get the lowest one.<br />
<br />

<br />
With models on you can still sow yourself.  The reason people turn horse models off is because the horsehead movement and bobbing motion is totally annoying.  Plus you are quite larger with models on and targeting is difficult.  In addition to that, you cant duck out of spells, it takes a few moments to start/stop completely, and when you are in the spell book you have to click &quot;done&quot; to exit it (rather than just standing).<br />
<br />
While on horseback you are always medding as long as you arent moving or have autoattack turned on.  You will med through spell casting and item casting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a difference in horses? How much would the lowest end horse be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Horses differ in run speed, looks, and cost.  Otherwise no notable difference I believe.  The lowest end horse is about 8300pp with 115+ cha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they tough to use? Like mounting/dismounting all that crap? <br />
Or does that stuff even come into play with the models turned off?&quot;<br />
<br />
With models turned on they are tricky to use as you cannot duck out of spells, the spellbook thing, and it takes a few seconds to accellerate and decellerate.  Also, targeting is particularly difficult in first person view with the giant horse head swaying back and forth all the time.<br />
<br />
With horses turned off, you will not see any of the drawbacks of horses and will see all the bonuses (except you wont look as cool).  A slight drawback though is that if you are riding a horse on a raid and other people have horse models turned on then it may impact their game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because of the posts on this board I bought the cheapest horse available (8 or 9K). I was level 58 at the time and soloing Katta guards. No epic but have JBB and fungi. Before having the horse I would pull with slow, sick pet, tank and chain cast JBB and canna sometimes. My rate of kill was 5 mobs one round and then 4 the next then 5 then 4 and so on. After I started using the cheapest horse my rate of kill jumped to steady 6 mobs every 12 min. I could pull with slow, sick pet, drop on a dot, tank and chain JBB. At the end of the fight I would be full mana or very close. My exp started to flow to the point where at level 59 I was doing a blue bub every 60 min. I am now level 60 and hope I never see that place again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lowest horse is 8300 (bought one last night)<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest everyone else will have to comment on as I just took everyone's advice here on buying one and i'm learing how to use it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, sounds good, but I won't &quot;med&quot; while meleeing?<br />
So I should just not hit autoattack when I pull?<br />
<br />
How bad is the food consumption?<br />
Think I might just get a cheap one and try it out, where can I find a little nag named glueglue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beowulfe Grendelbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Horses are outdoor only, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes.  Though they work in the bazaar and drive some people crazy when your doing laps playing with it.. not that &quot;I'd&quot; drive people nuts.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No extra food consumption that I am aware of anyways.<br />
<br />
No, you can not melee and get the med effect.  However you can cast and get the effect as long as you stay still, so everytime you cast your JBB you will see mana increase, pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
Also you might not notice your mana increasing sometimes because you havent casted anything.  You need to cast to see the jump in mana so in other words, if you just sit still for 5 mins you will see no mana regereration but once you cast your mana will jump up a couple of blues. alittle bug but no doubt you are gaining mana.<br />
<br />
Horse is totally worth the money, better then a fungi and much cheaper, go buy one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wait a min here... am I to understand that while one is riding a horse one is sitting down and medding even though one is able to cast spells????? And what run speed is lowest cost horse? can it be sowed?<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes.  That is correct.  If you are not moving, nor meleeing, you are medding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Scurg is right and I'm a dip.  That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Lunasombra <br />
Yes.  That is correct.  If you are not moving, nor casting a spell, nor meleeing, you are medding. <br />
<br />
Incorrect, you are allowed to cast spells as stated above.<br />
<br />
So as long as you are not moving or meleeing you are medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/agree Scurg.<br />
<br />
Yesferatu:  Yup, definitely get a horse.  sounds like your situation is absolutely perfect for one.  Also, if you (for some reason) decide you don't like it- you can sell it back for 90% of the price you paid for it (8399 pp to buy, and sells back for 7619 pp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Humm.....<br />
<br />
Food consumption is bad...  horses eat like da pigs....<br />
<br />
Get lots of food and drink and stock up all da time.<br />

<br />
Horse versus JBB versus other upgrades?<br />
<br />
I have a fungi (fungus patch vest actually), but no JBB.  I could probably get enough cash for a cheapo horse by selling an Iksar BP instead of dumping it on my alt.  Is this the best investment of 8k I could make?  Or am I better off just hoarding my money and getting a JBB once I have 30k or so saved up?  Chances are, unless I decide to slow down on XP to focus on cash, I'm not gonna see 22k more anytime soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMO...get a JBB first...then save up for horse. <br />
<br />
Horse w/JBB is awesome. Horse w/o JBB is just ok.<br />
<br />
Only thing took me a bit to get used to (soloing) was not attacking while tanking and JBBing the mob. So what I do is wait until JBB is just about done casting, and I turn on attack so I can get a chance at hitting the mob between chain casting the JBB. Then I turn attack off, while JBB starts casting again (8 secs for JBB to cast). That way I'm medding for most of the time while tanking and JBBing. This works really great when using a Barabarian Spiritist Hammer which procs same spell as JBB (Winter's Roar, Max Ice Dmg of 263) so sometimes in between JBB casts, I swing hammer and get that extra 263dmg right after JBB lands 263dmg, which is always nice to see.<br />
<br />
Have horse models turned off, this is just more convienent and allows you to use your SoW while being on your invisible slow horse (assuming you bought the cheap one). Though other players seeing you on your horse (cause they have Horse models turned on) going as fast as SoW, will think you are on a very expensive horse....at least peeps thought I was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nothing major, but sometimes people can't trade with you and you with them.  Sometimes you can't cast on a person right next to you and get &quot;out of range&quot; message.  These are easily fixed by clicking off the horse then summoning again after.  They also don't happen too often (maybe trading does, haven't checked).<br />
<br />
Also, the horse is an actual NPC/pet/part of you and can be targetted.  This is most apparent if you back up a bit, then click or hit F8 to target and you'll get &quot;Borgax's mount&quot;, and you have to move forward again before F8 will not target your horse instead.  At least this always happens for me.<br />
<br />
None of these are a big deal, but wanted to make sure all info was available to people and were forewarned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, this might be a small factor...<br />
The horse thing does take up a buff slot right?<br />
Like it's something you can click off?<br />
So, with a horse, it's like having a horse buff, if you see my point.<br />
So instead of the normal 15 (i think) buff slots, anyone using a horse has one less?<br />
<br />
Do I have that right?<br />
<br />
Not that it'll matter, but it is something to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey, additionally, I have a ranger in the uppity ups who uses a bow alot.  Would i be able to fire a bow and still med, or is that considered attacking?  As long as I am standing still while firing, can I shoot stuff and med at that same time with a horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, the horse takes up a Buff slot, one small negative factor. Not much of a factor if you soloing.<br />
<br />
And thats a good question, about firing arrows with your bow, or for that matter throwing knives/etc while sitting on horse and still getting the meditation benefit?<br />
<br />
This woulnt apply to Shaman really, but for Rangers, etc it would.</div></div><hr />
