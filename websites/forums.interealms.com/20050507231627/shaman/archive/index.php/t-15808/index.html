Really? News to me, and probably a few thousand other Crucible goers. I've seen numerous &quot;guides&quot; and &quot;how to's&quot;. Hell...the &quot;Equipment&quot; forum use to be called &quot;Combat Tactics &amp; Equipment&quot; for a long time until the recent board relocation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Reiterating .... Kill him before he kills you.<br />
<br />
We used a SK to HT for poisitioning and aggro.<br />
<br />
Several suggestions.<br />
<br />
1) Make sure your SK stays up and keeps aggro, do not ping pong him even for a second or you will wipe.<br />
<br />
2) Keep casters outside his room, if positioned right they can stay out of AE range and cast on him. Improved Range Item's help.<br />
<br />
3) Staggered MGB HoT's work well, If you have enough MGB'able clerics and druids you can keep Elixir and that wood thing on people the entire time.<br />
<br />
4) Put compotent people on CC. Your lower levels. We are great as CC. Us + chanter +  lower level war = corner held long after the MB is dead or you have wiped.<br />
<br />
Thats just a few things /shrug if you have more specific questions ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The part I am wondering about is the spiders. Let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
If the spiders get into the behemoth room they explode doing a 4K AE. <br />
<br />
But the CC teams keep the spiders occupied. This prevents the spiders from exploding and others from spawning.<br />
<br />
Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure if it was 4k, may only be 2. I could most definatly be wrong with this so, but 1 spider in his room will mean your dead so just try and keep them dealt with.<br />
<br />
Basically how the spiders work is, they spawn somewhere in the factory and carry energy to the behemoth, to make him targetable you start killing spiders, and he wakes up to see what the problem is yadda yadda yadda. They are still spawning however. During the fight your CC teams MUST stop all spiders period, they spawn rather quickly. If you look at a map of the factory there are 4 corners surrounding the Behemoth's room, each corner needs its own CC, but there is no way into his chamber not through a corner. <br />
<br />
Your only gonna actually kill 1-2 spiders with just enc/war/shm. But MB needs to die in 1 Min, 2 Min tops. After that time healing gets tough and most of your raid starts dieing. If you have a LOT of DPS, I would suggest making bigger CC groups, it all depends on your composition.<br />
<br />
After the fight everyone needs to return to a corner, as your spider CC now has lots of spiders to kill, finish these off and Keep killing them. Do not make the mistake of calling of Spider CC untill AFTER flags and loot has been done, otherwise stuff gets nasty.<br />
<br />
Hope I answered your questions. If not let me know, can always try again =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For the flags, just have a monk aggro the gnome when MB is dead, bring him out of the room, FD, and have the raid hail him.<br />
<br />
For the loot, just laugh of people dying just after looting their item :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you might just wanna wait a week or two .. they just changed the resistence check on his ae from neg1000 to neg 50 ... ie, a naked halfing ranger could resist it .. totally gimped that encounter<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
blank sketch books are more fun that coloring books</div></div><hr />

These uber-hints always confuses me. Are you saying that FoH always waits for the mobs to be tuned to be sufficiently tough before you even try to attack them?<br />
<br />
Just having a resonable idea of what to do in an encounter doesnt mean you will succeed. The number of people and the quality of their equipment will also have a pretty significant influence. And this certainly favors ubers more than anyone else.<br />
<br />
I guess some people like to spend weeks wiping to the same mob but I dont think these people will come here asking for a little help. People that come here asking for advice are probably people that are not in an uber guild and they dont have 70 hours a week to play yet they still would like to atleast try some of the harder things. Is that so terrible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Seems like sound advice to me.  And it wasn't like he was forcing it down the throat in a patronizing manor.  I think it was just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The important thing for this encounter is CC: best to put at least one group in each corner to kill the spiders.<br />
<br />
The really important thing is for the CC teams to keep killing spiders even after MB is dead...you will have to rotate folks/groups out so everyone can get a flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">According to Lucy the lowest resist modifier on any of the AEs is neg 150...  not 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good Info Guys. Thats what I was looking for!<br />
<br />
Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Right?<br />

All I remember was last time we did the mb, our probie cleric was told to (probie quest) train the spiders into camp after everyone got the flags.. and that thing is not just 4k, it might be 4 or 2 but EACH spider does it.. 70 of us dead in an instant..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">neg 150 is still easily resistable.</div></div><hr />
