<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">cripple was made utterly useless by new content, slow was made almost NIL from new content, our heals are made near useless from new content.<br />
<br />
we need spell that scale with content, not some overpowering spell that crushes old content into an easily soloable cash farm crop.<br />
<br />
since we cannot get a decent non-mitigated slow, why not fix cripple.<br />
follow my line of thought, if we do cripple + slow with our crap heals we should be able to main heal.<br />
<br />
my idea on cripple is this.<br />
<br />
deterioration<br />
<br />
target of deterioration suffers 22.34% lose in physical damage.<br />
casting time 3.5 seconds<br />
refresh time 3 seconds<br />
mana 390<br />
&quot; %T's Muscles begin to deteriorate&quot;<br />
<br />
of course this will override cripple :p<br />
<br />
this would take a mob that hits for 1200 down to 931-932 damage, with slow would allow us to act as main healers.<br />
<br />
i got this spell idea from someone else, its not my own, but i have made changes to it and i think this would scale to all forms of content, this makes those mobs that hit exceedingly fast even when slowed like chavoor, umbiki, ferubi named, barindu named, hell even riwwi named hit fast, and it will allow us to be more sought after for groups.<br />
<br />
give me ideas and some feed back, i think this is a step in the right direction, for now atleast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WIN!<br />
<br />
Nice idea.  I like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, while I like the idea . . . I gotta nay say.<br />
<br />
The whole problem with slow (and why they had to mitigate it) was that they were having to design encounters with slow in mind.  Either they made the mob immune, or had to beef it up something silly so that it was the appropriate difficulty after slow (cripple in this scenario).  This spell is more of the same, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
If we have a new cripple line, then mobs just have to be beefed up that much more--and mobs will HAVE to be crippled to succeed, etc.  It's a vicious cycle.  Fundamentally, without breaking all their encounters (and previous encounters), all they can really do is fix healing, dps, ability to tank, or crowd control/utility.  Those are really the only functions they can afford to change without really hosing up all the encounters.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, developers are looking at 3 of the 4.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice idea actually I like it as well.  But if your concern is to be a main healer then fix healing.  Don't fix a &quot;non-related&quot; spell to help us heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think any debuff that reduces a mobs dps should be removed from the game.  Its just too hard to balance encounters and classes around dps reducing debuffs of any kind.  <br />
<br />
SOE uses slow as an excuse to keep our heals weak, and then perpetually reduces the effectiveness of slow, while not increasing our healing to match the decline of slow.  So, to heck with slow.  <br />
<br />
Like I've posted before, I think the shaman should evolve to NOTICEABLY buff player dps (through a variety of methods), an increase  in healing (but to compliment druids and clerics, not become them), and increase our personal dps (as a combo of player buffs and personal dps) to compete with enchanters and beastlords.<br />
