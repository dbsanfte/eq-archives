<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know im gonna be a shaman, and race doesnt matter to much. Can anyone point me to a good server? Ive heard roleplaying servers are really nice, just curious on if a small server is better then a larger populated or somthing.  <br />
<br />
Thanks much<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well my server (Vazaelle) is the newest regular U.S. blue server, alot of very nice people on it.<br />
<br />
The -Zek servers are PvP servers (players vs player)<br />
<br />
If you like to roleplay then Fiona Vie maybe for you, it has a different rule set though compare to the blue servers.<br />
<br />
You also have new blue servers Atonis bayle(sp) and another but they are based in Europe.<br />
<br />
Good luck and if you happen to come to my server give me a /tell and if not raiding or anything I will be happy to answer any questions you might have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go visit Scurg!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've only tried two servers.  Tholuxe Poells and Luclin.  It depends on where you are and who you are playing with.  I've yet to have a problem with anyone on Tholuxe.  I was on Luclin for less than an hour with a brand new character and was already being asked to duel, had people Kill Stealing, etc.  If you come onto Tholuxe, /t me  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont bother with Antonius Bayle - it is a new server, but they allowed people to move there from other servers and because of this it is full of lvl 60's.  Kane Bayle is the newest standard server, only been open a few weeks, but it is based in europe so you may not get as fast a connection to it as you would to a US server.  You would also find that the majority of people on it will play at European times so that would make it more difficult for you to group if you are playing on US time.</div></div><hr />
