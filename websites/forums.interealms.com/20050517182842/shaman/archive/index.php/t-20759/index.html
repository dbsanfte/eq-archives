<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It would be like the LDoN groups I was in this weekend.<br />
<br />
Group type 1: Necromancer, shaman, druid, various dps classes.  We aggro kited half a dozen hard adventures.  The necro would pull one or two mobs with snare + high aggro DoTs.  My role was to cast Bane and Blood, spot heal when needed.  Mobs died too fast to use any disease DoTs.<br />
<br />
Group 2: Bard, druid, paladin, shaman, various dps classes.  My job was to cast poison rain spells on normal LDoN adventures.  Bard would pull a bunch of mobs, melees would keep them in place and I pushed one of two buttons: Tears or Torrent.  I got bored so I started meleeing with my new sharkspine hammer (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=21885).  I parsed my dps at about 57.<br />
<br />
I got lots of adventure points.  I didn't feel needed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I once was the only shaman on our ikk trial raids and the warriors pissed me off enough on the trash mobs in Kod'taz that I didn't slow anything the rest of the night.  Not sure if many people noticed or said anything, but I know that the beastlords def noticed and died alot more.  I can't say how much of a difference it made since it was our 1st time beating the 2nd trial (2nd attempt)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">depends on where and what the situation was...but over all in a good group......not a whole hellofa lot of difference i would bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Reminds me of the '60's adage: &quot;What if they gave a war and nobody came?&quot;<br />
<br />
In many camps the group is solid enough you don't need slow. Some camps are based around an unslowable MOB. So yeah if &quot;slow is your thing,&quot; it's no fun to be you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But in all honestly, unless you have a chanters pet, then slowing is ideal for almost every situation.  I think that maybe in a kiting group no, however I tend to slow the mob anyways, cause a slowed mob is better chasing you than a non-slowed one.  But, then again I have TA so it doesn't really cost me anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On normal LDoNs I've found its more efficient to heal the MT with quiessence than to cast slow. I'll use AE slow on large pulls and slow the boss, that's about it.<br />
<br />
Guild did Saryrn raid the other night. Hardly slowed a thing, half the mobs are immune, the rest tend to die in the time it takes to malos+slow and they resist a fair bit too. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, did a PoV outer xp group with my bard the other day and the beastlord's 40% slow wasn't really up to the job. Level 56 cleric and 61 SK tanking and we really needed a 60%+ slower, but then kiting wasn't an option for our setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was in CoD the other day with a 65 mage, 65 ranger and me, a lowly 64 ghetto shaman.  The mage and ranger have 140+ aa's, I have about 20.  I'm pulling zone trash with slow since not many resist.  Slow, cripple, tank a couple hits then back off and canni and torpor to get ready for next pull.  No biggie, and we even handled three at once on a botched pull of mine.<br />
<br />
But, when I pull the Greater Pulsing, who is immune to slow, I quickly realize that my partners would be much better off with a cleric.  Since the mage pet is tanking all the mobs, slow isn't really of much consequence if you have a REAL CH.  Yes, I think I'm better on overpulls due to some crowd control ability, but I quickly go OOM when relegated to healing unslowed mobs.<br />
<br />
Once again, it proves that my good looks, wit and great sense of humor allowed me into another group . . . /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Everything in plane of earth mitigates slow to slightly (that I've seen so far), unless it's immune.  Exp is godly (compared to solro)... but any class would help the group more than I do in there.  Good thing my guild groups are just used to having a slower on hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You know what would happen if Shaman stopped slowing mobs?  Well, let me tell ya, they'd just quit getting groups altogether.  Beasts would be able to slow enough that they can't tell enough of a difference, plus with their pet, they'd tear stuff up that much quicker.  No shaman slow, no big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But in all honestly, unless you have a chanters pet, then slowing is ideal for almost every situation.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with this. Increasingly it works out better and better on normal LDON's for me to just drop some rains and keep pulling then to even bother slowing anything. Mana is better spent. This does not even include any charming groups. Stuff dies faster, and even the normal non-raiding crowd is getting sufficient gear to tank unslowed mobs. The only thing I need to slow is named.<br />
<br />
On raids where we repeatedly clear trash mobs to get to a target in elementals, again, it is better for me to nuke then to cast 1 turgurs. The MT's are going to get a CH either way, doesn't matter if the mob is slowed or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I disagree with this one.  With me in the group they can get by with a druid to heal and nobody else while using a ranger to tank.  Plus I can slap out DoTs on all of the mobs and even assist in pulls when root parking is needed.   I contribute a great deal in the ele planes IMO.</div></div><hr />
