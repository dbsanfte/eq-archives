<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent a lot of time writing this up only to realize that it was buried in a thread on the General forum, lol.  So here it is in this forum.<br />
<br />
I did this at 63 with Torpor and Bane of Nife.  It was hard.  At 65 with Quiescence and Blood of Saryryn it got MUCH easier.  Now at 65 with those spells plus some really nice focus items and 1k more HP, it's almost trivial.<br />
<br />
THE CAMP: Run to the guardhouse, up to the plateau in PoV; take a LEFT outside the door and invis across the WW camp to the zoneline (watch out, a few golems in WW see invis).  Follow the zone edge to Lever.  Go past Lever and to the NE corner of the plateau.  Single pull golems easily here, just watch for wanderers, especially unrootable wandering spiders that are VERY hard to see.<br />
<br />
Spell lineup:<br />
Tnarg's<br />
Root (level 14, cheap)<br />
Turgur's<br />
Malosinia<br />
Malos<br />
Quiescence<br />
Canni4<br />
Breath of Ultor<br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
SOW<br />
Focus<br />
Ancestral Guard (yes, I use it)<br />
Boar<br />
Wrulan (yes, I use this too)<br />
Acumen (makes it easier to see the spiders)<br />
<br />
NO PET. Useless, he just dies anyway and you burn mana trying to keep him healed.<br />
<br />
Start at max cast range, cast malos and turn your back to the mob while casting. When it lands, take off in as straight a line as possible. When spell gems refresh, stop and turn around, cast root when you have successfully turned around (the time to turn around is about equal to the time needed to guarantee no interrupt due to movement). Root WILL land after malos, or if not just run, rinse, and repeat until it does. Hit it with malosinia at this point to reduce root breaks, and Turgur's just in case it gets in melee range.  Retreat to max epic cast range if you plan to use epic DOT, or to max cast range for regular spells if you are not using epic.<br />
<br />
Now cast Breath of Ultor. While this is refreshing, unmem malosinia and mem Blood of Saryryn. While BoS spell gem is refreshing, cast epic. Retreat to max cast. Refresh root. Cast BoS.  NOTE: I don't have Bane.  If you have it, I'd have it up instead of BoU and cycle both BoU and BoS through the other spell slot.  Cast BoU first, you'll only need one of those and then you can leave BoS up the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 if it's up. Quiescence if necessary. At this point typically I have not been touched, I'm at 80+ mana and quiescing up from 60 health.<br />
<br />
At this point, you can go the patient route and just refresh root/BoS/BoU/Bane as necessary (without Bane this will take around two full durations of BoU but will never break root), or you can accelerate things a bit by using the DOTs that break root. Turn your back to the mob while casting the DOT that breaks root and run until root is castable, then turn and root, just like you did with malos. I like to load it up with disease dots because if they break root, they only break it once every 2 minutes :-) so generally I might have three disease dots and 1-2 poison dots running, plus epic. Bane would help a LOT, I really need to get that. <br />
<br />
There are variations - sometimes I don't use the epic because you have to get so close to cast it, and the damage for a whole epic run is worth about four ticks of BoS. Sometimes I do throw a second disease dot just to speed things up but no other root-breakers because I'm being lazy. I do throw swarm pets in there occasionally but the damage is negligible, it's more for fun than anything. <br />
<br />
I canni4 constantly and canni5 when available. If I get hit, I reroot, back off, and Quiesce; I VERY rarely ever use Tnarg's, in fact I am about ready to boot it off my spell gems when soloing. No horses, they are too awkward if the mob starts running at you and you have to retreat.<br />
<br />
I am short a lot of nice AA's, but I have some great focus items to make up for them. No, I don't have Burning Affliction, but I have a DOT extension focus that makes them last longer, excellent for soloing; a buff extension focus plus SCR1 that together make Q last an extra tick; mana cost reduction foci; and range increaser focus. Although I did all this before I had those, it's a lot easier with them.<br />
<br />
AA's that would help on top of what I have would be to finish out the SCM and SCR/SCRM lines; Quickbuff 2-3; maybe channeling focus; LR and other defensive AA's; and for dungeon soloing where you invis between camps, Suspend Minion 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice post. Basically how I solo there as well. However I go to the East Castle wall camp and pull there if its open, if it is taken then I go to where you described.<br />
<br />
VP is a big help here if you have it.<br />
<br />
I would add another spell to the line up if you are using VP and/or disease dots, malicious decay.<br />
<br />
I pull with Malos, Root, Slow, Malicious Decay, Epic dot, Breath of Ulthor, Bane, BoS. Re root with VP. Sick spirit call on it if up. Keep dots up until dead. Can in between re dotting.<br />
<br />
Easier if you grab a KEI and a virtue before hand but you can still do without.<br />
<br />
I keep two spell gem sets memmed. One is called PoV Pull and is Tnargs, Quiescence, Gate (just in case), Malicious decay, Root, Slow, Bane, Malos.<br />
<br />
The other spell line up is called PoV Kill and is: Tnargs, Quiescence, Gate, Breath of Ulthor, Root, Slow, Bane, BoS. After I cast breath of ulthor and get the other dots going I replace breath of ultor with Cann. Mob is usually dead before I would need to recast that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. I use this same spell line up and basic strat to solo in PoFire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I need to start using spellsets more.  I could swap out Malos and put another dot there, for example.<br />
<br />
BTW a great tool when using spellsets is to take all the spells that are in common between your sets and save them out as a &quot;base&quot; set, with empty spell gems in the other slots.  Then your secondary sets can be saved out with empty spell gems in all the base slots.  If the slot is empty when you create the spellset, it won't overwrite anything you have in that slot.<br />
<br />
I don't use VP primarily because I do use DOTs with an initial DD, and that breaks VP just like the 30-mana plain root.  So why bother.  Once I get Bane I may rethink that.<br />
<br />
I could get some mileage out of MD, but it's annoying to have yet another spell to get up.  I guess if I switch to using spellsets that won't be a problem :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">at 62 I partnered with a 61 necro and it was easy xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the helpful info on this :). I decided to give this a shot today even though I was under the mistaken impression that a shaman needed to have really good gear and plenty of AAs to be able to solo in Valor. The first time I tried it I got roughed up some, nothing too bad but I did have virtue at the time. What worked in subsequent pulls was to not turn around before rooting; this is probably my own awkwardness, but for the initial root and rerooting I was taking way too long with stopping, turning around, making sure I was steady, and then rooting and getting slapped because I was too slow. After a little of this I just maloed, bolted, stopped, rooted, moved a little more, and the golem would be well behind me when I turned around. I even have time to use my 64 root (for the initial root I use greater immobilize and then reroot when I'm sure I have him), and with a fizzle no less :D.<br />
<br />
This is probably way way basic for most players, but it's something that took me a bit to get down so I thought I would share.<br />
<br />
Still working on managing mana (I don't have much in the way of focus effects to help me here and had to take breaks in between pulls) but I was really pleased with how well it went :). Soloing has never been something that I did a lot of as I almost always had my beastie partner with me up until recently, and this was a neat way to get a feel for what I can do on my own (and probably with much more ease than bringing a melee partner into the equation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cool, whatever works for you.  I started using the turn-around thing before I knew about third person views, and now I use it for timing purposes, i.e. the length of time it takes to turn around is about as long as it takes to not get an interruption.<br />
<br />
I just use the lvl 14 Root btw, it is hard to argue with 30 mana cost.  Sure, it's short duration, but I can recast every 30 seconds at that price.  I played around with the longer-lasting and quicker-casting later roots but they just weren't worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gonna have to try this myself sometime. I'm hoping VP3 and clicky ornate pants will handle the rooting quite nicely for me - probably pull with malicious decay and then VP em, malos, slow, then pile on dots.<br />
<br />
Heard about it ages ago (on these boards) but didn't have ultor or saryn then - now I have the spells I'd clean forgotten until now :) Thanks for the update</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cardenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I wanted to add my experience on soloing Golems in PoV.<br />
<br />
I am a 65 shaman with a few Time items.  LOoking at 6300hp buffed with Focus/Virtue.  With my items, Magelo says i have about 5500 mana.<br />
<br />
The golems to me are almost trivail.  What i do first is get a DMF from your local Necro.  THen i zone in, Invis, and head to the zone wall right of RCY.  Just remember to check the three golems at edge of drop off.  Every once in a while one of them see's thru Invis.<br />
<br />
My Spells that i use for this is.<br />
<br />
Malo<br />
Quiensense<br />
BoU<br />
BoS<br />
Bane<br />
Anethema<br />
Pox<br />
Bane of Nife<br />
<br />
I have ornate legs so rooting is no problem.<br />
<br />
I first pull with Malo and run to get distance for root.<br />
<br />
Once i root, i back off to max casting distance and start me Dot chain with a clicky root between each cast.  When i get to Pox and Bane of nife, sometimes they may break root but it is ok since i am far enough to cast root before he getsto me.<br />
<br />
With no root breaks i can get 5 dots ticking at once.  I have to Canni 5 once in the fight and when he is dead, im at about 70 mana.<br />
<br />
I have a  few focus items that help out.  One gives +20% damage to dots and the other extendes my dots by 1 tick.  I do not use VP and have no points in it.  The root legs do the job just fine.<br />
<br />
I usally run out of golems to kill before i run out of mana.<br />
<br />
I also do not slow them.   if they break a root and get close, since i have DMF i can run in a striaght line to another spot to root while the golem has to follow the zone wall.<br />
<br />
<br />
I use this same thing in PoF on the guards just before the bridge.  Only they resist a little more and have a lot more HP's<br />
<br />
I hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Curious about the dmf thing - why not just levitate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cardenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I get DMF becuase it last for a long time.  Levitate only last 20 min and i dont want to be in the middle of a fight when it breaks.  Also if you Sow runs out you can make up the distance you need when your levitating by running in a striaght line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually everytime ya change direction the game redefines your position, so by turning around and not moving your telling the server you stopped, thats why ya get no interupts. Otherwise your waiting for the server to update by itself and thats where your interupts come from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I've heard that theory as well, Stolastorv... but I can also prevent interrupts by standing still for about that long, so Idunno.  Whatever reason it works, it works for me.  I checked the other day and I'm actually casting after I turn about 90 degrees or a little more, not all the way 180 degrees around.<br />
<br />
As far as lev/dmf goes... SOE should give the same benefit but is faster than SOW.  And it lasts a pretty long time.  I wouldn't hesitate to use Levitation if it wasn't convenient to get a DMF or SOE, though, just refresh it before each kill to ensure it doesn't go down.<br />
<br />
As far as SOW running out... you don't still have your SOW booties from the epic?  Refresh SOW while you're running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Weissblau,<br />
<br />
I been to PoV enough, but only did golems on the EW and WW, where is this other camp spot you are talking about? Could you give me a loc please on this map (or anyone):<br />
<br />
PoV map (http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/povalor3.gif) <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well the NE corner is the easiest place to solo them, the only hard part is dealing with the always solitary necro that wants to XP there as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I follow primarily the same procedure here but I pull with malicious decay instead of malos or malosinia. I prefer to park the mob with VP before I attempt to slow it, and if you interrupt VP it's easy to pop the hotkey again. I also use malosinia for debuff, it's quick and rarely resisted (at least for me), slow it then it's BoU, epic, BoS, Bane. Depending on how quick I do it, I can usually get all that landed before VP breaks. Re-root golem/crawler Q then canni V, and reapply BoS, bane. And of course, having a mount helps too for a little quicker mana regen.<br />
<br />
Using this method I have juggled 2 and even 3 at once, the 3 at once was b/c of getting trained and took a little bit to kill them all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, NE corner, around p1700 n750ish perhaps if I remember how to read map coords right, lol.  Go left out of the guardhouse at the upper plateau, through the WW camp to the zone wall, past lever, and you'll start seeing golems on the right.  I go past the first ridge and pull to a little valley just shy of the NE corner, plenty of room to run along the zone edge there.</div></div><hr />
