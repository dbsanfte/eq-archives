<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soldieint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That Shaman`s is the most useless class in pvp. not that many of you care, who play on a blue server. <br />
<br />
But you must admit, it has been awile sins We have gotten any usefull spels, beside our debuff and topor2. The dots we have, is only usefuld when we solo. They are easy to resist and if they land they cause huge agro. So where is the point. <br />
<br />
The only dmg spel i use on raids, is our Cold nuke and even our cold nuke is ghetto compared to any other caster class or ranger and Bst nukes. Way to long casting time on it. I must admit i feel with my fellow shms who dosnt even have a focus effect to speed the casting time up.<br />
<br />
Aye we can buff heal and slow, so we should be usefuld on raids. well yeah, but if you have like 5 shms there, the first 2 shm can take care of the debuff slow and one do MGB. Seeing druids have a must better heal then shms, well guess they are on assist heal insted of the shms.<br />
<br />
What i would like that Sony would offer us, is some new dots, who would be MR based with the same resist check as the druids or Necros.<br />
The Ldon MR based Dot we get is crap and useless. you can hardly land it on any mini bossed in EP or for that matter in Time. <br />
The mana cost is allso way to high on them to use fro soloing or grouping.<br />
<br />
What we need is  2 good dots with same resist checks as the necro druids high lvl ones.. Eather a new cold or fire Nuke with more dmg and same casting time as druids. maybee then, we can start feel usefuld in PVE and PVP...<br />
<br />
For my 1st statet point about shamans beeing useless in Pvp for those who care. Due to the resist people get. From VT EP and then time.  <br />
<br />
VT Geared people, you will find that every 3th dot you cast on them get resist after debuffing them (mostly casters)<br />
<br />
Ep geared People. Now the nightmare starts. Here you only use you Ancient bane dot and even here its start to be useless to even be thinking on dotting them. Mostly i try to nuke melee em down and hope to get lucky on landing a dot or 2. but mostly they perma resist my dots.<br />
Yes i ofcourse try to dispel em before i start dotting them with my 2 ghetto dispels.  but often useless, sins nearly all have 2 or 3 right click item on them.<br />
<br />
Time geared people. Forget it. they can stand afk in a corner in BOT for 1 hour and you can do nada to them. Best you can do, is call some melee freinds in and play the clr type shm for them..<br />
<br />
I started my shm back in the kunark's days,  for Pvp purpose. Back then there weren't any classes we didnt have a chance to kill. even pallies who could be a hell of long fights, back then our dots would land. But from there, the road of pvp mined shm, and it has only kept getting worse. Right now we dont stand a chance against any time or EP geared players ..<br />
<br />
Simply cant land anything on them, beside melee them with out Leet3 skilz.<br />
<br />
I`ll stop my whinning here, but i bet there must be some other fellow shms out there, who feel the way i do..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't really agree with the little blurb about more than two shamans being useless on raids, but everything else you said is pretty much dead on.  I want to say that shamans need some form on unresistable damage (a dot, preferably - unless they want to give us lifetaps :D), but I'm afraid it might be overpowered.  I look back on the hundreds of duels I have fought, and I only have four losses (twice to HT, once to ranger, once to SK w/o HT).  However, I have dozens of draws because I simply cannot kill my opponent, and he just doesn't have the damage output to run me oom and keep my from healing myself.  If I had a form of unresistable damage, all those draws would have been wins.  In fact, I can safely say, that even with something as meager as a 200hp/tick unresistable dot, I would never lose a duel again (except to a lucky deathtouch, of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Afaik pvp have been broken a long long time and what you are asking for with the 2 new dots you want is 2 lurebased dots I guess and havent that been discussed numerous times?<br />
I play on a blue server and have a char on a pvp server which I try to play from time to time, but I do not have the knowledge of zek-server shamans. <br />
<br />
I dont think we are the only class that whines about this, every caster class that ever met a full time-geared melee would get his a$$ handed to him pretty quick as they cant break thru their resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dead on with ep/time geared peeps. they are simply immune to shaman dots. malos+decay and they can just stand there and snicker while everything I toss is resisted. and there is no way in hell you are ever going to nuke down a 4khp caster. as for the deadly classes, sk's still rule and the fast gank. spear/spear/dt and its game over, necros with lb and wizzies with mb are a very close second. I can survive pvp with damn near anyone but those 3 classes have a giagantic advantage with the ability to crack out insane damage instantly.<br />
<br />
of course they the sk is the only one whos even remotely dangerous with out the uber click. wizzys are kinda dangerous but you can out heal them fairly easy.<br />
<br />
pvp still needs some real work to balance out better. and sony has followed closely in verants footsteps by not giving a rip about the pvp game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soldieint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Afaik pvp have been broken a long long time and what you are asking for with the 2 new dots you want is 2 lurebased dots I guess and havent that been discussed numerous times?<br />
<br />
Well make them lure base or lower the resist check, let them be Mr based so every class have the chance to dispel them. like most skilled peopel do, when we cast Malos on them, but aleast  give us a chance to win over the people who dont have the skill, but just the gear. its all what i ask.<br />
And a Fr based Nuke wouldnt hurt eather or lower the casting time on our cold nuke..<br />
<br />
wizzys are kinda dangerous but you can out heal them fairly easy.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what wizzards you been fighting. I see wizzards dayly crit for over 2k on there lure and even with there lvl 65 nuke they crit for 4k on you even you have all you resist above 250. and at the same time you cant land anything on the wizzard due to his high resists. So he will just stand infront of you chain casting nukes...<br />
<br />
IN my guild we are like 12 shms(no kidding). reason is, that VZ has become a guildwar server, where every high end guild kos each other. <br />
So every guild need a good among of shm for xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All you really gotta do in  PVP is assist and Malos. and Never  use Velium strike.  Spear of Torment is faster. but your points on resists are Valid.  look at it this way You are the other Time enabled guild on teh Server. so soon you can have Shinerbokk's sick assed resists. at which point it'll come down to luck and Skill. and a humongous Cadre of DTing sk's , Manaburning wizards and, Lifeburning Necros :)<br />
<br />
as for spells.  i'm soo cheesed off at the look of the garbage SOE keeps foisting on shaman that i dunno what to do.  back when i started playing shaman and necros were fairly even when it came to Dots. now they have boatloads of em with lures and such.  and Beastlords didn't exist with all those Near shaman level slows.  and chanters were on close to being as good as shaman. All the changes they made weakened shaman as THE  main slowers and buffers. and that makes me sad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, living on Rallos I enjoy the occasional PVPing in groups against muggers. Single PVP IS out of the question. We are a support class. We can't support ourselves, but we can make everyone else stronger. <br />
<br />
  I agree that before Luclin we had ALOT of power. Luclin was a turning point in the game back in late 2001 when the original designers of EQ left the project and they were replaced with trained monkeys.<br />
<br />
  I'm not sure how much activity it would get, but a new server should be made (blue and/or red). It should be pre Kunark just like &quot;The Fallen&quot;  but without all the detrimental side effects of &quot;The Fallen&quot;. You might not like running across three continents instead of clicking on 2 books. You might however, get more of a fulfillment from balanced classes and PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Soldier. Back before Kunark shaman were the pvp machine. We could kill anyone on the server easy. When level 50 was the max.<br />
<br />
Now today it's the complete opposite. I can survive for a long time but killing people is not the same. I get kills on people when I time my poison nuke just right. <br />
<br />
Our dots are a joke in pvp. I don't even waste a spell slot with a dot. With todays insane resists it's just a waste of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mbbkw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Discord resists aren't a problem.<br />
<br />
Besides, you could be a cleric.  What do you have to complain about, pvp-wise?  You may no longer be the best but you're still viable.  Cleric pvp has always been virtually nonexistent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah I don't do much in PvP anymore except for heal, malos, and dispel.  Pretty much anything else is out of the question unless someone has really bad resists.<br />
<br />
Clerics and shaman are similar these days in PvP really.  Both are hard to kill but neither is going to frighten anyone with offensive output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well, Discord is a different place that is for sure.<br />
<br />
log on there, do /who all shaman, i think there is 13 tops, 1 above lvl 15.<br />
<br />
there are less pallies, monks, rogues, clerics, warriors and Beasts (who get hosed because they suffer pvp for 3 lvls before they get pet)<br />
<br />
Wizards are off the charts, as are necro, druid, bard and mage.  not sure on SK's, i didn't look.<br />
<br />
even with the 50 lvl cap limit and low resists, PvP is about burst damage that sticks, or manaless pet damage that is extremely hard to resist.<br />
<br />
after 40 on Vallon and 52 on Sullon; i gave up on Sony ever looking at PvP as an actual game.  ran to Prexus and now 61 with 25aa, but i log onto Discord after my group breaks up and /cry over how broken pvp really is.</div></div><hr />
