<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DjManic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. I'm dropping this thread because i'm starting out on The Asylum project. A new ui complete. Thought maybe some of u were bored and might be able to create some graphics. I'm mostly interested in ideas that i can lay down as graphics later. I'm going for somewhat of an electronic theme. If you have any ideas let me know. You can post here or send me some stuff. Anything is appreciated. I want to make this for everybody. Hopefully when its complete it will have a little love built into it from every Shaman lover on EQ. I'm also working on mp3s and sound sets to go with this UI. I'm still trying to find the work around from the patcher. Lemme know if you have any ideas on this also.</div></div><hr />
