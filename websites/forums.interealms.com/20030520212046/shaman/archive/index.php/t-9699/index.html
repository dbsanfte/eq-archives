<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I know there's far more impressive twinks out there, so I can assure you, I'm not bragging with this guy.  Before I get crucified for making a twink, let me just say, I've given up on two other characters at high levels, and this is going to be my main.  I don't feel like struggling through 50 levels yet again and this is now my main :D<br />
<br />
His gear is here: Imhottepp (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=333985) <br />
<br />
I'm MOSTLY broke after all that I've put on him so far, but I can do some minor adjustments easy enough.  Have I over done the HP &gt; Wis idea?  From what I've seen/read the school of thought that makes the most sense to me is, &quot;It's not about how big the mana pool is, it's about how fast you can regain it.&quot;  errr something like that.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking at the boots, helm, cloak and greaves that would run between 1-5K.  I plan on doing the Coldain Bracer quest soon as well.  Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Corbane Ratheblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gear is ok... name is kinda funny though... Looks like    IM HOT PEE PEE. lmAO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*Sigh*<br />
<br />
Yeah, the names taken from this guy: Imhotep (http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/imhotep.htm) <br />
<br />
Perhaps the most famous of all Shaman.  Unfortunately most people dont know any better and say pretty much what you just did.  Heh.<br />
<br />
Oh well, if it starts bugging me enough Ill pay to get it switched.  Thanks anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Metal Linked Crown for helm.<br />
Cloak, I'd hold out for a heiro.  It's hands down one of the best droppable cloaks in the game.  If it's going to be your main, you'll keep it for quite a while.<br />
Boots... who knows, there aren't a lot of good ones I can think of off hand.  Do your epic quest and get the ones with insta cast sow.  Be more useful than anything else for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shimmering Hide Cloak 50 HP ~1k<br />
Shissar Scale Guants 40 HP ~2k<br />
<br />
only thing id mention is that the whole HP deal really becomes a factor with Canni 5. Granted you can never have enough HP, but id focus on the combination of AC/HP/Mana. Either way your twink looks fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is my shaman twink if you want to take a look.  I also have where I want to be at 53.  Though I have been asked by my guild to stay at 52 for twink night on Vox or Naggy.<br />
<br />
btw I suck at posting links<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">earing of the solstice would help out<br />
and i would say switch out another bracer till you can click the JBB but with that gear youve probably allready dinged mystic :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Each of those are good ideas.  I'm especially leaning toward the earring of the solstice.  Does anyone know if the FT I works below the recommended level 51?<br />
<br />
Just got my black fur boots this moring, so it's off to CoM for many levels while I try to get pages and the clay for Can II.<br />
<br />
Thanks again! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The FT on the Earring of the Solstice works at least as low as 45 - I tested it on a level 45 character and it worked. I can't verify anything lower than that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My twink shamy magelo below, maybe some ideas for ya.  I went for focus effects mainly, then hp/mana.<br />
<br />
Ran out of plat atm, but got my eye on Gem Encrusted Ring (Affliction Efficiency 3), and a horsey.  Fungi too of course, hopefully be able to replace his sometime soon.</div></div><hr />
