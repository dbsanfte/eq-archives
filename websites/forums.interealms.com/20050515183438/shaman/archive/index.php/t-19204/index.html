<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday was one of those days that you dread.  Woke up and felt like crap.  Called in sick and resigned myself to another boring and wasted day in front of the TV, blowing my nose and wishing I was dead.<br />
<br />
Felt better after a little nap so I decided to log on to EQ and see what was up.  Got into a couple groups and managed to get some exp.  Then I noticed my EXP bar...... 92%.  And I thought wooohoo!  Felt a little better.<br />
<br />
Then I won Ornate Chain Gloves, and later won Face Mask of Frozen Mana, and a little later I dinged 65!  Oh, and got an AA later on too.  :)<br />
<br />
Started off like crap, and ended up wonderful.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Course, then I cried when I saw the prices on the lvl 65 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL grats to you!! :) I'm on Karana too, and I say wait awhile on the spells. Pretty soon the 65-sellers will find more runes, and the prices will go down. Last night I saw a copy of Focus of the Seventh for 40k, and I'd gotten mine for just over 22k IIRC. All the spells that are on sale now are between 5 and 10k more than what they were being sold for three weeks ago. Give it time, prices will come down again.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Saw one guy with 4 copies of Quiescence at 39k.  Geez.  Ferine Avatar for 20k (guildmate discount), Malos for 14k (not bad, but waiting), and 27k for Blood of Saryn if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Saw that Fo7 for 40k.  Yeouch.  Plan on waiting to see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Noticed you were in NC as well as on Karana.  Where abouts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Right near Winston-Salem. :)<br />
<br />
I got Q at 33k. It had been 80k for like three weeks at that point, and my GL logged his trader, saw it, and snatched it for me. I still consider it a bargain, as I've not seen it below 36k. Haven't gotten FA yet, I'm going to get Blood of Saryrn first I think. Saw FA for 35k the other day (*shudder*). Got Malos for 12k5, IIRC, which I consider a good price still, since I've not seen it lower. BOS has been as low as 22k, but Tordail The Generous Shaman (DOH!!) gave his plats to a guildie for HOV. :) Yeah well, I'll get the spells at some point. Good things come to those who wait ... or is that ketchup ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats on 65! and looks like grats on some of your spells now too.<br />
<br />
/wave from Charlotte, NC too.  Go Panthers! though I think we might be our butt whipped in the superbowl. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Both Nanuq and Tordail are less than 40 minutes from me.  What a small world!<br />
<br />
I sure hope the Panthers at least play well and give NE a run for their money.  My worst fear is coming true.... Panthers make it to the Super Bowl and lose pathetically on national TV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wowzar all these NC people. <br />
Im Curently going to school at UNC-Chapel Hill<br />
<br />
Go Tarheels<br />
Go Panthers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt; -- NC State, class of 92!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What's up with all this North Carolina stuff?  My guild's full of carolina people, and now you guys are all popping up over here too?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not there anymore, but I lived in NC for about 12 years (Burlington, Asheville, and Raleigh), and went to NC State for a while (yay for the street preachers in the Brickyard  :rolleyes: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ferine Avatar for 20k (guildmate discount), <br />

Must not be a melee guildie =P<br />
<br />
&lt;-- Wilmington, NC =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I must admit something ... I'm not a REAL Southerner ... I'm a YANKEE!! *dives for the foxhole* Moved to NC little more than 2 years ago from up around Buffalo NY ... Problem is, nobody can quite pinpoint where I'm from. I go home, and people who don't know me look at me funny and say &quot;You're not from around here, are you?&quot; ... Come back down to NC after having been up North and people look at me funny and say &quot;You're not from around here, are you?&quot; Hehe I like Southern-style winter weather. :p <br />
