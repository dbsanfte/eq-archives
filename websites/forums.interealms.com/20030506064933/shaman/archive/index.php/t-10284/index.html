<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nakuni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have had the luxury of owning one of these since I was lvl 1 (Had a monk decided didn't like him after 59 lvls).  But now I'm starting to get other bp's and what not and my question is when should I think about ditching the fungi, if ever?  Recently acquired the PoG Bp (spirit weavers).  Thanks for any feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep it till you get torpor.  Once you can cast torpor it becomes inconsequential, but until then it's the best BP you'll have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still wear mine often, even with torpor.  But agreed, no reason to get rid of it at least until that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">id say keep it until Vindi BP or better</div></div><hr />

First off I'm jealous of you. :p <br />
I had a borrowed Fungi for a half dozen levels or so starting in mid-50's if I recall. :)<br />
<br />
I returned it soon after scribing Torpor.  Think a monk is borrowing it now.  Thing has been passed around so much, no wonder there is fungus growing on it. :D<br />
<br />
I'd recommend the same (dump after Torpor) to you if you need cash.  Though if you solo frequently, (and you've obviously been used to having it) you should keep it in a bag for situational use after you get a decent BP w/ good AC+HP (&amp; hopefully some resists).<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
