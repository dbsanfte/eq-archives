Wierd things can happen when you are against a wall and cast a horse. Night before last, I was down in Mavuin's hall near the wall to the right and a bit forward as you enter. On casting a horse, the visual became dreamy green mainly featureless and ground/sky-less view and my /loc altitude was about -2500. No damage was taken. Within a short time, I popped to GY. My pet stayed up the whole time, but somewhat annoying.<br />
 <br />
I have seen other strange behaviour in PoK, PoN, and Paineel; popping up on top of roofs, getting stuck in a hedge, to appearing in a completely different part of the zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes itchy I posted that a while back, I've been able to reproduce it also Dragnor's Cauldron and ummm Great Divide (near the Velk's zone line).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tweedl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The same thing happened to me during hedge quest.  I summoned my horse against the hedge and poof, I was on the outside of the maze with no sky of floor to speak of.  Luckily I ran the outside of the maze, peeking through ever so slightly to keep up with the groups.  I ended up having to duel and getting beat to death by an orge, consenting someone to drag my corpse back through hedge, and then getting rezzed back into the action.<br />

Bottem line....horsey near wall = banishment to bizarro world :P</div></div><hr />
