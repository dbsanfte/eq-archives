<br />
I think they made themselves look very silly.<br />
<br />
Other classes mostly think we are whiners. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol i dont care what other classes think the time is now! its either get the right (or near right) stuff now or i will leave i cant see any fun past time at the moment and soon as it it not fun i will stop.<br />
dont get me wrong i loved playing eq and i still want to play eq but enough is enough, time to make a stand and to hell with the rest of them . and i not doing this because i want to save those slackers jobs but because i want to continue to have fun.<br />
<br />
ps that gikar is the man , well least at the moment saying what i feel.<br />
<br />
(though if other need u/g like pall or something i fully suport them making there own stands)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my opinion,<br />
Keep our Shaman improvement thread at the top on official Board.<br />
Keep to submit our opinion at shaman's ballance.<br />
At least they have no other choice to recognize our thread is always refleshed.<br />
It means shamans have problems and those were not resolved for us.<br />
<br />
Even if we criticize or attack someone personally, it cannot be our solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had a whole long rambleing post here thought out, then comp froze...im not goin to retype it.  Like Vigdis said though, other classes look at us as whiners, like there is nothing wrong.  This debate raged on my guild board for a few.  EVERY other class other than a sham said, sham are great, if not overpowered.  I asked if anyone had played a sham to EP, and told them to make one and play them to EP or GoD...noone responded to that &gt;&lt;  Its funny how other classes can presume that there is nothing wrong when they havn't walked in our fur boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think my guild are beginning to notice that something is wrong, since out of our 8 shaman...<br />
2 are alts that used to be mains<br />
3 dont play too often<br />
the remaining 3 can usually be found leveling alts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">for the person whop neg rep`ed me saying pls shut up now thanks? funny how i dont see a reply to this thread saying that?<br />
<br />
so no i wont shut up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i'll just start spamming them with emails, i really could careless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yea cas, that debate was interesting.  Sham do need lots of help, but too many other people still think of sham as too powerful from old content.  <br />
<br />
Though if people in the guild think that, i'm fine w it, they get me groups!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When the the &quot;warriors&quot; tried this way back, all but one warrior in my guild thought it was stupid. While there were problems with the class they were far from what the hysteria going on in TSW would have suggested, most of those people got caught up in their own hype. The so called &quot;warrior fixes&quot; actually did very little except make a few things a little easier, and they certainly didnt resolve any of the underlying issues which exist to this day. The issues faced by warriors at the time wasn't class destroying, but it did require warriors to adapt their play style within the context of the content they were facing. The good ones did, the poor ones whined.<br />
<br />
In the end the cycles of change caught up to everyone, and in the latest iteration of the game weaknesses that were less important became more important and the percieved tide of class favor changed. Actually the innate strengths and weaknesses of warriors/paladins/SKs didnt change at all, but the way content reacted to them did. And in the next expansion I'm sure it will change again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep you are correct , shaman havent got less than they had, the problem is that the evironment has chnage and gone away from long fights , which was shaman strength, to short fights that shaman are very weak at. howver they have said that the fast fights are here to stay for th next expansions.<br />
<br />
shaman are still as good in kunark and luclin, but as other classes have gain new lines and spells better for the fast pace shaman havent. and there lies the main problem. and shaman are lacking in pop and it gest much worst in hard ldon and GoD. that is really what we want shorting.</div></div><hr />
