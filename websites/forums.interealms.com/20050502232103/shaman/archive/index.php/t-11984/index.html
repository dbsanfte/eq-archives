I'm sure the moderators will move this to the appropriate forum very soon, just wanted to post it here to get the most exposure because it really helped me. Wanted the chance to reach the most poeple...<br />
<br />
I've had problems in the past going link dead, often in the Bazaar, and found this little trick that seems to prevent it. At times, you can do a /who command to save yourself from going link dead, but this trick seems to take care of all that for you.<br />
<br />
After you enter the game, go into windowed mode and open a command prompt window. Basically you are going to Ping your own internal address, which seems to keep your network connection alive in certain of these link death situations.<br />
<br />
Your internal address is 127.0.0.1, and the ping command has a -t switch to continually run the ping. You can also use the -L switch to set the size of the packet, to keep it small.<br />
<br />
So, the command I use at the command prompt is:<br />
<br />
ping -t -L 8 127.0.0.1<br />
<br />
http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/empire/images/ping1.gif<br />
<br />
While running behind your EQ, the window looks like this. I hope this helps some of you out there, it seems like it's been working pretty well for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I’ve had a lot of problems with my vendor staying connected more than an hour.  It’s been this way since the bazaar opened.  I tried yet another location in the bazaar last night out of desperation.  When I got up this morning I found the desktop staring back at me.  <br />
<br />
A friend suggested that it might be because of a lack of activity.  So I have a CNN web page up in the background now and I’m waiting to see if my vendor is still up when I get home from work.  The ping your suggesting seems to be something similar.  If the web page doesn’t work I’ll give this a shot.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

When setting up your trader for the night, do the following:<br />
Minimize clip plane, set opacity to 0%, /showspelleffects off<br />
face a wall or look at the floor<br />
turn off all chat - ooc, shout, auction, guild, all chat channels<br />
set all spells to yourself or group<br />
make sure badword filter is off (/filter badword)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NipperRipper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think non-EQ network activity has anything to do with you getting booted to desktop. I have left myself in the bazaar many many times over night with no issues, but then there are some times when the server goes down or the bazaar zone crashes (which seems to happen quite often) and I end up at desktop or in crash-land.<br />
Even if non-EQ network activity does make a difference, a ping to your local loopback address (127.0.0.1) will have no effect whatsoever since your packets will never leave your network stack and won't generate any network packets. At least ping some host that is really out there somewhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats a pretty nice trick for not going LD. <br />
<br />
Here is another for Windows XP users. XP has a known fault in the power management service. When your computer hybernates it turns off power to your network card, but when it comes back up it has trouble re-initializing the network card. So.... Turn off your hibernation Feature!<br />
<br />
I have been staying on all night (barring updates) with this trick.<br />
<br />
It also works if ou keep loosing connection to your DSL/CABLE connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My trader doesnt really go LD as much as it just dumps to the desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use:<br />
<br />
ping -t chat.everquest.com<br />
<br />
It seems to get rid of the kind of ld that goes away when you say something, but not other kinds of ld.  I still go ld in the bazaar a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My trader doesnt really go LD as much as it just dumps to the desktop. <br />
Same here, has been really bad since LoY came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm pretty sure the Bazaar zone since LoY has gone live is quite flaky.   It actually crashes frequently and many people will LD at one time.  It's definitely gotten better however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe the crashing to desk top is related to bad item links due to the Bad Word filter.  If you turn that filter off by typing &quot;/Filter Badword&quot;  This has sure help my trader stay up though the night.  I also try to stay away from setting up too near the banks as those places seem to be a favorite place for people to set up and just are lag central.  Lord for bid a bard desides to sing though the night near there with a annoying AoE song.  Hehehe good luck all you traders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can confirm the badword filter issue.  I run a 24/7 trader that was unable to stay on for the night after LoY came out, with the typical crashed to the desktop.  Since I removed the badword filter (it got switched on as default with the strart of LoY) I got 5 day sessions without drop.  From what I gathered it was an issue with the badword filter colliding with linked items - and in the bazaar someone is always linking items, only a matter of time till it gets one that crashes you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ironically I just went LD from bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for these ideas.  I tried several of them on my vendor last night.  And for the first time he stayed logged in all night.  I left him up today and if he’s still up when I get home I’ll consider it a success.  I always have my clip plane turned all the way down, as it’s far easier to maneuver in the bazaar that way.  But I also turn off all chat, turned off spell effects and turned off spells.<br />
<br />
I’ve not logged in any other characters yet, but from past experience I’m assuming these changes are universal.  Is there any way to make these changes affect ONLY my vendor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I find it REALLY hard to believe that pinging the local loopback address (127.0.0.1) will have any effect whatsoever on the game.  The loopback address is optimized in the network stack so that no data ever goes out on the wire.<br />
<br />
I can believe, maybe, that pinging some external address might have an effect, but it's far-fetched since plenty of network traffic is taking place just on your Everquest connection.<br />
<br />
You can get more sophisticated ping utilities that allow you to select the time between pings, btw, which would help your bandwidth a lot more than reducing the payload size.  I use PingPlotter, it's very nice shareware and graphically shows the ping delay to ALL the intermediate steps in the route to your destination.  http://www.pingplotter.com .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Believe it.  You know when your lag meter goes all staticky and yellow/red?  That is a problem with the game code, not your connection.  And oddly enough, pinging your local machine DOES work.<br />
<br />
I 2box on the same computer and the minute I open up that second window both lag meters do the staticky thing.  I made a small batch file after reading about this fix on the official EQ website tech boards, and it fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
My batch file looks like this:<br />
<br />
:LOOP<br />
ping 127.0.0.1<br />
goto LOOP<br />

It is named sonysucks.bat heheheh</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem I was having, was that my entire network connection would go down while I was in EQ. I'd go LD and have to reboot my machine to re-establish a network connection. When EQ would go LD, I couldn't get out at all before reboot.<br />
<br />
Somehow, and I'm not a tech guru, the local loop ping is keeping my network connection alive.<br />
<br />
It works for me, of that I have no doubt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Since your IM stays on for days will guess you have a persistant connection.<br />

have you checked if its just the bazaar you get disconnected from?  tried popping on a newbie to let him chew on his biscuits during a trader session?<br />

Also, see if streaming audio will keep going.  If your having connection problems it will break the stream and it doesn't always pick back up.</div></div><hr />

After applying this my vendor bot has been dead stable in Bazaar apart from those times when the zone is actually going down - cant do much about those.<br />
<br />
Another practical thing is just go to the back away from the crowd.  People wanting to buy anything from you dont browse trough traders anyway and its just as easy to find your skinny mule in the back using the compass-feature in /bazaar as it is trying to sort trough a crowd that looks like someone just shouted 'MGB HoV'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>RootX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">uhm.. not to sound rude but what the original Poster posted wont help in anyway with going Linkdead..<br />
<br />
The reason people were going Link Dead every couple mins was due to a Routing Problem inbetween Your internet provider and Sonys Bandwidth provider, to see if there is a problem click START &gt; RUN &gt; command &gt; tracert servername.everquest.com i.e. druzzilro.everquest.com   if you see anything over 250ms OR if you see -&gt; * &lt;-- those alot thats where your problem is just a bad routing problem..<br />
<br />
there are a few things you can do to make it so your internet connection is better.. you do have to have some Knowledge of how windows and networking works. there are Some programs out there that do all the work for ya personally i cant list any off cuz i dont use em :)..  <br />
<br />
might check online for something that Optimizes Internet connections <br />
http://www.speedguide.net/ &lt;-- great info / downloads to optimize yer computer for use with the internet :)<br />
<br />
oh and ping -t 127.0.0.1 just pings yer computer you could be offline and do that and it wont make any difference..<br />
<br />
just like if you had a network card and its ip# was  192.168.0.1.. and if yer on cable and yer ip was 24.76.243.2 and u pinged it all u would be doing was clogging up yer own internet connection and litterly wont keep you on a server thats trying to send you information and that information is getting lossed some where between the server and you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">well, for me at least it was the fact that they had left the debug code in there, I turned off my monitor last night and this morning I was still in the bazaar. was not doing to ping, but did have all chat off and such/ so forth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">uhm.. not to sound rude but what the original Poster posted wont help in anyway with going Linkdead..<br />
<br />
Hmm, you can of course choose to think whatever you like.<br />
<br />
I know, for a fact, that I went Linkdead over 30 days in a row. I began to ping my internal loop address and the LD stopped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night, I did not run the loop to again test the theory. Link Dead.<br />
<br />
So, for me this solution is working very, very well.<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that the Linkdeath that I am having has nothing to do with any traffic, but somehow my Router is getting bombed with tons of packets and just stops responding.<br />
<br />
Again, I never suggested that this would work for you, him, or anyone else but please refrain from making such general statements. It HAS worked for me, and a few people I know.<br />

<br />
I now have a 24x7 trader.<br />
<br />
I wasn't LD'ing, I was dropping to desktop.  Turned off Badword filter.  Filtered out OOC/shout/auction/everything I could find.  Tuned down all display settings.  Haven't dropped since then save for when the bazaar crashes or my router chokes.<br />
<br />
As for the perpetual ping.  I would think that indicates a network or security problem.  Some NIC's on some operating systems default to hibernate mode.  This is one of the first things I look for now on systems.  You would think that being in EQ would keep it from hibernating, but turning off hibernation has solved scores of problems for me.  <br />
<br />
Regardless, I'm a happy friggin troll.   :D</div></div><hr />
