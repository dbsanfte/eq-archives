<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Growlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just wondering which  Duo is better, Paladin/Shaman or Monk/Shaman?<br />
<br />
<br />
also i have a few questions about a Bard/Shaman is this a good duo?<br />
1)do their slows stack?<br />
2) can a bard tank?<br />
3)over all can this combo work?<br />
<br />
This Duo would only build up to 1-50 and then group/duo 50-60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I swear by the bard shaman duo.<br />
<br />
My brother and I have tackled King Bathezid, Kelorak Dar, Cliff Golems, Guardian Wurms, got the Reet Crown, Ixiblat Fer, Rathe Mountain and South Karana epic monks, Faydedar, Ulump, several other epic mobs, Radir, Tawro, Kithicor DEs, Phinney, Riff Cycle, etc., etc...<br />
<br />
We duod the eighth shawl for both of us, the ninth ring for both of us, the spiritwracked chords and regal band of bathezid quests for both of us, mask of draconic enhancement, qeynos badge of nobility, froglok stone, circlet of falinkan, camped for fun stuff like Voice of the Serpent, Wand of Impercepitibility, Ring of Stealthy Travel, etc., etc...<br />
<br />
My brother solo'd the preserved chokidai vocal chord camp, dessicated halfling mask camp, chardok pipe, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
It is an extremely potent combo, although the lull nerf hurt re: navigating through dangerous dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before a bard gets Fading Memories, you're a potent combo.  After a bard gets Fading Memories, it's game over man, you win the game. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>korshatiz123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If by duo you mean two boxing dont go with the bard, they need full attention to be effective. However if you mean two different people a shaman can duo with anyone and still be effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It just depends on the situation.  Bards and shaman are two of the most active classes to play.  They both require as much of your attention as possible.  Makes it a rather poor two-box, but two players can do very well.<br />
Paladin makes a very nice counterpoint to shaman.  Your skills and buffs dont overlap, making you very self sufficient.  Dps is quite low though.  Cheap to gear up.<br />
Monks are great fun, but can be very expensive to equip nicely.  Nice dps, despite what you've heard to the contrary ;)<br />
<br />
I've wrestled with this same thing myself.  Recently decided to add an account for those (many) times when there's too many shaman lfg.  First made a beastlord,  it just didn't really 'click' with me.<br />
Then a mage.  Mages are great, but I really wanted someone to tank the tough mobs while the shaman slowed/dotted/etc.<br />
Then a shadowknight.  Probably the perfect fit, really.  Was able to gear him up insanely well for little plat.  High aggro tank with snare, perfect for multis.  I just didn't have much fun with him.  There probably isn't a better companion for multi-boxed shaman though.<br />
And finally, monk.  Actually two monks.  First made a human, decided to make a 'real' monk and re-rolled as ikky.  The monk is crazy, period.  This guy can wipe out stuff the others slogged through.  I know that at higher levels, the monk will become less and less powerful against  the mobs I'm fighting.  But, by that time the shaman will be able to group with him and end that problem.  He went from 24-30 this morning in unrest.  Just run into a room full and start whacking away.  When they're all dead, mend and do the next one.  The monk has been, by far, the most powerful of the bunch, at least under 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Growlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the info just a couple more questions about the bard shaman this Duo is for 2 people not 2 boxing btw<br />
1) do their slows and haste spells stack?<br />
2) does the bard act as tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like paladin combo alot. Have no experience with the other two duos though.<br />
<br />
Bard tanking all depends on gear. Good gear, better tank. But between shaman and bard tanking. The shaman needs WAAAY better gear and AA's to out tank a bard. So you would want your bard tanking in a shaman bard combo.<br />
<br />
But you could probably get by without tanking at all if you find some good places to kite.<br />
<br />
About slow stacking, im pretty sure they dont stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the info just a couple more questions about the bard shaman this Duo is for 2 people not 2 boxing btw<br />

<br />
A bard can slow and a shaman can slow; they don't really block each other, although once the shaman slow is in place, there's no point in slowing with the bard unless it's for other reasons (agro or snare or aoe mischief) since the highest slow just takes effect (75%).<br />
<br />
A bard haste and shaman haste stack as well, but only the highest one will take effect.  A bard also has overhaste, which stacks with both.<br />
<br />
The bard is a much better tank than the shaman, especially with reflexes and defense, although in many cases the shaman can tank as well.  I've seen my brother tank better than a paladin and much better than a ranger with good gear.<br />
<br />
You'll want the bard to tank so that your hp and mana are protected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't speak for Level 65 Monks and Paladins, but I DO know as a Chain Healer at 58 the Monk required ALOT more chain healing. The Shaman would probably end up as the tank in a monk / shaman duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have some really good reasons for picking a Paladin. The fights are long, but you can get some really good camps when fighting undead.  I duoed a ton with a Paladin friend and it worked great.  I wasn't so cautious for trying crazy things cause he had a 90 percent rez.  I don't know if that makes a differance for you all, but dying for me and trying to find a rez later is not worth it.  <br />
<br />
Paladin also get Pacification which made most pulls great and with limited risk.  With a Paladin we could handle some pretty hard stuff.  I had many good times in this duo combo.</div></div><hr />
