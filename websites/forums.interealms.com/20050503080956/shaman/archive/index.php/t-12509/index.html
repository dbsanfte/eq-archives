<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kierok2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I two box and one is a old machine and as of the last patch I can not play on it. It is a old Compaq 450 with 128Megs of RAM and a Vodoo2 card &lt;yes, thats Vodoo2 Card&gt; and has worked great with only a few zoneing problems up till now. Now when I log in I get to the charecter select screen. I select a charecter hit enter, the monitor goes black music comes on and thats it. The music plays over and over and the screen remains black until I Ctrl-Alt-Del out. Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? This machine does not have a AGP slot and I can not afford another one.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I used to get this on my main rig, which is lots newer...<br />
(AMD 1.9gig, 512Ram, GeForce 4 Ti4400)<br />
I had to remember to log out in windowed mode or I'd get this issue, or my computer would freeze on char select. (but even with windowed it happened sometimes)<br />
<br />
To fix, I updated Directx to version 9, and updated my video card drivers.<br />
<br />
You may be able to find updated drivers for this card at<br />
Guru 3d (http://www.guru3d.com/)  or at <br />
Voodoo Files (http://www.voodoofiles.com/) <br />
<br />
and Directx is here:<br />
Directx (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx)</div></div><hr />
