<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this was already posted here somewhere, but here it is.  Since the last major patch (new UI &amp; bazaar), &quot;Affliction&quot; focus items now affect roots, slows and debuffs rather than only dots.  Pretty good change imo, my bracer and gloves fire off on almost every spell I cast now when soloing, and Im sure that longer duration slows will have a big impact on boss mobs  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wonder if my affliction haste belt will speed up casts then, that would be nice. Just got it so will have to test it out tonight. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My Chrysobel Talisman has cut casting time on Root to confirm that part :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mage summoned focus earring now works on Turgurs and Malo' too. Gotta love those focus items, hopefully they don't plan on changing them AGAIN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a hunch this is just a bug that will be caught and fixed soon.  <br />
<br />
They did this when the focus items first came out as well, but VI later changed it to affect only dot's.  My guess is that with the new UI patch they messed up the code.<br />
<br />
Enjoy it while it lasts though.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have the same hunch, as when the focus items were originally changed to not affect these spells, it was announced in the patch message (if I remember correctly).<br />
<br />
Can always hope though.</div></div><hr />
