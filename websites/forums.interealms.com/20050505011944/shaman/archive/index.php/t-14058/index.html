<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HarpuaKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I gathered 14 people together (people kept asking to bring friends) and we headed to Sol B.  We did get a VoQ, but couldn't get HoV if our lives depended on it, which they kinda did.<br />
<br />
We got to Sol B, buffed up, and headed in.<br />
<br />
I explained the CH rotation to the clerics, this was their first raid.  We had four so it wasn't too hard to explain.  They had the rotation down to a T.  I mean perfect, I was impressed.  We plowed through the FGs and lastly, Magus Rokyl.  So we're all in the buff room, redoing dummy buffs when I get a tell.<br />

Greldon tells you, 'you're not going to kill naggy'<br />
You tell greldon, 'why not?'<br />
Greldon tells you, 'b/c he's not up'<br />
<br />
I almost died.  Sure enough the bastard wasn't up and I had drug 14 people here.  He was killed 5 hours before we got to him by some German guild.  I didn't even know they attempted him, but then again they keep nearly everything w/in their little community.  Grats to 'em though, wish I had checked prior to organizing, would have saved a lot of trouble<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I know who to turn to next Monday when I go back.<br />

<br />
