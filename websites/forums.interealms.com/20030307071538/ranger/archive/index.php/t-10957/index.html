<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Montegue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SO, I was browsing the FoH board today, which I do for entertainment during my work day, and for the information they tend to provide, when I came across a subject line that really struck me. <br />
<br />
&quot;SKs get Raped by verant&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
It was the &quot;raped&quot; that cought my eye. <br />
<br />
We use that term so casually. It's aweful. Rape is so horrible, and yet we toss the word around like it's a ficking basketball. &quot;Wuooshi raped our guild last night&quot;,  &quot;Dude, Yarrick totally Raped Montegue in that duel!&quot;<br />
<br />
So, like an Idiot, I posted. Feel free to read the flames over on their boards. <br />
<br />
but it really got me thinking. Why has it become so acceptable in our EQ community to use terms like &quot;Faggot&quot; and &quot;Raped&quot; as if they were just another emoticon? It f'n bothers me that we can all be so casual about the words we choose to use while we play, and when we post to boards and such. <br />
<br />
<br />
Montegue<br />
<br />
off to think long and hard about how many times he's casually used &quot;Massacre&quot; to describe a sporting event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Salty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Montegue, it is just the nature of our society. Only the most awfull news, the newest car, biggest this, and loudest that gets any attention. We have become desensitized to the horrors and wonders of the world.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that I disagree with you, quite the opposite, but We are what We are. Look at the people we vote into office (those of us who even bother to vote, that is). Look at the most popular people in entertainment. We seem to be all about sensationalism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, Montegue... 'raped' is not a word to be taken lightly. When some d00d says 'Man, I was anally raped by Gorenaire last night' I want to send Bubba to visit him so he knows the difference. And using 'faggot' as a term of derision is a TOS violation... report it and say that your *fill in the blank* is homosexual and you are offended by it. Teach the little brats to use language appropriately!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I totally agree with you, but I find it kind of ironic that you use &quot;ficking&quot;, &quot;f'n&quot;, and &quot;B****&quot; in your post. Especially the last one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure how the term came to use either. But it's there, and when you hear it used in context, the likely hood of someone using it to describe twigs or iron is pretty damn slim. There are a couple alternate definitions to rape too, but lets be honest, we know what we are refering to when we use it. <br />

The definition thing i simply disagree with. We all know spicificaly what they are talking about. Their definition argument was a cheap attmept to justify trying to relate class balanceing to being F'ed against one's will. <br />
<br />
I agree about the Massacre thing. Been thinking about that one lately. <br />
<br />
Ever hear about this one? &quot;Rule of Thumb&quot;. Know it's origin?<br />
<br />
once upon a time it was ruled by the American Supreme court that a husband could beat his wife with a stick no wider than  his thumb. Sick eh? I make a concious effort not to use that phrase either. <br />
<br />
Anyway, i myself got waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too nasty on that board, and I felt bad about that, and apologized to one of the posters there. I was trying to stick up for something, and it was foolish of me to do it there. Anyone who sticks up for anything over there gets hosed. Makes me wonder if they use that kind of language in RL, or only online. oh well, I did what I thought was the right thing to do. <br />

Your vocabulary is terrible, in that case.<br />
<br />
When I see &quot;Boy, the Emperor raped my guild,&quot; I don't think about a sexual act. I associate the term with abusive treatment.<br />
<br />
Here's one for you: a convicted murderer is killed in the electric chair. He's then proven, after the execution, to be completely innocent via some kind of scientific evidence. The man or woman who ran the trial didn't lose a pregnancy. &quot;Miscariage&quot; has more than one meaning, just like &quot;rape.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
My one friend and I joke about everything, including personal issues like our religions (which are different :p) ...we both know we're not saying things to be mean, so it ends up being jovial.<br />
<br />
so long as it's not in seriousness, I think thing's like that are fine. I'm an extremist in this view, though, I think..<br />
<br />
and yes, I don't consider anyone using the term &quot;rape&quot; in eq to mean something sexual, although the other definitions of the term still have a same general impression. Language can be subtle at times, and this is a case where it is.</div></div><hr />

in my (possibly inflammatory) opinion on things like this go, so long as there's no intention to cause hurt with words, then it's ok.<br />
The problem is that intent is hard to judge in writing. Feelings can be hurt.<br />
<br />
On my guild board, we almost lost an officer member over one person saying that a certain action by a random ID10T in game was &quot;Retarded.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer in question has a daughter with downs syndrome, and was highly offended by the use of that word in the wrong context. If she'd heard it spoken with his original intent, it would probably have been better, but seeing it written, and not hearing his tone of voice, etc - she was very hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And 'retarded' can have other meanings as well.. but it is still offensive to some people. I'm guessing that those who have been raped have trouble hearing 'I was raped by the emperor last night' without hearing the sexual connotation. Besides, while 'raped' my have another connotation, kids on my sever complain that they were 'a** raped'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While &quot;raped&quot; has meanings other than those sexual, it is blatently obvious that those who use it regularly mean it in the sexual context.  To beliebe otherwise is delusional.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;retarded&quot; I use that world quite often..  As in &quot;The DNA uptake percentage was retarded due to the pH level being too low&quot;  I never thought to think that it might be considered offensive..<br />
<br />
On the other hand I'm particularly annoyed by perfectly PC people, so I'll prolly keep using it in that xontext =P</div></div><hr />

Could you provide a citation for that case?  I'd love to look it up, but I just can't seem to find it.  It would be awfully useful as a counterargument to these stodgy old legal history professor (http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~law/threads/rulthumb.html) types who say that this so-called derivation of the phrase is pure polemic bunk.<br />

Also known as the Rape Ballet, the concept revolves around the word's alternate definition of seduction.  Today, the word is very strongly associated with the forcing of sex upon another individual.  The range going from statutory rape, sex where a minor has sex, forced or not, through date rape, making the date have sex against her will, through any kind of intimidative means, to the violent and brutal version, which I won't describe here.  Its just a word, but its very emotionally charged by its usage in society.<br />
<br />
Faggot also has another meaning, cigarette.  Its slang, but so are any of the meanings that aren't bundles of sticks.</div></div><hr />

I think that the point was that while it CAN be used in a non-sexual context most daily users don't use it in that manner. I can tell you that the average 14 year old boy who says 'man, that dragon raped us' is not a scholar of the language trying to enrich his vocabulary.</div></div><hr />

I have seen congressmen refer to new bills as rapes of justice, rapes of the constitution and rapes of the bill of rights. These men do carefully chose their words and they can find no verb powerful enough to convey their dismay except this. Personally if someone said the Emperor Routed my Guild versus the Emperor Raped my Guild, I know which one more accurately potrays the horrible beating doled out by him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raped has another connotation, and most of the people who use it in game are using it to shock, which is appropriate when one speaks of justice and less so when one speaks of pixels. And many of them DO include modifiers which make it clear that they are using it in the sexual sense. The biggest issue I have with this is that it removed the horror this word invokes... is it really necessary to use the same work for getting beat up in a game and violent non-consensual sex? And doesn't it belittle the pain of victims of ACTUAL rape to hear the word used in such a casual manner? Imagine that last night some big, burly guy decided to beat you unconscious and have sex with you.... do you want someone using the same word for your experience and a total wipe with 96% rez in Vex Thal? Do you really think ANYONES night in EQ compares even remotely?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I don't see why when a word has multiple meanings people automatically assume its the insulting one being used.  I tend not to use the term raped at all, but not because I think it might offend someone.  The word rape does not ONLY refer to non-consensual sex, so when its used in the context of being slaughtered by a mob, its not insulting at all and should not be taken that way.  Instead of getting offended, just put a little effort into reading comprehension and give people the benefit of the doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ok.... I admit... I use these words alot...... and definition or no.... what you think about them or no..... here are my feelings.<br />

<br />
What Verant does to rangers = anal rape<br />
<br />
Giving our Lvl 60 class speicif title to someone's pet = anal rape with a big wooden buttplug.<br />
<br />
If your going to point out what words mean and what they have meant then your going to have to reevaluate alot of the words you probably use without thinking. Human society has been around for a very long time and over that time languages have evolved and changed and especially in the case of English.... has evolved diffrently in diffrent places. A common example of this......<br />
<br />
In england there are thousands of little old ladys that still call thier cats thier pu$$ys. But if they invited an america to &quot;sit down and pet thier pu$$ys&quot; that American would think something completely diffrent. The british slang word for a ciggarette is a fag. In american english a fag is a homosexual male. But none of that matters by your reasoning because a fag was originally a bundle of kindling wood. In england a torch is a flashlight. In japan if you want a cigarette from someone you make a hand gesture that to an american would mean jerk off. Language was invented to express thoughts and feelings and it just isn't suitable to the task. A thought and emotion are fluid things.... varied and subtle... a word is static. So over time those same words change meanings and meanings are given to diffrent words. If I said to a person I wanted to buy ram they would know I meant random access memory... a computer accessory. If I said that to someone from previous decades the closest association they could make was an album by McCarthy. Buying grass? Buying Pot? Anyone remember when a hard drive was a trip to your in laws and double clicking your mouse could make you go blind? Face it. Things change. Yes I may say a mob raped me and don't actually mean that the mob forced themselves on me in a sexual way... so what..... I can also say I fk'd my girlfriend but that doesn't mean I raped her.... but there was a time when it did. For Unlawfull Carnal Knowledge. Now I could say I wanted to go on a picnic with my girlfriend and no one would think that odd. But many years ago a picnic was a lynching where they would hang a african american from a tree just for bieng black. If your going to complain about people using words for purposes other then intended your going to be very pissed off for a very long time. Languages change. Accept it. Move on with your life.</div></div><hr />

It's not the same as relating in-game inequities to a sexual crime. It's as simple as that. <br />
<br />
You relate what a set of pixles do to your set of pixles as anal rape??? You may want to re-evaluate your perspective. <br />
<br />
The only reason this is getting &quot;accepted&quot; by the EQ comunity as a standard expression is that precious few people have the guts to say &quot;Stop it&quot; when it happens, or they get flamed ad nauseum by the immature for taking a stand.<br />
<br />
our guild makes a POINT of giving a ton of crap to people who misuse the word &quot;Gay&quot; on EQ. The multiple definition argument doesn't wash here because we ALL know what they are refering to. It isn't &quot;happy&quot;, which is an alternate meaning of the word Gay. They are using Gay in a negative fashion. The same argument simply DOES NOT APPLY to when people refer to rape in game, especially if they attach a descriptor like &quot;anal&quot; to it. Then we KNOW what they are refering to.<br />
<br />
To make light of such an act like rape, or anal rape, is irresponsible. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Look at the definition first of all.<br />
<br />
rape1 Pronunciation Key (rp) <br />
n. <br />
The crime of forcing another person to submit to sex acts, especially sexual intercourse. <br />
The act of seizing and carrying off by force; abduction. <br />
Abusive or improper treatment; violation: a rape of justice. <br />
<br />
tr.v. raped, rap·ing, rapes <br />

To seize and carry off by force. <br />
To plunder or pillage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Abusive or improper treatment<br />
To plunder or pillage. <br />
<br />
These two definitions in particular. Even assuming your going by rape as a thoughtfully used and used in total seriousness it's still valid. What Oowomp did to me when I was Lvl 35 definatly was abusive or improper treatment...... What I occasionally do to the entire Crushbone zone also fits.... to plunder and pillage. Now thats just looking at the use of the word rape in the commonly accepted means. However people who use it in this case don't mean it's actually definition as much as they mean something horribly cruel and debase done by them or to them. Personally I use the word spanked more then I do raped unless talking about something like Crushbone where I was killing greens in seconds and killed every mob in the zone. That is zone rape.... to plunder and pillage. When I went back later on another charachter and killed Oowomp I said I spanked him. No I don't mean that I repeatedly struck his buttocks with a hand or implement..... but if a friend asks me what I'm doing... and I say I'm spanking Oowomp... they will know exactly what I mean. No since the purpose of languages and words is to express an idea..... and since using that word succeded in expressing an idea..... I see no problem with it. Furthermore you distinguish that weed and grass are euphimisms. Well that is a yes and no arguement that personally I think your wrong on. However lets assume for a moment you weren't to save us some time. Even assuming you where correct in that they are euphimisms then what's to say my use of the word rape isn't another euphimism? What is to say that my use of the word wasn't simply a description? So what is your real problem with my using the word rape...... your believe that because rape in actual definition is used to describe a sex act that by all accounts is henious that it somehow makes that word special. Taboo. Forbidden. I say your wrong. It is a word like any other and as long as it gets my point across without the person I am speaking to misunderstanding what I am saying then as a word and description and euphimism it succeeds. If I say to my friend that I just raped this mob..... they are not going to think that I forced the mob to engage in sexual acts against thier will..... they are going to think I defeated this mob in combat. If you personally have a stigma against the word rape then that isn't my fault. I was raised the believe that there are no bad words only bad thoughts. Furthermore since we are in fact talking about a game where you do use force to achieve your gains.... I believe it is a right and proper and even warrented comparison. I wanted a Batskull  earring from Oowomp and I took it by force. I raped him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">then what's to say my use of the word rape isn't another euphemism?<br />
<br />
A euphemism is a word use to replace a more offensive or situationly inflammatory word.  What word then would raped be an euphemism for?  &quot;Spanked&quot; would be a euphemism for rape in the context you are applying, however &quot;raped&quot; is not an euphemism for anything I can think of.<br />
<br />
There are no bad words, true enough.  However, when you say &quot;I just got raped by xyz&quot; in /ooc or /shout you are being irresponsible with your words because the context which the vast majority of those who hear your words will be that of being &quot;taken&quot; (see, that was a euphemism) against their will.  You will get reply /ooc's of similarly inappropriate matter.  <br />
<br />
I strongly disagree with Ytrill.  He makes the claim that it is an over generalization that people who use the word &quot;rape&quot; to describe an EQ encounter do not mean it in the sexual context.  Then explain why if you were to respond with a sexual connotation they would not only agree and then follow with a more fanciful explanation of what mob xyz did to them?<br />
<br />
Are you saying to me that if you do an &quot;/ooc Vex just raped us!&quot; and someone replyed &quot;/ooc Bent you over and gave it to you real good, eh?&quot;  you would reply &quot;OMG, you sicko, I didn't mean it like THAT.&quot;  or would you say something along the lines of an unwelcome anal penetration with an obscenely large/rough object? <br />
<br />
Again, it is naive to think that the common use of the word is not sexual in connotation.  You could argue that you are not responsible for other people's misinterpretation of your words.  I would argue that if you used a different word to begin with, another word that would convey your meaning without being offensive, then no misinterpretation would occur.  Therefore you ARE responsible for how people interpret your words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Not all euphimisms are used solely based on bieng less offensive. Some are used to be more generalized in nature. Aside from that..... people shouldn't be shouting that xyz just raped them. That in my book falls under spam. As for people replying with a comment of a sexual nature that means nothing. You can make almost any comment sexual and guys are notorious for this. &quot;I need to get my tires rotated&quot; Guy... &quot;I'll rotate your tires baby&quot; Now the original statement had no sexual conotation but one was added in the response. Simialarly if I said &quot;I need to get off&quot; a person could reply &quot;Then go glaze a knuckle&quot; and be sexual or assume I mean camp and say &quot;Take care.... hope to see you soon&quot; Just because there can be a sexual response to something doesn't mean anything because anything can be made sexual with a dirty mind and an active imagination. As for your statement that people can use other words that are less offensive.... I find nothing offensive about the word rape. It's just a word. If you have a problem with it... then it is exactly that.... Your Problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">since you want to quote definations at me Monk,<br />
<br />
Main Entry: eu·phe·mism <br />
Pronunciation: 'yü-f&amp;-&quot;mi-z&amp;m<br />
Function: noun<br />
Etymology: Greek euphEmismos, from euphEmos auspicious, sounding good, from eu- + phEmE speech, from phanai to speak -- more at BAN<br />
Date: circa 1681<br />
: the substitution of an agreeable or inoffensive expression for one that may offend or suggest something unpleasant; also : the expression so substituted<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
The act or an example of substituting a mild, indirect, or vague term for one considered harsh, blunt, or offensive: “Euphemisms such as ‘slumber room’... abound in the funeral business” (Jessica Mitford). <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
n : an inoffensive expression that is substituted for one that is considered offensive<br />
<br />
so the statment that a euphanism can be a generalized term is false.<br />
<br />
 As for your argument about the sexual connotation reply, in real life someone saying would likely be slapped because it was obviously not the intent of the original speaker to have his or her statement turned sexual. However in all the cases I have witnessed in eq, the original person will reply to reply with a much more graphic description of how they were &quot;raped&quot; by mob xyz. <br />
<br />
You are right, rape is just a word. I have no problem with the word in and of itself. I do have a problem with people misusing the word to put a droll spin on a humdrum event in EQ. It is inappropriate in open chat channels and that makes my problem your problem because you are going to hear about it from me. I'd much rather see &quot;d00d, w3 jU5+ g0+ PWN3D&quot; than seeing someone try to describe their encounter with the term &quot;rape&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">No in real life a person saying something sexual in response to a non sexual statement would not get slapped. I do so on a daily basis but have only been slapped twice. However should a person reply in that manner there is of course an easy way to do exactly as you describe. /bonk. You say that it is an innapporitate word to be used and is used falsely. You quote definitions back at me to try and make your assanine point and yet refuse to accept that by the definitions I quoted at you the term is in fact used completely in context. Since you have apparently missed the definitions thruout thier repeated posting and quoteing on this thread I regret that I must restate them for your edification.<br />
<br />
rape1 Pronunciation Key (rp) <br />
n. <br />
The crime of forcing another person to submit to sex acts, especially sexual intercourse. <br />
The act of seizing and carrying off by force; abduction. <br />
Abusive or improper treatment; violation: a rape of justice. <br />
<br />
tr.v. raped, rap·ing, rapes <br />
To force (another person) to submit to sex acts, especially sexual intercourse; commit rape on. <br />
To seize and carry off by force. <br />
To plunder or pillage. <br />
<br />
<br />
As I have in the past I would draw your attention to two of the definitions listed there. &quot;Abusive or improper treatment; violation:&quot; &quot;To plunder or pillage. &quot; Your opinion may not be that a mob that totally whipes me out isn't abusive or improper treatement but that is your opinion. Same for the senator using the term to mean as example a rape of justice. Maybe in your opinion it doesn't... but maybe in his opinion it does. Just because you dissagree doesn't make the senator wrong in point of fact. He used it will within it's defined means.<br />
<br />
Now you quote euphimism to me.... so I must now get into the arguement that I had avoided earlier. Grass and weed are not euphimisms as they are not any less offensive then the term marijuana. They are in fact slang. Slang may not be in the dictionary but it is a mode of common speach and as such is acceptable in normal every day usage. So no matter what the definition of the word rape is.... it is almost unversally understood in meaning in the context &quot;XYZ just raped my guild&quot; You will not find AFK in a dictionary either but if I say I'm going AFK everyone in the game will in fact know what I mean whether I use /afk or not. If I said to a person &quot;Send me a tell if you want it&quot; they would know exactly what I mean because it has become a mode of slang used within the gaming comunity that is both widely understood and accepted. However that doesn't make it right and proper speech and a word used in the context of it's definition as defined by Mr Webster. The everquest community is exactly that. A community. It has it's own rules and in many instances it's own language. A chanter will say &quot;%T is Mezzed&quot; even though mezzed isn't a word and isn't the name of the spell bieng used. I can tell a druid to snare and they will know that if they are of suffeicient level that I mean for them to cast ensnare. If I say &quot;snare that mob&quot; I don't mean sit down and memorize the spell &quot;Snare&quot; and then cast it on that mob. I know that I meant and more importantly the person I was speaking to knew what I meant. If you are going to try to apply classic definitions to words used without the context of Everquest then you are going to have to 1) Remember all possible classic definitions and 2) Not understand what most anyone is saying to you. As for you making it my problem there are two points about this. The first is that just because you choose to take issue with something and debate/flame/ or anything else that person that has said it still doesn't make it my problem. I have the /ignore and it deals well with spammers that make thier problem everyone's problem. The second is that making your problem someone elses is not now nor has it ever been considered acceptable. Sure I have a problem with alot of people.... Sure with my physical dimensions, knowledge of weaponry and the use thier off and my personal collection of weapons I could in fact make my problem thier problem with a single well aimed shot or thrust of a knife. Just because I have the ability does not make it acceptable. However saying that ever you want is acceptable within reason. That reason is defined by those in charge and deals primarily with things you say to and about those in charge. Sure free speach says I can say anything I want but the fact of the matter is my account won't get suspended for using the word rape but it will for calling the guide a dickless waste of space that should pull thier thumb out of thier @$$ and stop bieng such a clueless moron incappable of even the basest thoughts. Sure I have a problem with GMs.... and sure I could make my problem thier problem but it wouldn't be a problem for long because I would be dealth with swiftly. However saying rape in a sentence is not a punishable offense. Saying fu******** isn't even a punishable offense but insulting someone else is. If you choose to insult someone based on thier using the word rape it is you who are in the wrong and to be punished and not them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Monk, I never said I did not accept the other two definitions of the word.  I said people are not using the word with those definitions in mind.  Simple as that.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if that second long paragraph was aimed at me (not an attack but please insert a paragraph marker.  It was hard to get thru that), because i had nothing to say on slang terms to begin with.  All I was saying was your calling the word &quot;rape&quot; an euphemism was an incorrect usage of the term euphemism.   <br />
<br />
For your point about it become your problem not being valid, apparently it is because you are here arguing your point.  <br />
<br />
As for free speech, yes in America you have free speech.  In EQ you do not.  Sony owns that world and you cannot say anything you please without consequence.  I could, if I choose, report people who use excessively graphic sexual imagery.  Have I ever?  No, but I have told them to take it to tells.  In doing so, my problem with them became their problem as I forced them to change their behavior.  If they choose to ignore me, then my problem would have become their problem and a GM's problem.  Therefore it is an invalid statement to say it is not acceptable to make your problem someone else's problem.  If that was true, there would be no EULA topics considering offensive language, now would there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">No they probably are not using the word with full knowledge of the commonly accepted definitions for the word but they are still correct in using it. No you didn't mention slang... I did. As such the word rape is used as slang by the people who do not use it with the definitions of the word in mind. <br />
<br />
As for overly graphical sexual messages and the reporting therof that is also a matter entirely up to your own personal judgement. Personally I don't think anything is to sexual. However by normal definitions of &quot;to sexual&quot; that would include such things as the quantity, volume, and duration of ejaculation, describing the sex act in detail describing all acts done therin. That is commonly accepted as to sexual and yet is still commonly found in society. Ever read or seen excerpts from a Jackie Collings novel? The only thing that women leaves to the imagination is the taste. <br />
<br />
The single word rape is not overly graphic in sexual orientation. Yes it does in some uses describe an act that is hatefull but even in that case the act of rape as described as forcing someone to engage in actions that are of a sexual nature is still not a sexual act. Rape the act... the crime... is a crime of power and dominance not of sex.<br />
<br />
As for you making it my problem... no... it still isn't my problem. We are all given the wonderfull ability to just ignore something. However I am here and posting. The reason is not to argue, nor is it because you have made it my problem. On the contrary I am here to attempt to educate those who seem to not realize what is wrong with thier statements.<br />
<br />
You  Dedolito are here posting messages in opposition to mine and yet I still don't consider this an arguement nor has your taking offense at the word become my problem. However you are wrong and I will try to show you the error of your ways in order to make the world a better place in which we all can live. People taking offense at words is something that has always bothered me and so I will try to point out the falacy in doing so whenever I can. If you should not see my point then I will go about my business and care not. Agree with me or don't.... I could care less.<br />
<br />
As for your problem becoming theres that is also false. The word rape is not overly sexual nor have I ever heard of an instance where someone was punished for using this word. <br />
<br />
On the other hand.... do I think it should be taken to tells... certainly.. I have already stated that. Shouting that ZYX raped me isn't overly sexual but it is spam. I don't know you and don't care that ZYX just raped you.  As such it should be taken into tells. <br />
<br />
Offensive language is in fact against the rules but language considered offensive is decided by those in charge and punishable if a person persists in using such language. However using the word rape isn't offensive. Calling someone whitty the blue eyed patty-o devil is. Offensive language is commonly described as making statements that are sexist, racist, or descrimanatory as well as using words that are considered by most to be vulgar. For a list of what words are considered vulgar look at this message board. I can not use the word F*U*C*K* without taking pains to disguise it as something other then what it is to escape the filter however I have to take no such pains to use the word rape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Thank you for the carriage returns, it was a lot easier to follow your argument this time.<br />
<br />
Again, I have nothing against the word in and of itself.  There are many legitimate reasons to use the word.  Talking about how Vex just lubed up and bent you over in a public channel is not an appropriate use of the word.  It is offensive and can be reported.<br />
<br />
No, they would not be punished for the word alone.  The combination of the word, along with the usual graphic descriptions of the act which I see all too often in public channels, is however punishable.  How often it is actually reported is pure speculation.  Usually people will cool it after being asked once or twice in the public channel.  Given that there are never any GMs around it would also be relatively futile to go thru with the report.<br />
<br />
Don’t mistake me for a PC goodie two shoe.  I’ve gotten into many an argument with the PC types about them being overly retentive.  However apparently even I have my limitations because words misused commonly, such as “rape”, “gay”, “fag”, etc really bother me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Montegue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Would you use the word, in it's commonly used context within the umbrella of EQ, in front of your mother, or your sister, or your girlfriend?<br />

Frankly, people use the anonymity of the internet to say and do things they normally would not do, because there is no real consequence to their words. To defend it is to simply try to justify your missuse of the language. <br />

<br />
You say that you think some people say things on here that they would never use in real life. That may be true or may not be true but I would have to remind you that alot of people just don't care. Me.... I learned most of the cuss words I have ever used in life from my parents. <br />
<br />
The only thing that might stop me from using words in real life that I use in Everquest is that I would then have to explain what they mean. Send me an message instead of send me a tell and the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Montegue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">This isn't about your basic cuss words. <br />
<br />
I doubt you would refer to your uncle as a fag, unless thats some sort of term of endearment or inside joke between the two of you. <br />
<br />
But if you went with him to a bar, where there were gay folks present, I doubt you would look at the outrageous price of the drinks and say &quot;OMFG that's so F'in GAY!&quot;. <br />
<br />
You wouldn't walk into a support group for battered women and say &quot;The BlueJays totally Bitch-slapped those Cubbies!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And the problem with the internet, and EQ in general, is that you have no controll over who is listening. If you care at all about other's sensibilities, there are some things that reasonable, decent people don't make light of. <br />
<br />
You have no idea if Sally High Elf has been a rape victem, or if Bob The Avenger of Good is, in reality, a gay teen ager coping with his homosexuality.<br />
<br />
/ignore is not a justification, and neither is the /filter command.<br />
<br />
On message boards, it is the same thing. You have NO IDEA who is reading, and if you just don't care, then you have serious issues. <br />
<br />
Further, the alternate definitions mean NOTHING to those victims of crime and hate. They know what people really mean. They know society turns a blind eye to their pain by cramming the words that decribe their hardships down everyone's throat until they become so cauterized that they just don't care anymore.<br />

We really are desensitized to words. I have, on more than one occasion, used extremely offensive language to describe my situation. I have said &quot;that test was so my bitch!&quot; plenty of times. I have never said that I &quot;raped&quot; anything, though many of my friends use that term. I don't like it, really, and I hate to admit to it cause I have a mouth like a sailor usually. But it is also our right to ask them to please not use that word. If they get indignant, then put them on /ignore. <br />
It is also my perogative to say &quot;ambassador dvinn is so my bitch!&quot; If Verant wants to suspend my account or you want to put me on ignore... well I deserve it.<br />
We all knew the rules when we started. <br />
Different people are comfortable with different things. They are not about to adhere to our levels of comfort, just as we are not about to adhere to theirs. If Everquest has rules, we must follow or face the consequences. Same for these boards. <br />
I understand that you meant it as a comment on the sadness of our human situation-- how callous we are when we can use a word with the connotations of &quot;Rape&quot; to describe something casual. I have used that word in not necessarily sexual situations, but with no less gravity. Exxon has raped the seas, we have raped the rainforests, the indigenous cultures, blah blah blah. Some people just don't mind the gravity of it. Just like I can call someone a word that is normally repugnant to most, which refers to my own reprodcutive organs in a less than respectful light. (Begins with a c, ends with a t, yes I say it regularly. I am not a nice girl, alright?!) <br />
I have no right to inflict that upon anyone else. And no one else has the right to tell me I can't say it. What we have here, ladies and gents, is the American Dream.<br />
I do, however, refrain from using the c-word around people I don't know. If that is redeeming at all...<br />
I had a point. Mainly live and let live. If it makes you unhappy, remove it from your life. You had the dignity to refrain, so draw strength from that. And if you wanna use it, draw your happiness from your own devilish enjoyments. And try not to bump heads. That's pretty much all we can do, no?</div></div><hr />
