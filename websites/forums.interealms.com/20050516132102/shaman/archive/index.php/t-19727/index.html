<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are your first impression of GoD?<br />
In terms of exp, new game systems, AA, Raiding, Tradeskilling(btw the tradeskill UI is not part of GoD), Mobs looks, group events, Loot, Beserkers, platinum/droppable stuff, the feel of zones and spells. Heard that some of the zones have a real dungeon crawl feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">change the not not bought still waiting/planning to buy to just not bought- still wating.  i can`t tell you if i planing to buy it yet as i am still waiting:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Zones, mobs and items so far seem nice.  Spells and AAs are disappointing to say the least.  TS UI although a little flawed, is great.<br />
<br />
Zerkers.... meh.  Will put the prices of chain, quest armor and ornate up - doesn't affect me, may hurt some younger shaman though while everyone equips their new twinks.<br />
<br />
Not sure of raid content yet - looking forward to being summoned and quadded for 4k though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love the new zones.  PoP turned everyone into a bunch of newbies where retardation was offset by the fact that CRs took all of 20 seconds and a cleric was always one zone away.<br />
<br />
So far this reminds me of Kunark - running to Sebilis to CR a group when it actually meant something.<br />
<br />
Oh and there's no pvp safezones hohoho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have only spent 2h in GoD yet but I like it. Nice chellange and it is easy to see now who knows to play his class and who is from KEI generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So far, the only thing good I have seen from GoD is the new tradeskill UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like it so far. The trade skill system is awesome, the Tribute deal is interesting. I've not messed around with the grouping point system as of yet. The Boat city is a night mare to get around LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm impressed.  We did a raid on the Packmaster last night and got our butts handed to us a couple times (we had only 40 or so, most of us Time geared).  The same zone was fun to hunt in as a single group, and some named drops some very nice Augs for a single group kill - they weren't hard, but neither were they simple; the named were yellow cons.<br />
<br />
The instanced expeditions are quite difficult, and we're still trying to figure out the &quot;temporary flags&quot; they were awarding.  There wasn't any loot aside from unknown tradeskill items and no drop (quest, maybe?) junk.  AA exp was about 2-3% per mob, and took about an hour per AA.  The expeditions don't have a time limit, but there is respawn, so if you wipe at the end (that will be common), you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm very happy.  Tonight is our night in Time, otherwise we'd be right back exploring and learning more.  I'm anxious to return.  Packmaster must die!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Said no.  I am a casual player so the main reason I got it was the possibility of new spells (even if they are only mediocre).  Wandered around Naibimi(sp) some last night and have to admit I was a little unimpressed.  I liked the nice cohesive themes to the LDoN adventures, it seems we are now back to big open zones where random weird things wander around waiting to attack or be attacked.  Not giving up on the thing yet....especially if there is nice loot to be had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As a 57 Shaman, I thought the new expansion was pretty decent. In Natimbi, I ran around with my wife (52 Monk) and we were duoing just about everything. Mobs hit kinda hard and fast, so slow is a big priority. Resists at 57 seem to be about 50/50 firing off Turgur's without Malosini. Basic strategy for us was slow, epic DoT, sick dogdog and Stoic near the end. No deaths, not even close. The trains are a bit sick with people running around like chickens missing their heads. Couldn't zone over to The Hanging Gardens zone because of level lock (which was patched) Abysmal Sea zone is a bit confusing as far as layout, but the mini-quests seem helpful for beginner tradeskillers. The new potions make me very happy, especially snare. Only downfall to them is they don't stack and could be bothersome to carry, as 6 slots plus an empty medicine bag is hard to handle (I'm a packrat). The tribute system, if it stands as it is, will be very nice. Can keep the effects going indefinately just by farming for one or two nights a week. I have amassed 100k FP and only spent 3kpp.<br />
<br />
Overall, I believe that GoD is a decent expansion. Back to what I had come to love about pre-PoP EQ. I have a few lvl 65 friends who got wiped on the same mobs that my wife and I were taking out, so that tells me that all the lazy people who raced to 65 in PoP and developed no tactics can't run through content. Other than the level locked zone, the content I saw was impressive. I like the new models, the low HP mobs and the mini-quests available. I have no opinion on the spells as I have quite a ways to go before seeing any. Nice, challenging expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've heard a lot of good things about the dungeons in it. I still think though the tribute thing is a lame gimic, and the aa and spells lack innovation though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am a little disappointed in the way our AA turned out, and of course the horrible disease dot.  However from what I have seen so far (although it isn't much) the content for GoD looks really good, and that is what really matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What I like about it is that now everyone has a chance to get some elemental quality exp in areas, with the same types of fights and difficulty that you'll find in the elementals.  I'm sure anyone that's been to barindu or ferubi can tell you, those first mobs that you fight are a serious reality check.<br />
<br />
Plant is very difficult.  It was the zone that i was soloing in testing out the crit dots for a bit until they decided to up the difficulty.  So, in the span of two hours it went from 600 hitters to double 1200 hitters.  Soloable yes, easily.. hell no.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I fixed my spelling mistake bastards.  I just type too fast for my own good sometimes, and that's why alot of my words end up together or slightly misspelled (oh, and I hate spell checker so that helps too).<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Solealbe yes, easily.. hell no.<br />
<br />
n.  solealbe  (sul - ee - owl  - bee)<br />
     1) creating new words with hopes of creating vernacular<br />
     2) creating new words that no person presently understands<br />
<br />
<br />
that is one bass-ackwards sentence Valsuvious, couldn't resist playing around with it. cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">3) alternate form of soloable when you forget the proper spelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm actually just plain pissed.<br />
<br />
I can't believe I actually ****ing bought it..........I can't believe I actually ****ing bought it, what in the hell was I thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My impressions of GoD thus far:<br />
<br />
All jazzed and excited I log in on patch day.  Like a kid in a candy store, I drop my hard-earned and long-saved AA's into various new and appealing-sounding areas, one of which being the &quot;endurance&quot; ward.  I run around Tranquility jumping my ass off to wear down my endurance bar, take a seat and note the rate it's regenerating.  I repeat the experiment, jump around like an ape some more, and drop the ward -- same regen rate!  Whaddaya know, it's a hp regen ward just like the other priests got.<br />
<br />
After being generally disappointed with the meager choice of Gates AA's (and the waste of 6 on that crappy hp regen ward) I drop my remaining saved AA's into ID and head over to Nedaria's Landing to join the throng in the exploration of the Great Unknown-except-by-ubers.<br />
<br />
I slay some stuff in Natimbi, I move to the next vowelly unpronounceable zone northwards, group for a while, loot a couple of ambiguous questish items, get bored with old-graphic humanoids and move on to a couple of the other zones.  I end up in, hm, I think it was Bikini.  Yeah.  I'm walking around looking at the dull-ass monotonous design, the endless assrape humanoids, when - oops - a see-invis wanderer on selos stops by to say hello! I have just enough time between the snare proc and the tripple 1200's to type /loc.<br />
<br />
Two days later, I still haven't recovered that body.  Looking at shaman spells and AA's, at the (albeit limited) scope of the zones I've seen so far, I realize GoD holds nothing new or exciting for my shaman, nothing for the character to really look forward to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My berserker's level 29 now, with no PL /flex.  Maybe I'll see some of you over at the berserker message boards sometime soon.<br />
<br />
/wave crucible<br />
/rude GoD devs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">GoD = No EXP.<br />
<br />
But it is pretty funny to see all of the E-Bayers and Uber Guilds go running for their lives because they forgot how to play the game or can only raid if someone put the step by step instructions of killing a boss in front of them.<br />
<br />
Hehee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">my impression so far is that it's only worth buying if you're level 65 with serious gear.  how wrong am i?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">my impression so far is that it's only worth buying if you're level 65 with serious gear.  how wrong am i?<br />
<br />
you are very wrong<br />
<br />
Anyways, I love this.  This is fun for me.  All of this is challenging.  Fun and challenging.  No longer can you move around the whole zone and not worry about losing invis or being seen by something.  This whole concept about graveyards is obsolete now.  You can't just step into a zone and go from point A to point B without making sure that nothing will see you.  It benefits to pay attention to the layout of the zones to figure out the best way (it's like, you can take Qinimi to Barindu, but we've found a good % of the time it's best to run through Riwwi to Barindu instead).  All of the Kyvs seem to see invis so avoid them.<br />
<br />
The exp in places is goin to be better than others.  The plant has great exp, but it's alot more challenging than the other sewer zones.  The HP in Barindu is train central area, and it pays to pay attention to where you are standing in there (there is a safe place to stand, however I guarantee that not everyone is that smart to do it, and will train you).  I get in there, remove invis, hail the HP and immediately invis again just to make sure.<br />
<br />
The area by the apprentice isn't totally safe, it all depends on what mob is roaming. Sometimes it's a kyv, and when that happens, you have to run back towards the mtn pass and wait for him to pass before you hail the Apprentice.<br />
<br />
What's great is that these areas won't be frequented by the normal run of the average person who doesn't know how to play.  There will be occurances of course, but unless you are smart about how you move about here, you aren't going to get very far.  Sometimes its unavoidable and someof the mobs are unforgiving, but for the most part, it's not too bad.<br />
<br />
On that note, some areas of course aren't going to be able to be handled by a normal tank.  If you do make it to Vxed and Tipd, a tank with 7k hps isn't goin to cut it there.  Mobs hit too hard.  There is alot of room to get only single mobs, but they have an extremely high risk right now.  Exp isn't too bad there, prob cold be just a bit better though.<br />
<br />
More later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not trying to be difficult, but your statement is coming from one who obviously has been through time and has over 6k hp unbuffed...<br />
<br />
Is it worth it for the shaman who is 65 but has less than 3k hp and a couple dozen aa or so, and if it is, what makes it worth it?  Saying that it makes you think is not my idea of an answer, especially since I try to push myself into new and different things as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've been seeing a whole lot of people that are through PoTime raving that this is great... but that is from people that have 10x the dps and 3x the unbuffed hp.<br />
<br />
I haven't gone in yet but as of now I'm not really excited.</div></div><hr />
