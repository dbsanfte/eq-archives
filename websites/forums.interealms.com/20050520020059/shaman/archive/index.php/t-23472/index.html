<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well this is just a little idea but if every one of us wrote a petion which simply complained about spells being given to shaman in omens, I think that would probably have a bigger effect than moaning about / not purchasing the expansion. <br />
<br />
lol can you just image the poor GM's if they got 1000 of petions going<br />
<br />
/petion stop screwing over the shaman class in omens.<br />
<br />
And if you got every one in your guild to do it as well you may actually get someone to come and talk to us about it. <br />
<br />
P.S. I think Rytan plays a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Druids haven't exactly gotten a great lineup for oow either. Have you seen the numbers for their 70 spells with the lowered foci? The only classes that are really making out good are the specialists. Wizards got a huge jump in damage potential, clerics get a pretty nice healing jump again.</div></div><hr />
