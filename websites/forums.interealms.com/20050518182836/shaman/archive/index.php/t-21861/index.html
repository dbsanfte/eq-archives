Common sense should tell you that all of those spells are still being changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, Shako, common sense has never prevailed in case where Shaman get the business end of a broomstick before, no reason to apply it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, we should all basicly not stress over the new Omen spells on Lucy.<br />
<br />
They'll change repeatedly, and what goes live will probably look nothing like what we see now.<br />
<br />
But we SHOULD keep an eye on how they change.  The newest change is indeed rather silly, and we should make sure SoE knows that it IS silly.  But let's not go nuclear, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dreamx2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No sir Common sense would say lets not realease the spells until we have then right and not give people the impression there getting the shaft to begin with thats common sense why post something thats broken and not wait to post it till its fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">common sense would be to stop to give dot to shaman in fast fight concept situation</div></div><hr />

<br />
Call me crazy but I don't recall OoW being released in the past week or so... which would mean that /gasp the spell hasn't actually been released.  Yes, lucy is a data miner, and picks up the spells and such that are under testing and most likely to change before the actual release of the expansion. <br />
Though I do agree that I really don't see the need for a more powerful dot as I rarely pull out my current ones in group situations.  Hell even in hard ldon and common exp zones like BoT mobs die fast enough that by the time they are slowed a nuke will end up doing more damage than a dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All you wait and see folks ask yourself one question:<br />
<br />
Does SOE have a history of changing spells for the better before release?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kvak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, it is 9 more damage per tic, but it is also 5 vs 7 tics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Common sense should tell you that all of those spells are still being changed.<br />
Common sense tells me to grease up and bend over, so I only feel some momentary discomfort while SOE is screwin it to my class AGAIN.<br />
<br />
Changed, yes. For the better? No. <br />

Herre is a more comprehensive view of the spell situation, in case some of you want to be facing the Dev's missionary-style when they GIVE-IT to us: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21831</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's funny how every pre-expansion period people fret over how we're going to get shafted and they get told &quot;don't worry the expansion isn't released yet you have nothing to bitch about&quot;.  Then the expansion is released and we get shafted.  How many times must we repeat this procedure before we learn that we MUST bitch pre-expansion cuz things won't change after release?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Clearly EQ isnt dying if people still want to adopt the &quot;wait and see&quot; policy. I mean, no one but a noob could possibly think that works after its happened to us for the last HOW many expansions?  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  Wake up you lemmings!  SoE, and Ryan specifically, will undoubtly screw us again.  He has even said so (in not so many words) by indicating his perceptions of the shaman class.  <br />
<br />
You can be an ostrich and stick your head in the sand, or a sheep and just be led to slaughter (and irrelevance) or you can voice your displeasure in the hopes that it will be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I too think that we have been getting shafted with a lot of spells. <br />
<br />
However, when the expansion isn't even close to being released, I think its dumb to start bitching about a spell thats not even near to where the final spell will end up looking like.  I mean lets at least wait till it starts beta, then bitch about it.<br />
<br />
Every thread I read lately is people bitching about something, it irratates me a lot and this is probably the only thread I responded to.  I'm just going to go back to lurking lol.<br />
<br />
Btw, thanks for the negative rep bumps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The biggest impact to any projects direction and outcome can be made while its still nebulous. Once there are target numbers, tweaks will be minor. And dont forget, any upgrades we get to stuff now will be LESS than our level 70 spells. Therefore those level 70 spells need to be badass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bane is a 5-tick curse DoT<br />
Blood of Obkin (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5414&amp;source=Test) is a 7-tick poison DoT. And it is one of many spells that are obviously in active development for an expansion that is still two or three months away so stop the obnoxious whining OMG. Test and feedback now, cry and stomp your feet later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh good, another poison dot that can steal unwanted aggro after two ticks of damage. <br />
<br />
Of course, they're are too busy fixing the TOTAL ADMITTED screw-up that was GoD to worry about fixing aggro from poison counters.  But just throw the shaman another poison dot.  Oho!  I have a better idea!  A disease DoT!  One that lasts like 3 mins and does 2k of damage, with an initial DD to break root, just because.<br />
<br />
It's like that folkstory about Job and God.  After all his trials, Job asks God, &quot;So you did all this to me, just to win a bet with the Devil?&quot;<br />
<br />
God replies, &quot;No, there's just something about you that pisses me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not that I'm making ANY comparison between SOE employees and the supreme creator of the universe, but there just must be something irrational about shaman that pisses them off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Blood of Obkin also doesn't have the stupid 24 sec load/recast on it either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, this spell is the poison dot line (BoS) upgrade, not the magic dot line (Bane) so you need to compare it againste BoS, not bane. I think in another thread when the first iteration of Obkin came out, and people were discussing it, it was pointed out that based on the mana ratio compared to BoS the new dot would probably end up doing about 400 dmg/tick, which is pretty close to what it has been changed to.<br />
<br />
That is not to say it wont get changed further, the spells are still in development. They did say (apparently) in the summit (its in one of the threads) that the agro associated with poison spells was more than was intended, so perhaps that will get changed in the next few months.</div></div><hr />

Broke out laughing at work, got some funny looks :D<br />
<br />
Seriously, this has always been my concern about the devs.  This last set has been hyped as players who love the game.  But because they're players, they also have their own preconceptions about the game.  Ryan may well have hated shamans in the past and is letting that cloud his judgement, who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">710 was obviously a typo from the moment it appeared on Lucy, and calling it a nerf is somewhat silly.  However, everyone that takes the wait and see approach is going to be disappointed with their spells with the next expansion (sooner or later).<br />
<br />
P.S.  I remember at least 3 expansions where the shaman spells were pretty crappy and most people said &quot;wait they are just on test/the expansion is out in several months/stop whining/ etc.&quot;  These people have NEVER been right to date.  Will they be right this time?... (if I was betting my life, I'd stake it on no)</div></div><hr />
