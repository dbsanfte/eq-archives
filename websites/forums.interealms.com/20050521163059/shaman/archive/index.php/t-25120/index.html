<br />
I'm going to document how to get the level 20 armour as I get it, so that future Mystics and Furies can do these quests without too much trouble. Both the Mystic and the Furies have the same quests - and I believe monks have it too, whereas the Templar armour appears to be a different set of quests altogether. <br />
<br />
The Quest NPC who gives you these quests is Selwyn Oakheart, in South Queynos, near the Antonica gate. The quest itself is called Selwyn's Errands.<br />
<br />
----- QUEST #1 ------<br />
<br />
The first quest is for a pair of gloves.<br />
<br />
The quest wants 20 Caltorsis Clerics, and 4 Sabertooth Elders.<br />
<br />
The Clerics are soloable, however they are a bit of a problem. They are green at level 21. They roam around the Ruins of Caltorsis in Antonica, and look like glowing white Erudites. I have seen them in the front of the ruins, the back of the ruins, and both sides, they spawn at night and in the day, and they are fairly common. However, they are very hard to see and are usually surrounded by green - and aggroy - knights, magi, and other mobs. With my graphics card, as buggy as it is, I can't see them unless I'm directly next to them. However with a better card you can see them further off. I ended up grouping with a charming bunch of wizards, sorcerers, and magi who were hunting the named there, and they were able to see - and pull - them from quite a distance. If your graphic card is not up to snuff - as mine isn't - you will probably need help. If you can see them, they are easily soloable at level 20.  If you group with another person, no matter where you are at the ruins, if someone kills one, you get credit for it. So splitting up and searching is the fastest way.<br />
<br />
The Sabertooth elders require a group. I've done it with just 3 people - Merroci, Tigre, and myself, but we had many failures. I'd recommend no less than a group of 4 for guaranteed success. To create the elders, you'll need to do a time trial. Find a sabertooth tent, preferably without the &quot;distressed merchant&quot; near it. That seems to ruin the spawn. This tent will have 3 or 4 groups of sabertooth around them, with about 1 rune caster per group, sometimes a warlock as well, the rest will be battlers. There are two sabertooth tents near the Keep of the Ardent Needle, one to the left, one to the right. Quickly - clear all the camps before they can respawn. I estimate it takes about five minutes before a respawn, so move fast, don't med or wait for mana - just knock them down. They will be grey/green to you, but the issue isn't surviving - it's knocking them down fast enough. Don't yell or break any encounters. If you kill all the groups before one of them respawns, a group of 2 elders and 2 tormentors will spawn at the tent. I believe the tormentors are needed for another class's armour quest, not sure which. Anyway, they are fairly easy. Since you will need 4 elders, you will end up doing the time trial twice. It's fairly easy as long as you go fast.<br />
<br />
The reward - for Shaman, not sure about druid - is Trade Cured Gauntlets. They look brown and leathery. Stats: Medium grade, 82 ac, Heat +80 Disease +100 Health +13  Wisdom +3 Agility +4 Power +11, no-trade and attunable.<br />
<br />
<br />
----- Quest #2 -----<br />
<br />
The second quest is for a bracer.<br />
<br />
This quest requires 25 hulking stalkers, 20 plaguebringer acolytes, annd 8 bloodfang broodtender spiders. <br />
<br />
The hulking stalkers are soloable. They are green or blue at 21, aggroy, and wander the hills directly west of the Windstalker village. Watch out for the roaming bears, which are also green and blue and aggroy, they are an unpleasant add to any fight.<br />
<br />
The plaguebringer acolytes is a time trial. Find a foci of decay at Caltorsis. There are four there - one to the south of the ruins, one near the cliffs to the west, one directly north of the ruines, one to the northeast across the river. Clear out all the surrounding groups of restless Caltorsites before they can respawn - there are usually four groups, with grey/green mobs that come in groups of 4 or 5. A large group of 4 to 5 plaguebringers will spawn at the foci. They are aggroy, so don't sit directly on the foci. This is the important part! WAIT for them to summon their pets before you start, or the encounter will break. DON'T use any wizard AoE's, it also breaks the encounter.   I had two encounters break on me that way. Also, sometimes after you clear the foci, a single trio pair will spawn, of two acolytes and one Priest. The Priest doesn't count for the quest, but she drops nice loot - an int staff, some coral earrings, and other items. The xp from doing this part was very nice, I got about 20% of level 21 getting my plaugebringers. You will need a group to do this, one high on dps and able to move fast and cut through all the camps in under four minutes.  <br />
<br />
The broodtender spiders live in the bottom of Blackburrow. There are three spawn points in one cave. One is a single group ^^ green spider in the hall. Then there are two camps inside the cave itself, each with one spider and four hatchlings. The spider is hard, the hatchlings are easy. They are on a five minute timer. I would say the single one in the hall is soloable, the ones in the cave are not. <br />
<br />
The result is Trade Cured Bracers - AC 129, Health +13, Poison +100, Int + 2 Divine +80 Power +12 Strength +5 Attunable No-trade. <br />
<br />
It's kind of a crappy piece for a shaman or a druid as there is no wis on it. Ah well, I will replace it as soon as I can find something better.<br />
<br />
----- Quest #3 -----<br />
<br />
The third quest is for a pair of boots.<br />
<br />
This quest requires 8 strong boxes from the library in Stronghold, and 8 feign zombies from Stronghold. Both of these require a group, preferrably a strong full group as they are yellow group ^^ mobs to a level 21.<br />
<br />
The strong boxes are in the room to the right of the library, near the door to Antonica. They come in groups of three, there are two spawns. Sometimes you get a mimic instead with a named, it drops nice loot, but doesn't count towards your goal. There is also a single box on one side of the wall. Sometimes you can find a box in the Crusader room, however, the library is a guaranteed place to find them.<br />
<br />
The feign zombies are on the same level as the Atrium in Stronghold. There are four that spawn in the room where the crawlway leads to the Library, they come in groups of 2. This is also the goo room if you have a writ that needs goos.<br />
<br />
The result is Trade Cured Boots - AC +89, Health +16, Magic +60, Mental +120, Agility +4, Power +11. <br />
<br />
Again, there are no wis on these boots and the raw power isn't exactly great, compared to the Boots of the Grave which you can get by questing in Stronghold.<br />
<br />
----- Quest #4 -----<br />
<br />
The fourth quest is for shoulders.<br />
<br />
This quest requires 20 deadly scarabs, 10 diseased corpses, and 15 forsaken shrillers. All of these creatures are found in the Crypt of Betrayal. <br />
<br />
The deadly scarabs are level 20 group ^^ mobs. They might be soloable by the brave, but I wouldn't try it. They are very common and they drop chests frequently. Last night, we got three adept 1 spells, three different tradeskill volumes, a fish hook (some sort of a quest), and several bracers from chests dropped by the scarabs. They're also very good xp, and are very abundant in the hallways of this zone.<br />
<br />
The diseased corpses are also blue, but I believe they are single ^ group. They also are aggroy. Some spawn in the &quot;corpse room&quot;, a room with several groups of diseased and other corpses, including a named, they used to also spawn in the entrance but they don't anymore. So you're going to have to camp the corpse room to get it. <br />
<br />
The forsaken shrillers are blue ^ group mobs, and cast smite. They live in the hallways and are slightly hard to find as they aggro on people as they walk through the halls. My group found that staying near the &quot;t&quot; intersection on the first floor allowed us to see down all three hallways at once and have the best chance of finding them as they spawned.<br />
<br />
The result is Trade Cured Spaulders. AC 140, Heat +80, Stamina +4,Health +12, Wisdom +4, Cold +100, Power +17, no-trade and attunable.<br />
<br />
----- Quest #5 -----<br />
<br />
The fifth quest is for pants.<br />
<br />
This quest requires 12 sabertooth diviners, 25 swarm beetles, 12 corpse feeders, and 8 unearthed settlers. All of these creatures are found in the Thundering Steppes.<br />
<br />
The first two items of these require a group. The second two are soloable.<br />
<br />
The sabertooth diviners are located near the northern part of the Thundering Steppes. Run down the road as you enter and take the second left. You'll see a crater on your left. Inside the crater are several gnoll tenters. Around these will spawn sabertooth diviners and sabertooth looters. Both of them are spellcasters, so it doesn't matter which you kill first. They come in groups as small as two, and as large as five, and are marked as group, with no ^ arrows. They were level 21 and 22 mobs. With a good group, they are very easy to take down and respawn quickly.<br />
<br />
Follow the road to the end, between the fields of undead farmers and workers and scarecrows. In the green areas you'll see groups of swarm beetles spawn. There are five to a group, marked group, and have no ^ arrows. They are leel 21 and 22. They spawn quickly but are highly contested, so it may take some time to get them if the area is camped.<br />
<br />
The corpse feeders are found in the dry riverbed. Go through the bridge keep (while the gates are open in the day) and you'll find the riverbed. In the bed you'll see the corpse feeders - they're level 23 solo crabs. They aren't particularly hard to kill, although their spawn rate is low.<br />
<br />
The unearthed settlers also spawn in the dry riverbed, in the same area. They are level 21 solo mobs, and are aggroy. They are very easy to kill however they have a low spawn rate. Clearing out the solo unearthed villagers made the unearthed settlers spawn faster, I believe they are a placeholder.<br />
<br />
The result is Trade Cured Leggings. AC 146 int +5 str +4 health +16 power +14 vscold +80 vspoison +120. Not wearable until level 23.<br />
<br />
<br />
----- Quest #6 -----<br />
<br />
The sixth - and LAST - quest is for a breastplate.<br />
<br />
This quest requires 12 steelhoof mystics, 8 griffawns, 10 highland huntresses and Shadowdash, a named Grif. All of these can be found on the Thundering Steppes.<br />
<br />
The swarm beetles are easily enough found. Take the second left on the road in from Antonica and you'll pass a bunch of fields. There are animated scarecrows here - needed for light armour's quest - and there are swarms beetles. These come in swarms of five, and are level 21-23, so you will need a group to take them on, preferably with an enchanter. However they have a quick spawn and are easy to dispatch.<br />
<br />
The steelhoof mystics are a bit more scarse. They also require a group. Sometimes they can be found at t4 in groups with other steelhoofs, but no more than 1 or 2 in a group, and they are level 24+ and are quite hard. I recommend a full group with an enchanter. You can also find single - but double up yellow group - mystics in giant valley and in giant canyon. Getting all 12 took me about four hours.<br />
<br />
The griffawns are found in Grif valley. Go to t2, take the west road, and it will lead you to Grif valley. There are solo blue griffawns, and grouped griffawns that come in a pair with a griffon. They are all aggroy. They pop fairly quickly, so doing griffons can be done either with a group or more slowly by yourself. <br />
<br />
Shadowdash spawns by some rocks by mirror lake in Griff valley. It's very easy to find. If you have the quest, he'll instantly spawn and attack you with two shadow hawks. It's not hard if you have a complete group and are prepared when you walk towards the rocks - but be ready! If you are not, you'll get a wipe.<br />
<br />
And then we come to the most frustrating part of this quest - the highland huntresses. They too spawn in Griff valley, however they are RARE. They are group yellow doubleup mobs, aggroy. You'll need at least a tank to help you with them. And then there is the respawn problem. Every lion in the valley is a potential ph for them, so to get more of them to spawn, you must kill them all and run about - trying not to aggro griffs or Amazon huntresses - to find the huntresses as they pop. This took six hours for me. Six, very frustating, hours.<br />
<br />
The result is Trade Cured Breastplate. AC 252. Agi +7 Str +2 Health +18 Power +14 vs Disease +100 vs Magic +100, attunable. Wearable at level 24.<br />
<br />
Here is what the whole set looks like on a kerra!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Added quest #3 and part of quest #4. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Added quest #4, #5, and part of #6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This quest requires 20 deadly scarabs, 10 diseased corpses, and 15 forsaken shrillers. All of these creatures are found near the entrance of the Crypt of Betrayal. <br />
The corpses do not spawn at zone anymore. <br />
Instead there are nice aggro Bloodsabers where the NPCs were, I hope that is not the final way this zone will be. Corpses are still in a bit deeper, sorry, I do not know the zone well so I cannot tell you where exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well that blows. I was able to pick up all of my mobs just by running up and down corridor between the T and the entrance. <br />
<br />
CoB is a bit small. Ok, it's very small, compared to the number of groups who want to camp it and the fact that there's a bunch of very hard very close together very aggro masses on the next stairway. There's probably a lot more zone beyond there but we died twice - two wipes- trying to go down the stairs so we gave up and just did the entrance.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear they changed it.<br />
<br />
Edited the quest description to fit this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Added quest 5 and 6 and picture of complete armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am currently lvl 18 -- can I start this quest now, or must I wait until lvl 20 to begin?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Guk Server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gotta wait till level 20. They won't give you the quest until then.<br />
<br />
I'm seeing stuff similar to this (But with Wisdom) dropping in Chests off similar level group mobs. I wonder why there's so little Wis on this stuff?<br />
<br />
Anyway, Thanks Harvyst for a GREAT write up! I printed it for refference. Got quest 1 last night.</div></div><hr />
