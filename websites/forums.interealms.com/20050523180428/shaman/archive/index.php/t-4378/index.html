<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
So I have been reading about HS and want to take a few groups of my guild up there on slow nights. I keep seeing conflicting reports about Drusella Sathir.<br />
<br />
Some say she is a Normal Spawn with PH's, others say she is 24hr, and yet others say she is 2-3day spawn.<br />
<br />
If she is a PH spawn then thats easy to confirm but if not anyone have some &quot;Real&quot; info?<br />
<br />
I also understand she has a 250hp Lifetap. Any other attacks?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just killed her two days ago for a guild monk after some quest item on her.  She was blue to me at 60 (level 55 I believe), slowed easily without using malo and I do not recall any obscene lifetaps (constantly casted, doing major damage).<br />
<br />
We did this mob with one group of 5 people (cleric, shaman, monk, druid, warrior).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure but I think she spawns every few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3 days spawn time I believe, up after patch.<br />
<br />
She is killed quite a bit, as she drops (not everytime) an item for the chardok spirit wracked cords quest and the mirror for the SK greenmist quest.<br />
<br />
The times I have done her, it is not Drusella that is hard, rather splitting her room is difficult.   Last time I did her we did not have a FD puller and the first pull we got her and like the 6, or 8 other mobs in her room.   We wiped out and came back and our ranger managed to split the room into 3 pulls.   <br />
<br />
Anyways, hardest part about her is the pull and finding her up.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 Days +/- about 5 hours. She's a wuss, the only hard part is the golems guarding her. Drop rate on the urn is ass, it's why she's dead fast after the tracking mules find her up.<br />
<br />
Rogues can check her spawn very easily, just be wary of the see invis biles. Rogues with ammo slot invis cloaks can check her without fear of death 99% of the time basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ya terrible drop rate for urn <br />
<br />
drops the dam mirrior every time <br />
<br />
im still waiting on that urn myself<br />
<br />
one group can easily own her and guards</div></div><hr />
