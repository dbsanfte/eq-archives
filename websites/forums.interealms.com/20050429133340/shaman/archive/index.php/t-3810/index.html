<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, that depends.  You up to manipulating the .xml files yourself, or do you just want to download other people's that you like?<br />
<br />
If you just want to install what others have created, I can help with how to do that:<br />
<br />
Go to your EQ folder and look in the folder called Uifiles. Inside that folder, is a folder called &quot;default.&quot; Open it. <br />
<br />
On the second column of files, there are a bunch of xml files that start with EQUI. If you look at them, you can see that each one is responsible for part of our user interface. <br />
<br />
EQUI_groupwindow - this is our group window <br />
EQUI_inventory - inventory <br />
EQUI_spellbookwndow - spellbook <br />
<br />
etc. <br />
<br />
In order to make changes, in the Uifiles folder, create a new folder (inside the Uifiles folder, not inside default) and name it whatever you like (I called mine &quot;skins&quot;). Copy everything from the default folder into it. When you are modifying your interface, you can replace each file singly, or download a complete mod that somone has created.  <br />
<br />
Here is an interesting layout from the Ranger's Glade.<br />

<br />
You can see he has a link to download something called &quot;Sean.zip&quot; Go ahead and save this file to your desktop. <br />
<br />
Look at the picture of Sean's UI, is there anything you like about it? I liked his inventory window, so I went to his folder saved to my desktop and copied EQUI_inventory. I pasted that file into my new folder (in the Uifiles folder) that I created called Skins, and it replaced the previous file. Repeat with every file of Sean's that you like. <br />
<br />
For my spellbook, I got it from this site: <br />
<br />
http://newui.technosapien.net/misc.htm <br />
<br />
(this is a great site to browse around and see what items you like). <br />
<br />
I went to &quot;Compact Spellbook&quot; and downloaded it. Once I had the item on my desktop, I opened it and did copied EQUI_spellbookwnd and pasted it into my my &quot;skins&quot; folder. <br />
<br />
Once you find all the xml files that you like, go ahead and start the game. Once you get your character loaded, type /loadskin (name of your new folder that contains your new UI folders), my command was /loadskin skins. All of the new stuff will pop in, and then you have to take a few minutes to &quot;place&quot; everything where you want it on the screen. If you also want the new UI windows on other characters, you must log them in and type /loadskin (folder name) and also position the new windows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't look at all the files, I just looked at the UI_(windowname) xml files. Based on screenshots of other people's setups,  I found an inventory, spellbook, playerwindow and buff box that I liked and copied just those file into the new folder I created in the uifiles folder in my EQ folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found an inventory, spellbook, playerwindow and buff box that I liked and copied just those file into the new folder I created in the uifiles folder in my EQ folder.<br />
No, I understand that..in fact, I'd done the same thing with Jilariz's mod.  But there're a number of features that I'd like to combine from a number of different mods.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm pretty much in the same boat. I dont know XML, but I have an XML editor so when I look at it, it might as well be russian. <br />
<br />
I took the compacted spellbook from eqinterface.com like Glori did, and I also nabbed the advanced group/target windows, old style inventory window, a spell bar without the book button, slimlined window selector, and a player window with % values added. <br />
<br />
Then I just created a new folder next to the default directory in EQ\UIFiles, copied the contents of the default into the new directory, then inserted the specific window xml files I downloaded into the new directory, and loaded it in-game with the /loadskin command. Worked like a charm, but it's not exactly how I would make it if I knew how...but it's pretty close.<br />
<br />
I may grab that buff window with the mini icons and text with color-coded background, but havent decided yet.<br />
<br />
If anybody who knows XML has some tips or hints they might share, or perhaps a site with some XML info, that'd be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hrm, question.<br />
<br />
I had basically downloaded Rombus's player window, and Geddina's Buff window.  I havent' fooled around with it much, but I did load up Rombus's player window mod.<br />
<br />
To use both, would it be possible to just unzip both files into the same directory you think?<br />
<br />
I haven't even looked inside the folders yet, i just followed the install instructions, and left it alone.  But, I'd really like to run both mods at the same time.<br />
<br />
I guess my question is, do you think it would be possible to copy the default to a new folder, renaming it.  Then, unzippng both skins into that folder and loading up that folder and running?<br />
<br />
edit - i can't spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, answered my own question by going in and tinkering with it.<br />
<br />
Ended up using the buff window from one skin, hp box from a separate window, then group and target windows from a 3rd.<br />
<br />
Still have a little tinkering around left to do, especially chat fonts.  But overall I like the way I have it now.  The boxes are taking up a good bit of room on the screen now, but it's functional.<br />

Ok, I must be dumber than I thought.  Seems everyone and their brother can just whip up new mods/skins/etc in mere minutes, meanwhile I've got 17 windows open, searching threads/websites/screenshots/etc for stuff I can use to make my own mod.  I've found bits and pieces from various mods that I like, but nothing all inclusive that strikes my fancy.  I open up some of the files of the stuff I like, and I'm looking at Chinese math....what the hell does &lt; Style_VScroll &gt; false &lt; /Style_VScroll &gt; mean, and how do you know?  Where do I find this out? <br />
<br />
The xml is all plain text and mostly obvious. Style_VScroll. Well lets break that down. Ok style is how something looks so this is probably gonna control how the window looks. <br />
<br />
V? who knows right now.<br />
<br />
Ok scroll, hmm only scroll i can think of normally on a window would be the scroll bars.<br />
<br />
Hmm that would mean V would probably be vertical.<br />
<br />
So this means that you don't show a vertical scroll bar on the window.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;CX&gt;104&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
	&lt;CY&gt;395&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Following that same pattern the first line says that the window has a title bar.<br />
<br />
The second line says that it has the X to close the window in the title bar.<br />
<br />
The rest says that it's 104 pixels wide and 395 pixels tall.<br />
<br />
In most cases it's that simple. If you can't figure out what something is, try changing it or looking for other spots it's used. There is also one document in there that kinda defines everything and tells you what attributes things have and what the defaults are.</div></div><hr />
