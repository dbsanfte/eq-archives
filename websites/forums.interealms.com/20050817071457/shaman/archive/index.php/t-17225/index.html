<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend recently returned to EQ from hiatus, we plan to spend a lot of time duoing (both 65 NToV gear and 80+aa's) and can see definate benefits from our partnership.<br />
<br />
We plan to invest some time in farming to get him an Incense Burner and myself some toy I am yet to decide on.<br />
<br />
Neither of us have really played with alts a lot, I am going to recommend we both do a /testbuff of each others classes on Test to get some familiarity and of course we are constantly offering each other info on our resepctive classes.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people here have a good amount of knowledge about Mages and more importantly Mage/Shaman partnerships, and was wondering if anyone was willing to share some experiences or point out some oppourtunities.<br />
<br />
So far we have only spent 2 nights together, both in Droga (total 3 hours) and it has quickly become apparent that we can easily hog ever named camp in the place (ever camp from Runri up on the loot table) so thats an easy one. IA is next on our list and from what I have read on here that will be a cinch too.<br />
<br />
I have multiple ranger alts built purely for situational tracking so spotting named eg Lodizal, Umbral mobs and I am thinking Cobalt Scar are on the agenda also.<br />
<br />
Care to share your experiences and / or opinions of this partnership?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno what you're seeking as infos but I'm dual boxing a mage 65 with decent gear but nothing great and a shaman 65 with decent gear but again nothing great.<br />
<br />
Mage has 95 AA's<br />
Shaman has 135-6 AA's<br />
<br />
<br />
This duo can kill mobs hitting for 500-600,slowable.Not easy,will need alot of work for the shaman to keep his mana up and the pets alive.<br />
<br />
I can hunt in CT,killing about 10-12 mobs before respawn,w/o stressing too much.If two people play,could be a bit more.<br />
<br />
Duo'ed in IA for a while,nothing there is a problem,died once cuz I used canni V and got jumped by High Priest,rest of the time it's very easy really.<br />
<br />
Duo'ed for most of my shard's camping,except ssra,deep,akheva.Again was very easy,only problem I got was a runner meeting a CH'er in FG.<br />
<br />
As long a mob is slowable,there is alot of things you can do with this duo.Mage pet tanks,mage nuke,shm slow/heal and doggy to add some dmg.This isn't a science really.A mob hitting for 200-300 is no match,getting tougher at 400+,but still very doable till the 500+ where problems can start if you don't play safe.Only time this duo is limited is when you have alot of adds,but that's true for most duo.No snare can be a problem,but I try to finish mobs with a big nuke to avoid problems.<br />
<br />
Toughest mob I've duo'ed is prolly Dlammaz Stormslayer(kael),500ish hitter,rampages and enrages.He has a ton and more HPs,long fight.Buffs wore out during fight so it added to the difficulty.Getting him solo is the tricky part,gotta love coth-pulls.<br />
<br />
Dual boxing a shaman isn't the most efficient thing,two players can be much more efficient,especially for canni.Shm canni+pet canni isn't something I've tried,maybe with some macros but I don't duo all the time and it's mostly to do quests or farm for cash.But this duo is very good,two good players can do alot of things.<br />
<br />
Very decent duo IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The most fun I ever had in the game was duo'ing with a mage partner.<br />
Every morning we'd meet up and camp for various items to sell.<br />
<br />
I remember being quite envious of his pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pocket pet 2 is really a must have for this kind of thing.  The mage will want (or already has) this for pet canni anyway.  What's really truly handy is for the mage to use his nice fixed-duration invis to romp down to the camp, pop his (already buffed and equipped) pet for protection, then CotH you (and your pet, who would normally die when you were summoned, but he's safe in your pocket) down.<br />
<br />
When pulling a new area (like when we were first flagged for PoS - when it needed a flag, sigh) you'll be exploring and pulling while the mage chain-casts CoH and interrupts before it goes off, so that hopefully, when you hit your &quot;OMG AAAAAAGH!&quot; panic key, the spell is almost done casting...<br />
<br />
This duo is the most fearsome thing I've ever encountered while pairing up with people in EQ.  The mage spends 95% of his playtime at 90m or higher.  Then suddenly, you're crapping your knickers because you ended up with 2 or 3 times as many mobs as you're used to.  Before you know it, the mage has fried them to cinders, and his goliath of a pet has kept taunt very nicely.<br />
<br />
A big thing to remember that the mage probably won't confess -- mages have exactly two methods of defense: pet and gate.  Your eye must be firmly fixed on the mage at all times (especially when he's not using earth pet) because he can't root, snare, or do anything else by way of escaping aggro.  Very handy to have a high-aggro, low-mana spell up to peel mobs off the mage when necessary, in some situations (especially when his pet is nuking and proc'ing your well-meaning roots off instantly).<br />
<br />
I ended up pulling with malo (or sinia) just about every time with the mage, since every resist is a tragedy to them *grin* and things just went a lot smoother when I sacrificed the mana rather than him.<br />
<br />
Lodi and UP critters should be cake for you two.  The regen ring (luggald flesh) quest was a good bit of fun (and a bit of a challenge on the last critter) as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I 2box a Mage-shaman duo. You can take on anything you might consider doing with an AA-less warrior, a 60 wizard without evac, and the shaman. The 65 Mage pet has 5k HP unbuffed to give you some idea.<br />
<br />
Fully buff the pets (minus STA - it doesn't effect pets). Especially DEX since it helps their weapons proc. And make sure the mage gives both pets weapons, a haste mask, and a belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Izarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My main is a magician and I have a shaman bot.  Its a fairly popular duo amoung mages.  I typically have both pets loaded with mage goodies, both pets buffed with max str and max dex (for weapon procs), DS on mage pet.  Tends to work pretty well, although I haven't moved to Tier 2 mobs duoing, I tend to look for groups.<br />
<br />
Mage is 65/70 w/FT15 and a several pieces of elemental gear<br />
Shaman is 59/0 w/FT3 and all droppabe gear, nothing great.<br />
<br />
With mage's malosinia my shaman lands slow pretty easily, even in places like PoV and Tactics.<br />
<br />
I duo PoN mobs pretty easily.  Although for better exp duoing I plan to move to PoS and use CoH pulling to try and single tougher mobs.  I like the duo because slow/buff/heal/dot/canni works really well with nuke/DS/proccing pet weapons/focus items/pet heals/pet canni.  The only problem I have with a 2 boxing duo is managing both chars when things get tough is difficult.  But playing with a friend should make this a good duo.<br />
<br />
Mage pets certainly make good tanks.  And with the 61 Air pet's stun, it holds agro really well, while healing generates practically no agro.  And a mage's nukes can help burn down a mob when it heals itself or runs.<br />
