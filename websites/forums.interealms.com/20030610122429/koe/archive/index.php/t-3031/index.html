<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is an email I recieved today from my brother-in-law that is stationed on board the USS John F Kennedy.  The reason I am posting this is they just moved from Maine to Seattle, WA this last month and have barely been able to get settled.  I post this because everyone should know that thousands of brave men and women are at this moment, going to fight for what we as Americans hold dear.  This is very personal to me.  My sister and her kids are out of place in their new home (Seattle is quite a change from Maine).  I post this to ask for your prayers that Jim makes it home to his family who loves him dearly.  I post this also to pray for everyone who is going to strike down terrorism for ALL of our freedoms.  Thank you for reading :)<br />

PS:  Jim is a Navigational Engineer with the US Navy...a great guy and can drink me under the table.<br />

<br />
I still haven't had any contact with Keran and the Kids since going to sea.<br />
I miss them very much. If you hear from them, tell Keran to have Tiffany<br />
check her &quot;Go Mail&quot; account. I have been leaving emails nightly on her<br />
account. I hope you are well. I am glad to see on the news that the USA<br />
seems to be uniting in a positive way. I just hope that they do not try to<br />
use this as an excuse to limit our personal freedoms. If that happens then<br />
the terrorists have really won. There are normally phones for use on the<br />
ship, but it costs about $1.00 a minute (I can live with that). However the<br />
phones are either down or secured to limit the possibility of unauthorized<br />
disclosure of our position, understandable but really bad for Me giving the<br />
circumstances. I am supposed to be going to NAMTRA for initial training in<br />
Prowlers sometime around the first of October. I'll be sent off the ship to<br />
a base or airfield to go back to NAS Whidbey Island. I can't wait to get<br />
back! So how's your work going? I wish you well.<br />

my husband spent many years in the navy.. i know how bad the communications are when they are at sea.. one thing i do remember is.. dont sent telegrams.. the captain reads them to the seaman.. the one i sent was like this<br />
<br />
hiya hon.. just a note to say hi and let you know that things are ok here.. havent heard from you in like 3 months and am just a bit concerned.. oh by the way.. the washer is broke.. the brakes on the car is out.. but thats ok as it wont start anyhow.. and that cat we had spayed.. it had kittens.. <br />
<br />
we are holding up ok and miss ya.. love ya.. me<br />
<br />
well.. the captain handed him the phone.. i got to hear from him.. and mail started coming regularly.. seemed the captain wasnt aware that &quot;all&quot; the mail was not getting off the ship.. just whatever would fit in the chopper.. <br />
<br />

<br />
God Bless Them All<br />

What a wonderful country you live in. The tremendous spirit of Freedom cannot and will not be squelched by a madman and his suicidal followers. I believe in the Declaration of Independence, one of the most powerful documents every written. This is not a war to defend America, this is a war to defend an ideal, a concept that goes to the very core of every man, woman and child born into a free society. Godspeed to all the brave men and women who go forth to bear the standard of freedom for the world to see. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family my friend, and all of America and her allies as they begin INFINATE JUSTICE.<br />
<br />
Sincerely Jeff.<br />
<br />
PS. There is a song by Charlie Daniels that I have been listening to lately<br />
I believe it is called God Bless America Again.<br />
<br />
If you have the chance give it a listen, If I had the ability to send it in Arabic to Osama bin Done like Dinner, I would and he may realize in a small way what America is all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Halvard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I send my prayers out to all the families that were effected by the terrorist attack and to all the families that have loved ones that are in our armed forces. I have sevearal friends that I grew up with and went to school with that are in the service and I worry about them every day they are there. I have friends that went to desert storm and now we are back in the thick of it again because some crazy terrorist with a death wish thinks that we are the devil. <br />
<br />
<br />
Freedom is a powerful thing and we have to protect it at all cost. I am afraid for my friends and all of the people that will be put in harms way. I just hope that we do this war on terrorism properly and not go in with good intent and not finish the job. <br />
<br />
<br />
You all be safe,<br />
