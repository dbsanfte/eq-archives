<br />
I've been experiancing some OE errors on my system.  Looking around from my work computer and found that alot of people with my same processer an AMD K-62 (500) say that changing the voltage is a solution that works for them.  However, I do not know how to do this and was just wondering if it is a hard process, or something that someone with enough knowledge to be dangerous can do.  The type of error I am receiving is <br />
OE 0028:C005257 VXD VMM (01) + 004257.<br />
<br />
Computer specs are<br />
AMD K62 (500)<br />
PA 2013 MB<br />
386 MB RAM<br />
SB 128 Sound card<br />
ATI Radeon 7000 32 MB<br />
Win 98 SE <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any help that might be offered.<br />

<br />
This is a really good way to cook your cpu if you have inadequate cooling, though it may also help.  Have you checked your RAM for errors?  Mushkin has a good program for that here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You may want to upgrade to Windows XP... it almost entirely does away with those damned blue screens.<br />
<br />
By far the most stable consumer OS yet. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it almost entirely does away with those damned blue screens <br />
<br />
Chuckle, actually they are turned off by default.  When XP SHOULD bluescreen it reboots instead (note that you can disable this &quot;feature&quot;).  <br />
<br />
Hmm, what revision is your board?  According to the web site the top end cpu's for this board (500 and 550) are only reliable with the final 2 boards.  <br />
--------<br />
K6-2 500MHz 100x5.0 2.0 with &quot;EO036&quot; sticker, 2.1 <br />
VR: 3-4 <br />
CLK: CLK1=1-2 CLK2=1-2 CLK3=2-3 CLK4=1-2 <br />
SDRAM:  SDRAM=2-3 NBCLK1=2-3 NBCLK2=1-2 <br />
FREQ:  FREQ1=1-2 FREQ2=2-3 FREQ3=2-3 <br />
--------<br />
<br />
Also, make sure you system is properly cooled (these things get hot), and get the latest bios revision ( http://www.fic.com.tw/techsupport/drivers/searchbios2.asp?selectedmodelname=PA-2013 ).  If you are uncertain about flashing the bios BE CAREFUL, don't hose your motherboard, take it slow and read up on how to do it correctly.  Are you running McAfee, by any chance?  For a while there one of the virus updates was causing blue screens.  Couple other things to try after you check ram and cooling:  Update all drivers (including getting newer VIA busmastering drivers), kill everything running in the taskbar, turn off power management in the BIOS.  Something else I came across while looking around:<br />
------<br />
If you are running with an AMD chip, you should also note that there have been quite a number of reports of a faulty L1 cache (the cache on the chip). Go into your computer's BIOS (see your handbook for instructions), and disable the Level 1 cache. If this resolves your problems, consider buying a new CPU. <br />
AMD &amp; Temperature <br />
We've received information that running the (older) AMD K6-2 chips over 60ºC (140ºF) will produce a FATAL EXCEPTION OE ...0028:C0005338 IN VXD VMM(01)+00004338 (or similar) errors. So if you are running a K6-2 chip, it's another area to check!<br />
----------<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
I have the same probleme. Have you found a solution to resolve it ?<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do not know if your problem will be fixed or not by setting the voltage for the CPU. But I can tell you that you do this by changing jumper settings on the motherboard.<br />
<br />
You can download the manual for your motherboard here: http://www.fic.com.tw/support/download.aspx?dl=motherboard%2fmanual%2fsocket7%2fpa-2013%2fPA-2013B1Sh.zip&amp;title=PA-2013B1Sh.zip&amp;info=manual<br />
<br />
The file you download is a zip file with 6 pdf files inside it. The page you're looking for is page 18 in the file 2013b1_2.pdf.</div></div><hr />
