<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Search is your friend, sir.<br />
<br />
This is asked several times a week. You're new, so we'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Don't mind the grumps who will post just to hear themselves whine. Play whatever you want. You can do the epic with any class and not worry about faction too much. Faciton is a part of th egame, anyway.<br />
<br />
Plsy whatever class you like best, looks the coolect, gets your rocks off, whatever...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sometimes I get the feeling that it's the same person is making new user names just to post this question on a weekly basis to annoy us  :D   Anyways, if you run a search on it you will find a lot of topics on it which would probably have just about every answer to the aspects of the different race choices you could choose from.  Good luck on your new Shaman  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone once mentioned it was the Druids.<br />
<br />
I'm starting tobelieve them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm where's the daily: 'hi I two box, what's the best duo' question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The best race for questing the epic easy and safe is......<br />
<br />
Troliksarbarbogrecatloks!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your jedi mind tricks won't work here Druid.  Us shaman are wise in the ways of the darkside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bogmush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm where's the daily: 'hi I two box, what's the best duo' question?<br />
<br />
HI!  I two box.  What's the best duo??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mmmmm pie.  I like pie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Um, gnomes.  Gnomes make the best shaman.<br />
<br />
So what if they can't lift their epic?    :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey there, im a new shaman to the game and i was wonderign what is the best race, i really dont want to be kos, becuase i wanna be able to epic quest easy and safe? any ideas?<br />
<br />
The &quot;best&quot; race is Iksar, but since you had to ask you are not worthy of being part of the empire. JK<br />
<br />
Seriously, there is no &quot;best&quot; race, since you don't want to be KOS, then Vah Shir, Froggie, and Barbarian are your choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think the 3rd in Belmond</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We are not Enchanters. Being good or evil does not matter for the Shaman epic. There is only one brief step of that quest that involves visiting a good city, and that is very easily dealt with using invisibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zrakkonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the best race to be would be a Jack Russell Tarrier.  Only so you could hump your pet's leg for a change of pace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thought that was why SoE gave us shrink and grow?!?!?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nobody said orc shaman and I think that stinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That about sums it up, nothing matters in the end, only enjoyment of the class you play.<br />
<br />
close your eyes and think about what you wanna be... got it ?  good, go make it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Your all wrong, Iksar is the best.<br />
<br />
Well I guess troll is good also.<br />
<br />
Barbs are fun.<br />
<br />
Frogs or Cats is fun for a change.<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
I guess what we really learned here is Ogres suck.</div></div><hr />
