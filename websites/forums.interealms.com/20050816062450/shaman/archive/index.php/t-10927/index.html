<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious whether anyone has experience using Blinding Luminence <br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=134&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
for agro control in a single pull exp group situation?<br />
<br />
Once the mob is in camp and slowed and surrounded by melee, would using this allow you to dot up or cripple without getting agro?  My understanding is that the blind mob, like the rooted mob, stays agro on the nearest player, which is hopefully the MT.  Would this be superior to using root because it would last the full 24 secs of the spell and not be broken by all the melee hits like root?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who has the extra spell slot for this?  I have a rot up or the root on Scaled Avatar legs, but no room for this spell in our measley 8 slots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, I wouldn't put a slot on it..<br />
...but, its right click on bio orb if you have access to it.<br />
<br />
if your in a situation where there are assisting mobs - dont use it. Blind acts as ghetto fear if you are not in melee range.<br />
it's nice if your partnering with a rogue, or something though..it is actually very nice taunt and you can hold aggro well. Just remember to stay in melee range or they will run off.<br />
<br />
good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">UMMM... I sit down, mem bane, ebolt and blind when I'm bored and want to spice up the xp grind.. the tank loves it when you do that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm pretty sure that root doesn't break from pure melee attacks.  Just it's normal chance to break every tick, and from any direct damage spells, this includes some procs though, which might be what you're referring to.<br />
<br />
I prefer good ol' Root for accomplishing what you're after.  Also, from my experience with our earlier blind spells, those have a random duration as well, even more so than root imo.<br />
<br />
I've never thought to test if summoning mobs might not summon you while blind.  I'm guessing they do.<br />
<br />
Someone smack me hard if I'm wrong about the root thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Talking about the scaled avatar legs does anyone actually use the root effect on them?<br />
I find it casts way too slow and petrifying earth is so much more superiour in sticking ability. (resist adjustment) So I end up just keeping root memmed anyway, feel like I'm wasting a slot but feel safer at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dropped root when I got my ornate legs.  It's a little longer cast, but for extra spell gem, well worth it IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's a story about blind.<br />
<br />
During Velius, my guild was killing Vindi for maybe the 4th time. Monks pull, kill guards, and finally got to Vindi. Ch cycle start, MT gets agro, and all's going well.<br />
<br />
Then Vindi decided to take a walk.<br />
<br />
Not just any walk, he decided to run across the entire arena to the see invis line with our entire raid chasing him. Why you ask? A warrior procced blind on him.<br />
<br />
The moral of the story? Make sure you use it on mobs who's melee range is small, or if the mob has a melee right under it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't do it... from my experience (using flash of light) what it does is if the mob is within melee range of person with the most agro, it will attack him. On the other hand, if you happen to be outside of melee range of its most hated player, it runs away and you now have a full size train. (poor man's fear)<br />
<br />
   I used this technique to pet kite mobs so that my poor puppy didn't get eaten... Of course you need to dot maintain your agro but its funny to see a mob go away and towards ya while a puppy nips  his heel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This spell is very powerful if used with caution....<br />
In outdoor zones especially it is nice to keep mobs occupied.  For example if you get two in camp you can keep one mob blinded.  If you use a barrier near by you can keep em walled.  I had success with this spell and duoing or in a trio with spell casters or rangers.  It uses practically no mana to cast it and you can yo yo a mob all day. If the mob gets in melee range just back up and it will start to run away.  With a ranger or caster dropping nukes or arrows on the mobs it is very easy xp.  The only time it is a problem is with summoning mobs.  It takes some practice, but you can even solo with this when you have dog dog out.  Just make sure taunt is off and he will run behind the mob.  Keep cripple up to cause aggro on you and keep blinding.  Works well if you get the hang of it. You just have to be creative with this spell.  I have often used it for pulls on mobs also.  If you blind a mob in a dungeon it starts to gather all its friends after it paths back to you.   If no one is around and you need to clear a path lets say to a particular camp.  Use blind have the mob retreat into the dungeon and than zone out.  Zone in fast with invis and as they path back run past em to camp. :) Just ideas on how to use the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/e smacks Borgax<br />
Yeah melee, nukes and dots that land with damage all give an extra chance to break root. Druid/ranger and some necro/SK dots dont land with any initial damage and thus dont give the extra chance to break rootage; add that to the fact that druid/ranger roots simply hold better (usually lasting their entire duration) and you can see why duids root/rot better than we do.<br />
Also, back in my young shammie days, I used FOL and Blinding Luminesence as ghetto fear for adds and OMG stuff, its faster casting than root, and if your just running, the FOL is a viable option to rooting the mob, at least in outdoor zones.<br />
Would I give up a spell gem for it? no. Would I use it for fun or in certain instances? yes...its the perfect aggro snatcher if your in melee proximity, that and the cripple line after a slow and the mob is all over you.<br />
funny FOL story sideline...me a paladin, a cleric and a druid were in the bottom of kaesora working on HS keys a few weeks ago and the paladin and the cleric were goofing off during spawns seeing who could start the biggest trains with panic the dead......i FOL one mob at the top of the stairs ran back down and took a seat....the druid had to evac us :D it can be loads of fun or cause a hellacious train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Using blind is suicidal unless you specifically want to use it as an alternative means of fearing a mob.  Want agro?  Use Disempower instead, debatably the biggest taunt in the game, no recast time, costs virtually no mana to cast, and casts pretty quick too.  Its not quite as good as Insidious decay was pre disease counter tuning, but its damned close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Blind does not work like root. Root makes a mob attack the nearest player. Blind doesn't. <br />
<br />
Blind makes a monster run away, unless the person who is at the top of the aggro list is in melee range. Then it attacks that person. If the person at the top of the list isn't in melee range, the mob runs away. <br />
<br />
You can (rarely) see this with a paladin who's using flash of light to hold aggro. Usually they'll hold aggro, and the mob will stick to them. But if a caster in the group manages to gain aggro (by overnuking/dot'ing and then sitting down), the mob will run off and do its very best to find a big train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Never blind a MoB in the Arena.  It's a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The responses above explain why this doesnt work the way I thought it did.  <br />
<br />
I tried it last night on a vexed banshee pull in PoN;  laid on blind after malo and slow while mob was surrounded by three melee and my pooch.  Banshee ran off immediately, either because I had moved to the top of the hate list and was not in melee range, or because the melee who was tops was standing back too far.  I didnt try it a second time, hehe.  Seems too unreliable unless you are duoing with a rogue or something where very careful positioning would be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
It is interesting though to hear about folks using it for ghetto fear kiting with the pooch;  have to try that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">IIRC, blind has decent hate built into it, as well.  Know some pallys who use it with their stuns to keep agro.  Thankfully, a decent paladin is harder to pull agro from than we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">using blind in a group is generally a good way to make your group get really mad at you!  Using it in a raid can get you on guilds' **** lists really fast.  <br />
<br />
Using it solo . . . can really rock under the right circumstances.   And generally if you mess it up, you only hurt yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What are you guys talking about? AE blind is the best! Was drinking and playing a pal's warrior and made up a little game called Rygorr Bowling. What ya do is run to ew, find an orc camp. Whip our yout blazing bp of orange death, and target a clump of rygorr. Ideally all will scatter, but occasionally you'll get a 7-10 split o resisters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rofl thats brilliant, one of our wizzies has the Vadyn robe with a right click pbaoe blind on it that seems to be a lure or just exceptionally hard to resist (It lands on me pretty much everytime with 200+ mr), yeah I think you can imagine some of the fun he has had with it =)</div></div><hr />
