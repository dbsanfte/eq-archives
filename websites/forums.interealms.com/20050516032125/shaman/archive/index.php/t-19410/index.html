<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>venomator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are now 9 elemental raid capable guilds on my server and the competition is getting fierce. The lag from multiple guilds raiding in the same plane is utterly ridiculous. 130+ people in these zones makes /assist and spell casting lag unbearable.<br />
<br />
The lack of adequate raid content is so bad a few of my friends are considering moving to a different server or even retiring if GoD turns out to be LDoN 2.<br />
<br />
Are the EPs overrun on other servers? And what happens when there are multiple guilds raiding PoTime, I've heard the instancing wont work for more than 3 guilds, is there any truth to that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been everquest free for a week now for this exact reason. Its worth quitting over because it will just happen again again and again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently 7 (I'm pretty sure) guilds with EP access.  2 of them have been clearing time for months and don't go to EP, 2 of them are in the process of killing rathe/coir again to finish their flagging for time, and we're just coirnav short of time ourselves.  <br />
<br />
It really hasn't been too bad on terris, time however, is going to suck really really bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess this is where a pvp server is kind of nice. The only time there is more than 1 guild in an EP zone is when we are fighting for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there are currently 2 Time enabled Guilds and 4 EP flagged guilds and one Humongous Zerg guild trying their best to get in here. unlike the Blues when someone wants a zone.. well...if yer a shaman you get to Assist and Malos someone.  then you die :) an hope enough of your side Kills enough of their side.  then you run to teh Tables and KITE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Total of I believe 9 EP flagged guilds on Ant Bayle and 3 of those are in Time. Time is not an issue due to it being instanced, ie if one guild is in Time B then another can't get into the same instance barring a bug. Instance reset time is 5 days more or less and so is the repop time, so the 3 guilds go every 6 days to be safe. 2 Time guilds clear in 5-6 hours each, the other hasn't killed Quarm yet so stays for 2-3 days.<br />
<br />
As to lag the ele planes simply cannot cope with more than 1 serious raid at a time in any one zone, so to preserve everyones sanity most EP guilds will simply go for a different target in a different EP zone if another guild is there. There is no formal agreement for this, but noone can play with 130+ in the zones so people naturally leave.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later. SOE may hurt themselves with three mid-level expansions in a row. Every expansion up to LoY build upon the &quot;old&quot; end-game. Now they are flooding the game with &quot;casual&quot; player content instead of catering to their high end players. <br />
I'll grant that LoY isn't aimed at the L65 crowd, casual or otherwise, but doesn't LDoN offer something regardless of level?  Aren't all those raids in LDoN aimed squarely at the raid crowd?  And yes, the 36 person limit is lame.<br />
<br />
And what content am I being flooded with as a casual, L65 player?  This is what my friends and I have to look forward to: endless hours spent in LDoN, BoT, PoV, HoH and just this week, Tactics.  How many of you raiders would keep playing if that were the only places you could go on a limited play schedule to actually see your exp move and have a shot at some loot you'd actually wear?  If you think the EP's are crowded, try PoV or BoT on a weekend- no wonder you hate those places so much.  Sadly, there's nowhere else for a casual L65 to go where the risk/reward is as good.<br />
<br />
SOE brought this on themselves by creating such a huge, artificial gap in player power between those who raid and those who don't.  They now find themselves in the uncomfortable position of no longer being able to create &quot;one size fits all&quot; expansions post Luclin.  Create zones where casuals will have a good time and raiders will hate it.  Create another PoP type expansion and casuals won't buy it.  So what do you get instead?  Something in the middle that will wind up pleasing neither.<br />
<br />
C'est la vie, SOE made this bed, they'll have to sleep in it.  And no, neither myself nor the friends I play with are buying GoD, so hopefully it has worthwhile raid content as it certainly has nothing so far for us.<br />

Maybe to open up some of the game you should quit your guild. Leave all of your friends and start Over. Then you can make all new friends and have a wealth of zones to explore. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My guild just killed RZ the other day and became Elemental on Prexus.  Currently there are 3 guilds in Time, one of them just got there so probably will spend more time in elementals.  Including us, there are 5-6 guilds spending time in Elementals that arent Time capable.  We havent raided them yet, but I imagine the competition is fierce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Every expansion could have plenty of content.  They just screw it up.<br />
<br />
Consider PoP.  If Halls of Honor, Plane of Torment, and Plane of Storms were better itemized, more people would hunt there.  If either of those 3 zones had BoT Tower style raid content, casuals would pickup raid there.  The problem has never really been lack of zones, but rather an imbalance between existing ones.  One designer does an amazing job with a zone like BoT, and another just makes a totally worthless zone in Plane of Torment.<br />
<br />
LDoN is the same way for raiders.  The risk versus reward is so bad that many servers don't even bother doing them.  Yes, we could throw ourselves endlessly against this useless content, but why?  It *could* have been a solution, but instead it fell on its face.<br />
<br />
SoE needs to learn that itemization drives EVERYTHING in this game.  They leave it as the last step to be completed, but it is really one of the most important aspect of a new expansion.... People won't hunt in poorly itemized content.<br />
<br />
I 100% agree with the gap between casual and uber players becoming a huge problem.  Ornate is selling for ridiculous prices, and the casual player considers ornate to be &quot;good&quot; gear.  Yet it is still 50hp/mana behind Luclin gear, 75 hp/mana behind elemental, and 100-150hp/mana behind Time... and that's per piece!  <br />
<br />
The net effect is that Time gear and high aa have pretty much obliterated class distinctions in that even the lowest dps high-aa class with Time gear (or elemental, really) is higher dps than any pickup low-aa class.  It is kind of funny that people at the pickup level still go by class when grabbing people for groups... my criterion is just look for the uberguild player... since the gear/aa is likely to make them the win.<br />
<br />
GoD really needs 100hp/mana items for the &quot;casual&quot; player base.  Although if 300hp/mana items come in for the ubers, then not even that would help.<br />

It would take more than better drops to get me to willingly spend any time in PoTorment(AKA PoSuck).  I do agree tho that with just a few small changes, things would be much better pre elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">On Bertox there are between 6 to 9 guilds elemental plane tagged.  I kinda forget if anymore came in after the 6th, but if I remember right two smaller guilds teamed up and beat RZ.  Most likely 7 EP flagged.<br />
<br />
However of all those 4 are Time flagged.  The first Time flagged clears in 1 night.  The 2nd (us) and 3rd are working in phase 5 (Inny, CZ, Bert, RZ) right now.  The 4th just got keyed and just started.<br />
<br />
Guild 1 gets time 1 night every time there instance is ready.  The rest each get it for 3 nights.  Sometimes in the middle of the 3 nights the first guild gets to do thier turn, then the 3 night guild gets to continue till 3 full nights done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Someone tell Gurck this cause he was arguing last night that only 2% of the player base is in the elementals.<br />
<br />
Seriously, there is a natural progression of things.  People that used to take out Ssra went to VT, then to PoP and then elementals and the Time.  People now in time will then go to the higher end GoD content.  It's how the system goes.  Loot naturally gets better just the same way.<br />
<br />
There is prob 8 total guilds that have made it to the elementals on my server.  Two of those guilds made it to the elementals but broke up shortly after, and you can see remnents of their guilds scattered throughout the other guilds on the server (hell, i'm one of them).  3 guilds are in time, and until last week, my guild hadn't killed an elemental mob in months.  1 is sitting a coirnav kill away from time.  2 just got to the elementals (one of them made it to the elementals before disbanding most of their guild and reforming).  Once GoD comes out, at least my guild will stop farming time, and another time one will prob in a month or so.  That leaves 2 in time at that time, 2 in god, and 2 in the elementals.  That's plenty of mobs for everyone.  Remember high end Luclin gave you Ssra and then VT.  VT was a 7 day spawn and it wasn't instanced.  So, if one guild got it one week, no one got a shot till the following week.  This is the main reason I think you think there is a big difference in gear now, cause with Instancing, it gave the chance for more than one guild to build themselves up in time at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There are 6 or 7 full elemental guilds on my server as well as a loose assortment of people that are working on access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">They should do what they should have done in the first place, but with a twist.<br />
<br />
Instance the Elemental planes.<br />
<br />
BUT.<br />
<br />
Do NOT instance the loot tables.<br />
<br />
What do I mean?<br />
<br />
First off, the planes become instanced.  That means they become split between &quot;yard trash&quot; zones which are more like grouping-miniboss areas and &quot;raid&quot; zones.  This might take a little rearranging, but you have to work to fix things.<br />
<br />
Ok, the spawn timer remains the same, being whatever it is for that mob.  Whoever comes along and kills the mob when it's &quot;up&quot; will receive loot from the corpse when it's dead.<br />
<br />
However, these zones will be instanced, so the next raid to zone into the &quot;raid&quot; part of the zone receives a fresh instance.  But, if the mob's not &quot;spawned,&quot; i.e., the spawn timer has not reset, the mob drops no loot.  You get the flag for killing it, but you get no loot for your effort.<br />
<br />
No raid that instances a zone receives a loot-bearing mob until the respawn timer counts down and enables the loot table.<br />
<br />
There, now everyone can have their own uncluttered shot at the Elementals, yet not have the game become flooded with overpowered gear.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the new &quot;XP&quot; areas of the zones (elemental &quot;A&quot;) would be opened to non-raiders who complete a very long, very difficult quest, THAT THEY COULD NOT COMPLETE IF THEY DID NOT HAVE THE GEAR OR SKILLS TO SURVIVE IN THE ELEMENTAL PLANES IN THE FIRST PLACE.  This allows the casuals who have evolved past BoT, Tactics, and LDoN to get access to greater challenges, yet removes the uberplayer's rants and whines about why they should not be there.<br />
<br />
They cannot get uber loot aside from what might drop off named mobs out in the XP zone.<br />
<br />
They cannot mess up raid triggers.<br />
<br />
They cannot raid (they lack the &quot;raid&quot; flag).<br />
<br />
And the quest they performed for access was just as long and difficult as getting the elemental flag the normal way.<br />
<br />
There, everyone wins.<br />
<br />
The massive gear imbalance between ubers and normal people is getting out of control, and must be addressed.  This will help address it.  It also solves a problem of overcrowding in non-uber areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is now elemental, but I 100% agree with this post.  This is a huge drag on the quality of the game in my opinion, and it even adversely effects the big time raiders.  I think back to old Fear/Hate raids, and at that time big raiders and casual folks would often in a plane raid together.  Even casual folks could play hooky one night once in a while for a big planes clearing.  <br />
<br />
That's all changed now.  <br />
<br />
Itemization is an enormous issue - and farming 10 mobs in BoT and PoT is simply not an acceptable solution for such a wide range of people.  <br />
<br />
Good post.  <br />
<br />
I think the estimate that about 2% of the server population is elemental+ access is probably right.  Outside the very narrow world view that you can fall into in a raiding guild, there a ton of folks around who do not have and will never have EP access.  2% sounds right to me right now.  <br />
<br />
Some differentiation is fine, too much is not fine.  <br />
<br />
I don't think LDoN is a very good solution.  They need to do better with droppable, one group gear.</div></div><hr />

1%? are you daft? Assuming your server has 6 EP/Time guilds, and assuming a meagar guild population of 100 people, that's 600 people on your server who are elemental. Are you going to tell me 60,000 people play on your server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Innoruuk is very crowded at the moment.<br />
<br />
I think there are 10 or so EP guilds and the competition is fierce for spawns.  Three guilds  are in Time, but they are on a weekly rotation.  So, when they are not in time, they are competing for spawns as well (as they should be).<br />
<br />
So what ends up happening, is EP flagged guilds start going backwards and killing lower level bosses just to keep raiding and their members happy.  Loot rots, and lower level guilds have nothing to kill as well.<br />
<br />

<br />
To my knowledge, we have 3 Time guilds, 2 guilds that are only 1 or 2 elemental gods from being in Time, and then 3 guilds that are in EP but have not taken down FR, Xegony yet.  <br />
<br />
Amazingly enough, since my guild became elemental about 2 months ago, we have had very little frustration in finding EP targets - in fact on most nights there's more targets than we have time to raid.  Plus, the guilds that are EP now are all on very good terms and respectful of each other's boundaries.<br />
<br />
This may change soon as some of the later, more &quot;zerg-type&quot; guilds gain EP access over the next couple of months.  I'm sure some would already be there if RZ didn't have the &quot;one raid&quot; limit!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I am on Druzzil Ro, which used to be a pretty quiet server. Our breakdown is:<br />
<br />
1 Time guild (pretty much exclusively raids Time/LDoN)<br />
1 &quot;new&quot; Time guild (mass transfer from Legends, still raids a decent amount of elemental content)<br />
7 EP guilds (only one is close to moving into Time)<br />
<br />
It's getting to be a bit crowded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">LDoN gear blows.  Even if you spend incredible time tricking it out you'll still lack the saves and effects of ornate - and a lot of ornate gear really isn't that impressive.  <br />
<br />
Obviously it's nice to be able to slap a 40hp augment on something, but on the whole I think ldon is fairly weak.  <br />
<br />
ldon is also boring as hell.  That's what happens when code-monkeys and beancounters step into game design.  Creativity is gone and you get stifling little incremental adjustments.  <br />
<br />
I borderline hate LDoN.  <br />
<br />
Some people who play EQ play so much their time has no real value - that is, you can't really design a reward system strictly around them.  Sucks for them maybe, but it's better for the game and presumably they are having fun.  <br />
<br />
And these whines &quot;but I work so hard...&quot; are simply pitiful.  <br />
<br />
First off, you don't work hard - presumably you enjoy it and have fun with your guild. I do, that's why I raid, because I like it.  It's the only reason I log in.  A multitude of game adjustments have made experience hunting so unbelievably boring (I blame aggro lock and pacify/lull primarily, but not totally).  <br />
<br />
Secondly, lots of people who don't raid play a lot - the problem primarily is that they may not be able to play CONSISTENTLY.  So, let's not pretend that it's time/effort which gets rewarded, but rather the ability to play consistent blocks of time of 4 hours or so at a time convenient for 50 other people.  That's where the rubber hits the road for raiding guilds.  Not raiding is valid way to play, and while they shouldn't get top end raid gear, the gap needs to be addressed.   <br />
<br />
Thirdly, we're talking degrees, not differences.  Folks who play/raid more should get/have more.  I totally agree with this concept of reward.  <br />
<br />
But it can go too far, and I think EQ does now.  How that is to be adjusted is a difficult design balancing act, but that's why they get the big bucks.  <br />
<br />
I agree with Sciek, content is getting strangled on the upper end, and it's a good thing an expansion is coming out.  Hopefully it will address that without some retarded design ideas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If you aren't raiding you don't need saves as much anyways (save for PVP servers).  A few wiz mobs hitting you for 1200 or whatever doesn't hold a candle to mobs that hit everyone you're raiding with for 1k+ every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that a casual player should have the same DPS as a time geared player, the answer is no.<br />
<br />
LDON gear is simply amazing if you augment it properly.  I don't know why everyone insists you have to be uber uber uber uber to be elemental.  There are quite a few &quot;family style&quot; guilds that have reached that point. <br />
<br />
As for someone saying that time doesn't matter because it's instanced, when there are 4+ guilds on your timezone in time, and only one guild can be in there at a time, you get 1-2 nights a week in time, assuming the other guilds are reasonable and agree to rotate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The casuals got LDON and don't like it, the raiders have POP, and it's not much better.  To those of you that are bored with LDON, take a poll of how many people in raiding guilds enjoy farming the same 4 zones for month after month to advance to time.  It was a lot of fun at first (see LDON at launch), but it has become a tedious and boring necessity to gear up(see LDON now).</div></div><hr />

Bull.   Total and utter bull.<br />
<br />
The problem with this game, isnt what a person can accomplish without a guild.  It's the DIFFICULTY of accomplishing it without a guild.<br />
<br />
There is a LOT of gear out there thats 1-2 groupable that runs 75-100 HPS per slot on it, or is tradeable.  <br />
<br />
Tradeable like: LDON Hard drops, White Dragon helm, Velium Encrusted<br />
Go Camp mobs.  Off Hand: Dozekar for Tears, BOT tower bosses for Greatstaff of the 4 Winds, Ornate BPs, BOT wing boss for Ornate Legs.  There are luclin mobs like Vadyn &amp; RC that are one-two groupable due to level 65 spells/resists now a days with 1-2 groups that drop gear with 75-100 range.  Then thow in some MQable purchases as well.  Bought myself a Secrets of the Planes for 190k before I could access the elementals.  Hell, of the whole quest I only killed one mob myself.<br />
<br />
It is entirely possible without Raiding to be at essential the VT level.<br />
It's just not easy.<br />
<br />
Anyway again sum it up put in some work and look around 12 or less people could accomplish:<br />
Tradeables: from LDON, White Dragon Helm, Velium Encrusted, <br />
<br />
1 -2 Groupables: LDON Hard Drops, Dozekar, RC, Vadyn, Most Dragons ranging from KorekDar to Zlandicar.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The game can no longer properly support the player base and where they are at in particular with regards to PoP and Ele. progression.  Old outdated content is killed by small guilds or bored higher levels single groups.  VT is perma farmed by guilds at that level.  Ele planes?  I lost track of how many we have there now...  like all servers, it's a LOT.  My guild is RARELY able to find anything up to kill barring the Ele. god encounters, except Fennin Ro which is perma farmed.  We are the 2nd of 3 guilds in Time.  The first guild there fell apart so currently only 2 in Time, but we have nights outside of our Time rotation when there is NOTHING to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Every expansion could have plenty of content.  They just screw it up.<br />
<br />
Consider PoP.  If Halls of Honor, Plane of Torment, and Plane of Storms were better itemized, more people would hunt there.  If either of those 3 zones had BoT Tower style raid content, casuals would pickup raid there.  The problem has never really been lack of zones, but rather an imbalance between existing ones.  One designer does an amazing job with a zone like BoT, and another just makes a totally worthless zone in Plane of Torment.<br />
chif<br />
<br />
I agree with you as far as Plane of Torment not having raid style content, since the only mob worth raiding is Saryrn and she takes 3.5+ hours to kill. <br />
I seriously think you need to take a look at PoS again. Go take a ranger or druid bot and hit track near the ocean giants. I bet 9 times out of 10 you will find a Lord up if not the mini named also. Personally I think the Lord event is alot more fun than BoT Towers. Mainly because every Lord has loot for EVERY class in the loot table and they all drop medallions needed for BoT Flag. So technically It's a win, win situation. This can be done with a tank with about 8.5khp and 4-6 groups. Nice thing is that alot of higher guilds rarely do them. I know the Ocean Lord drops a really nice 41% haste belt. The Desert Lord drops Writ of Karana (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17344) <br />
<br />
As far as HoH goes, it's not hard for casuals to group and kill for windblades and other items. They could also do the three HoHb trials. On my server, the trials are always done by pickup raids as soon as the triggers pop. <br />
<br />
With the exception of a few events it's not hard for casual gamers to at least get flagged for Sol Ro. Pretty much the only two that they might need over 2 hours to do would be Saryrn and Bert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">First off, unless they adjusted the loot tables, the PoS lords only dropped 1 piece of loot which is of mid-ssra quality.  It's hard to get excited about that getting that kind of loot of mobs which are a pain in the ass (yes, any mob with AE Rampage is a pain).  <br />
<br />
Saryrn is getting crowded quickly.<br />
<br />
1 Time Guild who can clear in a day (Heaven and Earth)<br />
2 Time guilds who have killed Quarm but farm elementals (Team Japan, Travelers of Norrath)<br />
1 Time guild still at tier5 (Order of the Pheonix)<br />
1 Elem guild w/ 2 god kills (The War Council; Corinav dies next time we get the spawn, Rathe we need to take a weekend to do).<br />
1 Elem guild 1 god kill (Titans of Saryrn, resident Euro guild, they have done Fennin only)<br />
3 Elem guilds with no god kills (Isengard, Guardians of Light, and Familjen (but they just broke in))<br />
<br />
With the exception of the japan guild, euro guild, and my guild (TWC, psat based) all other guilds are EST based raid times.  I remember reading arguments 6 months ago whether Vex Thal was really necessary to break into elementals.  It isn't (A half dozen clerics, a 9k tank, and 8+ enchanters make killing RZ trivial; rest of raid on kite duty).  But when you can go days without seeing a elem mob, having the opportunity to clear ex Thal is nice.  For the most part Aten loot is equal to elem in quality while everything else from the tvx twins/blob1 up is good filler.  So much so that one time guild on Saryrn who keyed up and killed emp a year ago, but was never able to clear VT because the japan guild had the lock on the respawn, they have rekeyed and now have access to not only the standard clear mobs, but the towers and twins.  PoTime doesnt drop enough loot for them so they have this option open.<br />
<br />
Luckily there are no more guilds on Saryrn who are even close to elem (one smaller guild is in SolRo, some hoe they were given flags off mobs they have no chance on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">3 guild in Time, 5 or + other in EP.<br />
But we have asian, euro and us time's zone guild<br />
<br />
3 have cleared time, 9 in EP on our server. Thats why there's probably so many open raids- nobody cares about tier1-3 any more except us newbies :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">More and more are getting elemental enabled.  A few months ago, SOE let an entire ele Euro guild move onto my server.  They claim they couldn't handle the competition on Stormhammer.<br />
<br />
Competition? I'm pretty sure Sullon is the only server with a smaller population. I have no clue how Europa could've not advanced on SH.  It's not like TR is going to bother fooling around with EP stuff, and Vexare and Leviathan were working on EP Gods as well.  Sounds a LOT less packed than any other server.<br />
<br />
Itemization:  People will pick the zone with the &quot;best&quot; exp and loot, and there's only one of them.  If itemization in PoS gets better, then there will be a tipping point when everyone leaves PoV to go to PoS.  Until that tipping point is reached, the &quot;4 camps&quot; in PoV will remain the only place to exp (on a side note, 4 camps? jesus that's lame).  Just like everyone will stay in BoT until a zone is identified with &quot;better exp&quot; or &quot;better loot&quot; then everyone will go there leaving BoT a ghost town.  <br />
<br />
I'd take a decent group in Veksar over PoV for exp any day, but the fact is, no one will go there because &quot;the exp in PoV is better&quot;.  Yeah, shouting &quot;camp check&quot; for 2-3 hours is GREAT exp.<br />
<br />
LDoN and items: Personally I love LDoN, and I think the itemization is pretty decent, especially considering no one can stop you from racking up points - unlike the week long spawns for stuff with decent loot tables.  Big win for me in that expansion.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.  I've got some pretty nice gear (I think), that is all attained w/ 1 group or bought, and it's taken a load of time to get it all.  I have time to play, but not necessarily every night, and honestly, I hate sitting around in a raid for 3 hours and killing 1 mob and some trash in between, just seems such a waste of time.<br />
<br />

My raid attendence is about 15% and I probably should not be there other then the fact that all my friends are in the guild and I really enjoy playing with them.<br />
<br />
My advice to those of you who are casual players is to be very nice and helpful.  One, its fun and the right thing to do.  The second is that I cannot count the number of players I have helped out who started behind me in terms of progression and then advanced well beyond me.  Those friends I made have helped me a thousand times more then I deserve.  I am aware of this so I try very hard to help them when I get the opportunity.  Good karma I guess.  Do not take help for granted and people will be happy to help you.<br />
<br />
Also work the quest angle.  I am by no means uber but I am elemental flagged and have decent gear (3500hps 1200ac ish) with only 3 raid drop items (KT belt, Vex thal neck and blood bracer).  Everything else is bought, quested or gotten in one group type encounters.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion but I have been very happy with my EQ experience, made alot of good friends, had alot of fun, and my wife has not divorced me yet:).  Plus I still get excited when I have the time to raid.  Alot of my friends get burnt out but I still love raiding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">The thing to remember, tho, is that once you make it to Time, all guilds must cooperate or nobody gets to raid Time for phat lewts.  Just one person can completely **** it up for an entire guild due to instancing problems.  So guilds have to cooperate and work out a plan for fairly sharing the zone.  And the lewt is plentiful.  We just got there and did our first real time raid, only got to Tier3, but we got 15 loots during that time.  When we are able to blow thru and kill Quarm, we should easily double that loot count per clearing, if not quite a bit more.  That will go a long way toward equipping the guild in a rather fast fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">one thing i don't think non time ppl understand is, when we say time is instanced we mean that we don't have to compete for the mob being up, which doesn't necessarily mean we don't have to compete for the time to raid.  unless they allow multiple raids to be in seperate instances of time at once, this is going to get really really bad when more guilds get into time.  the other day, for example, our asian guild had raided time and we think ended tier4 early and left to do tier5 and quarm another day.  it wouldn't let us zone in for our normal raid times because their instance was still up (yet there was no one there, obviously) so we had to wait until their instance despawned before we could go.  i can't imagine how this will be when new time guilds require more days of the week to clear and learn the mobs and the guilds that have been farming just want to clear in normal 1-2 day fashion for as much loot as possible, because as it is there's usually a guild in time most of the days of the week.    <br />
<br />
on my server there's probably 10 guilds elemental flagged, 3 of which are time flagged (2 U.S. that alternate and are friendly which makes it easy and 1 Asia that raids on their own time).  also to note my server, tunare, was the first to have 2 and 3 guilds into time, so we've always been pretty crowded.  but i've heard of guilds with so many people and no way to equip them in the elemental planes even going back to vex thal to try to equip their people due to lack of content.  <br />
<br />
the only thing i can hope is it will be so hard to get coirnav with his fixed timer and lack of equipment due to extreme overcrowdedness in the elemental planes that many new elemental guilds won't have time flags for a long time, hopefully either to A) give sony time to properly instance the zone so that multiple raids can be doing it at once, or B) come out with actually some new raid content worth doing (**** ldon it's horrible to raid absolutely horrible).  then again all the new elemental guilds have to do to get coirnav is band together and send a massive zerg horde and voila &gt;&lt;.  either way hoping GoD has something to offer the high end game for further progression for everyone, so that we may move on from time and let others have a turn, and hopefully avoid as much petty conflict as possible.  on the plus side, if they don't fix time, like every GM is going to be 10x busier trying to negotiate settlements between guilds on when they can raid time, or they'll be flooded with petitions of guilds racing each other every night so they can get their instance cleared and rinse/repeat for next week.  <br />

While I agree that SOE will never be able to put out enough content to fully satisfy the TRULY hardcore raiders (nor should they), I disagree with the &quot;zerg releasing&quot; part of your post. The last expansion that was aimed at the Hardcore player was PoP. <br />
<br />
I do think its important to keep the hardcore raiders moving along though, or we end up with the bottlenecks we are currently seeing on many servers. Too many guilds EP flagged, not enough loot to gear up properly to move on, and even if we could move on there is no place to go (4 Time guilds on my server, no instances left for us). <br />
<br />
Pop did an EXCELLENT job of spreading people out. We saw an unprecedented amount of inter-guild cooperation on my server, because there was plenty of content to go around and therefore no real hard feelings or cockblocking, leapfrogging, etc (at first, once it got crowded at the top this started again). The power guilds plowed though, the rest of us moved into the higher end Luclin content vacated by them, and still had flag mobs to hit every now and then. However, as happens every &quot;endgame&quot; expansion, the server caught up with the content, in general. <br />
<br />
As for all the % numbers being bandied about, I will use my server as an example. Bertoxx is consistantly in the Top 3 for population during the USA prime time hours (a holdover from WAY back when we were the first on the list alphabetically) so lets say we have 1800-2000 online from 8-11 pm (a generous number, I think the actual is closer to 1500). Of those 2000, there are 6 of the 9 EP guilds raiding those hours, with an average of 70-80 per guild logged in, 50-65 actually raiding. Another 50 from the Sol Ro Tower only guild, and another 40 each from the &quot;next 3&quot; doing Tier 2 PoP content and Ssra-Luclin stuff. Do the math. Thats over 25% of the total server population raiding, more than 20% of it EP flagged. And I think these numbers are lowball. <br />
<br />
SOE needs another expansion to spread out the top end. I don't think EQ2 is going to solve any of these problems. GoD is gonna get chewed up and spit out so fast its not funny, and the Time guilds will be right back into the EPs and Time again, leaving us back to square one. Personally, for myself, its not a big deal. I am in no big hurry to hit Time. I would love to eventually, but I can wait. I just don't want to see a lot of my friends decide the game is too plugged up and stop playing is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Blazz, have to agree with you (I think). This expansion (Planes of Power)have been the top for way to long. There havent been this long between expansions before (no, I am not including ldon or loy) so most guilds are maxed out and are only waiting for next highend expansion to release. <br />
You also said:<br />

I would not count on that. I have seen some of the loot for some elemental difficulty groupinstances in GoD and they are on pair with Time stage 1-2 loot so my guess is that the raidzones in GoD will be the one you contest for. Or get first too as all will probably be instanced. And if a ep diff. groupinstance drops a wristitem on pair with Wristguard of Keen Vision, I will bet my left pinkytoe that the time diff. raidzones nameds will drop on pair with quarm and better. Who cares about time in that case?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehehe, they won't respond because they have nothing to say.<br />
<br />
This is EXACTLY what they all started shouting when we debated opening the Elemental planes.  &quot;Get into a raiding guild, devote more time, blah blah blah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nevermind that we'd have to leave all of our good friends.<br />
<br />
Nevermind that we'd have to leave our nice comfy family/low-end raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
Nevermind that we'd miss the opportunity to explore new zones, take on new mobs, with the people who got us to where we are.<br />
<br />
Nevermind the fact that 90% of the time, your friends think you sold out when you abandon them for a raiding guild, and many won't talk to you anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uberguilders:&quot;  You wanted to raid.  You gave up your family guilds and found new homes in raiding guilds, and you've managed to conquer all the way to the Elementals and Time.<br />
<br />
Congratulations.<br />
<br />
Now stop complaining about overcrowding, because you have access to just about every zone in the game.  You can do anything you want, almost anywhere.  You can solo/duo mobs that we normal people have to group to take down.  You got everything that you wanted.<br />
<br />
If anything, you have three times more options that we casual players do.  You have access to the PoP quests that require Elemental access.  Your relative power allows you to take on mobs with less people than it requires for the casual player.  If you can't find anything to do, then you're obviously not looking hard enough.<br />
<br />
Go try to run the Hole with 2 people.  Try plowing the ring in PoI to see how fast you can do it with 3 people.  Do those Aid Grimel quests.  Go back and see if you can duo old-world raid mobs.  Grab a friend and go spring all the mindworm traps in Akheva and see how far you can get into the zone.  Try single-grouping Trak.  Kill that obnoxious fire elemental in Shadeweaver's Thicket that to my knowledge nobody on my server has managed to kill, not even the Time guilds.<br />
<br />
Heck, petition SoE until they respawn the Sleeper on all the other servers, and take your shot at him, but you only get one try  ;). (Grats you crazy Sleeper-killers.  Great job!)<br />
<br />
You can't find anything to do because all you can think of is raiding.<br />
<br />
Repeat after me:  EQ IS NOT JUST RAIDING.<br />
<br />
If you think it's boring, then consider this:  does a mob absolutely HAVE to drop uber gear to make it fun to kill?  Do you absolutely HAVE to get 2% AA out of a non-raid mob to make it fun?<br />
<br />
If you can't find anything challenging to do, you're obviously not looking hard enough.<br />
<br />
Thank you, drive through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I dunno, if you wanna be a successful player you have to have good gear.  At least that's what most people believe.  And to get good gear the best way is to raid all the time.  Raiding becomes your EQ life, you're almost always doing it when you're online.  At least that's the way it is for me.  I come home from work, and if it's a day I'm not doing anything, I log on EQ and join the everpresent raid in plane of whatever.  Now that we have Time access, the incentive to raid is even stronger.  The lewt is incredible and plentiful.  <br />
I can see how just leaving the ratrace may have its advantages, but honestly it would just be slumming for me, since I've done all previous content before.  Might be fun for a while, then I'd want an upgrade and wouldn't be able to get one without rejoining a raiding guild and getting back into raiding action.  <br />
Those of you who are bitter about raiders, might do well to just become one for a bit.  You may come to understand the fun involved in raiding. <br />
<br />
Last note: If GoD doesn't introduce a lot of valid and exciting raid content, this game is going to get rather crowded indeed.</div></div><hr />

Veeshan has 6 guilds in time I believe, although 2 are allied.  Saryn has 5 guilds in time with 1 alliance, Xegony has 6 guilds in time with 1 alliance.<br />
<br />
While alliances may make the time rotation eaiser to work out, it is still 5 or 6 guilds competing for the same loot and same mobs... they just are more friendly about the terms of the competition.<br />
<br />
If GoD doesnt offer high end content - high end content geared towards raids of 60+ members - you can add Karana, Luclin, MM, Prexus, Quellious, Sol Ro, TT, Vazaelle to the list in the near future.  And long before the next expansion comes out, baring mass customer defection, it will be the norm for 4 + guilds to be competing for Time spawns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think anyone would consider my guild Uber, but I'll respond anyways.<br />
<br />
This didn't even come close to hitting the nail.  Leaving your guild to redo the same content you have already completed is not even similar to leaving your guild to join a new guild that is doing content you have never seen before.<br />
<br />
Let me explain a few things about EQ.  There is no content that is out of reach of any player, casual or hardcore.  Mudflation makes everything possible.  Look back in time at some of the events that the Trailblazers have said only the top 2 guilds on the server would ever kill.  Trakanon, Emp ssra? Seru? LOL?<br />
<br />
You don't have to join an uber guild to see the end game.<br />
<br />
You could take your own guild and work hard, and get their on your own.  Thats what my guild did.  We started out as a bunch of lazy friends and over the last several years we have been SLOWLY getting better and now we are elementally flagged.  To give you a point of reference, we had wiped to Neh-Ashiir 4 times when the Avatar of War was first killed.  We were as gimpy as they came.<br />
<br />
If you aren't in a guild, dont want to join a guild, or your guild only has 10 people, and you are not willing to change that, then you are ACTIVELY CHOOSING to not participate in a large amount of content in EQ.<br />
<br />
Take a look at this guild. http://www.onlythebrave.org<br />
<br />
They raid 2 days a week, Maxium, and they schedule their raids in advanced so their members can prepare for them.  They are elementally flagged.<br />
<br />
There is a japanese guild on Veeshan that raids with a maxium size of about 24.  They are super skilled and will undoubtable see the elemental planes soon.  They've killed bertox with those small numbers, and will soon Kill Mithaniel Marr, if they haven't already.<br />
<br />
There are ways to make your goals happen.  You don't have to leave your friends, or give up your life, or make a zerg force to do these things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am I reading this right?  I'm sorry but the problem I have with turning my back and walking out on my friends has absolutely nothing to do with the rewards that come from deserting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">The reason for all this is directly the result of opennin up the tiers: hoh/bot/cod/pov/pos. It made a lot of people readily available for raiding guilds to consume. w/o these half those EP guilds would be only half 65s and the rest 60+, which would make it a lot harder to get elem.<br />
<br />
Also I raid, or used to raid almost 4 hours every day, 4pst-8pst. I did it for 3-4 months w/o any loot at all. This experience is not uncommon, casual players just don't understand that, they are used to 1 sitting getting an ornate or something to drop. <br />
<br />
That's why ldon is not apealing to most of you guys, specially the ones that think it's **** armor/too much work. If you do 1 ldon per hour, that's 200pts /day. in one month you get 6000 points. Enough to get a 140 hps bp (shaman) with 12 to all resists and burning affliction/regen v or ft2 on it.. (I'm approximating). And STILL have points left over.. nothing but the best bps in the game, that most high end raiding people don't have are better than that. <br />
<br />
Besides that you are getting good xp, good loots via drops and pp, while the raiding person is loosing xp, getting no cash/pp loot, has to deal with 70 or so other people who all want some nice loots.<br />
<br />
Casual people have it pretty good. It will take you about 2 months at 2 hours a day, that's pretty damn great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either your guild hates you, or they got some rule about not giving new people loots, or you are simply a DKP horder.  <br />
<br />
I can't see how you could raid with a guild for 3-4 months and not get any loots at all.  <br />
<br />
Did you join, get an crapload of loots to make up for your really crappy gear, and then get put on a loot hiatus?  <br />

My guild is a small guild built up of former guildies who split up due to content, then left their respective raiding guilds and reformed the old guild (certainly, not typical, likely not unique).  They like the high end content, but were not comfortable with the grind.  Once a week we hit older, accessable content, but we do the same encounters they did before with one third of the number of raiders.  It's a blast to do stuff with less, hardly slumming.  You're no longer stuck in traditional roles and get to enjoy the content rather than stand with the others of your class and fill out a specific role.  Sure clerics still heal, but they also do other things like pull, and sometimes even melee on raids.  Sure shaman still slow, but just earlier this week after slowing the main mob I ran around the raid training many of the adds in a circle keeping them off of the main raid force (not glorious by any stretch, but I was adding less than others and getting aggro wasn't much of an issue).  Bottom line is the game is what you make of it.  Unlike other guildies, I won't see time, but I don't give a damn.  Our weekly guild night is a lot of fun for me, not for everyone, but for me.</div></div><hr />

If by good you mean having LDoN and BoT (maybe Tactics) to look forward to once you hit 65 for the rest of your time in EQ, then yes, we have it good.<br />
<br />
SOE's artificial separation of the playerbase into raider and casual with nothing in between has essentially created a situation where almost no one is happy, it's just the reasons that are different. Raiders' problems are totally different than the issues facing casuals, but do either camp sound happy in this thread?  And this is over a virtual game mind you.<br />
<br />
SOE is in this seesaw of releasing expansions aimed at one crowd or the other but never able to please both simultaneously.  I think the last time both crowds were pleased may have been Velious, maybe Luclin.  PoP was the radical departure from their previous philosophy of limited, restricted content (e.g. VP/ST) into nearly an entire expansion of restricted (flagged/keyed) zones.  Couple that with the enormous difference in raid gear vs. obtainable bazaar gear and the division gets even worse.<br />
<br />
How will SOE reconcile the issues raised by two separate but equally valid playstyles in future expansions?  In my opinion, sadly, they can't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">If anyone hit the nail on the head, it was Salorm.  This is the longest stretch of time they've gone without an expansion that expanded the high end content.  That is the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean apart from the fact that 2 out of 3 options in the last expansion was high-end content.<br />
<br />
LDoN was not aimed at casual players despite everything that SOE said to the contrary.  The 'adventure' format that was superimposed on top of instanced dungeons is clearly not designed to cater for the characteristics of casual players.<br />
<br />
Lets think for a moment at some of the obvious characteristics of casual players.<br />
<br />
	- Unable to guarantee when they will log on.<br />
	- Unable to guarantee playing for long periods of time.<br />
	- Needing to go afk to deal with real-life distractions.<br />
<br />
All these characteristics should be catered for in an expansion that is 'aimed at the casual player'.  Lets see how the adventure format chosen by the Devs meets the need to satisfy them:<br />
<br />
- If you can't guarantee logging on for a certain time there's no mechanism by which your friends can invite you into an adventure thats already started.  They either have to wait around for you or decide to start without you and exclude you from their group.<br />
<br />
-  If you can't play for at least two hours then you may have to leave before the adventure is over - thus jeopardising everyone's hope of a success.  Even with two hours available, by the time your group has formed, gotten an adventure, buffed up and gotten to zone in, you may have used up a considerable amount of your playing time before even starting the adventure.<br />
<br />
- If you can't guarantee uninterrupted play then because of the 90 minutes timer (what on earth is that in there for?) you again risk everyone's success.  <br />
<br />
But if anyone after all that still insists that LDoN is for casual players then lets consider the range of adventures that you can choose from in the 'normal' option.  <br />
<br />
- Where's the adventure selection for soloers - or aren't soloers casual players anymore?  <br />
<br />
- Would it have been so very hard to have created an adventure option that gave you points per room cleared?  That would have allowed groups of say 3 casual players (or people with less than 2 hours available) to have had a decent shot at doing something worhwhile in LDoN. Yes I know that would have messed up the fragboard scoring - but who was this expansion aimed at again?</div></div><hr />

Seems to me that if this is your &quot;play-style&quot; due to whatever reason, then suck it up and be happy with what you get. I get so pissed at the 5 hour a week people that want to turn EQ into Diablo 2. <br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
That being said, however, some of your points DO have significant merit, however, you need to remember one key issue. Balance. LDoN was targeted at the &quot;medium casual gamer&quot; for sure. So was LoY for that matter, with a number of easily accessible small guild raids for the 50-60 crowd available. However, the hard-core people ROLLED through LDoN and immidiatly started churning out so many points for 40 hp augs etc that SOE had to make an adjustment to the whole Augment system. If SOE made it EVEN EASIER for the &quot;less-than-medium casual gamer&quot; to aquire top loot and access end-game type zones, then the hard-core gamers would certainly find a way to thoroughly abuse the system. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is that Everquest is a game of Time-Investment = Return. Period. Its not a hard game. Its not difficult to get to 65, or aquire EP level loot. Friend of mine recently took a Bard from 0 to 65 fully EP flagged, on a differnt server than his &quot;home&quot; server, in about a month. <br />

Seems to me that if this is your &quot;play-style&quot; due to whatever reason, then suck it up and be happy with what you get. I get so pissed at the 5 hour a week people that want to turn EQ into Diablo 2. <br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Actually I've averaged 3 hours a day since 1999 when I started Everquest.<br />
<br />
But I don't understand the comment - how does it have any relevance except as a mindless and ill-targetted insult?<br />
<br />
I am a 'casual' player because I find raiding as boring as hell: and yes I have tried it.  I would expect that anyone with a 3 digit IQ could at least realise that a fair number of players in EQ would feel the same way.<br />
<br />
This thread is about ubers whining - thats the taunt often thrown at casual gamers when they complain - that there isn't enough content for them.  Despite the fact that a disproportionate amount of the Devteam's time has always been devoted to pandering to their need for ever more ridiculous Monty Haul-style encounters.<br />
<br />
So lets throw this quote back at them.  If you are a hard-core raider then...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Blaming raiders for the issues facing casuals is neither constructive, nor fair, despite the temptation.  They have a commodity most casuals don't have in large quantities: time.  The fact that time spent in game does not result in linear rewards but rather in exponential rewards based on playstyle is a design flaw, not a flaw with a particular playstyle.  Raiders have the option to maximize their character's potential (defined by exp and gear) within the limits of the game, casuals do not.<br />
<br />
That having been said, it doesn't make much sense for a raider to tell a casual player with limited play time to &quot;suck it up and stop whining&quot; either. The casual playstyle is equally as valid and I'd feel confident saying it's the norm, rather than the exception among the total playerbase.  <br />
<br />
Ultimately the designers are responsible for the division of the playerbase and it's at them complaints should be directed.  Players can't fix issues with the game, only designers.  At the least I wish EQ would have a little more &quot;truth in advertising&quot; (slightly modified from the everquest.com site):<br />
<br />
Equip yourself for adventure, seek allies and knowledge, and experience a rich world of dungeons, towers, crypts, evil abbeys-anything is possible once flagged-even planes and realities beyond your imagination, provided you have the amount of time required to join a powerful guild.<br />
<br />
If EverQuest is irrevocably EverRaid, at least be honest about it if you're not going to provide a linear reward system.<br />

True, but the EQ Devteam have only been responding to the uber's demand for loot escalation.  And I'm under the impression that the Devteam have even gone so far as to recruit some ubers into their ranks.<br />
<br />
The Devteam may ignore casual players but they do respond to the uber guilds.  How many casual groups can get an encounter tuned down so they can beat it?  Yet what happened in PoP when the ubers found the going too tough?</div></div><hr />

Yes I am.  But I have no idea whether it was correct to tune it or not - its entirely outside my playing experience.  The issue being discussed is how much responsibility the uber's themselves bear for the current situation. Izmalis regarded it as entirely the Devteam's fault: I used the Rathe Council only as an example of how the Devteam watch over and respond to Uber guilds.  I didn't make that clear and thats wrong of me.</div></div><hr />

I tried it before tuning and it was correct if any guild would ever be in Plane of Time. Why &quot;the uber's&quot; get the responsibility could also mean that the encounters arent really tuned even after betatesting and the first to try the encounter on a live server are the guild who comes there first aka &quot;the uber's&quot;. I am pretty sure that whatever guild tried a thing for the first time and found it totally impossible would petition and then another guild and another guild etc. the dev's would listen and try to fix the situation as they want the game and the &quot;story&quot; to continue and not stop because of a bugged encounter. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? Please point out the pandering to the Uber player aspects of the last 2 expansions. The most recent expantion that targeted the high-end player was PoP, end of story. How can you call it pandering to ask for more content, when the casual player had the most recent 2 expansions targeted specifically at them, without any realistic high-end content at ALL. <br />
<br />
Sorry, your arguements just arent cutting it. I am not even a very hard-core player. I play less than you do, if your &quot;3 hours a day&quot; number is accurate. But I am in one of the guilds experiencing the MASSIVE bottleneck at the EP level on most servers, and its VERY obvious to us that there needs to be more End Game content. <br />
<br />
I would love to see SOEs internal numbers on the status of the active accounts in this game. People say &quot;2% of all EQ players are EP flagged or higher&quot;. Where does this number come from? I have 2 accounts I pay for, and 1 EP flagged character. Is my 2nd account part of the 2% or the 98%? I put up some guesstimate numbers earlier in this thread where I think that 25% of people logged in AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT during prime time are EP flagged. And thats not counting the 2nd accounts of some of these people who havent flagged up twinks. <br />
<br />
Say what you will, but the &quot;above medium casual&quot; - to - HARDcore player is a VERY significant portion of SOEs overall membership. I think that 2% number is a pile of crap. My medium sized guild has something like 140 members EP flagged, probably 180ish if you count 2nd accounts. There are 9 similar guilds on my server at or above this level, and 2 or 3 more up and coming fast. Do the math. Also factor in the fact that litterally 100's of &quot;uber&quot; players on each server run 3 or more accounts at a time. <br />
<br />
Bottom line here, we are not whining for more content, we are saying &quot;its a problem, and its our turn&quot;. Go be casual in LoY and LDoN, please. Stop blaming the higher end players for taking DevTeam time, when the Casual Players have dominated the DevTeam for the past 18 months since PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">[snip]when the casual player had the most recent 2 expansions targeted specifically at them, without any realistic high-end content at ALL. .<br />
Well, let's be more specfiic then, Blazz.  Let's talk the level 65 casual player since it's the L65, highend PoP raider that's experiencing the most issues.<br />
LoY- Outside of the overall game stuff (bank space, etc...) this was an expansion of little value to the casual 65.  I don't think I'm wearing a single piece of gear from this expansion- the loot, exp and zone accessibility are subpar at best.<br />
<br />
LDoN- LDoN wasn't aimed specifically at casuals, it simply includes them.  This is the linear reward system I mentioned earlier.  A raid player who does 20 adventures in 4 days winds up with the same adventure points as the casual who does 20 adventures in a month, assuming same level of difficulty and successes.  Don't tell me no one in your guild is using LDoN augs- none of your warriors are using the Anger III augs, none of your priests who didn't have RGC bought it?  The fact that LDoN raids (according to raiders on this board and elsewhere) are designed poorly doesn't negate the fact that LDoN does contain raid content.  In addition, the hard level of LDoNs is mostly aimed at those in raid gear.<br />
<br />
<br />

Also factor in the fact that litterally 100's of &quot;uber&quot; players on each server run 3 or more accounts at a time. <br />
<br />
I'd love to know this also.  It's important how you define the criteria, however.  Let's define it like this: Active accounts that contain at least one EP flagged character. Using SOE's<br />
numbers from awhile back, there are roughly 450K accounts playing EQ.  There are roughly 32 servers, right?  Feel free to update my numbers if I'm wrong.  So that means:<br />
450,000 / 32 = 14,062 accounts/server.  Let's say there are ten guilds, each of 100 members, all of which are at least EP flagged per server.<br />
That's 1000 / 14,062 = roughly 7.1% of the server's population is EP flagged.  On my server there are nowhere near 1k people in the EP's, but if this is correct, you're still talking<br />
roughly 7% of the playerbase.  If I'm wrong on accounts or servers, please correct me.<br />
<br />
The fact that a higher percentage of those EP flagged are on at any given time is irrelevant, because from a revenue standpoint it's still a 90/10 casual/raider ratio at best since SOE<br />
charges a flat fee to play.  It's all academic anyways, because we don't have access to the database to run the simply query to find this out.<br />
<br />
Any SOE reps out there want to jump in on this? We're not looking for subscriber numbers, we're simply looking for a percentage of active accounts which contain an EP flagged character.<br />
<br />

<br />
Noticed the raid option in LDoN? Who is that for?  What's that doing in an expansion aimed at casual gamers.<br />
<br />
What percentage of content do you think the uber 5% of the playerbase should get without it being described as being pandered to?  If all was done in strict proportion to the number of players who get to see it, your next injection of content should be coming your way round about 2010.<br />
<br />
If the Devteam was doing its job you wouldn't be seeing any new content at all.  The loss of every uber EQ account would mean nothing compared to the improved retention of accounts amongst the other 95% of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Cry all you want but the Devteam gave you ubers the ridiculously over the top loot that you all wanted and now you need a second version of EQ all to yourselves if you are to have any challenge.  Well tough: you don't have the numbers to warrant any significant commitment of Devteam effort on your behalf, so you should feel lucky that you get as much as you do.<br />
<br />
Oh I cant resist repeating it:<br />
<br />
Seems to me that if this is your &quot;play-style&quot; due to whatever reason, then suck it up and be happy with what you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">izmalis i think many that is in ep have 2 acounts or more so the number is probly higher then you get it to .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">or you could look at it this way.  90% of the population of EQ wishes that they were better off than they are now, and able to get the nice loot.  The more raiding expansions that they put out, the quicker that the top guilds move out of the zones that they are in, and the faster the guilds beneath them can progess.  Soon, everyone will be in the elementals at least.  And, I could care less about some of the fixing of older stuff (doors opening the wrong way).  But, what i do get excited about is new content.  New places to explore and new mobs to fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">The point is eventually the content will be consumed whether you raid once a week, once a month, or every day. The &quot;ubers&quot; don't go to Velious or Luclin when there is content available to consume. If the EPs are &quot;consumed&quot; and they are used to raiding every day, they will go to Velious and hit KT or AoW or emperor or VT, thus impacting the up and coming &quot;ubers&quot; or more casual or whatever you want to term them. Don't think that just because the EPs are too crowded that this has no impact on the &quot;non-ubers&quot;. It does. If GoD is compareable to EP/Time then it frees up that much more content for everyone and you won't see guilds bottom feeding on AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Noticed the raid option in LDoN? Who is that for?  What's that doing in an expansion aimed at casual gamers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you making a joke with this? Seriously, if you think the Raid feature of LDoN was &quot;added content for Uber guilds&quot; then you are saddly mistaken. Its completely worthless, but I am sure you already know this. Also, each expansion contains content for ALL players, PoP included. Wearing any Ornate? Got any 61+ spells? Been to the planes? Yeah, high end gamers got high end raids, but casual players benefited from EVERY single expansion made in this game. To sit there and say that SOE dedicates too much to the End game is ridiculous, especially in light of the last 2 expansions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, let's be more specfiic then, Blazz. Let's talk the level 65 casual player since it's the L65, highend PoP raider that's experiencing the most issues.<br />
LoY- Outside of the overall game stuff (bank space, etc...) this was an expansion of little value to the casual 65. I don't think I'm wearing a single piece of gear from this expansion- the loot, exp and zone accessibility are subpar at best.<br />
<br />
LDoN- LDoN wasn't aimed specifically at casuals, it simply includes them. This is the linear reward system I mentioned earlier. A raid player who does 20 adventures in 4 days winds up with the same adventure points as the casual who does 20 adventures in a month, assuming same level of difficulty and successes. Don't tell me no one in your guild is using LDoN augs- none of your warriors are using the Anger III augs, none of your priests who didn't have RGC bought it? The fact that LDoN raids (according to raiders on this board and elsewhere) are designed poorly doesn't negate the fact that LDoN does contain raid content. In addition, the hard level of LDoNs is mostly aimed at those in raid gear.<br />
<br />
Can I please get a break here? LDoN provided the ability to get loot superior to VT for EVERYONE. Of course hard core players are taking advantage of it. If the loot sucked, then the casual player would be where he was before the expansion, with little access to high-end gear. What, do you think every member of every EP guild has a full set of VT-EP gear? Check my magelo bub, its nothing spectacular. How can you possibly have an expansion aimed at the casual player that DIDN'T include the high end player? Please, cut me a little slack in this debate. LDoN provided casual players a means to get VERY good items without having to dedicate time and energy in a high end raiding guild, PERIOD. The fact that I have LDoN loot, or that my guildmates do is a testament to the quality of the gear available. <br />
<br />
As for your numbers on % of accounts EP flagged, they are low. 100 members per EP guild isnt very many, trust me. SOE basically forced guilds to recruit heavily in order to maintain the numbers needed for the encounters. You need an active member base of 120+ to successfully get to the EPs (there are exceptions, to be sure). Most EP guilds probably run in the 150ish active member list, not counting bots. Also, of those 14K accounts per server, how many do you think are 2nd, 3rd and even 4th accounts of High End players? I am willing to bet that well over 50% of all EP flagged players have 2 accounts. Suddenly, with my numbers, we are getting closer to that 25% mark I tossed out earlier, aren't we (1500 / 14K * 1.5, ok, 16% then, still a significant portion).<br />
<br />
Look guys, I have nothing against the casual player. But I cannot understand what it is you want. You cannot have end game zone access because it would create CHAOS in those zones. Don't blame me, ever been to BoT when a guild is doing Agnarr and there are 50 people in there XPing? Its a lagfest disaster. The EPs are the same with more than 100. You already have a means to get better gear than all but the EP stuff in LDoN. You have 100's of zones to check out, tons of 1-to-3 group type raids available, WHAT DO YOU WANT? To sit there and point fingers at the people who have been putting in TONS more time than you because THEIR end of things sucks is wrong. Most of us have DONE all that content, have you? Cripes, this game used to be known as &quot;Evercamp&quot; but you know, lately it seems there are MUCH better alternatives than 55 hours to get a Ghoulbane, like I did in 1999 on my original character. <br />
<br />
High end players have a legitimate problem right now. There arent enough zones/loots to go around. We are finding ourselves with more and more &quot;free nights&quot; than ever before, because we dont WANT to go kill Luclin stuff or AoW and take that encounter from a guild that is at that level. When we go to VT, and Rumblecrush is up, we ASK guilds that level if they want to come do him (with back-up). The Time enabled guilds cannot raid in Time daily. They are forced back to the EPs, which rolls downhill. The hill is getting bigger and bigger ever week. <br />
<br />
Keep using that quote too. Yeah, its rude the way I worded it, but its damn accurate. I played more so I could get more stuff, period. I joined a high end guild so I could see those endgame zones and get some endgame loot, period. I have friends all over my server, many many friends, I could have found stuff to do easily without a high end guild, but I CHOSE my path, and I got my rewards, a few really cool, nice items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">i tend to agree with blazz on this one.  i think of the same type of argument when i listen to affirmative action proponets, namely, what is it that you want?  do you want to be given ALL the benefits of those that play 8 hours a day and raid with a large number of people who want to see/kill every zone/mob in eq?  ldon was completely different from all other everquest expansions because it allowed you to get GOOD gear with no raiding AT ALL.  let me repeat AT ALL.  you would never ever have to have a guild, or raid, and just join adv grps over and over and over and bam you're equipped.  it's the end of the spectrum from purely raiding guilds.  personally, that's all i like to do is raid, kill things, progress, and it's not like i am trying to snipe or steal things from newer people by killing trak trio, but when our time instance is done and all the elemental planes are empty and have enough aa and my twinks are also elemental flagged, what else is there to do in the game?  perhaps why so many have quit.  <br />
<br />
i recently got my shadowknight twink with like 50aa flagged for elementals, and in the grouping i've done there i have been thoroughly owned due to lack of gear/aa.  it's basically reduced him to a puller until i can put more time into the character or get him geared up.  opening up all the lower pop zones to those not having actually done the progression was a bad idea imo, and like everything else it does go both ways.  when endgame people have nothing to raid they will either a) not play, b) play only to raid time, or c) raid old content which many lower level or casual/up and coming people frown upon.  i think in planes of power the gap between high end people and casual/non raiding people was too extreme and ldon has done a good job to correct it.  but to say the expansion wasn't necessarily aimed at casuals is just wrong.  thanks to ldon casual people with no raid work at all can get 90hp+ in EVERY slot whereas before the best you could get was in the 30-40ish hp range and that would require a ton of plat to buy ornate.  it would be quite impossible to implement an augment system and leave out high end raiders.  i really can't see why casual people would complain about ldon, tho if you've ever done a ldon raid you DO have a basis for complaint.  the raids are long, cannot accomodate late people, too small, the mobs have some ridiculous resists (try valdoon time level raid, i land turgurs before 50% it's super lucky chain clicking spear, the trash has 10k hp and like 450mr hmmmm), and the reward is really quite awful compared to what u can get easily from time farmage.  ldon was 99% geared towards casual players this is just common sense.  <br />
<br />
if the elemental planes turn into BoT, i'll be hoping there's some new good exp zones in GoD, because i refuse to enter BoT without fd and harmshield at the ready.  open zones to people that have not earned their way into them or have the gear/aa/game experience to handle them are just a bad idea all together.  /rant off<br />

This one leaves me dumbfounded - who was it intended for then?  Oh I accept that you don't personally like them: it doesn't match what you personally expect.

 How can you possibly have an expansion aimed at the casual player that DIDN'T include the high end player?<br />

If thats the case then there's no need to create content specifically for the high-end player.<br />
<br />
But lets go on to the most stupid idea of all, yet one that I'm seeing time and time again: the idea that high end content becomes acceptable casual player content years later.  The vast majority of casual players haven't seen Sleeper's tomb, can't kill Dain etc.  So lets imagine the following conversation at SOE.<br />
<br />
New Executive: The number of people  playing EQ is declining: what have you got to compete against the latest PC games that will keep our players happy.<br />
<br />
Devteam Leader:  Don't worry we have an expansion using all the latest advances in video game technology.<br />

Dude, its PAINFULLY obvious to anyone that has ever tried an LDoN raid that the entire &quot;raid concept&quot; was thrown in as a complete afterthought in an effort to appease the High End Guilds who complained that LoY brought them nothing but maps and a bigger bank. Its an utter failure. It is, by FAR, the most unfinished and completly useless concept in the entire game. I am willing to bet that there are less than 10 LDoN raids per month on all servers combined. <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I just don't understand your point here Crusty. I am trying to see it, but I just don't get it. Are you suggesting that the high end players have nothing to complain about? Are you trying to tell me that SOE has done enough for the High End player in the last 2 expansions? Are you asking that even more DevTeam time be devoted to the &quot;casual gamer experience&quot;?<br />
<br />
Please clarify your position for me, don't just point at what I say and go &quot;thats wrong&quot;. Personally, I think they SHOULD open up Sleepers and VP. Lvl 65 casual players could easily do stuff there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">The point about LDoN raids is you were claiming that its two expansions since there was any content specifically for ubers.  Well LDoN raids are for ubers, you just don't happen to like them.<br />
<br />
But the main point is that the uber 5% of the playerbase don't deserve more than 5% of the Devteam's time.  If the other 95% of the playerbase have been so painfully let down by recent expansions - and I think they have, reread my post about LDoN - then its time for some decent content for the 95%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">and now to another thing: When do a guild become uber? Is it when they hit ep or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Blazz, the point isn't that casuals got nothing from PoP, it's that casuals got (get?) very little in PoP (esp. at release) while raiders got access to everything.  Raiders weren't denied access to anything artificially in LDoN, on the contrary they received additional raid features and a harder setting that gives better exp and loot. It wasn't until after the zones were opened in PoP that I even had a chance to go after ornate or 63+ spells.<br />
<br />
As for your numbers on % of accounts EP flagged, they are low. [snip]Suddenly, with my numbers, we are getting closer to that 25% mark I tossed out earlier, aren't we (1500 / 14K * 1.5, ok, 16% then, still a significant portion).<br />
Since we don't have access to the database, this is all conjecture anyways, but even if 16% is correct, that's a far cry from the 84% who aren't in the EP's isn't it?  This is the part that baffles me from a revenue standpoint- why game designers would divide the playerbase so much artificially.  You have to provide content to satisfy your most fervent 16%, but this content has to be so different than the 84% (using your guesstimates) who make up the majority of your playerbase that it requires an alternating release of expansions of each type.  Which ultimately causes problems for both crowds.<br />
<br />
WHAT DO YOU WANT?<br />
I can only speak for myself and the casual crew that I hang with, but I'd like to see an end to the entire idea of flagged/keyed zones.  Design zones from the ground up to incorporate instancing to handle overcrowding.  Scalable difficulty of zones with appropriate rewards for all levels of play. Exclude no player from content- this gets the most bang for your development buck.  Give us challenging one group &quot;raid&quot; content- for me this is stuff like BoT wing bosses.  The disparity between obtainable bazaar gear and the best raid gear shouldn't be the gaping chasm that it is.  LDoN was a step in the right direction for the disparity, but I don't see any 125+ hp bp's out of LDoN either with FT, foci and nice stats/resists all rolled into one.<br />
<br />
<br />
High end players have a legitimate problem right now. There arent enough zones/loots to go around.<br />
Casuals have legitimate problems as well, though that second statement also includes us. If I want nice exp, I'm limited primarily to PoV, HoH, BoT or Tactics.  Zones outside PoP, including LDoN, have subpar exp at best.  If I want loot that I'd actually wear I'm limited to LDoN, BoT and Tactics... forever.  I reiterate my point- don't segregate the playerbase! The designers have had years to come up with a solution to this and they're still a ways away.<br />
<br />
Does it surprise anyone that John Smedley wouldn't answer the question in the recent dev chat about Blizzard's WoW?<br />

I would bet if you could dig into the SOE marketing vault you would find that &quot;uber&quot; players:<br />
<br />
1.  Buy new expansions.<br />
2.  Spend more time online.<br />
3.  Have more extra accounts on average.<br />
4.  Pay for extras like SH.<br />
5.  Use more of the game.<br />
<br />
While the above is likely, but complete speculation, I highly doubt SOE ignores the reams of info they have on players when looking to pull in more money.  If you raid, you pretty much have to buy GoD.  That is what Sony banks on and that is why the &quot;uber&quot; players get more than 5% of the devs time.<br />
<br />
The truth is that you can &quot;casually&quot; do every zone in the game with the exception of VT, the EPs, Time, LDoN raid zones, and maybe a couple others.  Raid content, unfortunately, is limited to those zones I just listed above and has reached a point where there really is nothing to do on most nights.  LDoN is not really even an option considering raid sizes are limited to 32 and nearly all raiding guilds exceed that size.</div></div><hr />

At peak we probably had 60 people total. I think the best single geoup we ever fielded was 42 of them. <br />
<br />
At the time we had 3 clerics. Guess what. We never could kill much of the big stuff. But in our day before the Storms and Bot openings we had a group of 24 or so flagged for tactics and Bot. How? The quest flags. And hard work. <br />
<br />
I do not begrudge the ubers thier loot. But I certainly begrudge them the chance to play and experiance the zones. My guild has diminshed a great deal from those days and those numbers. a few have retired and a few others have headed to the uber guild want to bes.<br />
<br />
If sony was smart they would have mechanisims in place to allow people who are willing to get flags with single groups to work for them. Sure they might die in the uber EP zoned areas. But they should be allowed to die there with out the artificial constraint of having 72 people carry your ass to get the flags.<br />
<br />
I have xp'd in tactics while the RZ script was running. Not a problem. We have on occasion killed glykus and even the diaku Overseer. If we had the gumption and the people and all the stars alinged we might even be able to weasle out a win against other mobs. But due to the limits placed upon us we can't. (And our own choices of course)<br />
<br />
And you know what I am seeing. More and more Time level people are slumming. And killing things for cash loot Like glykus and some of the decorin named. Taking a single group or even bots and killing them. Yet we have no way of stopping or even making any complaint known because when we get enough on we have to still look for targets. <br />
<br />
That is why casuals dislike most ubers. It is a one way street. they can come down and deny us things easily and tell us to suck it up. But they don't ever have the shoe on the same foot to learn why and what they are doing. (Nor for some would they care) They just steamroll you and expect you to get out of thier way.  Of course not all ubers are like that. But there are more in that subset than any other.<br />
<br />
If ubers want thier lofty status handed to them with developer time and attention then what about having the developers start Nagafening encounters. (Sorry you have a time flag. You are banished from Bot and below. Any aggro and poof you are ported to Po Tranquility to mull over your obviously superhuman abilities.)<br />
<br />
Wouldnt that be fair? Even Just? Due to your choices you are DENIED access to certain  parts of the game. <br />

<br />
Ubers represent their worst customers.<br />
<br />
1.  A high proportion of them show a total disregard for the EULA, ebaying their characters when they retire.<br />
<br />
2.  They absorb a disproportionate amount of GM time in squabbles with rival guilds.<br />
<br />
3.  A large number of them use exploits when they can (how many times has Furor had problems with GMs).<br />
<br />
4.  They lose SOE other accounts when they stomp all over players in their quest for loot.  You might want to consider exactly why the term 'Uber' was coined for these people, rather than any normal superlative.  Think about the connotations of 'Uber' just for a minute.  I'd be ashamed to be described by this term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I dunno snoww, if the ubers are pharming the good drops for cash lewt, wouldn't that mean that those drops are now BUYABLE for cash?  So all someone would have to do is come up with 100k or so and they'd have the item!  And trust me, it's a lot easier to come up with money sometimes than to come up with a certain item.  Hell, this past weekend I spent an afternoon pharming in CT with a beastlord partner as a duo, and walked away with 50k in profits, as the items we got sold almost immediately and we split the profits down the middle between us.  A couple of those afternoons (and believe me, what we did was very repeatable) and I could afford an ornate whatever.  Maybe you're feeling hosed cuz a pally and a monk duoed Gorenaire and have the CoCW up for sale in the bazaar for 40k.  I say, go get the 40k and get yer upgrade.<br />
<br />
As for your idea of locking everyone with PoTime key out of all lower content, that's absurd.  It didn't work when they tried to do that with the exp system, making any mob below 55 light blue to a 65.  They changed it back to a reasonable number then, I think it's like 52 or something now.  People who have &quot;won the game&quot; still might like to flex their muscles to help lower friends achieve great things.  Deny them that, and they'll cancel their accounts, and furthermore, there will be far fewer people driving to reach the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Heh, dunno how far you can push disregard for the EULA on &quot;ubers&quot; and as for using large amounts of GM time....what GMs???? :p<br />
<br />
Large numbers of &quot;ubers&quot; use exploits?  Proving that might be a bit err, daunting.<br />
<br />
The stomping of others for loot usually involves other people with similar goals.  It really does not do much for a Time guild to go run amok in Ssra or Crushbone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Also, in its current form, the rathe encounter isn't the hardest of the four gods to beat for Time.  I think that distinction should lie with Coirnav, due to time constraints, mass people needed, and difficulty of operating a raid underwater.  Rathe just takes people being disciplined and performing well for an hour and a half to win.  It's pretty straight forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Land, expecting people to pharm thousands of plat to buy their upgrades from Time-geared folks slumming is not a valid method of character advancement in a game.  <br />
<br />
This does highlight there needs to be more high end raiding content though.  But I don't think that would stop the slumming, which I see as a significant problem, and a very reasonable source of frustration for Snoww, especially when you have a lot of idiots who simply leveled up in a rush, glommed into a big raiding guild and then act like they are extra-talented or something.  <br />
<br />
Fundamentally, the character progression gap (which includes gear) is the big problem, as people feel really stymied in progression - and I don't think ldon addresses that sufficiently at all.  <br />
<br />
Let people hunt for their own upgrades, and not have the enormous gaps that now exist and a lot of these issues will improve.  The game would be better as a result.  <br />
<br />
For example, pre-kunark, the top weapon was a Ykesha, and the top haste a Cloak of Flames, although an FBSS was great for most anyone.  <br />
<br />
Those items were accessible to some degree or another to anyone who was intrepid, persistant or lucky.  It's so completely different now.  Getting time access is nothing like getting a yak back then.  &quot;Ubers&quot; got the yaks first and had them longer and that was cool, but other guys would eventually end up getting them too.  When my warrior friend got his first we were all pumped, and basked in his reflected glory.  In the PoP era, that feeling does not happen for a lot of people and there's really no reasonable expectation it ever will.  That's the problem with the current game design I think.  <br />
<br />
You can't turn the clock back, but you can reassess what the current design is resulting in.  Addressing the character progression gap will help everyone - uber raiders included, because finding guild replacements won't be such a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />

Sorry.  there are so many problems with this post that I don't where to start.<br />
<br />
1) Banishment routine = punishment for progressing/working hard.<br />
Sorry not going to work realistically.<br />
<br />
2) Questable Access = no way.<br />
<br />
As of right now, most casuals complain they are STUCK with BoT, HoH, and Tactics because the dozens and dozens of other zones ranging from umbral, to CT, to AR, to Velks, to Seb, etc Don't Offer the Loot/XP<br />
that those 3 zones offer.<br />
<br />
Okay.  Thats true.  But the proposal to quest to elementals doesn't change that same feeling.  Elemental enabled and I haven't xped outside<br />
POE/POF/Sol Ro (post change) in over a year.<br />
<br />
The logic problem that your missing with your idea of a quest.  Is it doesn't change the dynamic that only a few zones are &quot;worth&quot; being in.<br />
If you remove the access restrictions, you have the same dynamic.<br />
Except... WORSE... because instead of part of player base being &quot;STUCK&quot;<br />
in A and part in B... forcible spread out... the whole player base is then &quot;STUCK&quot; together.<br />
<br />
The better answer is to put more zones that are of that &quot;level&quot; so your not &quot;STUCK&quot; and theres more content.   Problem with this is zones MUST be easy to access like POT zones, or you don't get enough people wanting to run all the way to said remote zone.  Veksar for example deep inside is pretty nice.  But who the heck, runs out there on chance of MAYBE getting a group.<br />
<br />
Same sort of revamps are needed at the elemental level.   You need the ability to set up camps and for new members to join groups at a camp, to create a successful XP zone.  POA especially is a wasted zone.  Remove the immunity to lull and the see invis and you could actually XP theere.  POW as well deeper in, has a few spots that would make good camps but see invis problems make it a Bring your own group and fight down syndrome.<br />
<br />
Thirdly:  bottom feeding is not always done for bottom feeding, and isn't just the plane of time people doing it.<br />
<br />
There are a number of upgrades/good loots all over the game that are one groupable.  Even today, Dozekar quest stuff is valuable.  BOT Tower lords drop some very nice gear.  GreatStaff of the Four Winds is a legitimate upgrade for many people in elementals/pot.<br />
<br />
Theres also a challenge factor.  People enjoy the shere thrill of doing the seemingly impossible.  Shaman soloing Loz/WW dragons way way long ago, was based on this.<br />
<br />
BTW if you had 3 clerics/45ish, there are mobs all over the place from Velious Vindi on his 8 hour timer, to Rumblecrush, to Western Waste dragons, to Venril Sathir that were killable.  Even with your &quot;casual&quot; equipment level.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree that more zones would certainly help the L65 lack of solid zone variety, provided they:<br />
a) give exp at least tier 2+ with same risk/reward<br />
b) provide droppable loot that is 75% (just a rule of thumb) of the best gear obtainable through raiding.  Where's the droppable 125hp, +10 all stats/resists, FT2 breastplate? This lessens the disparity between casual gear and raid gear while still leaving a large enough gap to provide incentives to raid.<br />
<br />
All the revamps to Droga/CT/HS etc... did was provide mid level places to farm.  After exploring them once, there's little reason to go back. The risk vs. reward is ludicrous if you compare say BoT to CT- significantly more risk in CT for awful exp and substandard loot?<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW if you had 3 clerics/45ish, there are mobs all over the place from Velious Vindi on his 8 hour timer, to Rumblecrush, to Western Waste dragons, to Venril Sathir that were killable.  Even with your &quot;casual&quot; equipment level.<br />
Mudflation affects even casuals- I don't think any of those mobs drop a single piece of gear I'd give to a twink, much less equip myself.  I enjoy killing my own gear, so that means I'm limited to 1 group stuff or what's in the bazaar.<br />

How many times did you and your two player friends kill BoT tower named?  I see them up A LOT when checking track spawns.  They are one to two groupable.  Hell, a quick LFG in the zone adds 5-8 LFG in BOT around the clock.  So Mr. Casual non-raider I assume you have killed these right with 2 groups or so?<br />
<br />
Truth is, there is MORE THAN ENOUGH CASUAL FIREPOWER in BoT 24-7 to permfarm the Tower Lords.   Why don;t they permdie like the Wing Lords do?  Because most don't want to &quot;work&quot; IE (1) take the time in a row to dedicate to the event (2) put out the effort to organize the various individuals for chance of maybe winning an item (3) chance some failures and wasted time while learning the strats needed (4) look online for said strats.<br />

<br />
Crusty,<br />
<br />
I agree with you when you talk of risk vs reward to a certain extent. The only thing I would point out is that if you raid for 3 hours a night you get pretty much zero xp. You have the frustration (if your guild is progressing) as you wipe on encounters that are new. Some nights you can raid for a few hours and come away with pretty much less than you logged on with. DKP points are usually awarded only on success and bearing in mind that you are bidding against your fellow raiders it is not a simple task to get items/upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am not questioning your comment that you can get far better upgrades in the elementals than in LDON, however I am questioning the amount of time and effort you think it takes to obtain equipment. A really nice piece of equipment in the elementals will take over a month (minimum in my guild) to get. Points rise the more you raid, and the more you raid successfully. <br />
<br />
Raiding is a mix of interest and boredom. Setting up for a raid can be time consuming and annoying. Getting to a raid target can take time (cue earth rings/air avatars). Dropping the end mob can be exhilirating and fun. At any point in an encounter there is the chance that stupidity or something unexpected could occur.<br />
<br />
LDON offers xp, pp, and points. In a month of LDON I would wager I could obtain enough points to unlock a camp or two. I could then go back anytime and get further points for augments.<br />
<br />
As a raider my primetime is taken up with raiding. I xp less and less and really don't get to do ldon too often. I don't begrudge those who are able to get the points in each camp, and have great armor and augments. I simply enjoy seeing others gain good items.<br />
<br />
The only other point I have is that to get to the elementals you have to put in a lot of work flagging. That relies on the members of the guild doing the same events over and over (to get everyone flagged). Then apps need flagging, etc, etc. There is a timesink in getting that done. During all this you get very little xp.<br />
<br />
It's just a trade off with what you want to do with your time. I feel for you not wanting to raid. It's not for everyone. I understand your frustrations at what you perceive to be ridiculous loot for no effort. I simply challenge that it is a lot of effort, it's just not always difficult. I hope I am making a point here. If I figure out what I missed I will edit.</div></div><hr />

All the revamps to Droga/CT/HS etc... did was provide mid level places to farm.  After exploring them once, there's little reason to go back. The risk vs. reward is ludicrous if you compare say BoT to CT- significantly more risk in CT for awful exp and substandard loot?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mudflation affects even casuals- I don't think any of those mobs drop a single piece of gear I'd give to a twink, much less equip myself.  I enjoy killing my own gear, so that means I'm limited to 1 group stuff or what's in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Kudos to the participants in this thread for maintaining civility thus far.<br />
<br />
While not droppable:<br />
I love your BP question.    Heck very close to your example is the Phylactery BP.  Something a casual can do/purchase.<br />
<br />
For roughly 1492+1492+510 you can get a FT2 BP with 140 HPs<br />
<br />
As for those mobs.  I will tell you that probably over half the Plate + Shaman are wearing Vindi BP and thats from a Time Gear.   Pre-LDON I'd have placed it at 80%+<br />
<br />
as for 75% I know it was a made up number but I dont think it was ever that high.  Course now a days, I'd say 75% is very reachable through large amount of PP &amp; selective gear camping.  My shaman for example sits at 6750ish Buffed HPS and he has &quot;Bot&quot; status which means he gets little raid gear.  He's maybe 200ish extra HPs above and beyond what I could get him from a raid.  So say 6500.  There aren't many shaman sitting with over 8750ish.  Granted I'm NOT a casual player and have the ability to camp elemental 1 groupables.    But I'm betting I could come up with a very very good profile entirely 2 groupable or less that reaches 6500 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">The only problem I have with Ldon. Is a very simple one. <br />
<br />
Once you commit to the group you are in. Period. And anyone that gets on after is waiting. <br />
<br />
My normal night of EQ goes like this. I log on. Head to piglet camp in tactics pit. I am the only one on in guild at this time. Or maybe a couple folks soloing. <br />
<br />
About an hour in. One to 3 people get on and ask what we are doing. I holler come to Piglet. They head down. About 30 minutes later a couple more pop on. and one leaves. We keep pulling. Sometimes 3-4 more pop on. And I start looking for something to do. But by then it is 10ish. And I have to crash for sleep in a couple hours. So many times we stay in piglet. or head somewhere else. if time and oppertunity arise.<br />
<br />
Over the last few months. I have purchsed Boatloads of things from piglet drops. Ornate for main tanks and Spells out the wazzoo. I have upgraded darn near every person in the guild with something. Sometimes multiple things if they come camp with me.<br />
<br />
We do go kill Armorer and supplier some. As well. And have a run at Glykus on occasion. <br />
<br />
We have taken time to drop Servitor of luclin. And headed to hate.  We have dropped rumblecrush and Doomshade every now and again. <br />
<br />
We have wandered all the way up to Tallon zek. (Or vallon) Don't remember. And had a uber guild Politly blow by us to drop him. <br />
<br />
We have lots that we could do if we have chances. and we take them when we can. But me as a guildleader reads about GoD with dread. Cause All I see is 32-72 man raids built to challange guilds inflated to kill inflated mobs.  I certainly hope I am wrong.<br />
<br />
Wow I spun off course on that. Sheesh.  I jusy hope SoE can come up with something that is fun for us skilled little guys that we do not have to inflate to have fun. Cause for me Hearding cats. Wiping asses and noses, and telling people they have to do this that and this is not fun. I like the size of my guild and enjoy the game when I have things to do. But the current game and direction are poorly suited to me and mine.<br />
<br />
Oh and for the record. I don't want the time loot. What I want is the Slightly better than what I have step, that keeps my friends playing. That has been lost in the age of 100 Adventures for a buyable Bauble. Or 48 people with 8 clerics monstrosities whose only concern is getting the horde pointed in the right direction.<br />

1. A high proportion of them show a total disregard for the EULA, ebaying their characters when they retire.<br />
<br />
2. They absorb a disproportionate amount of GM time in squabbles with rival guilds.<br />
<br />
3. A large number of them use exploits when they can (how many times has Furor had problems with GMs).<br />
<br />
4. They lose SOE other accounts when they stomp all over players in their quest for loot. You might want to consider exactly why the term 'Uber' was coined for these people, rather than any normal superlative. Think about the connotations of 'Uber' just for a minute. I'd be ashamed to be described by this term.<br />
<br />
ok this is just ridiculous.  <br />
<br />
1.  when people got tired and quit, i guarantee you that if they could get money for their account, they would, at all levels of the game.  it's simple common sense that no one is going to pay for a poorly equipped account of bazaar droppable trash or ldon quest armor, hence you see less people with that type of equipment &quot;ebaying&quot; because there is no market demmand for this type of account.  <br />
<br />
2.  wow, ever been to crushbone or paludal or hhk goblins?  the lower levels fight over mobs and ks/petition all the time.  i was leveling a twink in paludal the other day and someone got angry because we pulled a mob they had aggroed so they brought in their 55 paladin and just slaughtered the whole camp as we watched in amazement.  there are retards at every level of the game.  whereas at the moment the plane of time is quite civil (for the time being).  to make a generalization like this only shows your own ignorance.  <br />
<br />
4.  not sure about you, but when i was a new player there were all sorts of nice higher level people that helped me out.  in fact i bought my first set of scaled mystic armor from a shaman i still see around and converse with in another time guild.  this is not to say that there aren't *******s in time level guilds who train/ks/harass, but then again, there are plenty of those types of people at all levels of the game, to unfairly generalize and blame all of your problems on people that choose to raid and put in lots of their own time into the game is just childish and pathetic.  <br />
<br />
perhaps we should just open up the plane of time to a quest out of crushbone and allow everyone to solo quarm and get all the best loot within a few minutes and not reward anyone who bands together with a group of people/friends to see/kill everything in the game that they choose to.  in my opinion ldon was good in the fact that it bridged the gap between those that raid and those that don't, if i were a casual person that didn't like to raid i would imagine to be relatively happy with it.  not sure about you but i'm not looking for any free lunches here.  <br />

<br />
Time geared guilds on Rodcet Nife are taking down just bout everything they can cause they are bored to tears.  They are farming the Avatar of War out the wazoo in Kael.  Selling the BoC for 700k and such (3 dropped on ascents last kill of him)  Word is that they are working to equip those who are more casual in the guild but when the people who are auctioning brag that they have over 700k in the bank it makes ya wonder ya know.<br />
<br />
The guild I'm in raids bout 3 times a week, our main problem isn't being able to take down stuff (though yes we are still trying on aow and ascent was very very polite about it last time we tried, no sarcasm, it scared me).  Our main problem as a pre-elemental guild is just finding something up to raid.<br />
<br />
The slumming is only half the problem of course considering there are probably bout 5 other guilds raiding the same content working on gearing up and trying to work their way into the elements.   We are usually stuck just doing the bot tower bosses, that is not raid content.<br />
<br />
I understand that the LDoN raids are insanely stupid in regard to risk vs reward, I have heard of some of the top guilds on our server failing them before, and when looking over the loot vs pop loot it just isn't worth it for them.   <br />
<br />
I have no solutions, but this is whats going on.<br />

Wrong.  Yes I accept you think like that.  I accept that the people you associate with think like that. So you and your friends don't consider yourselves bound by any commitment you make.

<br />
It doesn't actually.  How long do you think it would take a non-raider to equip himself to raid-standard using LDoN.  A month, two months?  He needs 2.5k to 3k points per slot to do it.  Do the maths.  Now consider how quickly gear becomes obsolete in EQ.<br />
<br />
Actually LDoN is great for raiders who only need 1 augment on their existing gear per slot.  They can very quickly upgrade every slot.  But the non-raider has to start by buying the armour for the slot and then 3 augments.<br />
<br />
The maths simply doesnt add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">The disparity between obtainable bazaar gear and the best raid gear shouldn't be the gaping chasm that it is.  LDoN was a step in the right direction for the disparity, but I don't see any 125+ hp bp's out of LDoN either with FT, foci and nice stats/resists all rolled into one.<br />
<br />
Once again, I will reiterate, if this level of gear was easily obtainable by the casual players, we would have Diablo 2 on our hands. There has to be a gap. LDoN filled up the gaping hole bewteen the &quot;casual&quot; drop stuff and the higher end gear quite a bit. But if gear as strong as you named were available at the drop of a hat by even the most casual player, why would we bother to keep playing? Diablo 2 is a great game, tons and tons of fun, but it burns out FAST because the gear is so easy to obtain. Once you've seen the content, you have seen the content. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Casuals have legitimate problems as well, though that second statement also includes us. If I want nice exp, I'm limited primarily to PoV, HoH, BoT or Tactics.  Zones outside PoP, including LDoN, have subpar exp at best.  If I want loot that I'd actually wear I'm limited to LDoN, BoT and Tactics... forever.  I reiterate my point- don't segregate the playerbase! The designers have had years to come up with a solution to this and they're still a ways away.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
I will agree with your point that MOST zones should be accessible by all, the RAID mobs MUST be segregated. To allow the general population into the bigtime raid zones would be an injustice to the raiders. There are plenty of asstards out there who would like nothing more than to simply grief people. We see them in the more accessible zones now. There is also the zone population factor to consider. If there are 50 people XPing in a zone, then raiding there is EXTREMELY harsh. <br />
<br />
I would have no problem opening up the EPs if they removed all the raid content from them, and left the XP and the 1-groupers in there. But thats not the case, so I NEVER want to see those zones opened. <br />
<br />
I do disagee with your analysis of zones for the casual player though. There is a ton of wearable loot out there. Nadox himself drops some &quot;Ornate-Quality&quot; items for slots that dont have ornate, and some of the events in Togrins Mines have some damn nice loots. Veskar is a solid &quot;xp vs loot reward&quot; zone, so is Sol C for the most part. The casual content is there, its just people don't take advantage of it. Too far to run, etc etc. Whatever, I played this game before there were any lvl 29 druids or wizzies and we took the BOAT. I realize the goal of many casual players is to log in, run half a zone, get a group, get a yellow of XP, and kill a boss for a GREAT loot in their hour of playtime, but thats not THIS game. Thats ANOTHER game. THIS game has a direct link between time investment and loot reward. Investment in a guild, investment in LDoN, either way, its all about TIME PLAYED.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: In response to Crusty - Lets put the numbers at 15% and 85% shall we? Not 5% and 95%. But lets look at another angle. What percentage of total PLAY TIME do you think that 15% of the population has compared to the 85%? The numbers probably reverse. While I agree that the DevTeam shouldnt dedicate ALL its time to the end-game content, they HAVE to put enough in to keep the people that are logged in the most playing. I have nothing against even the most casual players, but there is LOTS of stuff for them now, and it just doesnt require as much work to keep up with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ubers have access to the best gear.. Why do they still play? I mean they won havnt they? Is it okay for Ubers to play Diablo 2 and the rest of us to play evercamp?<br />
<br />
The gap argument does one thing. It seperates the driven from the casual. <br />
<br />
Ubers consume more content faster than the casuals. and then they bitch to high heaven. Then they, out of bordom, wreak havoc upon whatever. For the challange so to speak. But where is the challange after the first or second cakewalk win. After that it becomes a farm. And when farming the ubers refine even more and make it even harder for the less organized. less driven players to even see, let alone, try any of that content. So the Casuals complain some. Casually. Cause that is what they are. And the ubers Drive the words through thier forehead. &quot;If you don't like it get a real guild. Or quit. More stuff for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have gone after some of the Torgrian mines stuff. And the Nadox stuff. I have been in every zone in the game with the exception of raid only zones so to speak. Adventured and explored there too no less. Even the lower level ones. <br />
<br />
My whole argument boils down to one thing. Give the casuals a way to experiance the content. That would be available to them to consume without the requirement of Everraid. <br />
<br />
People said My little guild would never amount to anything. That when we were Xping in storms we would die and didnt belong. (Well before the opening up) When we were in tactics We didnt Belong either. When we had the audacity to xp and adventure in Dragon necropolis back when that was one of the hardest zones in the game We were ridaculed and mocked by a few. I have never had a family guild steamroll me. <br />
<br />
Only those who were driven. And now with the loot gap so far spread one or two of them can deny things out of boredom for 10-12 of my level folks. <br />
<br />
I know it won't be fixed. And I am not even sure why I am even bothering to type all of this. Other than the fact that it does sometimes Irk me that the ubers who are the loudest complainers about risk Vrs reward are normally the first to devalue, degrade, and denounce any effort to make changes to a sitution that is unfair and slanted towards thier own.<br />

Blazz, we already are playing Diablo 2.  Look at the title of this thread.  Once you've been to Time, you've done it all.  You grind for hours and gain exp and loot, I fail to see how EQ is any different from Diablo, other than the fact that in Diablo I had a lot more fun grinding and didn't need 70 other people to max out my char.  <br />
<br />
And how is raid gear not easy to obtain if you have the contiguous time to commit to it?  At this point in the game with raiding strategies well documented ad nauseum, how hard are most encounters once your guild is at the EP/Time level?  The devs have to make stupidly ridiculous encounters to provide any challenge at all and after you win once or twice, it's farm status and it's just repetitive looting.  Or am I missing something?<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you've seen the content, you have seen the content. <br />
<br />
I couldn't agree more.  LDoN, BoT and Tactics are going to get old fast.  Once I meet my goals, it's delete chars, delete EQ and time to move on.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Blazz, please don't condescend to tell me what zones drop loot that I'd wear.  I read the boards as well.  LoY is garbage.  Does your guild still farm Trak?  Why not?  Probably the same reason we won't waste our time in the zones you've listed.<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS game has a direct link between time investment and loot reward. Investment in a guild, investment in LDoN, either way, its all about TIME PLAYED.<br />
<br />
I agree 100% with this statement, provided it's modified slightly:<br />
Investment in a raiding guild is about exponential rewards for contiguous blocks of time, investment in LDoN is linear rewards for random blocks of time, either way, its all about TIME.<br />
<br />
There, now we're on the same page.<br />

No, it's not a great post for a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
First, he's passing his &quot;time&quot; off as a chore, or work.  That's patently stupid in a game.  If he is only raiding because he wants loots on his character and he's not having fun, his issues are far deeper than the game.  He has fun, AND he's getting loots.<br />
<br />
Secondly, upgrades come very slow once you've ALREADY geared up all your slots.  I used to be in a small family guild type and I'd get like 2 reasonable upgrades a YEAR, and other little bazaar modifications.  The gap is huge, and it's never been huger.  As I've said over and over, there should be a gap, but it's way too big.  Out of control too big.  <br />
<br />
Outside the unwarranted self-pity in Veril's post, it is true that PoP drops on bosses are too few, imho.  60 people spending two-three hours should get more than 2 drops.  <br />
<br />
But a lot of trash loot that drops along with the way is a huge upgrade to others who can't zone it.  <br />
<br />
I do agree that the design of EP zones is dumb in terms of mixing raid/exp goals.  Sebilis housed the Big Boss Mob of Kunark, and folks lived comfortably together - raiders racing for Trak, and others having fun in the zone.  It's good when folks AREN'T artificially separated - I like the Sebilis model best.  <br />
<br />
It was more fun.</div></div><hr />

And yes you get poor exp while raiding, but you can more than make up for that when you don't raid.  A PoTime equipped group can munch their way through an LDoN normal adventure in half the time a casual takes and get double the exp, or else to an LDoN hard for vastly inflated exp, or else do a higher tier PoP zone where exp is awarded at Monty Haul levels.

1. when people got tired and quit, i guarantee you that if they could get money for their account, they would, at all levels of the game. it's simple common sense that no one is going to pay for a poorly equipped account of bazaar droppable trash or ldon quest armor, hence you see less people with that type of equipment &quot;ebaying&quot; because there is no market demmand for this type of account.<br />
<br />
Wrong. Yes I accept you think like that. I accept that the people you associate with think like that. So you and your friends don't consider yourselves bound by any commitment you make. I accept that you have no experience of meeting decent people that behave differently. Think about all that - you may realise what you've proven by your sttement and what you haven't.<br />
<br />
Wow first of all you don't know me as a person or a player, nor do you know any of my friends.  Once again you choose random insults rather than an argument.  i will never ebay nor have any of my friends that play everquest.  real mature to claim to know who i meet/how i act and the same for my friends.  &quot;i accept that you have no experience of meeting decent peoplethat behave differently?&quot;  lmao this isn't even a counterargument, it's just libel, and much appreciated, thanks <br />

<br />
Erm... so people got annoyed because you were KSing? Old habits die hard I suppose. I suspect the real reason they got angry was because you lacked the wit to apologise properly.<br />
<br />
i did'nt want to get into the details about this as no one on this forum should/would care, but let's just say that the gm did witness the paladin harassing us and he won't be doing it for awhile.  i apologized immediately to the individual after taking the exp and he did not accept it, and after speaking to a gm and having him witness it the gm told me that i was not at fault.  end of story.  tho to immediately call me witless and unable to apologize is both false and arrogant.  once again your response is more attacks on me rather than to what i've said, in this case, an example of &quot;non uber&quot; people being just as stupid/disrespectful as the many you claim &quot;uber guild people&quot; are.  <br />

<br />
I met a lot of nice people too. Yes I accept that some of them may have ended up in uber guilds. What in my post says that isnt the case? My post was generalised because I was responding to another post that was generalised (claiming that ubers are SOE's best customers lol): read what I was responding to and try using that stuff in between your ears. What in the sense in this context of saying 'hey I know of a nice blioke in an uber guild?<br />
<br />
the point is, you are blaming a random group of people whom you claim as being uber for a number of people quitting or having ruined game experiences.  to use the argument of &quot;ubers&quot; being soes worst customers and a basis for that arguement being that higher level players destroy the fun and experience of lower level players is just wrong.  i honestly don't give a damn what you think of the word uber or its connotations, but i do care when you blindly describe a bunch of diverse people, both good and bad, like everyone else in the game, as being disruptive, selfish, and even disdainful of others.  when a lower level player sends me a question or asks for a link i usually help out of common courtesy and tact, something that you seem to lack.  i for one, don't stomp on lower level people or raids, and do not appreciate being blamed for your own problems with the game because i happen to enjoy raiding with friends and guildmates.  <br />

<br />
No, that would be as sensible as the rest of your post.<br />
<br />
obviously this was sarcastic, but honestly what do you want?  should time gear not be able to be augmented at all just so you can get gear closer to those that raid for theirs?  <br />
<br />
It doesn't actually. How long do you think it would take a non-raider to equip himself to raid-standard using LDoN. A month, two months? He needs 2.5k to 3k points per slot to do it. Do the maths. Now consider how quickly gear becomes obsolete in EQ.<br />
<br />
Actually LDoN is great for raiders who only need 1 augment on their existing gear per slot. They can very quickly upgrade every slot. But the non-raider has to start by buying the armour for the slot and then 3 augments.<br />
<br />
The maths simply doesnt add up.<br />
<br />
once again this is simple truth in everquest - playtime &gt;&gt; all.  when we talk about maximum gearing, we are speaking of people that play a TON, whether it be raid or otherwise.  if you want to raid smaller mobs or not raid at all that's your opinion and totally your right to choose, but you're going to have to accept that raiding is what many people like to do and collectively it's how people earn better gear/aa/zone access.  just because you choose to play the game differently doesn't make you any better or worse of a shaman or a person, but it really is pathetic to use the simple in game fact that raiding equipment &gt; nonraiding equipment as a means to make personal attacks at myself or other elemental/time/whatever raiding guilds and their members.  there's a difference between discussion and differing opinions and being flat out insulting, and despite what you think i don't intentionally train, killsteal, harass, ebay, disrespect law or contracts, or put down non raiding people in game, and i have a relatively open mind (not that objectivity is always the easiest thing to find) in terms of discussing our class, game, playstyle, etc.  i've wasted quite enough breath on this and don't feel like getting bogged down into intent or semantics anymore, or sink to insults, perhaps you should let go of some of this bitterness and resentment towards those that take a different approach to playing the game and remember we play it for fun.  lots of ways to enjoy the game, i'm sorry you feel so strongly against raiders.  *shrug*<br />

<br />
Bottom line, you know where the loot is. If you want loot, GO GET IT. Earn the points. Join a guild or accept the fact that you aren't gonna get more. Period. SOE will NEVER make it mega-easy to get the best stuff, or even 75% best. Deal with it. Average Diablo 2 account played time, 4 months. Average EQ account, 3 years. Yeah, we play it just like Diablo here, except it takes WORK and TIME here to get the same stuff you can drop in 10 minutes in Diablo. <br />
<br />
I did not make these rules so PLEASE stop blaming me and my &quot;uber&quot; friends for your woes! Especially you Crusty, I cannot even find words to respond to your ridiculously prejudicial and bitter post about how uber players ruin the game. My god man, if the high end players on YOUR server are like that, spend the 50 bucks and MOVE. Sheesh. I got a whole guild of about 200 people that don't fit ANY of your little categories. <br />
<br />
<br />
One more thing for you Izmalis, if you think taking down Bertoxx, Mith Marr or Rallos Zek is as simple as &quot;reading up on the strats&quot; then you are mistaken, and when you start talking about EP gods, the curve is even bigger. This isnt like zoning into BoT, going up to MS, spawning a couple nameds, waxxing them easily with 5 people, and divvying up the loot, man. Getting a whole guild keyed up for VT isnt as simple as shouting &quot;65 shaman LFG&quot; in PoT. Yeah, once you accomplish these things, you get to reap the rewards, or &quot;farm&quot; them. What exactly do you call what you want to do again? Oh yeah, get top-end gear (your 75% number would make it BETTER than VT gear)off easy access 1 group mobs. Well my friend, I suggest you load up Diablo. Wait, you already burned through that one so fast that you will probably never play it again, forgot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">The ubers have access to the best gear.. Why do they still play? I mean they won havnt they? Is it okay for Ubers to play Diablo 2 and the rest of us to play evercamp?<br />
<br />
<br />
Quickie response to this. Average raid night 2 mobs (except now with the overcrowding its more like 1 a night if we are LUCKY). 2 drops per mob. Thats 4 items a night. 20 slots to put items in. 150 people with 20 slots to put items in. Check my previous post too, it relates some. <br />
<br />
This doesnt even take into account the fact that MOST guilds are going to waste entire WEEKS learning some of these events. Took my guild 3 tries to beat RZ, and that was a GOOD result. Some guilds have failed him 5+ times before finally getting it. EP Gods are even harder to &quot;learn&quot;. I dread our attempts at Corinav and the Rathe Council. Thats gonna be a solid 2 weeks of death, no DKP, no loot. But I will do it, know why? I have a goal. I wanna see Quarm dead.</div></div><hr />

yes, it took me 23 saryrn kills to drop the weapon that i wanted, and i think i missed maybe 1 in that stretch.  whereas the casual can spend those months doing quests/exp/advs and get a whole lot of reward as well.  would you actually try to argue that i don't deserve it or that i didn't earn it?  that's months worth of time spent that the vast majority of players are unwilling/unable to commit to get the best weapon for our class, not getting exp, not doing quests or playing a twink, but raiding the same mob over and over again in hopes that it would drop the rare item that i dreamt of.  just because you spend equal time playing doesn't necessarily mean you should be equally rewarded, otherwise there would be no point in collectively grouping to accomplish goals of seeing all the zones, killing all the bosses, etc., which is both essential and indicitive of why so many people still play the game.  if you want a game where all the best stuff is droppable and you are able to get the same gear as those you hatefully define as &quot;uber&quot;, then perhaps you should look at diablo2 and in a few months when you are bored out of your mind because there's nothing to do come back and talk to us.  <br />
<br />
as a side note, i do dislike some of the higher end raiding encounters because they do demand a very large number of raiders, where before pop you could get by on almost any mob with 30 or 40.  vallon zek is a perfect example of this because it's really almost impossible without clerics in the double digits, which make up a disproportionate amount of the player base.  not only that, the entire pop progression basically encourages a larger scale raiding guild, but when you get to some of the elemental gods (aka coirnav), most ppls first coirnav victory is incredibly zerg.  if GoD raids are smaller size this could be a good thing in terms of the raid, but also a bad thing for a number of large guilds that have 150-200 on their roster and have 20-30ppl sit out of time every night.  <br />
<br />
blazz:<br />
obviously you and i agree on a lot of things, but i had a few comments.  when you get to time and finally learn all of the encounters (which is quite fun indeed, the guild i joined had just started farming fennin when i was accepted), the entire zone does become one big farm fest.  the amount of nice drops that you can get in 1-2 nights a week of raiding is amazing to say the least.  i only hope that they fix the instancing so that multiple raids can be in the zone at once, otherwise when more people progress like it sounds to me you are doing, we won't have the same type of problems of overcrowding &gt;&lt;.  <br />
<br />
on a positive note, there are certainly more challenges ahead.  took my guild months to finally get coirnav with relatively open elemental planes (alternated 2 and 2 with same time zone guild weekly and had no agreement with asia time guild), whereas many new people coming up are going to have an even harder time finding him up.  now with a fixed timer and a more crowded elemental planar set to equip your guild with he will prove quite difficult indeed, most likely more difficult than the rathe council.  rathe is the epitomy of what you discussed, it's pretty funny (in retrospect not at the time rofl) to have hours of work erased by someone going ld or messing up and watching the raid wipe in 15 seconds.  i respect what you've said and where you're coming from and wish you good fortune in your advancement.  shoot me a tell sometime would love to chat with you.  <br />

And so we have come full circle to the topic of this post. The EP crowding IS a big problem. My guild has very little hope of reaching Time unless GoD stretches things out a LOT. The reason is that the players have caught up with the content. <br />
<br />
We are not some uber guild that chews through content. We did the progression slowly, farmed Luclin mobs, farmed Ssra, Emp, the on to VT. All this AFTER PoP came out. We recruited gradually, and as we got the numbers we progressed in the PoP zones. We hit the lower mobs a ton for gear and flags. We continued to alternate in VT with another guild. Eventually, we became the 5th guild on our server to take down RZ and enter the EPs. Not the first, or even the second or third, the FIFTH. This certianly didnt put us in a position to farm much of anything. Other guilds were stronger, faster, and we have a horrible time-zone slot on my server. But we percivered and got what molds we could. We contiued to hit VT, but eventually, 2 more guilds became keyed enough to compete, one on Asian time, which sorta dried that up. <br />
<br />
Now there are 9 guilds in the EP on my server. We get even less molds. The Time guilds can't be in Time daily, so they are forced back to the EPs. The new EP guilds are establishing themselves, and many are in a time-zone advantage to us again. Mold droppers are scarce. Even Air is being cleaned out regularly. The result is we are pushed backwards to find raid content for ourselves. <br />
<br />
Does the casual player have legitimate gripes and concerns? Of course. But they are mostly the same gripes that EVERY SINGLE  EQ player has. The high end problem is VERY large right now. We are getting less and less raiders each night because no one wants to kill Bertoxx or TT for the 100th time. You cannot lump all the people who are butting heads in the EPs right now into one big &quot;UBER&quot; category. 9 guilds man. Thats WELL over 1000 people PER server. <br />
<br />
I dont mind being in the Number 5 guild. In fact I enjoy the pace of my guild. We have no real raiding requirements. You earn loot based on raid attendance (dkp). We are pretty close, despite our numbers, and we do not run things like some military orginization or even like some big corporation. You cannot lump us in with the Top 3. You cannot dismiss us as a tiny percentage of the EQ world. I am not Super-Uber, but I want more content added for THEM so they get out of MY way. I am perfectly happy to finish up the game exactly as it is right now. The current content is MORE than enough for us for a long time. But as it is, we cannot even do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">I did not make these rules so PLEASE stop blaming me and my &quot;uber&quot; friends for your woes!

Ridiculous advice: as if moving server is going to make EQ any better for the casual player.  Actually I cancelled my accounts a week ago today.  I don't think of it as me leaving EverQuest - I left EverRaid, the game which some time ago replaced EverQuest.  I would never have signed up to play EverRaid.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you also seem unable to find words to reply to my last post.  Surely that cannot be claimed to contain any prejudice at all, merely a single undisputed fact.  One which shoots down your ridiculous notion that uber players should get far greater consideration than their small numbers would otherwise dictate; merely because they play more.<br />
<br />
One of us is prejudiced yes.  One of us has the following attitude towards the other side:<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems to me that if this is your &quot;play-style&quot; due to whatever reason, then suck it up and be happy with what you get.<br />

<br />
<br />
Fine Crusty. You win. I apologize for the rude tone of this statement. Here is the modified version. <br />
<br />
If you do not like what you are getting out of the game, then adjust your play style accordingly. If you are unwilling to do so, then accept the position you are in.<br />
<br />
Happy now? Will you actually begin to read my posts and take the issues seriously with me?<br />
<br />
Oh, and here is my response to your last remark. EQ is not paid for by the hour, but don't you think that SOE wants to keep EVERY single customer they can? You act as though I am saying that the DevTeam should spend no time at all on Casual player content. Thats not what I said at all. You think I have no sympathy for the problems of the casual player, because I don't think you read my posts thoroughly. <br />
<br />
I understand your problems, man. I understand you have issues with the game. I have a TON of respect for you and players just like you all acoss this game. But a lot of YOUR issues are exactly like MY issues. Right now, though, the BIG issue is the overcrowding of the Eles. Its affecting a MASIVE number of players on all servers, because of the trickle down (as guilds are forced backward in content, it forces everyone backwards). Casual Players got some bones tossed their way recently. Casual players get content EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION! Hell, the casual player gets three times the content out of one expansion like Velious or Kunark than the &quot;Uber player&quot;. This is not puny crap stuff casual players get. There are fantastic quests and places to hunt and items to go after all over this game. <br />
<br />
Maybe I still just don't understand what you want. Maybe I am not hearing you. Are you saying that the DevTeam shouldnt spend ANY time on High End content? Are you saying they should ONLY spend the amount of time in some ratio with the number of &quot;Uber&quot; players? If 15-20% of the games population are spending 75-80% of the time logged in, you damn well better believe that SOE is gonna spend more than 15% of their development resources to make them happy man. Thats just good business, especially when helping them CREATES benefits for the casual player at the same time. <br />
<br />
I am sorry that you felt you had to cancel your accounts Crusty. It saddens me to see players leave the game. Personally, I play this game as much for the social interaction with my friends as I do the game itself.  Hopefully GoD will bring something to the table that will keep everyone a little happy. I think SOE gave up trying to &quot;Make all of the people happy all of the time&quot; a long time ago, as well they should because its impossible.</div></div><hr />

My paladin had the first Soulfire and Firey Avenger on my server, the 6th or 7th FA in ALL of EQ. Don't you DARE tell me I havent put my time into this game. You dont know me. You just want to lump me in with all the other &quot;ubers&quot; so you can point and say &quot;Glad I am not like them, now wheres MY awesome incredile loot&quot;.<br />
<br />
Gee whiz, I am so sorry you dindt like LoY. I think its a damn cool expansion, and I spent a TON of time there in my late 50s and early 60s. Call LDoN what you want, but there are a TON of people who feel it is one of the best expansions ever. <br />

This is one piece of advice on which I can agree with Blazz.  EQ is gone, lost now to anyone who doesn't want to raid.  There's roughly 300,000 accounts out there to which I think this advice holds good: that ought to worry the ubers but clearly it doesn't.<br />
<br />
It took a lot to force me to this decision.  I still have a few friends playing the game, and there are lots more people that I regret leaving.  And theres one more 'person' - my main character - that I will miss after almost four years together.<br />
<br />
For the last week I've been playing Horizons.  I don't know yet whether this is my long term replacement to EQ or not - that rather depends on how WoW turns out.  But at the moment its fun, more fun than I've had since PoP came along.<br />
<br />
It costs just over one week's EQ subscription to buy a copy of Horizons, you get a free month's play with it: so why not leave EQ to what I think is its target playerbase and try something else if you are a casual gamer.</div></div><hr />

My two accounts and all of my friends with their multiple accounts will be doing just that when one of the following conditions occur:<br />
- meet our ingame goals (mostly done)<br />
- WoW is released.  Whether it's incredible or sucks is irrelevant, it's a good breaking point.<br />
- EQ feels like work (this is a killer for paid entertainment)<br />
<br />
I'm irritated by SOE's complete lack of creativity when it comes to design and their apparent thinking that of the 450K people playing, it's necessary to separate them artificially so that only one style of play is allowed to max your character (EverRaid).  <br />
<br />
Simple tips for future MMORPG's that want to include the casual market:<br />
<br />
- artificial segregation of the playerbase is bad.  People want to play with their friends and have full access to all content for which they've paid.<br />
- exponential rewards are bad.  Character rewards should be awarded in a linear fashion based on time spent in game, regardless of play style.  <br />
- All players shouldn't be forced into the same playstyle in a game that purportedly includes roleplaying (yes, I know it's dead in EQ, but it's their claim not mine).<br />
- design around 1 group encounters at worst.  Requiring 72+ people and 4 hour blocks of time is unrealistic for the majority of your playerbsase.<br />
- Truth in advertising.  If your game is aimed at the hardcore, 4+ hour/night person, say so!  &quot;We offer nothing but raid content, online all the time!&quot;  There's nothing wrong with this, just make sure you market the game that way.  At least now I know that EQ2 is &quot;EverRaid Part Deux: The Vengeance&quot; and will steer clear.<br />
- Timesinks are bad if doing them isn't fun.<br />
- Inclusion, inclusion, inclusion!<br />
<br />
And above all else, make the game fun for as many people as possible.  <br />
<br />

Dude, half the stuff you want is already there, its called LDoN. I mean, how much MORE can you ask for? I mean, reward for time played instead of effort in the game? Please. How do you actually implement that? Maybe some kind of points system where you can purchase superior loot, loot that is APPROACHING the best raid level loot in the game? <br />
<br />
So you got LDoN, at least a decent sketch of it. You got LoY, which DOES offer some 1-2 group encounters, just not the loot quality you desire. Guess its not worth it to kill Nadox or the Overseers in Togrins Mines if you can't get Elemental Quality loot out of the deal. WAYYY too much work. <br />
<br />
As for your segregation points, I have to disagree again. There are MANY MANY styles of play in EQ. Some raid. Some tradeskill tons and tons. Some like to merchant and make trades and deals a lot of the time. Some just log in to chat. Some like LDoN non-stop. Some like to make new characters each week and find new places to take them. Do you want to gain Elemental Access? The path is there, you CHOOSE not to take it. You are not being segregated. You are fully capable of doing the things it takes to get to any zone you wish. Don't have time? Cant dedicate to a guild? Dont like to raid? Then TOUGH. Sheesh. I am SICK of this crap from you people, seriously. <br />
<br />
Stop trying to turn EQ into Diablo 2 by having Ele Armor drop off Wing bosses in BoT. Stop trying to make it some form of canival game where you pay your dollar and pull a duckie out of the pond and win a prize. EQ isnt going to miss your 5 accounts, and you know what, I am willing to bet that MOST of the &quot;casual player base&quot; is pretty darn happy with LDoN. People are getting BETTER than VT quality loot without having to spend 2 weeks getting keyed and a month farming Ssra and joining an Emp capable guild. <br />
<br />
Crusty, of the 300,000 accounts that you speak, the &quot;casual&quot; core, how many do you think agree with you? What needs to be done to fix it? Give me some solutions, dont just whine about the problems. MOST casual players are probably a helluva lot more understanding that you seem to be about the difficulty of designing a game that is fair to the casual yet offers something to the hard-core as well. LDON is DAMN close to a solution. What do you want now, solo-LDoN runs that take 30 minutes and award double the points so you can get your gear faster? Go throw baseballs at the milk bottles instead, you win a prize every time you know.</div></div><hr />

LDON isn't effort?  Weird, I thought I had to succeed at LDON to get my rewards out of LDON.  What exploit is used to win at LDON without effort?<br />
<br />
How do you actually implement that?<br />
See how AA's work?  The ridiculous difference in ZEMs aside between flagged and non-flagged zones, AA's are a linear reward.  Casuals don't earn them as fast as raiders, but both wind up with the same results and every player has access, regardless of playstyle.<br />
<br />

How many times do I need to point out that I don't play a pay-to-play entertainment game to work?  If this game is so much work, why play? You enjoy paying to work?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your segregation points, I have to disagree again. There are MANY MANY styles of play in EQ.<br />
Name a playstyle that results in my ability to see every zone in the game and achieve the best gear without joining not just any guild, but a highend raiding guild.  There is ONE TRUE PATH to maxing your char and one only.  Don't pretend otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are fully capable of doing the things it takes to get to any zone you wish. Don't have time? Cant dedicate to a guild? Dont like to raid? Then TOUGH. Sheesh. I am SICK of this crap from you people, seriously. <br />
<br />
When all else fails, fall back on the &quot;change the playstyle of the majority to fit that of the minority!&quot; argument.  Tough will be when there is finally competition and SOE begins losing the casual playerbase in droves.  There's no competition at present, so we're still here.<br />
<br />
Stop trying to turn EQ into Diablo 2 by having Ele Armor drop off Wing bosses in BoT. [snip]<br />
Stop defending the turning of the game I started playing, EverQuest, into the &quot;raid players only need apply&quot; EverRaid game that was nowhere advertised or marketed.  This happened during my time in this game, it is only in the last year or so that it became so egregious.<br />
<br />

Odd, my druid friend just finished VT and between his Talisman of Vah Kerrath (sp?) and some shield he hit FT14 with sick stats.  Took him 2 months of real life time after a year off to go from weak char to having more hps than my sk buffed.  LDON isn't anywhere near VT quality loot- where's my Crown of Ambivalence eh?  I'm more than willing to spend the same amount of time in game as he did in random chunks if it results in the same rewards as what he received but alas, that's not how it works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crusty, of the 300,000 accounts that you speak, the &quot;casual&quot; core, how many do you think agree with you? <br />
Most casuals by definition don't have the time nor the energy to post on the boards as much as Crusty or I do.  I'm simply a fast typist and work on the Web for a living.  So a much higher percentage of people who read and post on the boards will be raider vs. casual, which will skew your results.  Casuals vote with their wallets, as I suspect you will see this year.<br />

Heck, take a rescue mission in Miragul and don't use maps.  Take one wrong turn, and you lose.<br />
<br />
Go charge into a room in Deepest Guk without everyone being ready for the train.  I don't care if you have 10khp, when you have 6 mobs beating on you and dishing out 300+hp in damage per blow, you're going down fast.<br />

And not even the ubers can claim total immunity in things like this.<br />

<br />
Yes, that's right, you heard me correctly.  They wiped to Trak.<br />
<br />
Also last month, a very young guild wiped to Vindi, despite the fact that they had help from several Time-equipped people from another Time guild.  One of the ubers undinged to 64 after he got killed, and quickly went /anon to hide the fact.<br />

Not quite.  CoA to my knowledge extends both beneficial spells as well as detrimental (which is huge).  There is no LDoN gear that accepts multiple foci to my knowledge, and this is assuming the rest of the stats are close enough.  If LDoN gear is so close to VT, why is it I see VT farmed like mad as soon as our server resets?  Probably because it's not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes a lot for any pickup group to fail a normal LDON adventure.<br />
I bet it takes just as much to fail a mob you've farmed 80 times before, barring technical issues.<br />
<br />
Bottom line there's a lack of content for both L65 raiders and L65 casuals.  SOE has simply painted themselves into a corner because of their segregation of the playerbase in that they can no longer release content to please both crowds simultaneously.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">this age old argument I'm sure has gone on since Kunark, when guilds were formed and mobs were killed that dropped loot.  Hey, I'll admit it, I was one of those people that skipped a good % of the games content.  I moved servers at level 65 while 23 AAs, having just barely gotten my epic and not having had raided anything over fear (not even Vindi).  I joined my guild and was VT in a few weeks and elemental 52 days after I got on the server.  Within a month after that I was in Time with another guild (I did help them kill Rathe for their first time).  What does this mean to me.  Nothing.  I missed some content that alot of others saw, but I've went back and done most of it since then at one time or another.  I have all the keys in the game and have seen every zone at least once.  <br />
<br />
My attitude hasn't changed since I got in my guild.  If anything, it's gotten better.  Instead of dreaming of the stuff that I wanted to see, I now got to live it.  This is what I wanted from EQ.  It was my choice to do it and no one elses. <br />
<br />
I think that the attitude of people from each side is horrendous.  I don't personally see why their is such a big problem between the ubers and casuals, but then again, it might have something to do with it.  The one thing that I will say, is that there seems to be alot of resentment towards those people like me who truly enjoy raiding.  No, I don't raid cause I want to be &quot;uber&quot; and want to have the best equipment.  I raid cause I love doing it.  I love intermixing with people in and out of my guild, and I've made some close friends both in and out of it.  <br />
<br />
So, why the hate?  Why does one side have to hate each of the other?  I don't hate the casuals.  The one thing that I do dislike, is that there are ways your gear can be very nice, but it will require time and effort to get that.  Hey, I didn't get my nice gear without time and effort.  I went through 21 Saryn kills before I got my TA (including 13 of them when I was next in line).  I spent 2 months without a chain bp dropping only to lose the next one to someone that logged on once a month and who has since ebayed<br />
<br />
I remember back in the day on my old server when i would see someone from the top guilds, I'd be almost afraid to talk to them.  It's like, if I was in looking for kei from someone, I would ask one of their chanters cause I figured that they would have better things to do with their time than to buff me.  Was almost like they were untouchable.  Do I feel this way now that I'm in those shoes.  No.  I will buff any person that asks me nicely.  The gear doesn't make the player.  It's the character inside.  <br />
<br />
I would rather group with someone from my guild if it came down to it.  It's natural.  I know these people, I know who knows how to play their character.  Would I want someone from another guild if they knew how to play their character even over someone from my guild.  Just depends who that person is.  <br />
<br />
I die on normal adventures just like eveyone else.  I am usually the puller and just sometimes I can't channel to save my life and get smoked.  Happens to everyone.  Bad string of resists and another healer who isn't fully paying attention (always happens to me, but then again, my guild has pools on who can put me in the purple club)  <br />
<br />
In the end, the only thing I can say is, play if you want, don't play if you don't want to.  I enjoy certain aspects about the game more than others.  I don't enjoy getting exp that much anymore.  I do enjoy going on adventures in LDoN.  I love experiencing new content.  I love raiding with my guild.  I don't like tradeskilling, and I don't like most quests.  I do love talking and meeting new people.  I don't mind buffing beggers if they act nice.  I don't mind giving any class a buff, regardless of whether or not I think that need it.  I don't mind giving a warrior FA if he asks for it before we kill a named in a raid, but not if he wants it over the rangers/rogues.  I don't mind keeping 10 people FAed if I'm bored.  I love playing this game, if I didn't I would continue doing it.<br />
<br />
Last thing i will say.  To all those that are extremely disappointed and threatening to quit following the release of GoD.  Goodbye.  I&quot;m not sorry to see you go.  You are the people that have made it not fun for others with your constant whining about everything.  You are the people that have made these boards up their with the monkly business.  I hope that you enjoy your next game.  Me, I will continue to enjoy this game.  I love my shaman, he is my main and I will not stop playing him for any reason.</div></div><hr />

At this moment probably several thousand.  Over the next six months a large proportion of them.  Thats why, while the market for MMORPGs is still expanding as internet access continues to grow, EverRaid's playerbase shows negligible growth.<br />

........<br />
 <br />
<br />
         And that a huge difference. For my  guild<br />
 (absolutly not ubber) , finding a target is very very hard. And pretty often we can't raid due to the incredible concurence.But well it's not really surprising when even potime guild kill 3 years content ,and sometime to equip their alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good to see someone else actually took the time to poke around Ykesha, I really enjoy the stuff there.<br />
<br />
I'm always surprised that Wrank isn't dead more often.  He's quite doable with a group, especially if you have a couple folks with radiant cure, and he drops one or two pieces of pretty good gear most of the time.  That damned tunic is far too common though, and I flat out stopped killing him the time he dropped two leather arms.  If he were moved to level 55 for a half hour corpse, I'd like that a lot.  :)  If they took the tunic and whip off his loot table entirely, that would be just groovy.<br />
<br />
Nadox isn't worth killing unless you have an int caster who doesn't want to buy a Hiero cloak.  That's OK, because he's also pretty easy, I've killed him with a couple of friends just for their int caster alts.  <br />
<br />
Overlord Ngrub is a bit overly nasty with both AEs - either feeblemind OR the shadowstep + AE fire would be adequate in my opinion, or if they'd make the walls there block his AEs that would be good too.<br />
<br />
But he drops good stuff and you can do him with 2 groups, I imagine you could do him with 1 but if you were doing so you probably wouldn't need his drops.  :)  <br />
<br />
I'd also recommend PoM as a very good place for smaller guilds to gear up.  Experience is quite good and the gear drops include some handy focus items and a ft2 robe.  Some of it is NToV/low end Luclin quality and is all single groupable.<br />
<br />
Do you want to gain Elemental Access? The path is there, you CHOOSE not to take it. You are not being segregated. You are fully capable of doing the things it takes to get to any zone you wish. Don't have time? Cant dedicate to a guild? Dont like to raid? Then TOUGH. Sheesh. I am SICK of this crap from you people, seriously.<br />
<br />
This is true, in a sense.  There are currently NO elemental capable guilds on Rodcet who are recruiting anyone unflagged except clerics or bards.  Not sure how that compares to your server, you may have considerably more open guilds.<br />
<br />
It's also currently not feasible to try to do standard progression.  There simply aren't enough clerics around, and when they can easily join a guild that will flag them for EPs and time, it becomes very difficult to keep them interested in progressing on the intended path.<br />
<br />
My solution - I'm levelling a bard, because a cleric is just TOO damned boring and I'd like to see the zones I'm blocked from otherwise.  I'm just hoping I can get there before they reach VP / NToV status - old zones nobody raids because they're too much of a pain and the loot is sub par compared to the latest expansion.</div></div><hr />

There is plenty of game here for people who want to play it. Plenty for people who don't want the very best handed to them on a platter just because &quot;I play as much as the ubers, therefore, I should get the same gear&quot;.<br />

This game was never EverQuest. It may have gone from EverCamp to EverRaid, but thats about it. Are you going to sit there as 4 year veterans of the game and tell me its not BETTER than it was?

Sorry Crusty. There arent several thousand like you. There probalby arent even several hundred. I dont know where you get your numbers, you must be making them up as we go along here. <br />
<br />
You can stop attempting to insult my intelligence too. At least I have the decency to try to SEE your side of this issue. You flat-out refuse to see mine, even the slightest bit. <br />
<br />
Heres your problem Crusty. Your bored because you play 3 hours a night yet you don't raid. You are not a casual player. You are not an uber player. You are not a medium-raider like myself. The category you are in defies description, and its quite likely very very very small.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree its difficult to quantify how many are in my position.  I'd argue its quite a lot, I'm certain I'm closer to the majority of players than ubers are.  And, surely, a player in my category is less affected by the deficiencies of LDoN than those casual players who have less time to play and have worse equipment than I have (unless of course they avail themselves of IGE's services).<br />
<br />
What is beyond doubt is that the uber players represent a small minority - the figure 5% is bandied about here a lot - you might put it as high as 15%, depending on how you define uber.  Either way its a small minority.  Yet this same small minority gets far more attention from the designers than their numbers warrant and whines that it wants even more.  And thats the entire reason for this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">Can we please kill the myth that LDoN is &quot;near VT&quot; quality with less time involved?  <br />
<br />
It's completely not true.  <br />
<br />
I have a Crown of Ambivalance, Shield of Energy and Mask of Dark Thoughts.  The time it would take to trick out LDON gear that is much worse than those items would probably take x5 longer than the time it took me to key up and raid VT.  <br />
<br />
Plus, I had fun doing the quest (for the most part), whereas I think LDON sucks.  <br />
<br />
Fundamentally, frustrated powergamers are more frustrated than ever, and there are stupid roadblocks that are bad game design.  Blazz can go on all he likes, but it's true.  <br />
<br />
Progression should consist of more than farming plat to buy junk in the bazaar (which increasingly sucks as you go along) from raiders who farm items they won't use.  Progression should not require 39485737 flags.  <br />
<br />
The implementation is way off.  <br />
<br />
I am elemental flagged, and I only log on to raid.  I do it because I like it.  It's not work, and whines that it is &quot;work&quot; and &quot;I work harder&quot; are pathetic, and I have no sympathy for it.  <br />
<br />
The game can be better, and it's addressing how it can be better that productive common ground can be reached.  <br />
<br />
I still have fun, but it clearly can be improved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u161"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p161">You know something Crusty and Iz, I figured you both out. You are pure pessimists. The glass is half empty for both of you, and thats kinda sad. You find nothing good about anything SOE has done the last 2 expansions, all you do is point at the bad and say &quot;See, this is broke, fix it now or I am gone&quot;.<br />
Psychoanalysis notwithstanding, as a paying customer it is well within my rights to raise issues that affect me and others like me.  The first step towards getting issues like this addressed is to bring it to the attention of the company (SOE).<br />
<br />
This game was never EverQuest. It may have gone from EverCamp to EverRaid, but thats about it.<br />
EverGroup (Camp?) -&gt; EverRaid is a massive shift in game design and not one advertised anywhere on their web site then or now.  If they choose not to address the issues between casuals and raiders, at least update your marketing.  I won't type another sentence if they at least be honest.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Are you going to sit there as 4 year veterans of the game and tell me its not BETTER than it was? Man I guess you never rode the boat, or XPed with a hybrid, or wanted to go from LG to Sol B and couldnt find a port. Guess you never got a string of gobbly-gook when you turned in a quest item, or worse yet, had the NPC just eat your hard-earned stuff then say &quot;Thanks&quot;. <br />
<br />
Of course the game has gotten better from a game mechanics standpoint.  Where it's gone downhill is forcing players into one playstyle if they want to experience all the content they've paid for and max their character.<br />
<br />
<br />
This game has grown so much, and evolved into a place where almost everyone can find a niche. Its sad that you two can't. <br />
<br />
I don't blame you for wanting to protect and defend your hegemony.  Raiders, as a minority, are having the game designed and tuned around their playstyle.  If I were in your shoes I'd be doing all I could to protect this design mentality as well. I could draw all kinds of real world analogies here when the rules of a system are setup to protect the minority at the majority's expense, but I'm sure your history education included examples of that.<br />
<br />
I still have fun, but it clearly can be improved.<br />
Gart gets it.  I'm still having fun also, but that doesn't mean there aren't glaring design flaws in the game that can and should be addressed by the developers.<br />
<br />
I don't hate raiders one bit.  They're voicing their self interest (as am I), it's perfectly natural and as long as personal insults aren't thrown around, discussion on the subject is healthy.<br />
<br />

<br />
I can't honestly say it has.  Its changed certainly.  We don't have merchants standing on top of huts in EC any more.  There's lots of chrome added to the UI.<br />
<br />
But in the original game there were things that had value in a MMORPG that are now gone or diminished.  <br />
<br />
There was a world called Norrath: now there's just lots of diesconnected zones that you port between.<br />
<br />
There was a wide range of different races with different characteristics.  An Ogre was big and tough compared to a puny human, but had limited access to cities.  Now stats differences between races are dwarfed by the stats available on gear, and we all have access to PoK so who cares about cities anymore.<br />
<br />
To get my gear I'd plan where to go, when to go, how we'd tackle the mobs concerned.  Now - as Landagoran's post says - I'm best advised to farm pp and buy whatever the raiders don't want.  Thats every slot: farm pp, go buy.  Not much variety there.<br />
<br />
If your style of play is to log on and raid maybe none of this matters.  But for the non-raider, EverRaid is a sorry thing indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">Look, you are both misunderstanding me completely. I am not ignorant of the problems in EQ. Of course there are problems. But I have Crusty on one side saying &quot;plan, go, execute&quot; and I have Iz on the other saying &quot;If its too much work/effort, I am not interested&quot;. You two guys are NOT in the same category here. The 3 of us have completely diverse playstyles, and thats just fine. <br />
<br />
Once again, I am not &quot;UBER&quot;. I would place your 5% number of &quot;UBERS&quot; as accurate. I am talking about the number that are being affected by the current logjam in the EPs. That number goes 10 GUILDS deep on most servers. Thats a HUGE number. The high end game has not gotten ANYTHING (please do NOT bring me the LDoN raid crap, ok? Its completely useless) for 2 expansions. As a result, a LARGE chunk of the games population has caught up with the content. <br />
<br />
Iz, I just do not understand your points at all. LDoN created the exact scenario you are asking for. Linear progression based on time spent to aquire gear. One group based, completely accessible to everyone. Is it perfect? Of course not. NOTHING IS!<br />
<br />
Crusty, I will also call you to task on your assessment that the percentage of people who play according to YOUR style is large. Casual play is not defined by 3 hours a night man. That is approaching HARDCORE. Most of the people in my guild play 3 hours a few nights a week. Not every night, though, and thats why we need 150+ active members in our guild to raid effectively. We earn loot based on a linear progression of &quot;time raided&quot; using a DKP system. <br />
<br />
Bottom line here fellas. Its impossible to please all of the people all of the time. The current &quot;raid&quot; portion of the game isnt perfect. Do you think we enjoy backflagging? The current &quot;casual&quot; portion of the game isnt perfect. I understand sometimes peopledont have 2 hours to dedicate to an LDoN run. But SOE is trying to approach a middle ground game where ALL styles of play can find enjoyment. Stop looking at the half-empty glass. <br />
<br />
The EPs are packed WAY WAY beyond the point that ANY expansion has ever been. Period. Its affecting a much much larger percentage of the games population than either of you care to admit. I am sorry the game isnt EXACTLY what YOU want it to be, its not EXACTLY what I want it to be either. But I can certainly look beyond the few negatives and concentrate on the postives a bit, until SOE works something out. If they don't? Shrug, I will be gone as well. If GoD doesnt spread the players out more, then I can see the game shrivelling up at the top end. Will that adversly affect the casual population, which, I will admit, is the &quot;largest&quot; chunk of players paying their 13 bucks? I think so. In fact, I KNOW so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, I'll take exception to this.  I personally play three to five hours a night, all solo or single-group stuff, and I can think of several other friends who do the same.  There are lots of, for lack of a better term, hardcore non-raiders out there.</div></div><hr />

Err, this is a bit of a contradiction for you.  You've argued for people to go and do Ykesha events and stop complaining about them because they're content designed for them, but you turn around and describe the LDoN high-end content using the same wording they have for Ykesha.<br />
<br />
Step back and take a look at that, will you?  It's a bit silly.<br />
<br />
It may not fit your ideal for &quot;something to do&quot;, but it's available to you.  You could always go kill Bristlebane, too, the trigger is up 24/7 on Rodcet and I'd be surprised if that's different on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Hard-core non raiders are most likely less a percentage of the population then raiders.  Lets face it, most people who play 3 plus hours a night on average are raiding.  To try and dictacte game play for the 3 hours plus a night &quot;casual&quot; player would be impossible.  Thats 21 hours of play a week.  Considering that you average $50 RPG &quot;non online&quot; provides 80 or so hours of play, you would need an expansion a month to sastisy those &quot;casual&quot; 20 plus hour a week players.  Hell, I'm elemental flagged and I only play 3 to 4 hours a night 3 to 4 nights a week, maybe 13 to 15 hours a week on average, occasionally 20.<br />
<br />
As for accessing all the content eventually everyone gets to access zones, its just a matter of timing.  BoT, Tactics etc where all opened up.  Even Sleepers Tomb can be accessed by a number of players if you have 12 or so friends (really don't even need that many) and really want to accesss it.  I know alot of people are like oh great content that is a year or two old.  Well thats life, its still content. SOE cannot make all zones equally accessible, if they did we would all quit.  For almost all the player base the concept of improving their toon is the driving force.  Especially those complaining about content either raid or single group.  The grip is the same, people feel that they cannot improve their character to their satisfaction.  If SOE just hands the stuff out the game will not be better.  It will be ruined.<br />
<br />
If you want to upgrade your toon look at some of the quests available.  The marsinger gem, dozer quests, shawl quests...all of these provide what should be upgrades to the non-raiding shaman.  LDoN offers gear some great gear that can be had by all.<br />
<br />
I guess for me the bottom line is that SOE cannot satisfy either the hardcore raiders or the hard-core soloer's/non raiders simply because they both eat up content to fast.  They could possibly satisfy one group by totally ignoreing the other but that would be bad business.  Maybe when some sort of competition comes out who captures one group or the other the game will evolve in that direction but as it is now both groups will have to share the game.  And for those who say that is has already evovled towards raiding, I guess you missed the LoY, LDoN expansions, both of which were primarily geared toward the non-raider.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the big complaint with the LDoN raids isnt the loot, its the stupidity of them. They are obviously last-minute crap added in and completely unoriginal in design. They are nothing more than &quot;10 things charge, can you handle em all&quot; than any planning or strategy. <br />
<br />
The complaint Iz (and others) have with the LoY events isnt the design, its the reward and the accessibility. They don't want to run that far for &quot;sub-par&quot; loots. <br />

When Nixx Darkpaw posted logs and pics of first soloing Ydelma, all hell broke loose and shaman have never been given really remarkable upgrades since.

For the record, I was around when Yeldema was soloed for the first time, not on this board tho. <br />
I might have taken the quote out of context. And that the SK didnt post logs of it, who cares. Everyone knows it anyway now, no? When Nixx Darkpaw soloed Yeldema we were the most overpowered class there was also if you remember?</div></div><hr />

I'd have thought its true for all casual players.<br />
<br />
As a hardcore non-raider I at least had the chance to equip one or two slots with LDoN gear before it goes from poor to obsolete.<br />
<br />
Surely EverRaid is a bad choice of game for all non-raiders now.  And that IS the majority of players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Crusty, I am NOT ARGUEING WITH YOU !!!<br />
<br />
The game isnt perfect. They are TRYING to add something for the Casual player to obtain gear on a linear scale based on playtime. That answer right now is LDoN. And LDoN is ABSOLUTELY better than 99% of the gear you can purchase in the Bazaar, unless you count Hard LDoN tradable stuff like Boots of the Aged Mystic, etc. <br />
<br />
But you seem intent on complaining that your ONLY choice of game-play is to &quot;farm for pp to buy gear&quot;. This is what boggles me. What is your solution for something to do? I scanned back through the thread, and didnt see this question REALLY answered. <br />
<br />
See heres the thing. Good loot has ALWAYS been fairly rare and difficult to get. Most of the loot you want is obtainable by you, yourself, with 1 or 2 groups. Ornate BPs drop in BoT. All Ornate does. Couple groups can take Protos in PoI for helms and shoulders. Hard LDoN adventures are yielding many wearable items, and have the added benefit of increasing your AP pool. The problem is that its EASIER to farm the pp and buy an Ornate BP than it is to go get one where it drops. <br />
<br />
So what are you really asking for here Crusty. Gear better than what you have that is easier to obtain than the current situation of Ornate BPs and Innovation stuff? You don't think that would unbalance the game at all, turning it more and more like Diablo 2, where you log in, do a couple Baal runs, and hope you get that Shako you wanted?<br />
<br />
EverRaid isnt your only choice man. Its just that you have exhausted the other choices you have because you are not a TRUE casual player. A LARGE majority of casual players play 10 or less hours a week, not 3 hours a day. You don't like the next step in your characters progression, which happens to be raiding larger mobs for better loot. I am sorry for that. But the point of this thread is that its TIME to address the overcrowding in the Planes, (which Gates is attempting to do) since they DID address the casual player with LDoN and LoY. They didnt make it perfect. Have they EVER? Has there been a PERFECT expansion? I understand you want more. You will get more, I am sure. I am quite positive the LDoN system will be further tweaked and adjusted. But right now, this minute, the primary concern is spreading out the SEVERE overcrowding in the upper PoP zones. 10 guildss man. Only 1 on Aisian and 1 on Euro, the rest on USA time. I am willing to bet that EP enabled guilds are well over 50% of the accounts logged in any given Prime Time evening on any server, and thats just not acceptable. We arent asking for some perfect solution, we are asking for SOMETHING.</div></div><hr />
