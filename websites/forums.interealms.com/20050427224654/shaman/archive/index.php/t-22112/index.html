<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play a 55 Shammy and my wife plays a 55 Enchantress.  We quit the game a couple years back shortly after Velious came out but we're back at it and enjoying our surprisingly good shm/enc team.<br />
<br />
We're fairly well equiped (thanks to the new bazaar - thank goodness no more EC tunnel!!) and I was wondering if H.S. would be a good zone for us to duo in.<br />
<br />
From a ways back I recall that there are some SK type mobs (skelies if memory serves me well) as soon as you enter the place that HT ya.  I was just wondering if these would pose us much of a problem? i.e are there only 2 or more.  Two I'm quite certain we could handle...(likely even 3 if need be).  As fer strategy - was thinking of me going in first to take HT's and just before zoning in I was gonna cast stoicism on myself.<br />
<br />
Any additional ideas/suggestions on breakin the place would be helpful or further warnings if we should just stay clear...and of course we'd be buffed with Virtue I suspect.<br />
<br />
Other questions:<br />
What &quot;wing&quot; should we go down first?  <br />
Are there any good camp out spots so we don't have to bust it each time.<br />
I recall there being some traps in the floor - how deadly are these?<br />
Anyone recall the spawn time on the place?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips/hints you might be able to pass on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could easily hold the enterance for a while.  This should help you get a bearing on how quickly you can clear.  If you can clear quickly excellent.  You could also head down to the pit area (directly below zone in) and take out the mobs there.<br />
<br />
There are some harm touching mobs, but the enterance isn't that bad.  Last I checked and remember there is usually a skele, a spermie, and a golem at enterance, maybe only 2.  Then there are 2 mobs on each of the wing enterances.<br />
<br />
As for traps, yes there are pits.  The fall itself isn't too deadly, but the skeles at the bottom enjoy having at a weakened player.  Tip for this is to stay away from rugs.  Some rugs are fine, but as a basic tip unless the rug is mostely impossible to avoid or it is huge, it is a trap.  Stay away from rugs and you will avoid 99% of the traps.<br />
<br />
If you want to head straight to the south wing you can levitate over to the enterance since it is a false floor before the door.  Since there is actually no floor there the door is unlocked.  Take note though that there are large wall sized picture frames that are one way walls.  Once you are past them there is little way out other than falling down a hole and running to the port up in the pit or gating.<br />
<br />
As for camp spots I haven't done HS solely as a caster so I have never camped out.  There are a decent number of wandering mobs, but I am sure there are some corners where at most if you log in you will be hit on by only 1 mob.<br />
<br />
HS is definately a great place to explore and I enjoyed leveling here before the 65 cap.  Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the advice - most grateful.  Howling Wolf Stones is where I'll be bound for in no short order...after, of course,  a brief stop in the ghastly Kaesora and a romp through the foul stench of the Sarnak Fortress.<br />
