<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I killed saryn yesterday, finally... the last flag I needed for elementals! So I went to the seer knowing that my flags needed corrections, but all he would tell me was that Tylis didn't know me. So I went to sick bay and said the line &quot;I will go to torment.&quot; The mob said something about not knowing enough about the planes to progress. Unfortunately this was around midnight so I had to get some sleep before work in the morning, so didn't get a chance to petition.<br />
<br />
I did run between the seer, maelin, and Tylis a couple times to try to get this to work, but had no luck. Anyone have experience with this? I'm dying to get into elementals for xp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 things off the top of my head. <br />
You need to &quot;unlock memories&quot; with the seer in PoK. Often several times with her. Until saying it to her, till she says there is nothing more.<br />
<br />
Did you get both flags from Torment? Prior to the Saryn kill is a separate event called KOS. Keeper of Sorrows I believe. Often times people skip this, or kill Saryn and then come back down and do it 2nd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you kill Carprin and Bertox? I was looking through your keys and didn't notice the Carprin event listed. If thats the case you can't finish up Saryrn and KoS until Bertox is killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got both flags from this saryn raid(keeper and saryn) I have had bertox and carprin for a while. again, the only flag I was missing for elemental was Saryn.<br />
<br />
As for the Seer, &quot;unlock memories&quot; told me that I remembered bertox and RZ(I think) and that tylis doesn't know who I am. I'm not at home so can't log in to check the text</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't forget to visit the gnome at the top of the library up the elevator. Sometimes you have to go back and forth between him and the seer saying the phrases you need. Try that. May need to go back to sick bay again after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think that's what I'm gonna try when I get back home and am waiting on a petition response.. just run around in circles between those 3 mobs..<br />
<br />
any other suggestions? I'm dyin here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Make sure you have your grummus flag completed, as it's possible to have Bert without having done grummus.  Hail the Alder guy outside of PoD and say &quot;what ward.&quot;  Make sure after you kill grummus that you port out via the portal in his room.  Then go talk to the sleeping Alder guy in sickbay.<br />
<br />
I can't remember if BOT key is required for Saryrn or not.  I don't think so, but you want to make sure you get that pain in the ass quest out of the way.  Again, make sure you use the cyclone in PoS to zone into BoT, otherwise you won't get the flag.<br />
<br />
Also, try unlocking memories and guided meditation in various orders with the Seer, then go back, hail, and say the tag lines to all the people you need for flags.  Rinse and repeat till it works out.<br />
<br />
You DO have all your other flags, correct?  (PoJ trial, 3 hoh trials, AD, MB, TZ/VZ, grummus, carprin, bert, keeper of sorrows)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You flags are screwed up. To do the I will go to torment you need compleated grummus, bert and terris flags. Untill you can do the I will go to torment your saryrn flag won't compleate and you won't be able to get flagged. Using the god of flag guides at http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13530.topic<br />
it tells me that same thing.<br />
<br />
Check your guided meditation and make sure that you have &quot;Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.&quot; for compleated grummus flag, Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, &quot;Thelin is forever in your debt.&quot; for your terris thule flag and &quot;Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever in your debt.&quot; for your bert flag. One of those will likely be wrong. You can probably fix it by hailing elder Fuirstel and elder poxbourne. One of those 2 is probably missing for a post kill flag. Post back here with your full unlock/guided meditation and I can be more specific or you should be able to figure it out with the link i posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">this kinda sounds like some strange tech support forum for an ISP. groovy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, that may be the problem. I've killed grummus several times, but never even knew of a portal in his room. So I'll have to try to use that portal next time we kill grummus. <br />
<br />
Flags are a ******</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, that may be the problem. I've killed grummus several times, but never even knew of a portal in his room. So I'll have to try to use that portal next time we kill grummus. <br />
<br />

<br />
That isn't it. You DO NOT have to use the portal behind gummus to get flagged. We haven't even bothered to clear to the portal the last 3 or 4 times we've done gummus and people have definitely gotten flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ok, so that's not the problem.. let me run through that list that taraddor posted and I'll see if i can remember the exact messages that I get with unlock memories.<br />
<br />
<br />
Although it was kind of you to help him, Tylis still seems to have no idea who you are.<br />
You attempt to recall your defeat of Saryrn, but whenever you try to focus you feel a searing pain on your arm.<br />
<br />
<br />
I recall these 2 messages immediately.<br />
<br />
And I never talked with the guys about bertox, that could also cause a problem, so I'll try that first thing when I get home. I was actually 2 boxed by someone else in the raid for bertox. I bet if I talk with adler / elder I'll be able to flag for elementals. Thanks guys, I'll let ya know how it turns out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you never did the hails after the raids that definitely would cause that to occur. If you haven't done those hails then your grummus, bert or terris flags are not compleate. The msgs you posted just tell us what we already know that your saryrn flag is messed up. The msgs we need would be the ones for bert, grummus and terris thule. Odds are that hailing those couple guys and unlocking will get you fixed tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd hate to even speculate as to the messages I got about grummus and bertox, none of them even look familiar. I get off work in an hour and a half, does anyone have a way to speed up time? omg!<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Ok, I just went to my guild's message boards and saw a reply to a post I had made there from a RL buddy. He fixed my flags but didn't tell me how. My guess is that he fixed em cause he wanted to 2 box me for an xp group ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Keep going back to the seer and unlocking memories, hailing all the npcs's in the sick bay + the guy outside PoD.  I don't remember the exact sequence of hailing, I think the safehouse and allakhazam have a decent breakdown of the npc's you have to talk to.  I had a similar problem after bertox, and it took me like an hour of running around to get the flag finished.  The seer is a vague little sh*&amp; sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Looks like you missed one part of TT or Bert flags<br />
Bert flags<br />
1.say &quot;What ward&quot; to Alder Fuirstel <br />
2.kill Grummus, hail PP<br />
3.Hail Elder Fuirstel <br />
4.Get CoD lower flag in key rings<br />
5.Kill Bert, Hail PP<br />
6.Hail Elder Fuirstel again.(guess you missed this parts)<br />
Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever in your debt.(complete)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It was Alder and Elder, I hadn't hailed them yet. My friend finished the flag for me yesterday by hailing them and then going to seer, then back to sick bay to hail tylis, then back to seer, then up to maelin. Took him an hour to figure out what was wrong =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help guys, much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
