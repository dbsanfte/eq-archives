<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if there's any place a 63rd shaman can solo for exp.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can root and rot the frogs in PoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes , PoV , some places in PoS , hell PoM and PoG still have dark blues if you wanna go that way . . You could solo entrance to C T , but that would pretty much suck , possible invis and find a nice lil spot , but im not sure it exsists.  Hall of Honor is soloable.  Thats all i can think of off the top of my head at 3 am . I hear PoTactics is soloable , but not sure how good. basicly your going to level faster in a group. But solo is 100% for sure a path that is possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i am lv 63 shaman.<br />
i soloed WCW in plane of valor,outer too,and other thrash mobs there,when i could nt get any group.<br />
<br />
some mobs in POS can be solo also.<br />
<br />
sometime i got 2 blue  bub (aa xp at 100%) per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I soloed some from 62 to 65 in PoV at the caves(Ravenous Subduers)<br />
<br />
Better exp grouped but if for some odd reason you can't find a group, this is a place to do it if the group there will let you pull. 2 blue aa per kill at 100% to aa.<br />
<br />
Can solo in the wastelands of PoV also, but spiders are unrootable most of the time and some crawlers are also unrootable. The procs on these mobs are also incredibly annoying. Other than this area I have not tried to exp any</div></div><hr />
