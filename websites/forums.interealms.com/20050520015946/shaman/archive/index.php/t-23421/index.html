<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I think about the fun I've had in EQ, I'm forced to admit that my enjoyment of the game itself really decreased when I hit 65.  I don't want to explore the reasons for that here, but rather concentrate on the implications.  The EP-raiding-guild experience was infinitely boring (to me - I think it's great that some people dig it), so after a long break, and being faced with the truth that EQ still does hold something that I truly love and enjoy, I'm trying to get back in touch with that.  A lot of people are going to think I'm flat out nuts for leaving behind a couple hundred AA's, EP flags, VT key and gear to start at level 1 again.  I would have said it was impossible a year or so ago, myself.  I guess 3 or 4 years of the same game will do things to you.<br />
<br />
Here are the rules I've made for myself, to try to avoid falling into the same traps that caused me to stop enjoing the game in the first place.  Because honestly, I blame the downfall of EQ 50% on the devs mucking up the class balance and content, and 50% on myself for falling into the patterns of me-too, greed, and level-grinding.<br />
<br />
I'm writing this primarily to get the points firmly in my mind so I have less chance of &quot;forgetting&quot; and running off to the bazaar.  :P  And I figured I'd put it here, because I see a lot of frustrated people who perhaps can find some similarity between things that dragged the game down for me, and what they're experiencing.  <br />
<br />
New server - no twinking, no PL'ing, no asking old friends about what the guild is doing, no links about the gear you're not getting.  I adore my old Xev friends, but there's always crossserver channels if we decide to keep playing.<br />
<br />
No twinking - how many times have you looked up a quest item or flipped through the listings on Alla's, just to say &quot;what a great quest, too bad the reward is so gimpy&quot;?  I'm finally doing some of these newbie quests (the new tutorial is fun if you don't need a pet during the first 5 levels, too), and the starter iksar quest claw is GREAT if you're upgrading from a cracked staff....<br />
<br />
No bazaar - this is basically the same as 'no twinking' except you're using the exaggerated price of tradeskill components combined with mudflation to twink yourself.  At level 5 you can start farming well enough to equip yourself better than the gear you'll get from level 20 quests.  But my point this time around is not to have the best gear in the shortest time.  It's actually to take as long as possible to get the gear I want to extend my entertainment value from the quest.  Or, alternately, to upgrade as often as possible to keep that carrot in front of ourselves.<br />
<br />
Quest, quest, quest or<br />
No grinding - most likely, this will spell the end of the Starting Over Experiment, because we WILL run out of quests eventually (hopefully LDoN is good at low levels).  But so far, these 11 levels have been incredibly entertaining because we've had a focus and a goal the entire time.  Anywhere we hunt, it's for a purpose.  We see new places, go to zones we've never had an interest in before.  We're not leveling as fast as we can, we're not picking zones based on the ZEM (burn in hell, paludal).  Since we still have a few empty inventory slots, ANY quest item is worth doing for them... which keeps us busy.<br />
<br />
No class boards - No reading about the problems with the class in the endgame, balance issues, how screwed our spell lists will be for levels 66-70.  For all I know, I would still be playing and loving my shaman if I hadn't joined a raiding guild, gotten bored, and then read about (and experienced) our dim usefulness in GoD.  I'm not blaming the Crucible, I'm acknowledging that I'm not the type of person who can know that stuff and just get over it.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm trying to remember that I'm not racing to a high level.  I'm not battling to have better gear than the next guy, and my ratio of /played time to level has absolutely zero bearing on my fun factor.  Most likely, I'm about the millionth person to play EQ and realize this.  I, too, have said &quot;there's no WAY I'm starting over on a new server, I've invested way too much time in this character!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how well this will work in the long run, but it's more fun than EQ has provided for a while now.  If anyone else has points to share regarding helping to keep yourself from ruining your own fun, please do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds ambitious.  Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What server are you starting over on?  I've been thinking about starting a beastlord/druid duo on another server to avoid twinking and just having fun.  Maybe we could work on newbie armor together or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh you're already level eleven =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I too have tried this very approach. I've so far failed for two primary reasons:<br />
<br />
1) I'm gimped. When you're the only player running around in half cloth armor and a rusty weapon at level 8, it's easy to get discouraged. You repeatedly used the terms &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, so I'm assuming you have people playing with you and observing the same protocols. That would make all the difference in the world.<br />
<br />
2) Most don't have much perspective on it anymore, but being completely untwinked makes it pretty tough. It's naturally going to be a much slower pace, but I mean it's a *lot* slower. Blue mobs are kicking your butt on a regular basis, or when they don't, they leave you as easy pickings for the next wandering blue. Again, friends help.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the only way I ever see a fresh start working would be on a brand new server with a NOTWINK ruleset. This would involve setting level requirements on *everything*. <br />
<br />
Firiona Vie proved that single character limits don't work. People just get a second account. Rather than doing away with NODROP, they should have made *everything* but crafted items NODROP. Either the role-playing on FV (the RP server /rolleyes) is non-existant, or everyone must have a back story that involves hailing from an extremely wealthy family or receiving a huge inheritance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would add:<br />
<br />
No zones I've already leveled in.<br />
<br />
I recently played around with my first /alt char - a Vah Shir Bard that has been a bazaar mule for a year or more.  I decided to level her up and I made it a point to at least hunt for a bit in every single zone that I had never visited.  I did have 1k in twink gear, and any castoffs I found on my other chars.<br />
<br />
I just started down the EQ Atlas Hunting Guide (http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html) and visited *every* zone that I had skipped with Snapdragn.  I made it to Tower of Frozen Shadow before mobs got too tough for my bard.<br />
<br />
Very enjoyable.  Helped fill in gaps in my EQ history...I'd never been to Unrest, for example.  <br />
<br />
The sabretooth cats in the Pits in Kerra Isle are the only KOS  mob in the whole zone, but everything is social.  THAT CR sucked big time. ;)<br />
<br />
And now, I've been to every zone on that list except 6<br />
Icewell Keep, Dragon Necropolis, VP, ToV, Sleepers, VT)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - There is a guild starting up that is Oldworld only, limited to lvl 51 (52?).  You should look them up, might be a fun group to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done something similar, a couple of times actually, and always seem to give in to the lure of uberness.<br />
<br />
The first time, I was having a blast, but ended up restarting on my own server and powerleveling/twinking myself heavily.  Needless to say, the fun dwindled quickly.<br />
<br />
The 2nd time, I eventually felt the need to 2 box, and though it was on a new server, that just draws some of the immersion away.  Maybe I'm just not a good multi-box player, but I really need to focus on one char.<br />
<br />
I wish I could do it.  Reading your post even makes me want to try it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You didn't mention - but your tone certainly implied - No PoK for Travel or Buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I would try a new game if you've played all the chars. I reckon only a plan like you are suggesting only works on a completely fresh new server. (it would be good if SoE implemented say a 3 month reset server with a varied ruleset)<br />
<br />
By the way, a new game I recommend is the Asherons Call 2 trial. You can have some good fun questing there for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm doing this with a zerker now.  <br />
<br />
Issues:<br />
Hard not to get twinked<br />
I made an &quot;all alt's in guild&quot; request to my members when I made the guild, so I had to follow the rules.  Now they all want to twink my &quot;cute&quot; (how can an ogre be cute?) Zerker.  When I'm not fending off that, I get strangers inspecting me, seeing I'm in cloth and handing me lowbiestuff.  I'm too polite to turn them dow so I pass the stuff off on to guildies and their alts.<br />
<br />
Guildies ninja buffing<br />
I never knew that all my 65 friends would travel half way aroud the world to ninja cast temp on an Ogre killing spiders<br />
<br />
Incomplete newbie quests<br />
Ogre zerker Newbie armor has no Arms - sucked to find that out<br />
<br />
Hunting Zones:<br />
On a previous Alt I discovered Kurn's and Kaesora (I &lt;3 kunark in general) and it's hard not to take my zerker there.  <br />
<br />
Exceptions I have made:<br />
I use bazaar, but only with money the zerker has earned and only to buy quest pieces that have become a PITA to get (example: I couldn't find a thick grizzly bear pelt for one of my quests so I went to bazaar, ooced to sell all the silks and other plts I had on me and bought the grizzly pelt, got some decent coin too.)<br />
<br />
I sell in PoK and bazaar in auction - I won't have him become my trader bot.<br />
<br />
PoK stones and such don't bother me (heck boats are mostly gone now and replaced by maguses[magi?])</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I think someone mentioned, the key is to find some people to experience this type of play with you.  Really, there are no more true newbies.  There are very few low level characters and the few you do see are very likely to be heavily twinked.<br />
<br />
So, unless you like soloing almost exclusively, or have friends that will play characters with you under the same rules, it's going to be tough.  If you do have people that will play EQ with you under these rules, then I envy you.<br />
<br />
IMO, EQ is an old game and it is really starting to show.  For a new and fresh experience, you need a new game.  Personally, I plan on playing EQII.  I think it's due out sometime this fall. I just hope that they have a FV-like server so I can find roleplayers and avoid as many &quot;dudes&quot; as possible.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />

Background. <br />
<br />
65 shaman main, with second account containing 62 monk, 61 war, 58 rogue, (all pl'd by shaman ) on Xegony. <br />
<br />
Started over on the greenest server I could find. Been hearing so much about the wonderful Beastlord being what we shaman should have been, that I thought I would give it a try. This is also a time to share with one of my daughters who likes to play computer games, so she started a cleric on our second account, on the same server. A friend from Xegony also started over with us, as a bard. <br />
<br />
Our rules were a lot simpler. <br />
No twinking for my friend and I, but my daughter is fine with it. hehe. She will take anything, anytime.<br />
No twinking to us means not accepting freebie armor or money etc. from the folks that always want to help us lowbies out, as described in previous posts.<br />
<br />
Scrounging however is allowed. We each have a lvl 1 guy that we got over to Katta to watch for armor left by guard killers. <br />
<br />
Bazaar was also declared legal, but no haggling allowed. (No beating people down on price for newb stuff. We only buy at the posted prices). <br />
<br />
With that out of the way, I must say that it has returned the challenge and fun to EQ. My BST is 21, daughters cleric is 24, and friends bard is 20. We have acquired enough leveling knowledge and abilities to level at a reasonable speed, but if we get careless it's a cr and run back. Scrounging buffs has become fun again. As in hearing on our chat channel 'OMG! someone is MGBing temp in 4 minutes!!! Get to POK!!!!' <br />
With my entire fortune of 300 pp, I sure can't afford to buy temp at 12pp a pop! A free TEMP is the bomb! <br />
We did our first LDON and were thrilled that my daughter won a ac 13, 10 hp shield WITH STATS!!!  hehe. <br />
<br />
We did the newbie armor quests, and just recently started upgrading to Paludal fiend armor looted off mobs. managed to get 1 armor drop for the bard in Katta. It's a <br />
<br />
I definetely support and applaud you at this enterprise and add that I and my little group are having a blast. I have had no desire to return to Xegony and grind my Shaman. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anywhere we hunt, it's for a purpose.  We see new places, go to zones we've never had an interest in before.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, it sounds awfully similar to what I have heard about the WoW leveling system.<br />
<br />
By the way, you don't have to start over to do quest-based leveling. For example, my friends and I are all casual, mostly 60s with a few 50s alts and rerolled mains thrown in for good measure. We have been hanging out in PoHate a lot lately, looking for Ranger/Mage Epic pieces while collecting Marsinger (sp?) quest items for everybody else. Good drops, good XP, fun mobs to fight, Epic pieces, progressively harder mobs to accomodate different group permutations, good company. We also do Droga, getting 31% haste and King/other named loot for the recently rerolled characters.<br />
<br />
Of course, none of us are flagged for EPs, so our expectations are probably lower. Perhaps it would be different for better geared/flagged people. Still, we manage to combine XP sessions with hunting for quest items and upgrades in a way that is both fun and rewarding. And what more can you ask for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did similar... completely different server (I had picked one a friend was on, simply to have someone to talk to, mostly everybody I know from Rodcet is gone), no twinking rule, though she did give me 200p to start (it worked retroactively), completely different race/class combination too.<br />
<br />
Instead of a Vah Shir Shaman, I made a Dark Elf Shadow Knight. He's still sitting at 20, but is great to do something completely different and being able to solo, somewhat, is good to see for the sometimes odd times of the day.  I do a bit of scrounging and such, and have even hit some places I never touched with my bard, or shaman (see: Nektulos, Lavastorm, Overthere), just me and the pet killin' stuff.<br />
<br />
Aside from the occasional temperance I get tossed, or maybe spirit of wolf, I don't ask for buffs, nor expect them, and prefer against them. I originally intended to complete the newbie armor in it's entirety, but after spending 6+ hours a shot only to maybe get one piece, I decided to use the money I originally had (none, the 200p wasn't 'awarded' until later) to buy the pieces I was missing in order to avoid frustration.<br />
<br />
Not flying along by any means, but so far I've gotten 2 characters over 60, and neither of them were really screaming along either. (8 months for bard, probably at least a year for shaman) Generally, I just want to see something new after that point (since it does take a while to 'consume' any content, by the time it is consumed, I really don't want to see it again if I can avoid it).</div></div><hr />

I remember reading it and thinking &quot;Why in heck would anyone . . .&quot;, and then, after the idea gnawed away at me a while, I got to thinking &quot;Wow, that could be SERIOUSLY fun&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">brand new, i was not very smart.  ok, still not very , but working on it.<br />
<br />
i started on Vallon, because it had the lowest population,  kept thinking my toon got deleted when there was a different server with lower pop.<br />
<br />
but i ran a shaman there to 40, and that barb did not put a point into wis.  when the max was 50.<br />
<br />
then Sullon came out and when the lvl limit was 60, i ran a barb shaman to 52.<br />
<br />
then i played the temporary perma death zek, and well, i died a lot.  but, it was fun.<br />
<br />
i had some friends on Prexus and did some cross server trades off the Sullon character to get there.<br />
<br />
starting over is not an answer it is the same as admitting defeat.<br />
<br />
and that is already what i have done on Prexus.  didn't buy LoY, didn't buy GoD, and ain't gonna buy OoW.  heck if Nurga and Droga had been revamped then, i probably would not have bought PoP.<br />
<br />
i don't have a 100 of my closest friends who log on every night to help me get aa, exp and gear.  i try the crappy quests, the bazaar, and the LDoN.<br />
<br />
but on Prexus, i am hosed.  and anyone that starts over, anywhere, is most likely going to be hosed also.  expect to get back flagged?  they do that for Clerics, they don't do that for shaman.  they aren't needed.<br />
<br />
right now i am trying to work a deal to sell for about the cost of the game CDs i have.<br />
<br />
imho, shaman died the same day as &quot;currently being evaluated&quot; became the new catch phrase.<br />

if they aren't smart enough to tell we are broken, then they sure as hell aren't smart enough to fix us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">definitely an extremist approach, but very admirable, even if you don't succeed. <br />
<br />
personally, i can't see myself doing the same thing, but part of that is the fact that i enjoy raiding. however, to balance out the raiding, i spend a lot of time doing things like ldon, GoD trial farming runs, etc--ie...things that are productive in terms of advancement, but allow me to focus more on socializing than strategy. additionally, my SK buddy and i do a lot of 'yardstick runs' where we go back and do things we did on our way up through the levels all over again, seeing how fast or how easily we are able to blow through them. examples are the hollowshade moore war, the TM castle run, doing the throne room in Droga for some aa and the challenge of doing it faster than the last time, etc. <br />
<br />
we're bartenders on PST, so we are often on late and sometimes find ourselves simply not in the mood for BoT, LDoN, etc, so we just pick something kind of random to do, or some mob we want to go beat up for chuckles.<br />

It was a ****LOAD of fun.  People actually *do* roleplay on Firiona Vie (which was a surprise to me) and it's a hoot.  It's probably because I'm two boxing but it's great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks so much all of you with ideas and constructive comments.  Call me silly (been called worse), but there's something about hearing about all of your experiences along the same lines that encourages me.<br />
<br />
To answer some of the questions, I AM doing this with my man - we're duoing a necro and beastlord (I just can't give up slow), in part because we think EQ just has too much downtime at low levels, and this duo really shouldn't have much.  (and so far, it doesn't - it takes a red or a half dozen yellows to make us sit down for a minute)<br />
<br />
We picked Firiona Vie because the one character limit really DOES change things (keeps the population low, apparently), and it keeps us from any temptation to twink, or roll up another alt.  Another benefit of FV that I hadn't thought of is that we absolutely HAVE to get (some of) our quest pieces before the critters turn green.  This can be frustrating, true, but last night we pet-aggro kited a lvl 17-19 iksar manslayer to death at level 12.  We were suitably impressed with ourselves, until his brother spawned and smeared me around the walls of his ruins.  An absolute requirement that I didn't mention before is a subscription to alla's.  Every quest bit needs to be checked for the LORE tag, to know if we need to get it early, or if we can just come back when the constant reds roaming around aren't going to slap us dizzy.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that at level 20 we'll have slightly better gear than now, but I'll bet LDoN rewards will still be exciting for us.  Level 13 now, and I have 3 empty inventory spots, and 4 or 5 spots with cloth armor (or equivalent) in them.  The rest of my gear is newbie quest armor.<br />
<br />
Maybe beastlords are just that amazing, but in general, blue cons cannot hurt me more than my iksar regeneration heals.  I can literally tank blues nonstop and never sit (maybe the necro pet is stunning the crap out of em).<br />
<br />
He's mentioned trying a PvP server, but I know enough about myself to know that the first time some 10 year old punk in his level 65 toon came by and slaughtered my level 12 in one hit, that would be the end of that character for me.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Good point, Snapdragon - we've been hitting a lot of zones we hadn't spent time in before, but it's hard to not trounce through Kurn's a little bit.  I've always loved that place.  I bet we'll play in ToFS, too, if we get that far.  Some zones just HAVE to be repeated.  Call me old and easily amused.  But I definitely want to see if there are any zones on that list that I haven't hunted in.  We should be able to do a LOT of things the shaman and warrior couldn't do when we leveled up legitimately the FIRST time - anything requiring *snare* for example.  ;)<br />
<br />
Definitely no PoK for buffs, I've always had a dim view of buff-beggars (go figure, a shaman), and every plat we earn goes toward the necro spells (mine still cost 5gp apiece, whee!).  We use it for travel, but so far it's only been to pick up water flasks for the smithing required to finish his 3rd skullcap (or fourth?).  I can't believe they didn't put water flasks in cabilis.  Pffft.<br />
<br />
I imagine it wouldn't go quite as well if there weren't two of us (soloing in EQ never was much fun, IMO).  This definitely isn't the solution for someone set on &quot;winning&quot; the game, or seeing plane of time, etc...  as made obvious by the *cough* colorful comments above.  But I can't bring myself to delete my VT loot on my shaman, and there's really nothing to upgrade to save GoD (oh that's a hoot, NOT) or raiding, which is pretty much done for me.  In the words of Mr. Leary, I ate the cookie, I had the orgasm, I smoked the butt.  Done with raiding.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Thanks Blazz.  I'm still tossing the idea of that Morden Rasp guild around, and if this doesn't work out, we may server transfer a couple of toons over to play with that crowd.  I definitely appreciate what they're doing.<br />
<br />
If anything, it's getting more fun as we actually fill out some gear slots, and get used to our characters and how we can make them work together better.  I agree, Haagen.  So far the FV people are - for the most part - a pretty fun crowd.  I'm fairly certain that if we avoid certain zones *cough*paludal*cough* we'll avoid the majority of the powergamers.<br />
<br />
I'm just glad to be having this much fun while waiting for WoW.  Now if they'd just hurry up and start the stinking stress test that we have accounts for......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I actually have a funny story from last night. <br />
<br />
This 35 DE Mage and a 4 WE Ranger were sitting on the newbie log, and my two DE &quot;brothers&quot; were sitting, recovering from a nasty fight or two.  I started roleplaying (ho boy, I can't believe I'm admitting this.. I'm sure Grizlor will give me **** about this) about how wood elves don't belong in Nektulos, the 35 mage was talking about how the ranger was her &quot;protege in hate&quot; etc. etc.  Anyway it got pretty heated (with some tells to each other to let us know we were just playing along) and finally after my necro dinged 4 I dueled the ranger (as she requested).  Well, my pet poofed because the ranger had the mage's DS up, and clinging darkness got dispelled by the mage so the ranger just chased me down and whipped me.<br />
<br />
After I got my wits back, we went back to roleplaying, and dueled again.  This time before we dueled I had to run to Neriak to train meditate on Jaundice (the necro heh).  When I came back, we dueled.  Well, the ranger had that damn DS again and my pet poofed.  Finally I just kited her around, lifetapping as mana permitted.  I was talking to her in tells that it was crappy she got that DS from the mage after we agreed to just duel without any help etc.  She thought I had run to PoK to get buffage (which I hadn't) and so had the mage DS up.  I was almost dead.  As a matter of fact, I went purple a couple times.  I actually regenned once, lifetapped, then a couple guards showed up.. lol.  Starting kicking the ranger's butt, but I got the final lifetap in to get the zonewide emote about winning the duel.<br />
<br />
Man, justice is sweet, and that was a blast.</div></div><hr />

Just a pointer, there's water in Cabilis.  It's in West Cab, over by the Necro guild.  It's a female iksar vendor, I think her name starts with an &quot;L&quot;.  It'll come in handy if you do smithing or pottery in Cab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hail,<br />
<br />
I just started a beastlord last weekend.  Haven't had time to play him much, as I keep getting sucked into helping my friends - I've created a monster with my VP quest updates IG &amp; on our boards and now they all want to do them! :p <br />
<br />
Anyway, I went the first 2-3 levels in the Tutorial completely untwinked, and then succumbed to moving some stuff lying on my Trader over with  shared bank spaces.  Now he's a motley collection of very nice stuff (Fellspine 34% haste belt for example) I've collected with Frekkels (but been unable or unwilling to sell) along with the extremely craptastic (Wu's Fighting Cap) at level 5 that I made myself years ago.<br />
<br />
I haven't yet given in to complete twinkage (like I did with my cleric, which has run me around 3/4 of a million pp so far), but the temptation is there.  :D   I've decided not to do any PL'ing w/ the beastlord, and that's enough of a sacrifice for me right now.  Keeping him on the same account means he won't be getting any Temp from my cleric or HoS from my shaman, and except for the occasional gift from Frekkels he'll be funding his own spells &amp; upgrades.<br />
<br />
I've been considering trying to play Frekkels completely naked full time as a challenge.  It would let me enjoy the rewards of all these hundreds of AA's I've accumulated, and yet make the obsolete portions of the game (where shaman were powerful) very challenging instead of trivial. There was a guild that did something similar way back when on Battlenet playing the first Diablo (after it became a hack-fest), and those folks were a real hoot. ;)   I'm not ready to do it yet, but it is fun to think about doing it. :cool: <br />
<br />
Laughingwoman, I respect and admire your choice to try this. :cool:   I know myself well enough that I don't have the desire or discipline to try it myself.  Rep bump and  best of luck to you!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thanks for the kind words!  As an aside, I've REALLY enjoyed reading the comments people have made via rep from this thread.  Yes, I used to be a little more... TENSE about the game.  I think this exercise has really allowed me to relax and view it as the game it is, and not some kind of freaking contest - where the slightest inequity in the rules is cause to get screaming and red in the face.  (at least in posts, har)<br />
<br />
I've always been a horrible alt-twinker, my Xev slots are full of alts (and half of a friend's account, once I started 2-boxing for a short while) ... and enjoyed it.  But the truly surprising thing to me about this whole experiment is how great it's been to NOT twink.  Your entire strategy changes when you have 300 hp for the fight, instead of 1500.  *grin*  But maybe I'm just masochistic that way.<br />
<br />
I have to say, a beastlord and necro are a seriously deadly untwinked combination.  And hella fun.  Take care, shaman.</div></div><hr />
