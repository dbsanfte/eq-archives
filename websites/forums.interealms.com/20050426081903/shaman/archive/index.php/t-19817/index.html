Lguk and SolB are great choices :)   You could do DL also.  CoM would be good (although a bit low yet for CoM - however with the shammy in tow you shouldn't have a problem).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well i tried Lguk today and it wasnt quite as good as i was looking for so i Tried SolB and it was basically SolA all over again i love it , ill deffinatley hit that up again , And what level can i try CoM ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can stay til 50 or 51/52 in sol B killing the beetles. Some ppl say that Bats are good, but the stun is so damn annoying.<br />
After hitting 50 id do sebilis, sebilis, sebilis. Exp is fast there, a lot faster than PLing in pop.<br />
<br />
Another good place is dulak, mobs die fast and drop gems</div></div><hr />

Never been to solb how do you get to the beetles? Is it pretty small in there? I use a 55 druid to PL my bst twink is he suffice or do I need slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">nah its old world dungeon and mobs hit for 100 max. i used a 55 druid myself for PLing, the mobs have so low HP they die on Damageshield.<br />
Hard to explain how to get to beetles, i suggest you look up a map on eqmaps.<br />
The dungeon is pretty small so shrink is a must (assuming you have an ogre BST). When i PLed my wizzie i pulled 4 mobs, AE em once and let em beat on my druid til they die....very easy. Just have a virtue on you.</div></div><hr />
