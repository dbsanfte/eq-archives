<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild is moving into HoT for alot of our members to get upgrades, but I personally won't get much upgrade wise out of it. Is there somewhere else I can organize a 2 group or so raid of level 58 / 62 people to get anything better loot wise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe the next step along the way is either NToV or ssra - is it not?  We'll be wrapping up with ToV in the next month or so, and those are the two directions I hear tossed around lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">used to be something like: thurg/epics/kunark dragons &gt; hot/UP/vindi &gt; ntov/ST/dain/yeli/tmax &gt; aow/tunare/ssra &gt; VT/seru &gt; u win eq<br />

With PoP, who knows. There are several guilds on Fennin which have barely touched ntov-ssra-st yet they are doing ok in PoP. I've followed the long, slow road -- yet don't have the gear to prove it :)</div></div><hr />
