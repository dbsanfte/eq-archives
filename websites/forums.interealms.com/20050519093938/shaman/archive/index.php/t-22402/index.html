<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silverfawx Bertie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started a Shaman who is now level 42 - Going out of my mind with fizzles. Conjuration is around 140. <br />
<br />
Call me old fashioned but surely if your a Master of conjuration you shouldn't be fizzling your entire mana bar away repeatedly trying to summon a pet or cast a dot.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I actually spent 30 minutes sitting there trying to summon a fecking pet. And I have, on average, 4 fizzles each time I cast a dot which makes me extremely frustrated when grouped.<br />
<br />
This normal for a Shaman? I have played Wiz and Necro and never had fizzle problems like I am having with this Shaman. Every time I see a fizzle now I curse SOE repeatedly - you have to wonder what newbies make of it all coming into the game and put through this kind of mental torture.<br />
<br />
Please advise. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think at 42 your conjuration should be more along the lines of 190 than 140.  Hence the fizzles.<br />
<br />
Summon bread and water for a couple of hours to raise skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cast a low level low mana conj spell repeatedly untill your skill is maxed<br />
<br />
140 is too low</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I still tend to fizzle when casting Talisman of the Tribunal.  I checked and I am only Abjuration 196.  Could be 235.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, it must be Sony's fault that your conjuration skill is too low for the spell you're trying to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i used to get this.. upon reaching 34 i spent ages trying to get Dogdog out, fizzles upon fizzles...why?<br />
<br />
well we dont really have conjuration spells that are worth casting till then... maybe if there spells that were usefull to cast at that lvl and below in the conjuration field then yu'd be ok. However spam casting food and drink shouldnt be the answer - i know i played the game for the game not for the stat requirements that i seem to have to do now, *shrugs* maybe i got swept up in &quot;the vision&quot; a little too much and am paying for it now<br />
<br />
and i find the tali of tribunal a bit of a hassle to cast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, my conjuration was always maxed out,  probably because I was too cheap to buy food/water and always summoned it when I first logged in.   Also, when I leveled up, it was 1999-2000, well before we had PoK books and Magus, so I usually ended up camping out far from a vendor.  Food/Water lasted the same duration no matter what type it was so summoned was just as good as any.   I can see how shaman wouldn't have their conjuration skills high now with no real need to summon anything anymore till their 30's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Formula is 5 + (5 * LVL)<br />
<br />
In my experience, 100 by level 19 and 200 by level 40 in each spell spec ended fizzling. Except for the always present, noway to cure, inherent fizzle that occur 90% of the time when you absolutely have to get that spell off NOW!!<br />
<br />
Work the skills up. Or pay for them with training points. You have a wizard, you have a necro - you should know the importance of skill ups on the casting lines. Having a wizard you should also know, much better than a shaman, the pain of working up conjuration to keep flappy from completely draining your mana bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To me fizzles is a &quot;feature&quot; that they could just as well remove from the game at its current stage. I guess it was really cool when EQ came out that some of your spells would not always work but now its just a nuisance. It certainly seems like a total waste of time and totally unrelated to any skill that you have to cast a low level spell hundreds or tousands of times to max your skill. Its a feature that adds nothing positive to the game it is only a timesink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its tough to mix Roleplay element into the game with time consuming stuff. Mean think of book wizards. THink Merlin just put a scroll in and was ready for the spell 1 minute later? The wizards would suposedly spend years studying lower level easy stuff before they could move on to the bigger stuff. I Know from our end its just annoying sometimes but i would assume that was what it was for. <br />
<br />
Course i also used to think it was cool to travel by boat. Just would be annoyed that boats would move so slow. and be so far in between. I would of ridden the boats more  if they would of shown up more often than 20 minutes or whatever it was. So now we can book everywhere and its cool but seems went from one end to the other in travel. If they totally took the fizzling out might as well take the skill ups out and just cast the same as a person  levels up. Or maybe turn a tome in to keep casting skills moving up but just would seem like nothing to work for anymore as leveling up.</div></div><hr />

Merlin is a bad example. :) Especially considering that, historicly, he would be a Shaman... heh</div></div><hr />

Heh embarissing im a 51 wizzy with a conj of 40, abj of like 90.. conj is such a pain cuz u cant summon food/water u have to keep waiting the long recast time and keep pressing delete</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can't remember the name, but the level 49 Poison DD is conjuration... mine was maxed back when I got it near that level.  I suffered common quad fizzles with it all the way through 54 when I got the new cold DD.<br />
<br />
That's the only spell that's ever given me trouble, except for acumen, but that was because I'd been neglecting my divination... and also, bein a JBB addict screwed my evocation a little.<br />
<br />
That was all quite awhile ago, but I remember distinctly cussing blowing 1.5 bubbles on the 49 DD with max conjuration and at level 53...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can see Divination easily lagging behind.  Heck, I can understand Evocation lagging, but conjuration?  It was always right behind alteration as I grew up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yeah but it took longer to level up before.. now people breeze in levels and dont cast nearly the amount of DoTs as they once would have to get to the same level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What really grabs the base of my Snarflees (*) is fizzling spells two and three times in a row.  C'mon - I am maxxed in all five - I should fizzle about once a month.  But I digress.<br />

Spells to help you raise those &quot;hard to get to&quot; areas:<br />
<br />
Divination: True North<br />
Conjuration: The aforementioned food and water<br />
Evocation: Nuke yourself with a low level nuke. Practice BW afterwards<br />

Feel your pain! <br />
<br />
Sheilds are the only spells wiz use ABJ for. They just don't get cast enough at lower levels to help raise the skill very fast. At the end game though, not having them maxxed causes fizzle after fizzle after fizzle trying to do either Arcane or Maelin shields.<br />
<br />
Before flappy there was no point to CON. Welcome to the introduction of flappy with a CON of zippo - which is where I found myself way back when as a maxxed level wiz. Sucked to be me 8(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pet conjuring spells for shamans are terrible fizzlers. You really need your skills up there badly to do that.  Yours is very low.<br />
<br />
Divination I usually wound up lagging on for the first couple dozen levels, but I am chicken and tend to run around invis a lot, so after a while just constantly casting invis got it up there for me pretty well.  But it's worth working on, if you haven't, because when you need invis, you often need it immediately, or you die.  <br />
<br />
Work those skills!</div></div><hr />
