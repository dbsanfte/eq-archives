<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Drixie dust is really rare.  I spent about 3 hours camping Drixie's nonstop until one finally dropped.  I was hanging out on the shore just outside and to the left of town past the ruins.  I would get alot of adds there but less than anywhere else.  Usually 2 or three would come in and try to assist thier friends but they were easy - all green to my 44th shaman.<br />
<br />
The dust is just a Magic Item, and not lore or no drop so /ooc to the zone and see if anyone else is killing them (my guess would be no but it's worth a shot =P)</div></div><hr />
