<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gabe99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently a 65th level shaman with 55 AAs and i'm not sure where I should go with them now.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I've spent the following so far:<br />
<br />
Innate Run Speed 3<br />
Innate Metabolism 3 (I hate eating)<br />
Innate Regeneration 3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 2 (ext buffs)<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Cannibalization 1 (best 5 aas i've spent)<br />
Critical Affliction 3<br />
Mneumonic Retention 1<br />
<br />
I have 4 unused AAs at the moment and don't know where to go next.  Here's some of my ideas:<br />
<br />
stats?<br />
finish SCR to 3?<br />
the AA that lets pet get buffs with group and mgb casts?<br />
<br />
Where would you start putting your AAs if you were me?<br />
<br />
Here's the link to my magelo if that helps, but this is not fully updated because of the DoN patch.<br />

Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Radiant Cure 1 (best 3aa ever)<br />
<br />
Spellcasting mastery 3 (10% flat stackable mana pres = no brainer)<br />
<br />
Quickbuff2/finish SCR(SCRM)<br />
<br />
Then start defensive aa etc<br />
<br />
I have near 500aa and don't have the pet crap, and have no intention of buying it in the next 100aa or so ;)</div></div><hr />

Agreed definitly finish Spell Casting Mastery Reinformecement first. Thats your bread and butter with Q. QB3 would be my next oen for fast casting Q. RC3 and SM3 then would be the next group of aa. Then like he said start with defensive aas CA3, LR 5 would be my choice can do mitigation after but I would probabably level some more and get some of omens aas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Casting Mastery 3, Reinforcement 3 &amp; SCRM, Radiant Cure 1.  Then Natural Durability 3, Lightning Reflexes 5.<br />
<br />
That all assuming you're capped at 65.  If you get the Omens expansion, levelling to 70 takes priority :)</div></div><hr />
