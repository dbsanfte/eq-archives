I hope SOE realizes that the improved Canni is not ONLY needed by the TIME-Level shamans.  I understand that they DO need it as well, but us more casual players are still hitting 5-6K hp buffed with 3-4K mana pools.  The standard Canni4 just doesnt cut it, even for a lowbie like myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the recast time is fair.  After all, they don't want to give us unlimited mana.<br />
<br />
We asked for a version of canni that we would have to click less to get the same result, and thats what they seem to have delivered.  This one is actually a little better in terms of utility, I think. <br />
<br />
Also, nothing prevents you (that I can see) from using canni4, canniwhateverthisis, and canni5 to get man back more quickly than normal.  You just have to sacrifice another spell slot to do it.  <br />
<br />
I think most people would just replace canni4 with this new one and call it a day.  I'd be happy with that.  I'm tired of pressing canni4 19 million times an hour.</div></div><hr />

I guess you could call that an upgrade :\<br />
But then if you don't have it, what are you missing out on? 15 seconds of group chat time, maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I absolutely can not understand these people complaining about the ratio of the new cann or the recast time.<br />
<br />
in 20 seconds you can cast this once and have 18 seconds to do other things and convert 668hps in to 360 mana and be ready to starty the cycle over.<br />
<br />
In those same 20 seconds you can cast 3 cann 4's and convert 444hps into 246 mana and spend nearly the whole time casting.<br />
<br />
Lets see I can convert more hps into mana with less time spent casting cann and less casts. Sounds good to me. Yeah it's not a huge increase in the rate we can make mana at, altho it isn't bad in that respect, but i's a huge step forward in usefulness since it's less active so we are more able to do other things.<br />
<br />
I mean stop and ask yourself for a second, what makes cann v so awesome. It really isn't any more efficient at converting hps into mana ratio wise than our other cann spells. What makes it so good is VOLUME. It converts lots of hps into lots of mana very quickly. It also happens to have high reuse time. This new spell is moving more towards that model which is a good thing IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Taraddar has the right of it.  Its a nice solid upgrade.  The changes to the slow are also good steps in the right direction.  <br />
<br />
If they replaced the disease dot with a direct heal, I think shaman across the land would be happy.  It wouldn't even need to be a massively better heal.  2K instead of 1300 would be a pretty big step in the right direction.  2.2K (at the cost of more mana or a slightly slower cast time) would be even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get more mana from one cast than you would if you chain casted Cann4 for 20.5 seconds.  How is this bad?  This means LESS CANN CASTING.  Unless of course, you keep both memmed.  That's some serious mana regen after a rez.<br />
<br />
This spell is an upgrade in every way that matters and makes me look foward to GoD just so I can mem this ONE spell.<br />
<br />
As for 3sec recast, lol, yeah, they're gonna give us 360mana a tick regen?  That sounds like a fun game.  Slows would cost what, over 1100mana?</div></div><hr />

<br />
People got exactly what they asked for:<br />
<br />
1. A canni that takes larger chunks of health and returns larger chunks of mana<br />
2. A canni they don't have to constantly cast every 6 seconds (because it's annoying / they have RSI / they're forgetful, etc.)<br />
3. Better renegeration rate.  ACP is ~18% more mana per tick than Can4.<br />
4. Ability to do other things instead of casting canni.  <br />
<br />
<br />
You can't please everyone.</div></div><hr />

  18 seconds is just a long time, youll see what i mean when your soloing and using this new spell and canni4, hogging up more spell gems<br />

I gladly spend those 40 hp more (that's less than 1 percent for most lvl 65 shaman, i doubt you will even see the difference with an active Q running) per round of canni and<br />
- get the needed mana faster<br />
- have more time for other things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">2. Mana Regen <br />
<br />
In the past, cannibalize and our ability to regen mana was blamed for shortcomings in other areas, such as mana cost and duration of our buffs and manacost of heals. With the new and widespread abilities in passive manaregen for other classes, an upgrade to cannibalize 4 needs to be implemented. We are the only class forced into a position where we have to sacrifice so much to regain mana. Most other classes simply use a buff slot.<br />
<br />
* Other classes get mana regeneration methods that are nearly equivalent to shamans<br />
* FT and other enhancements increase mana regen rate across all mana using classes<br />
* Mana regeneration spells are widely available to other classes<br />
* Cannibalize is active mana-regen and has a large number of penalties when compared to passive mana-regen (can't cast any other spells while regaining mana, can't move while regaining mana, cannot engage in any social interaction while regenning mana due to constant clicking)<br />
* Permanent Spell Slot required<br />
* The current Canni upgrade is unsatisfactory and does not address any of our concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* New AA ability for Cannabalize. <br />
* An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana<br />
Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes<br />
* Upgrade Can 4 - bigger bites, less clicking<br />
* New Canni AA - hastened cannibalize<br />
* Can 4 as an AA, to eliminate &quot;greyed-out&quot; spell gems<br />
* CAnnabilize over time spell/AA<br />
<br />
<br />
This quote is taken from the &quot;One voice&quot; proposal to the Dev team. Ceno, what you're saying is strictly in contrast of what we proposed. I would be incredibly happy if the spell went live even with the 18 sec recast. Less clicking for me, more time doing other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">18 sec recast looks really gay!  im sure we wont get another canni upgrade for another three years, should be 3 sec recast like canniIV.

<br />
Why would they suddenly change the ratio?? That's just shortsighted. The new canni is fair. The ratio % is in line with all the other Q's INCLUDING canni5. If you'd read any of the other threads about it, you'd know that 3 casts of canni 4 = 1 cast of ACP and you even get more mana out of it. LESS mashing the stupid canni button is a GOOD thing.<br />
<br />
Feel free to use Canni4, I'll be doing one shot of ACP then doing a nuke to have fun while you're still mashing the ole canni button. <br />

Ya sure we get more mana from it, but not enuff.  In the past three years since canni4 went live out mana pools have more than doubled, so should the next canni.  A good bard is constantly twisting songs and casting, same should be for a shaman.  Like I said this spell is great for bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fezik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This spell is great. This is what I was hoping for in Can6. More mana less work.<br />
<br />
And come on people. You really expect this to have a 3sec recast time? What do you want, VI to give us a 360mana/TICK spell?????<br />
 Its more realistic for you to ask VI to make all our spells 1 mana to cast and 1sec to cast time.<br />
<br />
As far as the new Torpor... Im not that impressed. 60hps a tick is nothing really. Id rather see a 400-500hp/tick for 300 mana or even a group version (hell Id take the slow and snare back to get a group version).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would absolutely love this spell...  If I can get it.  The &quot;Ancient&quot; title scares me, given that one of the devs went on record saying this iteration of Ancient spells are to be like the existing ones - very, very hard to get.  I'm hoping that the spell list isn't complete yet, however, and there will be a non-ancient version that's similar, but not quite as good.  If you take Bane of Nife as an example, with the Ancient version being about 20% better, that'd put this Ancient spell's base version at about 300 mana for 557 hp, which I could live with if I can't get ahold of the better one.<br />
<br />
I'd like it even more if it were an AA, but I won't hold my breath on that. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, I kinda don't like the title on the spell. Thinking back on how long it took me to get my ancient spells.. /shudder<br />
<br />
ancient avatar and ancient scourge only dropped in VT, it kinda makes me wonder if that's where this new spell will be from..<br />
<br />
Actually thinking about it more, I believe I read that Vulak ring would drop ancient scourge, but can't remember for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">RoV does drop ancients, its the only place I've ever personally seen any. We beat it once and got two ancients that were made useless by pop spells (aego and one of the druid ones I think).<br />
<br />
Thats a hell of a lot of time investment for a few spells too, clearing all of NToV then the ring itself. <br />
<br />
Frankily, I think only the current time shaman will see this spell at all before the next expansion. The rest of us are going to get screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I love this version of our canni upgrade. Right the thing we asked for. Thank you dev team!<br />
<br />
Just get +13regen on items and you cover the loss of 40HP over 18sec aka 3ticks. For really fast mana regen just replace random_spell with canni4 and cast new canni AND canni4. In 40sec you can cast about 2x canni6 and 4x canni4 getting 1044mana for 1928hp. Throw in a Q for 150mana to recover the lost HPs and you got 900mana in about 7ticks (almsot 130mana / tick)  When you are FM again drop canni4 and load random_spell again. I really can't see Ceno's problem with this spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So give it 7 second recast or whatever.  The point is, I would like the upgrade to a spell to mean that I wouldnt have to still keep the old spell memmed.  Something somewhere between what the 'new' spell looks like now and cann4 as it currently stands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Wow, the shaman community spends all this time and energy to finally agree on what the majority of us want.  We post that list for the devs, almost instantly get a spell that fits the bill of exactly what asked for (a canni that does bigger bites with less clicking) and it still isn't good enough for some people.  <br />
<br />
Well, I guess some people are only happy if they have something to complain about.<br />
<br />
IIRC when you look at the canni spell progression, each and every one is just slightly less efficient than the previous one, this is perfectly in line with that.  As to the recast time, as someone pointed out, with a 3 sec recast this spell becomes horribly unbalanced, so just accept it.  This is still faster mana regen than canni 4, doesn't block using canni 5, and will be quite effective for our mana regen needs.  And of course..if ya don't like, ya don't have to use it.<br />
<br />
I just hope that they don't mean to make this spell as difficult to get as the other ancient spells, in which case I'd still have no incentive to buy the expansion since my guild is still lightyears away from being able to get the existing ancient spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If they make it possible for a Shaman to acquire this spell without having to raid Time or something equally rediculous, I'll be extremely happy.  It's a decent upgrade (18% as someone noted) and it allows us more time to do other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Ceno, with your gear alternating casts of the new canni and canni 4 you could regain about 5500 mana in just over 3 minutes (2 casts of canni 5)not including scm, mana preservation focus, replentishment, or kei (but including soul clasp).  With chain casting canni 4 and canni 5 you would get around 4k mana.  These numbers are aproximate but an extra possibility of 1500 mana in the same amount of time is nothing to be scoffed at.  In addition, with just ancient chaotic pain and canni 5 and not canni 4 memed you would recieve about 4800 mana in the same amount of time.  800 extra mana every 3 minutes is nothing to be upset about at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">One thing nobody else noticed/mentioned that I personally would love to see changed about Chaotic Pain is:<br />
<br />
Make the casting time 3 seconds so that beneficial spell haste and BoR will affect it.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Make the casting time 2 seconds or less.<br />
<br />
It's a pretty small change, but it would make me happy.  Even with the 18 second recast time in place, Chaotic Pain will likely be our #1 most frequently cast spell (or #2 if you choose to keep Canni IV memmed as well), and a shorter cast time on it would be a welcome improvement.<br />
<br />
I've always disliked how our higher level spells generally take longer to cast than the lower level versions.  Only the devs know weather this is caused by spell haste foci being available, or maybe it's designed to make the foci more desirable.  Either way, we have the foci available, and I would appreciate it greatly if they would affect the spell(s) I cast more often than all other spells.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's a LOT more like what I've been looking and hoping for.  A slightly quicker cast time would be nice but I'm not going to complain, and I certainly don't mind the longer refresh time.  I'm going to take this as a positive sign =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  18 seconds is just a long time, youll see what i mean when your soloing and using this new spell and canni4, hogging up more spell gems<br />
<br />
id much rather have a 180mana/328hps canni that i dont have to wait for, but i guess this spell will be great for you bots<br />
<br />
You honestly believe that the shm class needs a spell that would effectively DOUBLE our mana regen?<br />
<br />
I can't believe that you would suggest that this spell isn't enough because of how it might impact our *soloing*.  Last I checked, SoE made it pretty clear that soloing for xp isn't going to be much worth it.<br />
<br />
What about every other second we spend playing the game?  This spell is almost exactly four chain casts of canni4, which if you think about it, goes by really fast.  Actually, those of us who are completely sick of canni'ing all the time and would like to give it a rest might actually spend some time medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hmm I like it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sunrise_01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Not bad perfect if it was an aa not a spell though :).<br />
The cast time is a bit overkill though.<br />
The 18 second recast is enough imho.<br />
They could make it .1 cast time 19-20 second recast even.<br />
The quicker cast time and longer recast would be more beneficial imho.<br />

Not too bad as it stands though it would be pretty tempting to have it and can4 both memmed which is the only thing I really see wrong with it.<br />
can4, can4, can4, acp. Basically I see that as a flaw as it would up our regen and still be the same amount of work (taking up yet another spell gem of course). Frankly the only way that works is if it grays out can4 until acp can be recast.<br />
<br />
Though I hate giving them ideas on how to nerf it.... that is what really needs to be done for this to be an upgrade to can4 without it being a bit too powerful and giving us the same work out.</div></div><hr />

While I do not agree with the method in which he posted his earlier thoughts, there is a bit of truth to this.<br />
<br />
We cannibalize to get mana back fast, because we do it faster then anyone (excluding the blob enchanters can gather every so often, and necromancers before we get the Cannibalize AA)<br />
<br />
I can see myself:  ACP, Can4, Can4, Can4, ACP, Cannibalize..<br />
<br />
Then i'd be dead, because lets face it, I dont have that many hp right now.  But the general idea is, if you spread Can4s in between it, it'll be even FASTER.<br />
<br />
This has the slight benefit of, once we get our mana back even faster then before, giving us time to socialize after it.  But I dont honestly see it as being less clicking.  It will at first, while people use it as a replacement.  Unless it greys out Can4, though, it'll become a suppliment - like Cannibalize, with a faster recast.<br />
<br />
I'm going to enjoy it, though.  :)  I like the spell alot.<br />
<br />
Edit:  A quick note, though.  It CAN hog an additional spell gem.  If you're in a situation where you REALLY dont want to have to swap gems, or lose one, then this does give you that chance, replacing Can 4.   In this case, i guess it would be a replacement, unlike what I just said.  That thought just came to me. I'm a bit slow.... wise, but not very bright.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Sooooo what Im seeing is that we get another slow that doesnt replace Turgurs so we will have to waste a spell gem on it.<br />
<br />
We get a Canni 4.5 that wont replace Cann4 but is a decent upgrade to take another spell gem.<br />
<br />
No increase in heal so I guess we demem Tnargs to free up one slot for the new &quot;upgraded&quot; Slow and we are even less a priest like Sony is pushing for.<br />
<br />
Where does the other spell gem come from? <br />
<br />
1. root (always)<br />
2. Malos<br />
3. Insia<br />
4. Turgurs<br />
5. Lamer eerrrr &quot;upgraded slow&quot;<br />
6. Quen<br />
7. Cann 4<br />
8. Newk or Bane or buff slot....<br />
<br />
So looks like I replace 8 with the new canni.... but um what do I need a new canni for when I cant mem any dots or DD because Sony doesnt have a clue how to actually upgrade...<br />
<br />
Upgrade = REPLACE <br />
<br />
Im so tired of this nominal ****... add neg mod to a inferior slow and call it a upgrade.... Make canni more mana for more hps but give it a recast of 18seconds......<br />
<br />
Come one already... Havent we suffered enough through the last 5 expansions for our godly Kunark times? Just ****ing make the spells upgrades or leave it alone and add level 65 BSTs to everyones accounts..... <br />
<br />
That makes about the same sense as giving us 2 new spells that arent capable of replaceing the 5 expansion old ones we use now...<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Sorry but dam Im over the edge about those asshats at sony.</div></div><hr />

You guys wanna take up another spell gem to have em both memmed then you can, you have a choice. I'd much rather cast this once, then canni4, four times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">If you plan to have both memmed and be twisting the two spells, canni4 and acp, then what is the point of using acp for even more mana when you will still be too busy canni'ing to spend the extra mana?<br />
<br />
The way acp is I wouldn't mem canni4 ever again unless I was recovering mana after a rez, assuming 8 spell gem slots.</div></div><hr />

Why wouldn't you replace cann with the new spell? Just because you can't chain cast it and do nothing else while gaining mana? ACP is currently more hps converted over time than cann 4 with significantly less time spent actually casting. As it stands it's a HUGE upgrade and total replacement. Sure you can't chain cast it but Big fing deal. You don't need to chain cast it and thats what makes it so good.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain<br />
668hps converted into 360 mana.<br />
Total time including recast ~20 seconds.<br />
Time actually spend casting 2.5 second.<br />
<br />
Cann 4<br />
4 casts of cann 4<br />
592hps converted into 328 mana<br />
Total casting time ~22 seconds<br />
Time actually spend casting? ALL OF IT<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see i can convert 668hps into 360 mana every 20 seconds spending 2 and a half seconds actually casting leaving me 18 seconds to cast other things OR i can do nothing but chain cast cann 4 and convert 592hps into 328 mana in a little bit longer time. I'll go with 1 cast for more hps over the same period of time thank you very much. <br />
<br />
Sure you can get a bit more mana regen by getting 3 casts of cann 4 inbetween cast of ACP but is that really needed? ACP is already bit of an upgrade on the mana regen rate side of things and it a whole lot less clicking and time spent gaining mana. Sure I might mem both of them in a post res in a hurry situation but for normal usage ACP will replace cann 4 in my spell line up no question.</div></div><hr />

ACP is not a bot spell by any means.</div></div><hr />
