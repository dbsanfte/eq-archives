<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wet through other ent so im at normal one, still adivice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">try the hunting forums - I was 50 when Luclin came out.  in Echo I hunted the taskmaster and later the archer/scounds<br />
<br />
both not good choices at yer level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok, i've decided to head to DL for the mo to get some plat for 44 spells but the exp in echo is good exp from underbulks. ATM they're not too easy so i'll try them when i'm 44.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can get a mellee partner or are very good at soloing and have the hp to take some 300damage nukes the acrylia mines in tem mnts are awesome exp up to 43-44 and very good money drops for those levels too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmmm... 40 is perhaps a touch low to solo on the taskmaster side, but maybe not. I could solo there from 43ish on, but I remember that the mobs (underbulks, stonegrabbers, lizard-looking things) were a bit tough. After 44, they got much easier, due to the upgraded ice nuke and pet. I was purposely tanking each one, trying to finish maxxing out my defense skill, so maybe the fights weren't that hard, but I can't remember. I do know that the new spells at 44 made the fights much easier. At 45, I was able to use my JBB and well, that made the fights trivial. The 44 pet CAN tank them, if fully buffed, so you don't have to, but depending on your playstyle, defense skill, you may want to. They hit pretty quickly but not too hard. In comparison, a HG hits harder but a seafury cyclops hits more weakly. They will stay dark blue to you until high 40s. By then, though, you may be ready to single pull the skellies from the taskmaster room. You can stay in echo until 51 or so, if you like, but hehe, that may get a bit boring to you. The exp is good, especially considering the difficulty of the mobs. The only mob to really be careful of is Xil something or other. He's a high 50s chanty mob. If he's up, kill somewhere else. ;) He despawns after 15-20 minutes. Also, be careful of a named underbulk, Fireclaw. He hits hard and fast and, while he can be slowed, he can NOT be rooted. I like echo. When I was hunting there, it was usually empty, so you could hunt as many mobs as you could handle. More people have discovered it on my server now it seems, so not sure how good it will be for you. Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Echo is a great place to xp. I first discovered it after a Kaesora raid. My Cleric was 46 at the time and went there to try and get shissar organs off taskmaster. I ended up grouping with an iksar SK and was amazed at the xp we got.<br />
<br />
When I worked on Getan I did most of 25-50 in Echo. First on the easy side killing needlites and raising my defence. Then on the hard side killing underbulks and eventualy moving up to the TM room. Getan camped the TM room for 3 solid weeks and collected enougth organs off the TM to get his EB device. One of the most exciting experiences he had was camping the TM with another shaman we played Ping Pong with the TM. First one shaman got agro then the other shaman would nuke and get agro back and vice versa. Meanwhile our pets would nibble away at the TM till he keeled over.<br />
<br />
Now my cleric is back in echo killing archers for aaxp. Sometimes he will group with a druid or a shaman and kill scounds while waiting for the archers to respawn.</div></div><hr />
