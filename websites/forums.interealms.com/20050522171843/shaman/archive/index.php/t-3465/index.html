<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gone through to spell casting reinforcement mastery (20 pts).<br />
<br />
I'm planning on getting at least Quickbuff Level 2 (9 pts).<br />
<br />
Primary reason:  Torpor.  The longer lasting, faster casting buffs are nice.   But the real reason these skills increase our power as shamans is Torpor.<br />
<br />
To me this is a &quot;too many eggs in one basket&quot; type of scenario.  <br />
<br />
I dislike that the primary benefit of at least two of our AA skills is focused on one spell.  Someone with Maxxed mastery and maxxed quickbuff would have put 38 AA's into skills primarily for one spell.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the carnage if Verant swings the nerf-bat at AA skills influencing torpor?  It just makes me nervous....<br />
<br />
Thought I'd share.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would be rather bitter if they do that.<br />
<br />
But truth be told, 3 second torpor isn't incredibly overpowered, considering that the cleric CE is 4.0 base cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Other classes have more visible AA skills that are on the &quot;nerf rumor mill&quot;, Manaburn being the biggest example at the moment.<br />
<br />
To me, 38 aa points to get a 3 sec cast, 1800 hp heal over 36 seconds isn't overpowering. I plan on getting Quick Buff to 2 and Reinfocement Mastery myself since I feel it's one of our best options. The big downside to reinforement is it doesn't work on any group spells.<br />
<br />
But yeah, torpor being a heal and not a buff makes me a little nervous about the whole thing as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd be suprised if MB gets nerfed.  I think it is hugely powerfull but has enough drawbacks to not make it too powerfull.  Team MB going out &amp; taking out uber mobs could easily have been predicted and VI made the decision to let it go anyhow.  You _do_ realize that if a Wizard just nukes with normal spells they will out-damage MB barring the critical blast?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">keep in mind a QBlvl2 + a focus item w/ enhacnement haste = QB3 <br />
<br />
<br />
 man i would love to have those 9 points back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Except for Torpor, which is the only reason why I'm pursuing Quickbuff.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste 3 + Quickbuff 2 nearly caps it, but I don't have spell haste 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm working on Spell Casting Mastery lately.  <br />
I've just grown entirely impatient with fizzle rates on Torrent of Poison which is my primary damage spell in a fairly fast paced 3 to 6 person group.  I have the mana to cast it, that's not the problem.  The problem is having it fizzle 2 or 3 times in a row and burn off my mana that way.  And yes, I have max evocation.  It's also annoying to fizzle a spell that you desperately needed to go off to save yourself.  If you are trying to channel it and can't even successfully cast it . . . well you're wasting precious seconds and might just wind up dragonbait.  <br />
<br />
The savings in mana per spell cast seem to justify this approach for me as well.  <br />
<br />
SCM1 and rising.  Might do Quickbuff2 at some point too, have to see how I feel when I have SCM2 and 6 points in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey, Landragoran, do you know how SCM AA skill stacks with the Mana Conservation III focus item?<br />
<br />
After doing the Quickbuff, I plan on working on spell casting mastery next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep that is so lame, ah well</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you mean group buffs like focus etc, your wrong it does.</div></div><hr />
