<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Monday night on Bertoxx an odd little gnome named Ognit Eznertob appeared in the wizard spires in DL, the ones you port to. He was telling us of how The Wizard Al'Kabor had become lost again. He was determined to help his master. So he gather what notes and books he had from their research and set to recreate his experiments. So he gather what notes and books he had from their research and set to recreate his experiments. There were only a phew of us there when he started to lead us to the Wizard Spires above the pyramid in the large complex. He chose 4 people to chnnel the energy to hopefully open the portal to find Al'Kabor. Congrats to Hithlain, Rapturian, Gorelon, and Cornwallis. <br />
<br />
Ognit's first attempt was flawed and everyone started catching 100dd single debuff knockbacks from &quot;a storm&quot; that had created it self in the spires. We discovered from the shouts they had started poping all over the place and had killed many people. Ognit graciously used his magic to rezz the slain. With that completed he got an idea, why not channel the power of the storms to help, by this time several people had shown up to watch. He gave each of the 4 a crystal of power and a rune to ward the storms. We all moved to the larger spires in the complex. He then tried the spells again and they worked. The clouds darkened, the sky went black and the storms raged. <br />
<br />
However through all this a dark portal opened in the center and shadow like creatues appeared out of it. Ognit screamed that he would not go back there and ran. We all feared for him. That is when Al'Kabor's Assistant Magril (?) showed up. Then by all doubts Al'Kabor himself was ported into the spires from the portal. He was furious that such trouble had been caused and ordered the four to help him stop it. He channelled the magic from debuffs he asked everyone to cast and the storms started to dispell. He then spoke with the chosen 4 of why they helped Ognit and upon explaining their endeavor to free him he was compelled to be kind to them. He gave each of them a locked box and sent them to his assistant to open. <br />
<br />
When they had the box opened they recieved each a Mask of the Nexus, and had &quot;of the Nexus&quot; added to their names. Very good event overall, I think there should have been something for the melee players as all 4 chosen were casters/priests. It was also apparent that some unamed high lvls have no respect for GMs and have a maturity lvl that does not exceed room temperature in Alaska during December. I think the GM was rather insulted by all the threats and trash talk these players gave him having showed up at the end of the event and not being able to get loot themselves.<br />

Hrmm, the source of the &quot;a strom begins to cast a spell&quot; messages in DL over the last week?<br />

I've been keeping my eye out whenever I manage to get online.<br />
