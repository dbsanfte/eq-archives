PATCH MOVED<br />

Tuesday March 25, 2003 <br />
PATCH MOVED<br />
<br />
This from the Scheduled Downtime page: <br />
Scheduled Patch for March 27th Rescheduled to April 1st <br />
On Tuesday, April 1st, at 4AM PST, (12PM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 4 hours. <br />
<br />
The EverQuest Operations Team <br />
<br />
Whoops..April Fools!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I bet the moved patch date has more to do with the impending changes to  ==&gt; PEEVEEPEE! &lt;==<br />
<br />
Yes you read that right! Straight out of the blue SOE suddenly decided to fix some balance issues on the zeks. Can you believe that?<br />
<br />
Neither can I. The April 1 date only reinforces my (dis)belief.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joke aside, on Test right now the following has been changed, not exact wording but same content:<br />
<br />
- no direct damage spell will do more than 75% of a PC's total MAX hitpoints. ie... no more instakills using MB/HT.<br />
- ranger archery damage gets the 66% damage reduction versus PC targets.<br />
- ranger archery is more likely to miss its target unless both the ranger and the opponent PC are both standing still.<br />
<br />
Now they just need to take a serious look at horses, bard manadrain and bard dots and I'll be happy as pie, err pudding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
