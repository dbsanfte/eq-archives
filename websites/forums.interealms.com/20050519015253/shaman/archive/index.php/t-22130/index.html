<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Kolmirg, I just saw your posts in the 'Epiphany' thread.  You joined in 1999, and have a total of 2 posts.  That's a lurking feat that should qualify you for the Olympics  :p <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be derogatory at all - that's just not something you see every day.  Kudos for sticking it out for 5 years before ending your vow of silence  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">FYI, All post counts got wiped out a while ago (year? 2?) during some board fiasco, but the profiles / join dates remained.  Thantu manually went through and fixed anyone who posted their old count (honesty rule!), so it's possible he had 1000 posts and just vanished around that period, then came back recently with none.<br />

<br />
Edit:  Heh, well I was here before that.  Must have had a different account name before that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">welcome aboard Gunny ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lurking isn't bad.  I've done it for years before I actually created an account and posted :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I guess I could've made an account earlier, but I don't really have anything to whine about.  :eek: <br />

<br />
Just kidding.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First post ever?  Not sure, since the post counts got wiped.<br />
<br />
 I used to be on the credits page for contributing info for the spell lists.  And now, back to lurking I go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Oaklanbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey Wildaar,<br />
I remember our days back hunting for our epics hehe.  That stupid dog in that Kunark zone that kept on getting bugged and stealing our epic stuff because of faction issues :)  Having to do the epic 6 times before finally getting that dog to stop being a dumb ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Whats Thantu up to anyway?<br />
<br />
Oh, I still lurk around from time to time.  Playing ShadowBane still, though my wife is leaning heavily towards EQ2.  Time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So what is Mung up to? :p<br />
<br />
*edit* You still got the best Gatorsmash Maul spoiler of all time Thantu!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have to admit, I think it's pretty neat that the joined dates have been brought forward all the way from the soerbaird forums.  :)<br />
<br />
Wow, the Soerbaird .. that's a name i haven't heard in a while.  I know a bard who STILL carries that guild tag to this very day (at least last time I saw him he had it lol).  They were a proud bunch, and some of the best RPers I've ever come across.  Not to mention some of the nicest folk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I wish I hadn't forgotten the password to my Belegurth account that was registered in 1999 :(</div></div><hr />

/revive old post<br />
<br />
Well, they didn't, really. I've been around since the Shaman forums were run by Maxx (even before Mung). Looks like you've been around a while too.<br />
<br />
Dec 1999 just happens to be the only date that did carry forward. Which, if I'm not mistaken, was around the time Sunmoon generously offered to host the community after Mung had been AWOL for a few months and those forums started having problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Your post counts are not going up :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yeah, it is cool.  I've been lurking, myself, on an old account, from about jan 2000 till 2002 on an account named after my old druid, was always fascinated by Shaman, then created a name after my AIM name and decided to post since there was so much controversy in early GoD.<br />

It would seem that sometimes, the people who speak seldom always have something very profound to say when they do speak.</div></div><hr />
