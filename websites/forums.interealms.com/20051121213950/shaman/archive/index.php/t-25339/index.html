I dropped a lvl 37 hunter in 5 secs flat yesterday.  He was stalking me and kept putting the hunting mark on me.  So I finally found him, charged him in wolf form.  Changed back into normal form in melee range, double proced on windfury and got him with two frost shocks, one of which crit'd.</div></div><hr />

Some people say go after the pet first but i think its a mistake. Most hunter spec their ranged attacks so if you can melee them then they are at a big disadvantage.</div></div><hr />

Warriors ? Are you serious ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel bad anymore when i beat a warrior. They have nothing for me. Maybe your at a higher level then me ? Im 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you kill the hunter the pet dies. I can't see any reason to ever go after the pet first. <br />
<br />
As for warriors, its a hard call. Even con ones at (mid 30's) I haven't had any trouble with, however a few I know in the high 40s report having around 3-4k armor which is kind of scary. I hope my damage scales to match :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">warriors are the easiest class to kill in pvp in my opinon. They got good armor yes, but crappy dps, and not many more hps than I do. I can kill an even level warrior and have half health or more. They need love.<br />
<br />
Hunters can be a pain in the butt, but I have tools to deal, I can snare them, and I have sprint, if I can hit them they die. Personally I loathe hunters, and I will do everything I can to kill every single one I see, the darling class of wow. I haven't been killed lately, but my guildmates always get jumped by cowardly hunters that wait for them to be almost dead. It is funny, but I just want to kill them all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warriors easier then druids? I play on a PvE server, but it seems the only thing I've got going for me in pvp as a druid would be the ability to run away really fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hardly ever see druids paw, seriously I have no idea. If I saw one I would probably panic and run hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can root, nuke, and heal, assuming you're outside. Also the bear form has been upgraded enough to be semi viable. In addition you have the cat form, so you can ambush if you really want. <br />
<br />
Most druids tend to lose in pvp because their first instinct seems to be to run after I ambush. The ones that stay and fight have been a bit of a challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well thats good to know, because I am looking forward to the battlegrounds. I hate open pvp, but small controlled pvp sounds kinda interesting. <br />
<br />
If a warrior sucks as bad in pvp as they say here, then bear form kinda useless. Even after the changes, my bro's warrior has 1200 more ac then my bear form at level 36. <br />
<br />
I actually lose some pure melee dps switching to cat form atm with my current weapon. (drops from 38.8 to 37.2) This is my favorite form to use when I don't have 3-5 eliete mobs beating on the group just because I like the special attacks though. Only really useful if I have someone else to tank to backstab though, because frontal specials are not all that great. <br />
<br />
Heals and root are nice when outside, but I'm not sure how casting times on my heals compare to a priest (never grouped with one). I can insta heal once every 3 minutes, other then that my fastest direct heal is 4 second casting time. I tend to rely on HoT's when I solo, but can't keep that up forever. <br />
<br />
Just kinda interested in what others had experience with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I understand catform doesn't use the weapon dps. Its all factored by level + talents. The reason it reports less is because your special attacks like BS make up for the defecit. Druid BS is 250% base damage vs Rogue 150%. The reason being we get the bonus from our held weapons. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't take the warrior bashing too much to heart. Everyone here has different experiences, and warriors go through several periods of evolution. The fact that they can wear plate, and have different spec templates means that while a PvE warrior might be easy to kill at lower levels wearing chain, a fully spec PvP offensive warrior is a totally different challenge. <br />
<br />
I don't believe any one particular class sucks over all others when it comes to PvP. Since it's a rock paper scissors situation there is always going to be a few classes that you will outshine one on one. As a Rogue I find Mages, Warlocks, and Hunters to be easy kills, and Paladins to be a real challenge. I bet that same hunter I can kill 100 times in a row hates rogues, but love fighting paladins since they have to range defense. It's all from the perspective of your class.</div></div><hr />

The priest's standard &quot;Heal&quot; spell is also a 4.0 sec cast.  We also get Flash Heals (which is 1.5sec IIRC) and a HoT which is instant.  Priests get a group heal (Prayer) and if they spec Holy they can get some other goodies as well.  With healing, a lot depends on the spec.  A full restoration Druid will outheal in a group a Shadow Priest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you kill the hunter, the pet goes away.  Ignore the pet unless you can root/sheep/fear it or somehow disable it.  If you stop to fight the pet or spend more than a second or two dealing with it, the hunter is going to tear you apart.  I have a 50 shaman and a 40 hunter, and when I'm playing the hunter, nothing makes me happier than when someone tries to fight my pet.    Our pets do good damage, it's true, but if I am allowed to just sit there and shoot at you, I do about 4x as much damage.  You can't let a hunter do that.</div></div><hr />
