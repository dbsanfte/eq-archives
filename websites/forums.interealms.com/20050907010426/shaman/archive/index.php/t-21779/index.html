<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it worth to exp in this zone? I only raided here but I was wondering if solo or a small group may be worth for anything.<br />
Did anyone tried?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">too much HP, ramp/flurry crappy exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everything has huge hp, huge ac, nothing drops loot short of Eom's and even then it's insanely rare.<br />
Not worth it, not even close.  Probably castle in disease would be better exp at 65 for time invested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I saw a Vex Thal pic the other day, and it looked like a pretty zone. I almost went out and camped my last three shards. Almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not pretty.  It's the same room over and over and over and over and over and... well you get my point.  Fighting the same mobs over and over and over and over....<br />
<br />
Even thinking of going to VT anymore causes me actual physical pain.  And that's only after 3 clears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I find VT pretty fun, the multi pulls keeps it intersting for shms and high HPs mean you can DoT. The courtyard of VT is quite nice looking (although you'l only see it first time round setting up a CotH mage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah its a shame, but half the people visiting VT never see the courtyard as once the guild has been there once there's no need to ever return (unless you're a rogue perhaps). Its a nice looking place. Once you're past there its all pretty much the same and very repetitive.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Telosk and I like it coz its still relatively new and there's lots of loot we both want :) But I enjoy VT raids as <br />
a) There are lots of mobs = slowing = something useful to do<br />
b) Long fights = dps via dots, seeing how long to get summoned :)<br />
c) Lots of nice shaman loot to be had, lots of loot full stop in fact!<br />
<br />
The downside is after 2-3 hours of killing the same looking mobs in the same looking rooms it gets rather repetitive, but as we only visit once every 2 weeks or so its not so bad.<br />
<br />
As for grouping there for xp - the xp sucks and mobs have lots of hp. Its a terrible xp spot. If you have a mage you can leave at Blob 1 and a rogue to do invites though, you can get some loots from there with a single group I should think. Long fight but blob 1 dps is very manageable and no adds at all. Just need some good dps and mana regen to last it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you can get some loots from there with a single group I should think. Long fight but blob 1 dps is very manageable and no adds at all. Just need some good dps and mana regen to last it out.<br />
<br />
Your kidding right?  One group Blob1?  <br />
Maybe if you want to kill for an hour.  I'm not sure if you could do him with 1 group.  He is immune to slow and hits pretty hard, rampages, flurries.  I'd think the healers start to get LOM before you get him to 50%.<br />
<br />
If someone ever did Blob1 with one group, I'd love to see some magelos or logs on who did it.  That would be most impressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have my vt key...the loots are way nice....theres  a shield there that casts a regeantless rune with 3 second cast time that will eat canni dmg and still give you mana its awesome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok I got carried away :) You're probably right, but it always amazes me what a group from top-end guilds can achieve. Mana regen with FT15, full buffs, bard song, SK taps etc is huge. Warriors have so many hp a critical CH is needed for full heals. People are breaking well over 200dps. VT isn't the challenge it once was.<br />
<br />
One group though - yeah a tad over-optimistic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">id say 2 groups considering the groups are all time geared in which case they dont need any upgrades from vt of all places</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">definitely not, Vex Thal sucks... for exp ;)</div></div><hr />
