I do know that there is a lot of info that hasn't gone public yet, probably due to <br />
<br />
1) overload<br />
2) fear of the NerfStick<br />

So be patient...</div></div><hr />

I know that last night a ranger in my guild won a pair of really nice chain legs.  I wish I had the name... <br />

Anyway, just chill out and give it some time.</div></div><hr />

Got those two nights ago in PoN ... don't seem that crappy to me, considering time required (about an hour or so).  I can't find any information about anyone finding anything else in the set, but I'll go out on a limb and say I'm looking for a full suit of  Leaf Scale Gear hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem with loot is that, in the past, Verant seems to have put a huge drop rate on everything during the first week then nerfed it the second week. I remember seeing hundreds of items during the first week of Kunark, Velious, Luclin, etc... For PoP I've only seen a handful of interesting items so far. I guess they have decided not to go that route for PoP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sionach</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's easy to get the impression that there isn't much &quot;Ranger&quot; loot in PoP because of what you see on Alla's and other spoiler-type sites.  Just remember that the 3 zones actually being fought in right now (Nightmare, Disease, Innovation) are only a portion of the zones released.  Even they have not been fully explored &amp; all loot even from them has definitely not been discovered yet.</div></div><hr />

just crafted one today, sweet graphics :) i d call that better than BFT for sure!<br />
<br />
there s also a 32/38 *2 magic dam + stats dropping in PoN.<br />
<br />
and don t forget that the Planar Fletching Guide (Book from PoK, talk to the fletching guy - seems you need a certain skill in fletching to get it tho , 200? 240? dunno) lists 4 more recipes and strongly hints for even more!<br />
<br />
i really don t see your problem Ticharary:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leeda_goodlife</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he gave me the book right away at max fletching skill<br />
<br />
my husband was working on fletching right there, and hailed him every time he had to buy another 2 stacks of components.  they guy didn't respond at 199 and did respond at 202. <br />
<br />
i had to bonk my husband for not trying at 200 and 201, but he said he just got lucky wiht the last 3 points happening all right together and he didn't notice.<br />
<br />
so anyway it is between 200 and 202 somewhere you need for him to talk to you about the bows.  my guess is it is 201, to severly limit who can get the book.</div></div><hr />
