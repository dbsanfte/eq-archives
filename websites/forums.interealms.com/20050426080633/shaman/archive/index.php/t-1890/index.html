<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about to ding 35 and am looking for some good XP solo spots. Loot isn't terribly important, just a good (realtively) safe flow of XP that I can grind with a limited play schedule (1 - 2 hours average).<br />
<br />
Thank you!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heya Sengal<br />
<br />
I think ive seen ya before(im on saryrn too) =-D either in HK or oasis or something.<br />
<br />
Anyway, GD is supposed to be great soloing, just pet kite kodiaks, easy stuff apparently.  Im hunting in OT, jus one more level needed to doggie, and there are some pretty easy solo possibilities, but from what ive heard GD.<br />
<br />
or yetis in DL, they are supposed to be nice exp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, Xertt.  <br />
<br />
I've probably seen you around too!!<br />
<br />
I'll try out GD and see how it goes. <br />
<br />
If you need a quick run to 34 - try mammoth's in everfrost.  Most are dark blue and nearly 1/3 a blue xp at 33. Plus they drop mammoth tusks which are worth nearly 10pp.  They are very easy to solo, especially once they are slowed. <br />
<br />
Send me a tell some time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok =-) ill check those mammys out. I solo'd a few back at 26, when i was hunting there w/ a friend.<br />
<br />
I need to go to EF anyway to buy my new spells =-)<br />
<br />
edit: heh just remembered, i bet i saw you in EF when i was in my mid-to-late 20's, before i left for HK and then to OT.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i remember soloin some mamys, and EB doing some insane damage to em, like a 3rd their HP or something.  W/ the 29 slow i bet their cake, they were w/ 14 slow ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: went there to get my spells and then went a-mammy huntin.<br />
<br />
well, there is insane competition for mammy spawns, gotta grab em quick.  most my time was spent killing PH's anyway.  when they did pop they popped in droves, so i often had 2-3 mammys, and can only take two atm ;( (eb just doesnt do enough, and 2 mammys is like 8 EB's, so thats what....1000 mana on jus those 2 ;( not to mention slows and roots.<br />
<br />
i did get defense up abit though, i was happy bout that.<br />
Anyway, i think just Groupin in OT may be better, unless i log on at 3am and theres noone there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taldon DreamWeave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At lvl 35, I hunted Cynthia in Rathe Mtns, Shes pretty decent exp, i think about half 1/3 a blue per whack, she spawns pretty fast though so try to keep at least half mana at the end of the fight, <br />
<br />
The strategy i used was ShmvsWiz3: Open with Scrounge, Pet goes in(full buffed) Nuke, Canna, Nuke, repeat nuking until dead, btw she throws some mean punches for a wizie, i think i remember seeing a double or so for 80 somewhere in the fight, unless your careful she will kill your pet in melee.<br />
<br />
A 2nd good place is the Tundra Yeti's in Dreadlands, I got bored with cyncthia and the cyclopses of Rathe Mtns at 1 point and wandered over here to check the yeti's out. The are pretty good exp, the pull is a little tricky, can't run to far away from them or they turn and bring their buddies. <br />
<br />
Strategy TankKite1: Full buff yourself and pet, med to good mana, 4 or 5 works, open with slow, slowly back up (taking hits along the way, belive me its worth it so they dont get lost) until you reach the cave entrance (where you conviently sat your doggie down.) let pet engage, Poison, Disease, retreat for 4 seconds(back off a bit, until you clear high agro range) sit and rest until your pet is starting to take a hurting (hes down to 1/3 hp, ) then either heal him and take the long route with him finishing off the yeti after you redot'd it, or nuke it to death, personally i take the long way and genneraly end up at 4.5 or 4 mana with my pet well over 4/5 hp. so its continous pulling.</div></div><hr />
