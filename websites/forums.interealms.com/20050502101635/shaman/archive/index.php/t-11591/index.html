Look at the charming classes that solo named that hit for 900 and are unslowable. Lure based or non mitigated slow would put us back where we were before pop, balanced imho. Malo/malos dont do a whole lot when pc's have 250 mr unbuffed. Tried slowing guildie the other day took me 8 tries to slow lucky for me his pet wasnt up(he was a bst no double attack so I could channel through his attacks) try that on him with his pet up and I'm toast.

I am fairly new to EQ and really new to being a Shaman, so I don't understand some of the above statement.<br />

I don't know what a lure slow is or lifeburn or manaburn.  I do know about rangers with AM3 and really buffed tanks though.</div></div><hr />

Druids have their magic based DoTs that will land 99% of the time no matter what your MR is.  Necros magic and fire DoTs land 90% of the time (plus lifeburn, and lifetaps), wizzy's have manaburn and lures, mage's have nice nukes while may not be lure (with mala they are), even a partially resisted one is deadly with their pets on your behind.   Chanters have rapture, tash, stun.   Or can charm a mob to kick your arse.   A lure slow wouldn't be enough to help shaman in the high end PvP.  We need a lure dot.<br />
<br />
Lifeburn is an unresistable nuke from a necro.   I got lifeburned for 2700dmg the other day.   <br />
<br />
Manaburn is an unresistable nuke from a wizard.</div></div><hr />

Right, and Shamans have the Malo and Insidious lines. If we had lure spells, we would not need Malo. We have Malo, therefore we are not going to get lure spells. Maybe you want it both ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hrmm, sounds like some of you dont PvP much.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our malo line isn't for us as much as it is for raids on uber mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By that standard, Shaman nukes are Lures when used in conjunction with Malo. (hint : neither mage nor shaman nukes have an inherent resist mod, Malo is a bigger debuff, and outside of Velious  Cold based spells are generally less resisted than either Magic or Fire).</div></div><hr />

I've been on both, and until I was on SZ for awhile I realized I didn't really know much about PvP.   /Duels and BoTB are far from PvP, trust me.   I haven't memmed a cold nuke in probably 30 levels.  Our poison nukes aren't a whole lot better either.  Mana heavy and fizzle like crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP means nothing in the context of this thread/request. Why?<br />
<br />
1)The request in this thread isn't &quot;Shaman need something unresistable for PvP&quot;, it is &quot;Shaman need something unresistable&quot;. Unles PvP is specifically mentioned or at least implied by the content of the message, the standard assumption is that the issue is a PvE issue. Since Hagle didn't mention PvP as the impetus for the request or even imply it, it is absurd to assume it to be so.<br />
<br />
2)SOE/VI will never alter PvE abilities to modify PvP balance : PvP is little more than an afterthought in EQ. There just aren't enough of you Reds to justify potentially screwing things up on the Blues. Even if every single Red cancelled their account in protest over something - it is likely that no change would be made if it would screw things up for the Blues. The more probable result would be SOE/VI saying &quot;OK, we can use the hardware for new Blue servers and/or spares&quot;.<br />
<br />
As such, my point stands that Mage nukes are no more unresistable than Shaman nukes (though I do admit that a Shaman is far less likely to have a nuke memed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Some shaman do play on red servers believe it or not.  This board does not say &quot;shamans on blue servers only.&quot;<br />
<br />
I also believe the classes on blue servers would be more balanced if SoE balanced them according to PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thought about this a little further.   People on Red servers tend to know a lot more about the classes than most on blue servers think.   You do have to exp/group/raid on red servers too ya know?   There is not an NPC where we go up to and say gimme level 65 and phat loots plz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't think a change will go in that is terribly over balancing in PvP, despite the fact that blue servers are the majority.  Look how long it has taken for changes to be made to harmtouch, it is only now a feared PvP thing and only with extreme AA thrown in.  Whether a lure based spell for us is unbalancing is another question entirely...<br />
<br />
I think maybe a AA skill to apply to the disease slow to make it unmitigatable or something in that respect might be fair, though.  Have it on a timer of some sort so it's not totally over powering and must be used wisely.  Not like I am high enough to bother with this yet but that's my idea *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the best suggestion made here is making disease slows non mitigated. Everyone and their damn dog(sorry Fooz, no offense bud) can slow these days one way or another..the edge needs to be reinforced. <br />
<br />
Hell, if they don't want it slowed to disease rates make the thing immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lure based slow is too powerful in PvE.<br />
<br />
Mitigation-immune slow is too powerful in PvE and limits the designers too much when making new ubermobs.<br />
<br />
Chance of VI giving us an extremely powerful PvE ability to enhance the Zekker experience = o.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation should be removed from all non-raid mobs, that's the real issue as I see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;Slow mitigation should be removed from all non-raid mobs, that's the real issue as I see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
/agree with this. BUT one of these two changes would but shamans back as the ultimate slowers and not just a little better than the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Look at how LONG it took for them to admit Manaburn was overpowered in PvP and actually do something about it?  Was only the last patch, so ONE SOLID YEAR it took to make them realize that hey, giving wizards deathtouch in PvP probably isn't very balanced.  Even if they only get to use it every 2 hours, it's still deathtouch.  <br />
<br />
But even that one, minor, easy to code, OBVIOUSLY BROKEN SPELL took a full year to have a reasonable solution worked in.  <br />
<br />
FYI the solution was to make manaburn do no more than 75% of the total of a player's full hp bar.  So wizards could still nuke you once for a couple k and then finish you off with manaburn, just no more instant &quot;one-button-and-you-die&quot; kills.  <br />
<br />
PvP in Everquest is the most broken of any game that supports PvP.  Keep that in mind when whining about it.  <br />
<br />
As for a lure slow . . . nah wouldn't be right in PvE.  And why?  Because as it stands, it takes more than one shaman to reliably slow something that is difficult to slow.  Nerf that difficulty and all of a sudden one shaman is all you ever need.  We don't need shamans to become even more obsolete on raids.  <br />
<br />
A lure source of damage dealing would sure be nice for PvP.  We got nuthin that will damage a highly resistant character in end-game gear.  We used to have our epic, but that got changed from lure resist to regular magic resist.  So once again we got nothing to damage a resistant person with except melee, pet, and spiritcall.  <br />
<br />
It took me half an hour to kill a fellow 65 shaman in the arena the other day.  I was sucking his mana almost as fast as he could make it, but couldn't damage him fast enough to make up for Torpor, and he was protecting it with insta-clicks from me dispelling it.  It's HARD to do &gt; 325dmg/tic consistently as a shaman without resorting to spells (regen plays a factor).  <br />
<br />
Face it, EQ PvP is broken and will probably always be broken.  You want PvP?  DAoC had some, SWG will have some, and WoW should have all you can handle.  And what I know about Blizzard is that they balance their games quite well with respect to multiplayer PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You have no clue what playing on a red server is really like Landragoran.   Doing a /duel in a arena where both players are 100% prepared/buffed/blah blah is not pvp.   <br />
<br />
Being aware of your surroundings, learning the classes and general level range of every player on other teams, knowing potential factions of others and yourself, where to exp. at, where others exp at, I could go on and on.   I've killed 4 or 5 60+ mana-stealing bards in outdoor zones within the past week.   Why?   I caught them unprepared.   Think you could kill one in a /duel?   No chance.  <br />
<br />
People on blue servers who have never played at length on a red server really don't know what it's like.   The only thing really unbalanced about SZ is the teams, not so much the classes themselves.  If necros/sk's were not limited to evil team only the server would be even better than it is, and it's already the best server imo.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mediman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">pvp is so unbalanced i dont even want to go into it but i will post a small rant anyways.  Ya theres certain classes shaman can own, but ifthey have the right gear they can be unkillable.  try zoning into a chanter with hasted pet, try fighting warrior thats unrootable and 9k hps.  try killng a paladin who can cure anything, and heal very well.  try killing a bard who has any clue how to fight.   Not to mention anyone can just buy dr/pr potions and cure our pop dots in one cast.   Only thing i enjoy is spiritcall.  that flat out destroys people who dont have good mr/ac like those pesky druids.    i also hate wizards, who with their draught of thunder spell can be very annoying to fight.</div></div><hr />

Frankly im very simple right now. Im tired of beging  and asking for things. Im very happy with my shaman at this point and im just going to shut my trap and enjoy the game for now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Right, and Shamans have the Malo and Insidious lines. If we had lure spells, we would not need Malo. We have Malo, therefore we are not going to get lure spells. Maybe you want it both ways. <br />

     Bah we have the most resisted spell .Malo is a raid tools(ok even in exp group because our spell are too much resisted) .And if you  malo do you think your turgur is now a lure spell ? bah !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What about an unresistable 30 second 60% slow at 65?  That would be similar to the chanter unresistable 42 second short mez except the mob hates us afterwards (perhaps add a -35 MR and -35 DR limitted to any subsequent slow-type spells with it as well and make it 450 mana or something big).  Mobs slowed in this way can no longer be slowed with this type of spell for 10 minutes (although Turgur's and Grummus can overwrite it)-- I add this caveat so that raid encounters don't become overly trivial with chain-cast irresistable slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Bah we have the most resisted spell .Malo is a raid tools(ok even in exp group because our spell are too much resisted) .And if you  malo do you think your turgur is now a lure spell ? bah !<br />
<br />
<br />
Malo is not a raid tool i NEVER do not have it memed unless im passing through black borrow or something. I use it on XP groups all the time. What the dude said was right , we have a debuff line of spells and giving us lure spells would negate those. It simply wont happen IMHO.<br />
<br />
As far as a 30 second unresistable slow at 65. While in theory it might sound nice , but whats reallythe point ? In the time takes you to cast that and slow with your real slow , you could have malos/slowed with what we have. Plus its just anoter spell slot being taken up when i already dont have enoughf or all that i want.<br />
<br />
Besides , if everything was instantly slowed , with no aggro being bounced , what fun would that be ? I like taking the hits and making the tank/cleric /boggle when a giant in BoT comes from the south with a add and i slow the first one then slow the second and run off and sit to draw aggro then preceed to tank it under my own power with no outside healing or help with my hotkey of /g Offtanking a (%T). When i was first trying out for my guild im in now i definetly got a few giggles when i displayed tht hotkey on a grummus raid ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Non-mitigatable slow would be too powerful for PvE because slow is the single most dibilitating spell you can cast on a mob.<br />
<br />
Think about all the mobs your guild have problems killing today, then think about how easy they will be if you can garantee a 40% slow on them. See?<br />
<br />
While a non-mitigatable slow for shamans sounds good on paper and puffs up the ego of those who need such an ego boost, it will dramatically unbalance PvE unless it is capped at the same magnitude of current mitigatedslow, around 20%.<br />
<br />
If we DO get a 20% unresistable, non-mitigatable slow, and people are actually happy, then I guess for these people the problem with the shaman class is mostly phychological, since about the only thing you can say about such a new spell is &quot;I can do something you can't, aaahahahahaaha&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I cant believe what I'm hearing. No wonder shamans get the shaft every expansion with the exception of Kunark. &quot;We are to overpowered we have slow!&quot;. Thats been the basis for screwing us for many expansions. Come on guys lets not be so blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">A Lure slow would be very nice.  It would have to be a low %, short duration, in order to not be unbalancing.  Similar to the bard slows, perhaps.  I think that disease slows are as close as we are going to get -less resisted, and less effective.<br />
<br />
An unmitigatable slow is unrealistic.  Mitigation is something that the designers added in PoP for a reason.  It was a deliberate decision.  Its not the kind of thing that is just undone.<br />
<br />
As for the PvP issues... as valid as they may be, they are irrelevant.  EQ is not about PvP its about PvE.  The fact that a few servers ALLOW PvP doesnt change the basic premise of the game, it just lets those who want to spice things up do so.  No matter how much you want PvP to be fixed, its still going to remain an afterthought, a novelty.  Its just not part of the design.</div></div><hr />

Honestly i think if we push our heals anymore we will be able to fill in the clerical role TOO well. While that might be a enticing idea for you or alot of other people, for me personaly its a reason to stop grouping if im going to be called on to be the main healer often. I simply dont enjoy it.<br />
<br />
I would go along with say ... a new CHeal and Quick heal each with 1000 or so more to them at 64 ? i just dont see wasting runes on them.</div></div><hr />

I want to rip off someones head and **** down their neck everytime I get a /tell &quot;fos plz!&quot; &quot;sta plz!&quot;. Hell.. its lucky I even get a tell anymore.. more likely some ******** tank just shouts it out at random and expects his buffs to appear out of thin air the moment he makes his desire known to the zone in general.<br />

<br />
Ahem.. slows.. er.. slows are allright. PvP is so absurdly broken and will never EVER be fixed. Early kunark days pvp was somewhat.. remotely close to being somewhat even/fair.. it was a few short months of noone being so horribly overpowered as to completely destroy all comers.. it didnt last long and we never really enjoyed its like ever since. Just give up in pvp.. we are hard to kill.. but we cant kill ****. Just quiescence and run like a sissy girl.. or at least drag some friends along and play classic raid shaman and malo and debuff ****ers while your tank friends own them. <br />
<br />
Lure slow that isnt mitigated would be too much. As it is, anything thats *actually* slowable I can slow like a champ. Takes a lil strategy with a bard hosing and some tash.. but its still far from hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Lure based slow would not make a big difference for PvE.  All it would do is dumb down the game even more.  It would make it so any schmuck could box a shaman on a raid or for a group.  Debuffers wouldn't have to work together, all you would have to do is have the shaman hit his magic button and the mob is slowed.  Boring, and too easy.<br />
<br />
I don't know what lure based slow would do for PvP and honestly I don't care.<br />
<br />
Non-mitigated slow would be overpowered.  Mobs that mitigate slow were made to do so because un-mitigated slow is TOO GODDAMN POWERFUL.  Admit it.  Once the slow lands, the mob is a gimp if it gets slowed the full 75%.  A slow that only lands for 20-30% still helps out a lot, but it doesn't completely gimp the mob.<br />

You picked the wrong class buddy.  Everyone that has been playing the game for over an hour knows that shamans buff and heal.  I haven't read the EQ manual in about 2 years but I am pretty sure it says it there, too.  Roll up a beastlord, because you just described them perfectly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">All the people saying that unmitigated slow would be too powerful crack me up. <br />
Where have you been the last 4 years ? <br />
Slow Mitigation was introduced with PoP and i doubt it was in place till the very last beta phase.(Why else would Thott make a fancy graph and totally neglect Slow Mitigation ? You do know that Thott either directly participated in the beta or had all the infos he wanted from other members of his guild ?).<br />
<br />
If Elemental trash that hits for 1k+ didn't mitigate slow, do you think it would make any difference ? <br />
<br />
If PoP mobs were designed around Slow Mitigation upon release(and i don't believe this bull****), it still would make no difference at all.<br />
<br />
They might have to change some gods, but that coul have been done in the 2 months before people got to them. Slow Mitigation is merely in place to weaken the Shaman Class, period. We are the ones who rely on this ability more than everyone else and i want a ****ing compensation(no not groupshrink or haste).<br />
<br />
How about you start fixing the elemental pants and put an effect on it that people used actually instead of a crapy 2 minute Kunark DoT? <br />
Malo or Malosinia come to mind.</div></div><hr />

And beastlords?  Hell, rangers, warriors, and rogues can reliably land a slow.  Sure, it's for half - but it lands a hell of a lot faster than mine.<br />

For example, a normal casting time of say 3.0 the spell would last for 30(?) seconds and have a recast time of 2 minutes, this way at least 4 shaman would have to work together to keep a mob slowed on a raid. Perhaps the slow could start out at something like 75% then decline in effectiveness every tick(e.g. 60% the next tick, then 45%, 30, 15..)With this idea i think it introduces even more strategy into killing Uber_Mob_XX.</div></div><hr />

Everyone that has been playing the game for over an hour knows that shamans buff and heal.  I haven't read the EQ manual in about 2 years but I am pretty sure it says it there, too.  Roll up a beastlord, because you just described them perfectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disagree. thats not a true restriction of the class, just what more lean to. Shaman can add some ok DPS and more the point , have fun doing it if there is ore then 1-2 shaman in a raid. Buffing its our strongest ability by far. But definetly not our only.<br />
<br />
But i do agree withy our attitude some what. If you cant take the buffing you need to step back and rethink if you wanna be a shaman still ,c ause even if its not all we can do , its certainly something we are expected in a large number of the cases</div></div><hr />

I also love how people argue saying we already have lure spells because we have malo.  Who are these &quot;we&quot; you talk about?  I sure as hell don't have malo and I'd say 75%, or even higher, of all the shaman on all of eq don't have malo.   People like you who say this can kiss my arse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Maybe on your gimmick servers most shamans do not have malo, but on the real servers, almost all of us have it.  I can honestly only think of one shaman I know that did not have malo by the time he was 65.  He never got it - he has malos and quinn now.  It seems worse than it is because the ones that don't have it scream about how bad it is.  Someone did a poll on these boards a few months ago, and the vast majority of 60+ shamans had both torpor and malo.<br />
<br />
Casting focus and stamina is a big part of our class.  Accept it or reroll.  Regen is great for groups and haste is really necessary when there is no chanter.  Ferine Avatar is nice, as well.  These are all good buffs, and you will learn that they actually DO help your group or raid if you would drop your &quot;I'm too good to buff&quot; attitude and actually start using them.<br />
<br />
Yeah, we can do decent damage with our dots and rains.  We are clumsy at it though and its not really what we are suited for.  We are a support class, not glory-hounds.  Accept it or make a beastlord.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">When you look at it migration of slow was a big nerf designed to affect shaman's and enchanters. this in short could be counted as a nerf on our ability. <br />
<br />
The question is what else can we bring to a group to make if worth while for us being there?<br />
<br />
An Enchanter can obviously charm and mez things and general Crowd control. <br />
<br />
Shamans can heal, (oh wait we can't keep up with DPS of a partially slowed mob.) <br />
<br />
The fact is when mobs start to migrate damage it is best that the group has a slower in the form of a bard or beastlord because they can bring a lot more to a group than the shaman can. <br />
<br />
Migration of damage was a nerf aimed at us. They did this obviously because as a class we are so overpowered. (Our complete heal is so powerful , and our dots do so much damage.)<br />
<br />
/rant off (Having a bad day)<br />
<br />
When max level was 50 shaman's where solo'ers not by choice but because no one wanted to group with us then they increased the level to 60 and suddenly shamans where getting groups again. <br />
<br />
This Nerf to slow has just damaged the diserability to have a shaman in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I m in a guild that is in elemental planes and kill nice stuff and raid a lot.<br />
During SoL's raid, MT's used to ask in /gu if mob was slowed when due to battle spam they missed it. <br />
Recently, our MTs asked on our forum if we could reduce /gu spam during fight and remove those /gu %T SLOWED message as they were useless..<br />
Since that post we are not calling any debuff in /gu (we were used to Malos/sinia in a debuff channel and slow in /gu).<br />
That's now 1 month we slowing (or not...depending of our mood) mobs and not calling it in /gu and nobody complain because slow has no noticable effect anymore.<br />
Yup, slow is useless on a mob that can deal more than 10k damage per rounds and mitigate slow to max.. Slow the mob or not, it will not have a huge impact on the fight.<br />
Slowing a mob is so 1980 anyway..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I would like to see a new Shaman Class AA skill that gives you an unresistable slow, perhaps a lower slow % then normal slow. (would not work against immune mobs of course). The skill should have a long reuse time on it similiar to MGB and cost a lot of AA points. Or if not unresistable have the chance of it landing be a lot higher than normal slows. Hell even give it a high agro when it lands. Make it undesirable as the first slow you would try on a mob but as a last resort on a mob that needs to be slowed but you just can't get that slow to land.<br />
<br />
I really hate it when guild is fighting something that is known to be slowable. I land malo and malosinia, i see that it  has been tashed. I stand there trying to slow while the raid keeps asking &quot;got it slowed yet?&quot;. Finally I give up and shout back that i can't slow it only to see the ranger/beastlord/chanter shout back two seconds later.. i got it slowed...<br />

Idiot. Yes, only your chosen playstyle is the &quot;real&quot; way to play eq. Therefor people on Zeks should **** and take it in the ass cause some blue jerkoff who hasnt left potime in a month decrees that everything is dandy.<br />
<br />
Buffing didnt piss me off so much till the fn fosoul came out. With its god damned flash in the pan duration. Other buffing classes buff once every 2 hours and get to spend the rest of their time having fun and playing their class. Not so shaman.. thx punishment for our mana regen.<br />

<br />
First of all, you are wrong.  Most people playing are over 60 (at least on the real servers).<br />
<br />
Second of all, why is it relevant that most shamans under 60 don't have malo?  They aren't supposed to.  On blue servers, they don't need it before 60.  Maybe it would be a nice thing to have on red servers - I don't know and I don't care.  You can't expect people to take pvp servers in to consideration, since almost no one plays it.  EQ pvp is terrible and has been unbalanced and broken for years, and it probably always will be.<br />
<br />
The point is, most shamans that are supposed to have malo (60+), have it.<br />
<br />
It is true that this is just a game, and you should play your character however you most enjoy it.  But if you enjoy slowing mobs and doing lots of damage, and you hate buffing and healing, then you did probably pick the wrong class.<br />
<br />
I play this game to be as effective as I can with my character.  Since I am a shaman, my role includes buffing and healing.  I don't particularly enjoy buffing, and there have been nights where I wanted to delete focus and stamina from my spellbook, but I realize that buffing helps my groups and my guild, so I do it and don't whine.</div></div><hr />

As much as i respect this forum and do love it , this place is FAR from a true representation of the shaman community. It voices many common concerns all shaman have , but only a few shaman i know across 2 servers have even heard and less come here and post and do polls. Most shaman I know play the game and dont bother with message boards wether is class related or server. I didnt even take the poll ( i have malo/malos/torpor/Quiescence ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Didnt you yourself even say you have it ?<br />
In this day and age a level 60 shaman has all the resources to buy them if they work for it. I too bought mine. I always had the auction channel open, i farmed seb SOLO , i farmed PoG and CC and Ice giants ,i saved up the 42.5k i needed in 2 weeks to buy it once I finaly gave up on it dropping.<br />
<br />
Is it easy ? Hell no it wasnt easy, i know frustrations reaching the same bounds of any shaman on this forum. Would i have wanted the shaman class to be changed because of it ? No.<br />
<br />
The resources are there , you just need to make use of them if you havent aquired what you need. <br />
<br />
BTW , from my understanding emp is the worst camp for malo/torpor, even worse then the GW's in SF. I know i never saw it and considering i lived in seb NG camp for 2 months day in and day out for hours and hour and only heard it drop once from another shaman that camped crypt every single day i was there too, thats pretty damn rare.</div></div><hr />

Talking about SF GW's, alot dont have access to VP GW's. And fyi I was lvl 60 for 6 months before pop came out and 60+ for 2 months till I got torpor. It hasnt become easy to obtain on my server, not even close. Once I got the money for it I waited 2 months nothing for sell so I camped Emp. Research so far hasnt put much in the bazaar. It has, but not much. And wouldnt it be nice if torpor sold for 42k on my server. Try 70k+ never seen it lower.

Gonna try to be polite here, but ****.  Reading comprehension is your friend.   I don't care about malo.  Malo being super rare is not the point I was making.   <br />
<br />
What I'm saying is a lure slow BEFORE level 60 makes sense because malo is not until level 60.   Chanters have tash from way early on for a reason.   To help them slow/mez/stun.   Tash is unresistable.  Why do we have to wait 'til level 60 for our &quot;tash&quot;?   A lure slow would not be overpowering.</div></div><hr />

As i stated in my post, this forum voices MANY COMMON  concerns all shaman have. But if you think for 1 second that a poll taken here is going to represent how many 60+ shaman across all servers actualy have malo, which was what my comment was aimed at if you actualy read it, then thats a ignorant statment.<br />

I'm going to agree with you that we should have a way to make slows and other debuffs land easier at lower levels.  However, I think that a lure-based slow is the wrong way to go.  A much better solution would have been to add a level 44 mini-malo to go along with stoicism.  That wouldn't change the balance on high level mobs (PoP mobs that mitigate slow), but it would make it easier for lower level shamans (and 60+ that haven't gotten malo yet) to perform their roles as debuffers.  On top of that, it would make life better and fairer for shamans on PvP servers, without fuxxing with the balance on blue servers.</div></div><hr />

The Shaman class needs help in the end game, since Slow was nerfed pretty bad. Mitigation for Bosses is acceptable. Mitigation for yard trash is not. <br />
You want to keep it that way ?<br />
Then ****ing give me something to make up for the power i lost. <br />
Give me buffs that increase the chance to make defensive skills kick in or just give me better heals, since this seems to be the new vision in EQ.<br />
<br />
Give me an AA skill that makes cannibalize I, II and II permanent without having to cast it with a refresh of 32 minutes. Give me something to cut down the reuse on Canni V to 2 minutes. Give me an AA that adds a resist adjust and permanently affects all my debuffs. Just give me something worthwhile. Hell it isn't too hard. <br />
Stop feeding me the same old bull**** of a spell. <br />
Rehashs of old spells suck ass, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Some of you guys may not be happy playing a shaman.  <br />
<br />
That's fine.  There's tons of other classes to play.<br />
<br />
Shaman are in fact balanced and do not require further substantial tuning, imho.  Sure, it's not perfect, but given the hordes of shaman crawling about clearly the class appears viable to many.  <br />
<br />
One problem that is real is that Kunark spell drops for some spells are clearly busted, and that's been discussed at length for about 3 years.  My theory is Malosini was incorrectly added to Jugg loot table instead of Malo, since Malosini is a vendor spell, and given that Mala, the mage equivalent, drops readily off Juggs (we sell it to vendors now).  I don't get why that would be the case.  I think they made a coding mistake that's never been recognized.  <br />
<br />
Other classes have the same problem with some of their Kunark spells - but those spells do not have the same impact on those classes that malo/torpor do on shaman.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps research will alleviate that, but I haven't seen much impact from research on malo and torpor yet.  I did get Acumen of Dar Khura researched though.  <br />
<br />
Hagle, your experience with the Emporer is nothing like my own, proving once again that anecdotal experiences prove nothing.  I had 15+ emporer kills with NO shaman spell drops.  Add 25+ dead Kunark dragons, many Overkings/Queens, Prot/Jumpy and Guardian Wurms, and 1 copy of Torpor later, and there is a drop rate problem in my view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">You need to face facts and deal with them.<br />
<br />
We will never have any lure spells, nor will we have AA's to adjust the resists on our other spells. Only if we didnt have malo/malos would sony ever consider this and i for 1 am not willing to trade one for the other.<br />
<br />
As far as what we need in the high end game. The only thing we really need according to our role is longer buff durations on things usch as FoSeventh. I think its pretty clear what SoE want the shaman to be and thinking your going to go on a crusade to make us into something uber powerful in all respect is asking for a headache i feel.<br />
<br />
But hey , if you wanna go for it, by all means. Ill be cheering you on , just dont turn around and bite me when you dont get anyone to support you or it doesnt happen. Im just dealing with reality. When you look at their &quot;vision&quot; for us in the high end game, we are pretty much where THEY want US to be and i really dont think alot is going to change no matter how much we curse and swear and stomp and hold our breathe.<br />
<br />
Just my view though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Lit, why is malo so overpowering but tash is not?  Look what chanters can do these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never said it was warador, infact i think its not. Im just saying , that in the mind of SoE, we already have a debuff line of spells. I find it very unlikely that with the track that shows where SoE wants their shaman to be , that we will have a resist adjustment on out spells to go ontop of the good resist debuff line we already have.<br />
<br />
Then again, its just my opinion. As also is my opinion that we dont need it. I mean so what if we cant slow every single thing in the game. Enchanters cant charm every single thing in the game, SK's cant Harmtouch every single thing in the game. I like the game of chance, not knowing if its going to work 100% and leaving a challange. Makes it a lil more like real life. The day this game becomes trival and complaisant to every whim of the users, is the day i cancel my account.</div></div><hr />
