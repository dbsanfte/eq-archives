I think alot of this (NOT 100%) turning into a witch hunt. And most people are looking for momey. Just like Sexual Harrasment once accused you are guility. As for the article its a shame that the Card is not helping to heal the wounds of the community, gaining the trust of the community will take long time and the best way to start is by taking strong measurements to ensure things are done right.</div></div><hr />

1) They are a non-profit organization, dependent entirely on donations.<br />
<br />
2) There is no central treasury. Each diocese depends on it's own fund raising to keep running. Why do you htink so many old churchs are falling into disrepair, and many inner-city parochial schools are closing? It's simply lack of funds to keep them running.<br />
<br />
Now, while I think that some people may be leveling accusations in hopes of winning a generous settlement, I don't believe that could be the case in the majority of cases, or even a significant percentage. You don't get this much smoke without a pretty big fire.</div></div><hr />

While I would not be at all surprised that there aren't some frivolous law suits against the church on this matter, the church has for the most part itself to blame.  Most all of the cases that are coming to light show gross negligence on the part of very senior officials within the church to hide and protect those guilty of very serious crimes.  The current furvor over this issue is half things finally coming out in the open, and half people being REALLY pissed off at the churches actions.</div></div><hr />
