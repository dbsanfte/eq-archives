I've taken a 5 month break from the game and now I find that when I go to quit, my computer freezes up. I ran thorough file search, no help. Anyone have any idea what's wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Excidium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i would like to know this also,  my other comp does the same thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How are you quitting the game and where does the freeze happen? Sit and camp using buttons or /camp desktop? Freeze at server or character select? Clicking on exit with mouse or pressing escape?<br />
<br />
Not that I have an answer based on any responses but it may help someone else point you in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I freeze up occasionally when I /sit &amp; /camp. I get past the &quot;You have 5 more seconds to camp&quot; message, then the game locks up. I also get booted to the server selection screen when I zone, too. This especially happens in the newer zones (Luclin &amp; PoP). Seems the zones aren't very stable. SOE says it's been working on this problem, but I haven't noticed any difference. <br />
<br />
My solution was to order a new computer, new video card, new sound card, everything. This should fix my problem.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure you have the latest drivers for both your sound card and video card.  This happened to my friend a lot, he updated the sound drivers and it worked fine after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you camp while on a horse, you get booted to server select, and your character goes linkdead.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily related, but I thought I'd mention it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Has anyone else had this problem?<br />
<br />
/camp desktop takes me to server selection.<br />
/camp desktop then /q takes me to server selection.<br />
<br />
I just want to go to my desktop! auuughhhhhhh.....<br />
<br />
Like I would ever play on any other server anyway. :P. I wish I could just bypass the whole server selection and have it just go to rodcet nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was mentioned in a recent patch message (or maybe a post on the EQLive site) that /camp desktop is currently broken. I don't think it works for anyone :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, I'm fairly sure camp desktop has been broken for months.  It has for me anyway.  I think it started with the new UI but it may have been before that.  As far as the freezing I don't know what to tell you.  I don't know if this is a good idea but maybe find a very safe spot to camp and /q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SilverD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I heard and verified that if you have your spell book open when /camp desktop you go to the desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont know if this will help, but I was having freeze up problems due to my AGP controller driver in the device manager.  I use a Radeon 9700 and was getting constant lockups in EQ when playing or camping.  I fixed this situation by changing the device driver for the AGP controller to PCI-PCI Bridge which is its &quot;generic&quot; setting in Windows.  I lost some performance but not much, and it never locks up anymore.  I think I lost about 10 fps in EQ.<br />
<br />
Note: Other games work fine with either the AGP controller or the PCI-PCI Bridge.  Just EQ is the black sheep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had the same freeze and zone booting problems too...and had the latest vid drivers for it. So I bought a better video card. Tada! No more problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tirais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks to everyone who addressed my freeze up problem. MagnoMightyMidget sugested I check my sound and video drivers and yup, that was the problem. Everything is fine and well again in Norrath.Thanks again to everyone<br />
