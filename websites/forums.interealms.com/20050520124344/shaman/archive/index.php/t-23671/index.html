Omens of War is live!<br />
New Teleportation Spells to Barindu.<br />
Just me and my shadooooow!<br />
Reflective Water?<br />
Register now for the New Orleans Fan Faire.<br />
<br />
Omens of War<br />
-------------------<br />
Explore the war torn lands of Kuua and reap the benefits of new AAs, spells and items including the new, powerful, Epic 2.0.  Lush new areas, filled with beautiful creatures and vibrant, living landscapes await you at every turn.  We hope you enjoy all that EverQuest: Omens of War brings to the game.<br />
<br />
Travel to the Omens Zones<br />
-------------------<br />
The Priests of Discord in Norrath believe they have been granted a gift.  A unique knowledge has been bestowed upon them which they believe was granted as a reward for preaching the way of Discord.  That gift, they claim, is the knowledge of a way to a world that is enveloped by Discord itself -- an ethereal poison that wreaks havoc and strife upon all it touches.<br />
<br />
Speak to a Priest of Discord to learn how to enter the World of Kuua.<br />
<br />
The Task System<br />
-------------------<br />
Only have a short time to play or are you waiting for a group or raid?  Immerse yourself in a Task.  You can find Task Masters all over Norrath. They can be found in most home cities as well as in places like the East Commonlands, the Butcherblock Mountains, Toxxulia Forest and the Swamp of No Hope. For the more daring individuals, the most challenging tasks can be found by speaking with Task Masters in the Dreadlands and the Overthere.<br />
<br />
You can open the task window by hitting Alt+Q and start enjoying this new game-play style and enhancement to the EverQuest experience.<br />
<br />
Be mindful of turning in task items in stacks, as with all quests in EQ, please seperate the items before turning them in for a reward.<br />
<br />
Epic Weapons 2.0<br />
-------------------<br />
Will you be the first of your class to earn these powerful new items?<br />
<br />
Guild Tribute<br />
-------------------<br />
Omens of War expansion brings a new Guild Tribute system. This system will allow guild members to donate items/cash for Tribute points, and allow officers to select benefits that the entire guild will receive, deducting the cost from the guild’s tribute pool.  <br />
<br />
Guild Tribute is an extension of the tribute system introduced in Gates of Discord and purchasers of either expansion, will be able to reap the new benefits.<br />
<br />
Retail Claim Item<br />
-------------------<br />
Those of you who purchased the retail version of EverQuest: Omens of War will need to use the /claim command in-game to receive your in-game items.  Enjoy!<br />
<br />
Select your title<br />
-------------------<br />
You can hit Shift+T to bring up the new Title selection UI which will allow you to choose from the titles you have earned, through AAs, levels or accomplishments, to be shown with your character name in-game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Voice Macros<br />
-------------------<br />
Using Ctrl+V will bring up the new Voice Macro UI.  There you will see a list of available voice macros as well as the options of Play, Tell, Group and Raid.  Selecting a macro and play will play the macro for you only.  Selecting a macro and using one of the other options will send the voice macro to either a tell (using the person you have targeted as the recipient), group or raid.<br />
<br />
To create your own voice macros, make a sound file using the same name as one of the existing voice macros, which can be found in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;Default directory and place it in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;User directory.  <br />
<br />
You can create hot keys of your favorite Voice Macros by selecting the macro you would like and clicking and holding on the Tell, Raid or Group button until the icon appears on your cursor. <br />
<br />
We hope you enjoy this new way to immerse yourself into the EverQuest experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Spell Slot	<br />
-------------------<br />
For the first time in EQ, you can open up a new spell slot by learning the Mnemonic Retention AA ability.  9 Spell slots!  Wow, Why I remember in the early days of EQ, we only had 8 spell slots and we liked it.  We cast spells all day, going uphill both ways.  You whippersnappers have it easy =)<br />
<br />
More Buff Slots<br />
-------------------<br />
If you find that you need more room for beneficial buffs on your character, activate the Mystical Attuning AA and open up more room in your buff slot window.<br />
<br />
Improved Customization for Graphics<br />
-------------------<br />
-There are now 3 sets of options (Spell, Environment, and Actor).  All 3 sets have similar options that affect each type of particle.  These options allow for more customization when setting up your display and filters.<br />
<br />
-An &quot;advanced&quot; button has been added under the display tab in the options window.  This will allow you to toggle some of the new settings, for our new customizable graphics and effects.  You will most likely need to expand the options window to see the new Advanced button.<br />
<br />
- Shadows; Toggles the new dynamic shadows.<br />
- Water Swap*: Switches between old style water, and new reflective water the next time you zone.<br />
- 2.X Pixel Shaders: Toggles the use of pixel shaders 2.0.<br />
- 1.X Pixel Shaders: Toggles the use of pixel shaders 1.0.<br />
- Vertex Shaders: Toggles the use of vertex shaders.<br />
- Sky Reflection Type*: Set to Static to use a preset reflection or Dynamic to have the sky reflected on the water.<br />
- Dynamic Update Interval: Control the CPU costs of the dynamic reflection by adjusting how often to update the reflection texture<br />
- Dynamic Sky Reflection Size*: Allows you to control how large the reflection texture is. <br />
(The * indicates a setting that will take effect next time you zone).<br />
<br />
<br />
- You can now see real time shadows within the world of Norrath.  Use the shadows option in options&gt;Display&gt;advanced to turn them off and on.  Now, even when soloing, you will never be alone.  Those of you with older video cards may have some performance issues when attempting to use shadows.  If your machine does not meet the recommended system specifications, we suggest that you play with shadows off.<br />
<br />
- Enjoy sunsets and moonrises viewed above EverQuest's new reflective water which is available for everyone, wherever there is static water, e.g. Oceans, seas and lakes.  You can toggle the new water shaders on and off using the Water Swap button, under options&gt;display&gt;advanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zoning Screen<br />
-------------------<br />
When zoning, you will now see the loading splash screen.  You have not crashed, do not be alarmed.  <br />
<br />
New Improved Particles<br />
-------------------<br />
-You will now be affected by the environment around you, be sure to check out these effects especially under water, in frigid weather, dry climates and upon death.<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
-------------------<br />
- Clerics Symbol and Aegolism spell lines no longer require reagents.<br />
- Necromancer pets will no longer require peridots.<br />
- The beastlord spell, Tureptan Spirit, now has a healing component.<br />
- New transportation spells are available in the Abysmal Sea.  Check with your transportation spell contact for more information.<br />
- Bard PBAoE spells will no longer damage targets that are moving, however any other spell effects from the PBAoE spell will still be applied to the targets as usual.<br />
- Beneficial spells can now be used in the EverQuest tutorial.<br />
<br />
Skill Cap Changes<br />
-------------------<br />
- Piercing now caps at 250 at level 60 for warriors, rangers and beastlords.<br />
- 1h Blunt and 2h Blunt now cap at 250 at level 60 for beastlords<br />
<br />
Items<br />
-------------------<br />
- The Timespinner pet will no longer cast spells.<br />
- The Dagger of Death has had its AC value reduced.<br />
- Some of the new Omens of War items will now display an &quot;Attunable&quot; attribute, which means that they can be traded freely until they are equipped or augmented.  Attunable augments will become no-drop flagged when added to an augment slot, attunable items will become no-drop when equipped.  You will not be able to auto-equip an attunable item that has not been attuned to your character.  Please be mindful of the new Attunable flag before equipping or augmenting new items.<br />
<br />
Alternate Advancement Abilities<br />
-------------------<br />
- Berserkers have received some new AAs. This should bring their AA selection up to par with comparable melee classes.<br />
- Added the ability for shadow knights to train the Gates of Discord ability Improved Theft of Life and the Planes of Power ability Suspended Minion.<br />
- The healing wards that priests can summon using their Gates of Discord AAs are now immune to most spells.<br />
- Lowered the reuse time on the Magician ability Host of the Elements to 15 minutes.<br />
- Added the ability to train Quick Damage to Magicians as a Luclin Class ability.<br />
- Increased the critical hit chance for the Wizard Gates of Discord AA Frenzied Devastation.<br />
<br />

Now this will without doubt be the 1st AA I and probably a great many other people will get.<br />
Personally still dont think this should be an AA ability.<br />
<br />

If you find that you need more room for beneficial buffs on your character, activate the Mystical Attuning AA and open up more room in your buff slot window.<br />

About time they took gem reagents out.I personally think that 99% of spells that have a gem reagent shouldnt need the reagent.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Attunable&quot; ?<br />
This to me seems a very strange idea from Sony as what it seems like is for example a Sword wont be no drop till you equip it and then it becomes no drop.<br />
Isnt this going to introduce a lot more stuff into the economy which is the thing SoE having been trying to stop lately.<br />
Imagine an &quot;Attunable&quot; TA :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I htink Attunable is designed mainly for the player-made Augs. They are tradable, UNTIL you actually stick it into a piece of gear, at which point it becomes NO-DROP, even when removed. Thus, you cant re-sell them after they become obsolete to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imo a very good (if not the best) way to get rid of bards swarmkiting whole zones with perfect circling due to scripting, really.<br />
The number-restricted bard ae's still have same effect as usual, just the immense swarmkiting will be stopped with this.<br />
From what i read on the sony board, most bards agree on that, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bards can ****, this nerf was long coming and well, well deserved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tebion, meaning some PBAoE songs will still damage mobs because they are limited to a certani number of mobs?  Like the mob limit on rain spells?</div></div><hr />

-------------------<br />
-You will now be affected by the environment around you, be sure to check out these effects especially under water, in frigid weather, dry climates and upon death.<br />
<br />
<br />
I saw this in the beta in Halas. The NPC's (and maybe the PCs but I didn't see anyone else at the time) breath out mist as you would do in RL in a cold environment.<br />
<br />
- You can now see real time shadows within the world of Norrath. Use the shadows option in options&gt;Display&gt;advanced to turn them off and on. Now, even when soloing, you will never be alone. Those of you with older video cards may have some performance issues when attempting to use shadows. If your machine does not meet the recommended system specifications, we suggest that you play with shadows off.<br />
<br />
The shadows were bugged in the beta. You got shadows from the sun indoors. You got shadows for NPCs stood next to a wall being cast on the oposite side of the wall. PoK was a good place to see examples of this.<br />
<br />
Also because the shadows are realtime it makes you realise how quickly the Norrath day goes. you see them moving if you stand and watch for a few mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bards were well aware of the nerf; originally it was going to be quite different but after much uproar and discussion SOE agreed to change it to the current fix above, so that songs such as their AE slow (which has a DoT component) would still be effective. 95% of bards would probably agree the nerf was due... although now they go from kings of solo play to next to useless at soloing.<br />
<br />
I like the attunable concept for items. Its a straight copy of a WoW feature, and it seems to work well there. The voice macros could be fun but I can also see them being abused as people replace them with custom sound clips, and ending up thoroughly annoying. I hope there will be an option to turn them off so you can't hear other people's voice emotes.<br />
<br />
They've added a lot of features (spell slot, buff slots, level 70) that are going to make it very hard for any raiding players to avoid this expansion. Not sure if I can hold out for WoW or not. The task system intrigues me too, gadamit I might have to fork out some more cash for this!</div></div><hr />

BLEH fun for 2 mins then going to drive you nuts.<br />
Been playing with no sound for 4 years now and dont think this will make me turn it on again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, that's not a bad thing, if it's done right.  For most of the past year, I've been using a real-time log parser called EQ Watcher.  It has voice output (need Microsoft Voice stuff, freebie) for a variety of things - and you can program extra's.  The initial setup is extremely annoying, as you get a ding, chirp or bark for every say,shout, ooc, auc, guildchat, chat, etc, etc that comes in.  Which all gets turned off asap, to maintain your sanity. :p<br />
<br />
But it also does stuff like announce slows (when yawn is parsed), chime &amp; announce when aa's are reset (good for canni), and a whole slew of other things.  You can also set it to read any commo out load - I only have that on for tells.<br />
<br />
I really think this is where Sony got the idea, because a rep posted over at the EQ Watcher message boards about voice feedback being a cool idea.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to see the new zones, can't wait to see the titles, and can't wait to get working on my epic.<br />

I like having the sound on because i find hearing the &quot;grunts&quot; and &quot;spellcasting noises&quot; actually helps my play. Might have to turn off with these macros now. <br />

Can't wait to see the new zones, can't wait to see the titles, and can't wait to get working on my epic.<br />
<br />
I like having the sound on because i find hearing the &quot;grunts&quot; and &quot;spellcasting noises&quot; actually helps my play. Might have to turn off with these macros now. <br />
<br />
Can just hear some people spamming them non-stop in groups....<br />
<br />
BST needed an increase to their 1hb and 2hb skills levels so that they can get closer to monk dps, without their pets.  The new heal replaces their group IOS and is basically the same as the Ranger GoD heal.  So, although they can slow 65%, they also get the same self heals that Rangers do, and the best pet heals by far.<br />
<br />
Makes perfect sense to me.  :P</div></div><hr />

Suddenly they get 3 more weapon skills that max to 250, they get a spell they complained about altered and a new heal?  I think they should all heals stripped, much less get even modest enhancements.  <br />
<br />
It's pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Heres their new heal, which replaced their group IoS: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4875&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
I dont understand what the big deal is? We did the same thing when we complained about the disease DoT in Gates and it got changed to a heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The point is, they shouldn't get anything.  Much less a heal.<br />
<br />
This class with *any* kind of extra healing ability will move beyond merely &quot;overpowered&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Plus, with all the legitimate issues by other classes that are struggling more, Beastlords getting three new weapon skills maxed to 250 is a big freaking deal - from a simple dps standpoint, flexibility standpoint, and simple range of stuff to loot standpoint.</div></div><hr />

beasties had heals before, too, it was just the gimpy chloro, but still, was a heal<br />
and that turepta spirit spell wont make them valid whatever healers either, i mean, its only base 525, thats not even a spot. Can save a caster maybe, but really wont mean **** all in all :)</div></div><hr />

I know when I looked at the task system at 65 on beta, there was a whopping 1, which seemed to be more trouble than it might have been worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually, that's not a bad thing, if it's done right.  For most of the past year, I've been using a real-time log parser called EQ Watcher.  It has voice output (need Microsoft Voice stuff, freebie) for a variety of things - and you can program extra's.  The initial setup is extremely annoying, as you get a ding, chirp or bark for every say,shout, ooc, auc, guildchat, chat, etc, etc that comes in.  Which all gets turned off asap, to maintain your sanity. :p<br />
<br />
But it also does stuff like announce slows (when yawn is parsed), chime &amp; announce when aa's are reset (good for canni), and a whole slew of other things.  You can also set it to read any commo out load - I only have that on for tells.<br />
<br />
I can't live without EQWatcher anymore, especially with the buff timer script added into it... to be able to have buff timers announced as to when they are about to expire is simply a god send.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guys... the 250 thing was not really an &quot;improvement&quot; for Beastlords.<br />
<br />
Their Hand to Hand was capped at 250, but their piercing and 1HB were capped at 225 I think.<br />
<br />
So even if they had 3 identical weapons, of each type (HtH, 1HP, 1HB)... using anything but HtH resulted in an ATK drop.<br />
<br />
This change (the skillcaps) ONLY allows them to use other types of weapons at the same proficency (sp?) as their HtH.<br />
<br />
That's it.<br />
<br />
They didn't really get a power increase out of THAT part... just stops them from being forced into HtH weapons (and on that note:  BST/MNK HtH weapons are usually a bit better than 1HB/P... but now they can use that 1HB if they want without the ATK drop).<br />
<br />
Now the spell... that's another matter.... but really.. the skillcaps is nothing more than a toy upgrade for them... which I actually fully support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Select your title<br />
-------------------<br />
You can hit Shift+T to bring up the new Title selection UI which will allow you to choose from the titles you have earned, through AAs, levels or accomplishments, to be shown with your character name in-game.<br />
<br />
Sucks I have had all PC names turned off for a long arse time. So I am not going to be able to see your new title!<br />
<br />
Voice Macros<br />
-------------------<br />
Using Ctrl+V will bring up the new Voice Macro UI. There you will see a list of available voice macros as well as the options of Play, Tell, Group and Raid. Selecting a macro and play will play the macro for you only. Selecting a macro and using one of the other options will send the voice macro to either a tell (using the person you have targeted as the recipient), group or raid.<br />
<br />
To create your own voice macros, make a sound file using the same name as one of the existing voice macros, which can be found in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;Default directory and place it in your EverQuest&gt;Voice&gt;User directory.<br />
<br />
You can create hot keys of your favorite Voice Macros by selecting the macro you would like and clicking and holding on the Tell, Raid or Group button until the icon appears on your cursor.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoy this new way to immerse yourself into the EverQuest experience.<br />
<br />
Some of these were pretty cool. Some of the voices sucked. The one thing that was missing was the &quot;WAKE THE HELL UP&quot; macro recorded at 5 times the normal speach volume! You know the 3am fell asleep at the keyboard macro :)<br />
<br />
Skill Cap Changes<br />
-------------------<br />
- Piercing now caps at 250 at level 60 for warriors, rangers and beastlords.<br />
- 1h Blunt and 2h Blunt now cap at 250 at level 60 for beastlords<br />
<br />
Bout time! It was plain stupid that warriors for one couldn't be max piercing and Beast couldnt be max 2hb<br />
<br />
As for the improved graphics they down right ROCK. The new water is sweet looking! But it the first few times that I looted my corpse after a death I was like, &quot;*** did I leave on my corpse!&quot; Then it faded away. Freaked me OUT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sariss, that way understates the impact of the change.<br />
<br />
Now, the entire universe of piercing, 1h blunt and 2h blunt weapons are as usable to Beastlords as H2H.  The likelihood of getting a better weapon just went up threefold.  <br />
<br />
That's a huge difference.</div></div><hr />

If that means that the player-made augments will be tradeable via bazaar, this is very very cool.<br />

These augment are tradeable... BUT can only be USED once.<br />
They went and stole that &quot;atunement&quot; idea.<br />
As soon as this item is stuck in an item, (it may take wearing the item, I am not sure) it is immediately changed to NO DROP meaning it can then no longer be traded. (you do get a popup confirming you want to atune the item)<br />
<br />
The armor made by smiths and tailors is also atunable, that is definitely &quot;once worn it changes to No Drop&quot;<br />
<br />
Every tradeskill except fishing and research got at least a little something, some for fun... some with uses. None of the ones that got something are teasers like the GoD things that went nowhere... they are at least something.<br />
<br />
So the items are tradable - at first.  You make an item, it gets sold, traded &amp; resold a dozen times.  But once someone actually equips it, it becomes no drop.</div></div><hr />

Bards are not &quot;useless at soloing&quot; with the change.  It ONLY changed Point Blank AOE songs.  It didn't change chants, it didn't change charm.  Bards can still swarm kite.  They cannot AOE kite(that's where they pull 30 mobs and run in a circle, playing AOEs and killing the mobs).  Swarm kiting is where you pull a bunch of mobs, but you charm one of them, it fights while the rest beat on it, when your pet is down to a low amount, you break charm with an invis and then chant it to death and then repeat.  Chant kiting is where you use chants(4 x 142hp dd) on a single mob, running it in circles.</div></div><hr />

No its not, its a straight copy of the spell system in EQ, where you take a tradeable scroll and &quot;attune&quot; it by memming it. Its pretty much the same sort of thing except that they are applying it to some equipment.</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid I just disagree.   There's a ton of BST/MNK only weapons out there, from 17/20 bazaar fodder, up the food chain to whatever GoD offers.<br />
<br />
This change ONLY gives them the flexibility to use other weapons without a penality.     Thats it.   <br />
<br />
They didn't have trouble getting good weapons as it is.    The only advantage now is that they can see different graphics.<br />

I really like it, and think that it is probably long overdue as I have had lots of No Drop items drop that I could have used on another character that I couldn't get to the mob in time to loot.  Would have been nice to be able to transfer the item to the character that truly needed the item before it became no drop.<br />
<br />
I knew about the Beastlord Heal spell, but I didn't realize it was a change made in this patch, I was just using it on my Betabuffed beastlord thinking it was a heal they already had.  I did notice that the spell description was wrong though, and that it was described as a buff (which I /bugged).  <br />
<br />
It's funny though, I have been having bodies fade away for me on the live server since the changes to the client from patching to beta seem to still mostly work on the live server.  The first time I saw it happen on E-marr, I thought to myself, when did they add this to the live servers??  The water was the same way, I actually noticed it for the first time on my live character when I was doing the Test of Patience in Erud's Crossing, haha.</div></div><hr />

It means just that. If an item is attunable it will become No Drop the first time it is equipped. If it is an augment, it will become No Drop the first time it is sealed into an item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Interesting thing:<br />
<br />
I was in a hard ldon with some people from some of the GoD raiding guilds on my server, and when Stone Bracelet of Battle Mastery (LORE droppable, 15k+ in the bazaar) dropped, I was ecstatic, as was the Berserker.<br />
<br />
I had difficulty in convincing the &quot;ubers&quot; that I wasn't a twink alt tho /sigh and they wanted to greed roll cause I was a &quot;twink&quot; (get real).<br />
<br />
They moaned about it, but as the Berserker was from their own guild they let the 2 of us roll and i was lucky enough to win :)<br />
<br />
Just wondering if these &quot;attunables&quot; will encourage the same sort of &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot; behaviour from the ubers who want to twink their alts over a main who needs loot or just for bazaar greed.<br />
<br />
I've always been a massive fan of NO DROP gear. You have to &quot;be there&quot; to get the item rather than just be rich, and ubers can't just farm the camp 24 hours a day (ornates in sol ro) and then sell to the rest of the server at a massive profit.<br />
<br />
Not all will agree (the rich) and I respect that.<br />
<br />
Either way, it shall be interesting to see which way it develops.<br />
