<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Discovered last night that using Spirit Call when you have a pet up and buffed will clear the little pet buff icons. At first I thought somehow he had been dispelled but a /pet report health showed the buffs still there. The icons reappear when one of the buffs wears off or you cast a new one on him. No big deal just thought I would share so other folks could /bug this problem in game.<br />

Oh and the window isn't resizable vertically and the bottom two buttons are no longer showing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn, that means I'll probably have to revert to the stock pet window.  And I love my little 3tabpet mod.</div></div><hr />

And I thought I was the only person to be haveing problems getting it resized.  I had the window right above my chat window and the pet window is now cut off where it should have been overlaped by the chat window.  I now have two buttons on the window to use.</div></div><hr />
