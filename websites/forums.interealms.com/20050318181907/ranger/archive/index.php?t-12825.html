<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently Stamina gives Rangers 4.2 hp per point at level 60. If you have ND maxed and PE, it gives roughly 4.7. However, Stamina past 255 does not give the same ammount. Stamina past 255 currently gives roughly 2.5 to 2.6 per point at level 65, maybe even a bit less than that.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think this sucks. Stamina for all classes has had its use diminished severely past 255.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone see any real reason to max Planar Power? I can't think of one. 10 points to me is simply not worth an extra 60-65 hit points currently. You do get more Atk... but considering it's Strength Atk, it doesn't really do anything. It's only 22.5 more Strength Atk at that - basically a way to make your Magelo profile look pretty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting the automatic 5 to caps raise each level is more then enough for me at this point, when I still have POP skills to get, as well as some SOL skills still on my list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kariena</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I actually put 8 points into it becuase I had an interest raising it to what sta i have, but doubt I will train the last level, that 40hps wasnt worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm wondering, but do casters get a reduced amount of mana post 255 as well?<br />
<br />
if not then I think it definatly needs to be looked at, especialy since they get to raise their int/wis up to 355, we can only raise our sta to 305.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, I'm pretty sure they get the full value from wis/int past 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotane Shagaminn</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Smoke and mirrors.  It is sorta like that Headshot thing.  Hours and hours of time spent to earn AA points for a skill that, besides a neat sounding ability, provides no real productive benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamotracker</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't STR affect maximum damage as well? Or is maximum damage based off ATK too?<br />
<br />
Also don't underestimate the DEX for increased procs, or the WIS for the soloing ranger.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also a lil AC from the AGI never hurt, and its only a lousy 2 points.  Not like you're wasting 9 points for MGB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strength caps really early, and even earlier for Rangers with Atk items.  It only effects your max to a certain point, most Rangers probably cap around 200-220 as is.<br />
<br />
Dex has extremly diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
I don't know any Rangers with over 255 wis, let alone the 280 cap you have just for being 65.<br />
<br />
Agi, like dex, has extremely diminsihing returns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hopwin</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought that even past 200 (yes even after they raised the cap to 255) casters got diminishing returns for wis/int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toof</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure if pop changed anything but until 200, int wis gave 12 mana/point, 201-255 it gave about 5.8 mana/point. (at level 60)<br />
<br />
before, 201-255 gave only 1 mana/point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toof</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if i read you right, sean, that would be an extra 125ish hp from the 50sta gain, which isn't that bad.<br />
<br />
if i had 200 aa points to throw around planar power would be in the middle or towards the end of what i'd spend it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's 25 Sta gain, not a 50 Sta gain. You gain 25 naturally by leveling to 65, 5 per level. To get the other 25 you have to pay 10 AA points, which is simply not worth it for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toof</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahh k.  bleh, hehe.<br />
<br />
bottom of the barrel, then :)</div></div><hr />

If you've got a primal and have your dex capped (265 for me atm) you'd be shocked at your proc rate. It's insane.</div></div><hr />
