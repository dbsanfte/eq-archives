<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thermo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friends and I have a 5 man group.  We are looking to add a 6th to complete the group and one of them is willing to play another character.<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind that the 6th will be a background character, and will have to level(with our help) to 51+ to group effectively with us.<br />
<br />
So far, good suggestions have been:<br />
<br />
another rogue<br />
wizard<br />
monk<br />
<br />
These purely for the added dammage potential... since we already have tank, healing, slow, dmg, mana regen, snare, ect.<br />
<br />
Your suggestions, and mostly &quot;why&quot; you are making your suggestions, would be extremely helpful.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jonoisgod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I would go with chanter...much better hastes, more mana regen, makes crowd control easy so bard can twist away...etc. My second option would be wizard for evac, snares (sk will have difficulty snaring while being main tank) and stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say Enchanter (though Bard can do most of that) or a porter of some form so you all can go into Howling stones, the Hole and get around easier ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wizard.<br />
<br />
Ports, TLs, BOOM, stuns, another snarer, fun and effective AAexp skills, fun and effective mob specific spells, easy/cheap to equip 1-50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definately wizard for transportation and DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Monk :) Good damage, can pull well (and have the SK tag), can take a lickin' and keep on tickin'. Nothing's wrong with a melee heavy group, it's what most groups are these days, plus you'll really rip up a zone like howling stones in no time.<br />
<br />
Or I'd suggest a necro. I love that theft of vitae spell with all my heart. Nice snares, can heal in a pinch, tough pet, etc. all adds up to a mean addidion to your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wizard, easier to move around and decent dmg, bards &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enchanters in most situations.<br />
<br />
edit:assuming the bard isnt too lazy :) a chanter takes less work to play well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wizard or another rogue/monk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">everyone knows beastlords now own with the latest patch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wizard is always a good choice for travel and big nukes. <br />
<br />
Necro would be also be good for their pets, DoTs, group taps, ST mez, snare (epic is a 1100dmg snare) , and secondary rez - if party bites it, rez the cleric and then the cleric rezzes everyone else. Necros are extremely versatile.<br />
<br />
Enchanter, hmm...Crack, mez, nukes, and charmed pets.<br />
<br />
Any of these would be good choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would say Wizard for the porting/evac and the big nukes for later on, the porting especially to help with traveling.<br />
<br />
Enchanter sounds good as well but you do have a bard that could subsitute somewhat for the enchanter unlike the Wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">druid for similar to wiz with added DS and track. Otherwise just go for melee dmg with rogue/monk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happens if one or more of your members don't log on?<br />
<br />
Rogue? Ok kills go slower.<br />
Bard? Shaman can &quot;ghetto mez&quot;<br />
Cleric? Shaman can heal.<br />
Shaman? Ok the safety net is gone.<br />
<br />
SK? Tell me who's going to tank? The Bard? The Shaman? Not efficiently.<br />
<br />
Warrior? Booooring.<br />
SK? Repetitive in a single group.<br />
Monk? Sadly no. Hurts me to say but not the best alt tank.<br />
<br />
Cough Ranger Cough<br />
<br />
DS, snare back up, track, forage, med to high  dam output, can tank (some), spot heal and is fun to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would go all out for more damage, rogue or monk.  Necro is a consideration.  Ranger can do the job as well, but need more in the way of top-end equipment.  The group you have is practically invincible defensively already, but does not have a lot of sustained damage output.  <br />
<br />
Damage=xp.  If you went with something like an enchanter or a warrior, you would basically have one xp generator (the rogue) splitting xp 6 ways.   The closer you get to a monk-rogue-rogue-rogue-rogue-utility group the better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mez agree wid Faern<br />
<br />
Ranger would be a very nice addition.<br />
<br />
Da other reasonable choice would be Wizard.  Wizard wid eveacn lets joo get more agresive about where joo go to hunt.<br />
<br />
Monk / Rouge add more damage to da group but no flexability.  For da long run mez would sacrifice some exp grinding uberness for more flexability.<br />
<br />
The further joo get from da monk-rogue-rogue-rogue-utility group the less experiance joo get but the more fun joo get also.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wizard or Ranger.<br />
<br />
Rangers tank surprisingly well and can put out some serious damage.  Wizard for nukage and ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, you really didn't say what kind of content you were doing. Also, who will be playing this character?<br />
<br />
I doubt a highly needed bard would be able to twist songs and play a rogue for the added damage without getting agro.<br />
<br />
If you are doing alot of big type mobs, a warrior would be best for tanking. Since you have a cleric for complete heals, it would save mana instead of healing an SK. Also, warriors do a good amount of damage.<br />
<br />
If you feel the SK is good enough, and all you are looking for is damage, I'd have to agree, a wizard or rogue would fit in nicely. Depending on who is playing it. I'd probably choose a wizard since it's much easier to just sit him down and nuke when needed. Plus it would make transportation to places alot easier. Another advantage is he can hit most targets that other casters can't, and if you get into a situation when something needs to die fast, well, that's a wizards area.<br />
<br />
The downside would be powering the wizard. It will take some time to get him to 40, which is the minimum level he can group with the 60's, although at 38 he could team with the shaman I believe. If the bard has the right click DS he could throw that on the wizard, then add some cleric/shaman buffs and porcupine in unrest to 30 fairly fast.<br />
<br />
The other notable damage dealers would be a ranger, druid for nukes/ds/utility and ports, and monk.<br />
<br />
If I had to choose, I'd go with wizard. Hard work at first, then just sit him in the background while he gains easy experience and helps with ports/damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Since you would need to powerlevel them up I would go melee all the way. I know there *are* ways to level a caster up..but they seem rather involved. <br />
<br />
The possible exception would be the pet classes since you can just power level their pets. So Magician or Necro would be the way to go there. <br />
<br />
Warrior&gt;&gt;Ranger&gt;&gt;Monk&gt;&gt;Rogue&gt;&gt;Paladin&gt;&gt;ShadowKnight. <br />
<br />
The order is just based on ease of play. Since you are looking for a decent damage dealing secondary that would be my choice of order. The only reason Ranger is ahead of the monk is because of tracking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Enchanter - No question</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">how about a 60 shaman? heh, it can't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">well if youre saying wizard...how bout a druid then?  maybe not as much damage potential, but you have nukes, dots, and backup emergency healing in addition to the transportation...<br />
<br />
<br />
kinda galls me im advocating the creation of another druid, but oh well :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Make sure you have a sacrificial gnome for good luck. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If it was my group, I would choose an enchanter. If you guys want to gain the most xp in the least amount of time or want to do things that are quite challenging for a single group, go with an enchanter. Bard song + clarity / KEI makes for a group with virtually no down time whatsoever. <br />
<br />
If travelling is a big concern for you, go with a wizard. Wizards are also great in a pinch because they can add a whole lot of damage in a very short period of time.<br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't choose a druid over a wizard because you've already got a secondary healer in the shaman, and the druid's damage shield, while nice, has greatly diminished returns because of the shaman slowing. <br />
<br />
A monk / ranger or another rogue would help you kill faster, yes, but with an enchanter's speed and clarity, I don't think it would make much of an appreciable difference. A warrior in your case doesn't make much sense to me, as the SK can tank extremely well at level 60 and can hold agro like nobody's business. A mage or beastlord can do a lot of damage, and with the pet changes coming up would be a fearsome addition to your group, but don't really measure up to a wizard or enchanter.<br />
<br />
In short, in my opinion the key to a good group is diversity. It doesn't really matter what you pick in the long run, as you sound like you already have the foundations for an extremely solid group :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wizard makes the most sense as a 'fire and forget' class -- you would only have to run them for snare and periodic nukes (easy enough to macro together with a sit). Enchanter (sadly) and melee are both out, because you really need to run them full-time -- and I would be wary of a pseudo-AFK pet class in a dungeon.<br />
<br />
 It's going to be a pain to get them to 40, and even after that they'll only mostly be porting for a while. Still, it seems to make the most sense, as all you're missing is ports. That group as listed could hunt about anywhere, so transportation is probably the most important thing to add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would say ditch the SK for a good warrior but that leaves you minus snare.  Other than that I would definately say a Rogue or Monk for that extra damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Enchanters are nice for some things but a good bard can handle crowd control just fine.  I have seen some bards play better than enchanters.<br />
<br />
You want that extra damage to make things go faster, and a 60 cleric can more than keep up with the heals.  This group shouldnt have any downtime even without a chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A skilled bard &gt; chanter.  EQ lived almost 3 years without KEI, you can live without it even longer.   I personally would go for a warrior.  With the nexus and bard speed who cares about ports.  A warrior, SK, Rogue, shaman pet/dots, and bard songs is plenty of damage output imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Druid.<br />
All around usefull class in addition to being a porter. . The fact that one of you already skilled folks will play the druid means that you won't have to put up with the normal folks that play that particular class.  <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that you won't always be 6.  Often the cleric won't make it, or the bard will be gone.  Druid and shaman make a good team for support.  I should know, I've done enough of those type of groups.  <br />
<br />
And a druid in chardok who knows what he/she's doing with animal charms, with a shaman to back them up, with new pet rules . . . amazingly helpful with that pet doggie.  Charmed NPCs really are sick, and nothing says sick like a charmed Chokidai Mangler.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a thought, somewhat different from what the others are saying atm.  <br />
<br />
You need a porter to tackle many dungeons if you go deep in.   HS is very helpful to have a porter along.  <br />
<br />
Also a class I'd strongly consider is Magician.  These guys put out a LOT of dmg lately, and the new pet rules make their pets a real asset.  Plus the utility is useful, modrod2 with Torpor makes for fast mana for whoever is lacking.  CoH is nice for pulling, splitting, and retrieving groupies who fall in the pit traps in HS.  <br />
<br />
There are lots of fine options,  these are only two.   The important question is &quot;What does the 6th person WANT to play?&quot;</div></div><hr />
