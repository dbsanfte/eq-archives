I've managed to see a few of us in there, including Zunayn, Greaux and Shibbi, and I heard that Aruman was also in it, but these are the only ones that I've recognized so far.</div></div><hr />

From what I can tell, most of the people who were copied were the ones that hit /beta on the night that they signed up for beta.  I personally hit it that night on val and I got transfered (albeit I was transfered into the middle of Txevu :(  I have two other accounts from which I transfered three total other characters, including the ranger and beastlord and I have yet to see any of the three transfered.. and they were all /beta'd on the day after the beta opened.</div></div><hr />

On the behalf of all of us who are happy with one, i'd like to ask you, /feedback every day on everything that is discussed here.  Beta's in EQ's are probably when the devs take their vacations.  They never seem to DO anything with that time.<br />
<br />
Better yet, concoct a scheme to stop Omens from launching for at least another year.  2 expansions per year is TOO MANY.  One per year is reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, I know there is an NDA but some things you who are in may want to look for to /feedback are:<br />
<br />
1.  Are stat caps raised so that new stat buffs make any difference?  If they are raised, does the stat buff make a significant difference?<br />
2.  Casting times on nukes.  Are they reasonable for the speed of fights?<br />
3.  Are heals enough, and fast enough, to matter?<br />
4.  Is slow viable?<br />
5.  Does the new cripple spell make a difference?<br />
<br />
The big one that is gonna make or break OoW will be the availability of spells.  I'm sure they are vendor purchased in the OoW beta like in GoD.  When it goes live if they are as bad to get as the GoD ones it will really kill EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that spell availability is part of what is breaking EQ. But also the vast difference of availability of other upgrades. Theres a massive difference in what one level 65 can get compared to another depending on what kind of guild they are part of and how many hours a day they can play. Yet all level 65s use the same spells.<br />
<br />
If I bought OoW (which I right now dont think I will) and the spell availability is like in GoD that would make 3 expansions (LDoN, GoD and OoW) i dont have a single spell from. And in PoP in bought all my spells. So there is a total lack of sense of accomplishment. I almost hope they keep up this system in OoW so that it will be much easier to stop playing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>BurgBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Also, the only bottle neck with GoD spells is a lack of mobs / spawns dropping them, not where they drop imo.

<br />
The shaman spells in LDoN are buyable with points:  650pts for Bane = 13 adventures.  If you don't have it, then it's because you couldn't be arsed to do any adventures.  <br />
<br />

Compared to PoP and GoD, I'd say that its about as difficult (or maybe a little easier) than PoP. So far, mind you, I've only been in about four zones... perhaps the raid content will be different or something.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you are trying to say here but what I wanted to know was if OoW has a never approach to how you get spells or if its the same old drag as GoD.</div></div><hr />

What you are saying is not interely true but its a good question.<br />
<br />
 If your primary reason for getting expansions is to get the spells, but you are not prepared to play to earn them, what are you doing in game?<br />
<br />
Spells arent my primary reason, I never said that. I like to see new zones and monsters and maybe find a quest or two that is doable and relevant. After a while I have seen some of the PoP zones and done a few quests. I have tried all the different LDoN themes. I have seen 1 zone in GoD.<br />
<br />
 It's not like they are hard to get. The hardest of course are the GoD ones, but thats mainly because they are uncommon drops off uncommon mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I agree that spell availability is part of what is breaking EQ.<br />
Honestly Spirit, this makes little sense to me, and after reading some of your rebuttles it makes even LESS sense.<br />
<br />
Do you have all your PoP spells? Did you have them within 6 months of the expansion shipping? How long were you 65 before you finally got that last lvl 65 spell? Is that the problem? The spells say &quot;lvl 65&quot; so you think you should just get them? Do you have RGC?<br />
Guessing no. <br />
<br />
Did you play Kunark? Velious? Luclin? How long did it take for you to aquire all your spells in those expansions? Torpor, Malo, Ancients, etc. <br />
<br />
Are you basically annoyed because they didnt give out any &quot;freebies&quot; in these last couple expansions? Nothing you could buy right off a vendor.<br />
<br />
Spell aquisition as always been an evolving process in EQ. From various combinations of vendor-sold/mob-dropped spells, to questable ones, to &quot;non-class specific&quot; drops, to LDoNs adventure point system, to ancients, to research, etc etc etc. <br />
Spells arent my primary reason, I never said that. I like to see new zones and monsters and maybe find a quest or two that is doable and relevant . . . I have seen 1 zone in GoD.<br />
Why? Seriously. Because you read stuff here and decided it wasnt worth your time? Wait, its too far, too hard, no graveyards, it sucks, some-other-reason. Wow, why are you still playing again?<br />
Things that are &quot;not hard&quot; for you might be different for others.<br />
Whew. Thank god too. Because its my personal feeling that EQ is already far &quot;too easy&quot;, I couldnt imagine trying to make it even easier, so &quot;others&quot; won't have as difficult a time.</div></div><hr />

The guy said he wanted adventure, etc. But honestly, this excuse is just a cop out, sorry. One zone? There are 3 zones a 65 shaman can solo EASILY in. <br />

<br />
<br />
I have to agree here.  I have had one GoD group outside of my guild.  It was very bad to say the least.  The only groups I tend to get when I use LFG is BoT, PoV, and Ldon.  This make it very hard for the unguilded or low end guilds to get any of there spells or the low end god upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Just my 2 cps worth from a non-uber shaman in a guild that is still working towards elementals. This is not intended to be a flame. If you only sit somewhere and put LFG up all the time then you are correct you will see very little GoD content. When I'm on I throw LFG up, if I don't have a group in the ten minutes or so it takes me to refresh my C and run to Barindu, then I start looking at the list of LFG and make a group. Very, very rarely do I have a full guild group. Very few are interested in GoD atm in my guild, so its my own personal challenge to make it to KT (without Smith raid). It will still take you a bit to put a well balanced group together for the trials, but it can be done. I have one sewers trial, Vxed and Tipt completed(which I know isn't much), and have done Vxed and Tipt many times with pick up groups successfully. I have been playing for awhile and have a good reputation for being a very good shaman. Even if you don't have an uber guild, long friend list, or great reputation, it doesn't take long to put some people together and take a swing at it. As long as you are knowledgable about your class, the zone you are in, and lead well, even if you lose the trial, many will still flock back to try again at a later time. Unfortunatly, I have only seen two Yiktu stones drop and lost roll both times to rangers.  :(  Got to get me some new dice!!<br />
<br />
Bottom line is if you are willing to do the research and lead well even in failure, you will have loads of fun and see some great exp and loot in these GoD trials (even if you don't win it). After awhile you will build a great reputation and people will start looking for you even if LFG isn't on. GoD content is hard and not ment for the faint of heart or impatient. Its defin not like BoT or normal LDoNs, where you can grab any LFG and go exp. It takes some stellar performers (and I don't mean uber geared or 500+ AA) who know and play their class well, and a little bit of strategy. Flame away if you want, but GoD is my new hunting grounds whether its solo or grouped and its a blast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it is hard. In places. But You really should visit Riwwi. There are some very good (Better than ornate but without effects) armours there. All of it doable by a Shaman / SK combo that is not uber.  Not even elemental with no dragon or Large target god drops.<br />
<br />
A single group of non elemental planes can survive and prosper in Ferubi. You will die some learning it. (Make sure you can summon bodys) You can't take out the bosses of the zone. But there is more than enough to do there. <br />
<br />
Quinmi has some things but I havnt done a tremendous amount there due to too much time in Riwwi. Only so much time in a day.<br />
<br />
You should visit Gates again. It is worth it for the non raider. Just bring a friend or two. Not all of gates is shaman unfriendly. The trials are simply a result of the pure goal oriented. They want it over fast and easy as possible. And Shaman are never fast, and rarely easy to be around. <br />
<br />
Go some. And if you need pointers send me a tell. I will be glad to help some where I can. <br />
<br />
Please note none of this is trials. Just regular zones that you can probably get upgrades in. If not you sure can sell it and buy some upgrades. Plus it is fun. The trials you should attempt if you can handle Hard LDON or have farmed ferubi a pretty good amount.<br />

Outstanding post Snoww. Just a quick mention about this area, there are events here that are easily doable by a less-geared group of solid players. <br />
<br />
This expansion also has a quest that seems like it would appeal to everyone, BiC. While there is some multi-group content in the quest, there is a LOT you can do as a single group, and even solo in some cases. Another thing that Gates has is SOLID EP level XP, just in the Vxed and Tipt trials alone. Enchanter + Shaman combo is a group in Vxed. Add support for the pet. Period. Snarers, Rooters, some healing, a puller (lots of options) and off you go. It doesnt really take a 6k/6k chanter with tons of uber gear and a billion AA to charm in there, competence is all thats required. You might even spawn a named. <br />
This make it very hard for the unguilded or low end guilds to get any of there spells or the low end god upgrades.<br />
Then its hard. Not sure what else to say, honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">GoD is almost fine.  <br />
<br />
It represents a lot of improvement over PoP imho.  Except spell distribution.  Spiritblood is a bad posterchild, but spell distribution is increasingly BS.<br />
<br />
I've spent a fair amount of time in GoD, and I got one spell.  And I was lucky to get that.    <br />
<br />
They need to do better in OOW, or this game will in fact wither more than it is now.  <br />
<br />
You can't release a product like GoD.  I'm still amazed that fiasco occurred.  But it's largely fixed now, and there's a lot of good there.  I understand initial bad preceptions remain, but things are better now.  And shaman are still perfectly viable in every part I've seen (KodTaz access last night).  <br />
<br />
It's worrisome that OOW doesn't sound like it's really going to get much beta testing though.  It sure sound like they are making the same mistakes in OOW as they did in GoD.  <br />
<br />
I hope you beta-testers are putting in lots of hours for my benefit!</div></div><hr />

LOL, ok, fair enough. I will concede this point to a degree. The spells SHOULD be semi-tradable, or at bare minimum, have an alternate path to the spells. I didnt mind the PoP system too much, and I enjoyed questing for my LoY spells. I didnt mind paying the points for Bane in LDoN either, in fact, I did that FIRST, once the whole camp-points-payment thing was figured out. And I am not a huge LDoN fan. I like it, but I only have 1 piece of armor, the 760 legs, with a BA4 aug and 40 hps on it. <br />

Heh, you DO realize that we are all beta testers, and that we have beta-tested every expansion we have bought so far. This is nothing new. Yeah, Gates was an idiotic move, it should have been polished up LONG before this, but what else is new with these guys. I tell ya, thats one of the main reasons I like the &quot;niche&quot; in the progression I am in with my guild, because usually, by the time we get to a stage in the game, the bugs have been worked out and the events are much smoother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The only groups I tend to get when I use LFG is BoT, PoV, and Ldon.  <br />
<br />
That does kinda stand to reason . . . pretty much anyone can handle those encounters.  GoD is not for the faint of heart.  You are gonna die.  Yes, you.  You are gonna lose encounters.  You will fail.  Often.<br />
<br />
That is called challenge.<br />
<br />
Now, by no means do I believe that additional tuning isn't in order for GoD.  By no means do I believe that Shaman are &quot;all set&quot; for GoD.  But I do believe that GoD is very close to being where it needs to be.  Far closer than it was at release.<br />
<br />
However, when using the LFG tool, expect to get offers for &quot;less than cutting edge&quot; encounters.  That is just the nature of it.  If you want to do cutting edge content, you need to know people who are doing it or form the group yourself.  If I was putting together a group for GoD I certainly wouldn't use LFG tool to find a Chanter.</div></div><hr />

So if I am reading this right you before this post take your time to flame me for wishing spells were somewhat easier to get and then you later agree that there might be room for improvement?<br />
<br />
And you admit that as it is now you and your guild probably have the easiest time of progressing through content yet you earlier flamed me for saying that everything is not equally easy for everyone?<br />
<br />
I should probably point out that I dont want everything easy but I wouldnt mind if everything was equally hard. And, yes, that means that I think things should scale to how many is doing them and how many AAs they have and what equipment they are using. I want challenge as much as everyone else.<br />
<br />
You dont have to waste your time responding because I just about lost all faith in ever understanding what makes people like you behave like that.</div></div><hr />

That is correct. Equal to what, exactly? Oh, and while I agreed that the spell distribution engine in Gates could use some TUNING, I didnt say it needed an overhaul, or that it is &quot;part of what is breaking EQ&quot;, not even the tiniest bit. I'm sorry its not equally as easy for you as it is for me (oh, BTW, I have no Gates spells, and I am not KT flagged, lacking Tipt), and the 5 guilds above and below me on the &quot;Power Meter&quot;, but I certainly do not want this type of thing made THAT much easier. Why must we continue to lower the standard, to some common denominator of gear or AA. Its harder for you. Sorry. Want some tips on how to make it easier? Read some of the less abusive, negative threads and look for more positive thoughts. You have been to one zone in Gates? /boggle<br />
<br />
Sorry Spirit, but you just have a negative attitude. The glass is always half empty for you, and thats a shame, because I am going to assume there was a point in this games history that you actually enjoyed playing.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you missed some of my post I was agreeing with what Kilodeo was saying. <br />
 &quot;The only shaman I know with anything from GoD are the ones who have their &quot;special&quot; group they are able to go with. The rest of the shaman I know are having no luck either getting groups there to do any trials.&quot;<br />
I dont see any difference between what he said and you said.  Except that you wouldn't want a GoD group with someone you don't know using the LFG tool either.</div></div><hr />

Last night they opened it briefly again although I dind't see a message for it.. you just had to get lucky and happeend to look at the webpage and notice that beta was open again.  I managed to tell my guild and we got alot more in last night. <br />

All those that have their characters copied we are all relying on you to let soe know what you think about everything - Please this is one time where you should nitpick and be fussy about things. Remember the attitude that 'well its still in testing and will probably be fixed for live' does not always work - if you see something that you feel is useless or broken for shaman be vocal about it :)<br />

Really sad they keep asking people to join the beta in the patcher and that GMs keep serverwide emoting to log into beta and then they never get around to copying folks over.

Fix: Sit with the &quot;That zone is unavailable&quot; message on character select for a couple minutes. Eventually you'll be moved to bind point, or home point, or, basically, somewhere up.<br />
<br />
By the way, this &quot;trick&quot; also works for &quot;linkdead while inside LDoN and don't make it back until it's over&quot; as well as for when zones crash.</div></div><hr />

Spells arent my primary reason, I never said that. I like to see new zones and monsters and maybe find a quest or two that is doable and relevant. After a while I have seen some of the PoP zones and done a few quests. I have tried all the different LDoN themes. I have seen 1 zone in GoD.<br />

Things that are &quot;not hard&quot; for you might be different for others.<br />
I'm glad there are still people like you around.  In the game for the adventure and experience of it.  Dunno why Blazz finds it so hard to believe that there are people out there that don't feel the need to strive to be the best, the fastest, or the best fastest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Similar here, I just want different scenery as much as the next guy, but don't have the time, or tolerance, to sit around for 4-6 hours in a sitting, bored, getting to that point. That's not the point of a game, they're supposed to be fun, not tedious timesinks. (see: VT key, will never do it unless they fix the timesink aspects)</div></div><hr />

Where did I say I am not in the game for the adventure? I am certainly a LONG LONG ways from the &quot;best&quot; or the &quot;fastest&quot;. I just dont care for people that whine about stuff being too hard when they havent even bothered to put in any effort whatsoever.<br />

You dont wanna do the new content, fine. Skip anything you feel is over your head, I could care less. But stop trying to adjust the game to YOUR idea of difficulty. I am not KT flagged. I have no Gates spells. I have 2 items from Time, both T1 drops. I am NOT even close to uber.

That too.  The 65 shaman they stick you with has managed to choose about the worst possible setup of AA's I could imagine.  About the only thing they did right was buy Cannibalization...and that is it.  I didn't pay attention to the skills though, what did they do wrong there?</div></div><hr />
