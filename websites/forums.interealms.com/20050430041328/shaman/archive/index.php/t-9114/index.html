   There is a tradeskill mod in game where you replace window_X with a listing of tradeskills.  just tabs with pics to show and all that.    I was wondering if any of you can put the slowing guide onto a mod like that.  I reference it a lot as our guild grows, but would LOVE to have it in game instead of on another window/comp.</div></div><hr />
