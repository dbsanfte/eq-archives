THINGS YOU'D LOVE TO SAY AT WORK, BUT CAN'T! <br />
<br />
1. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit. <br />
2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce. <br />
3. How about never? Is never good for you? <br />
4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public. <br />
5. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to worship me. <br />
6. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter. <br />
7. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message... <br />
8. I don't work here. I'm a consultant. <br />
9. It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying. <br />
10. Ahhh...I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again... <br />
11. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid. <br />
12. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers. <br />
13. I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn. <br />
14. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. <br />
15. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. <br />
16. Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view. <br />
17. The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist. <br />
18. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. <br />
19. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!? <br />
20. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. <br />
21. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. <br />
22. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial. <br />
23. And your crybaby whiny-assed opinion would be...? <br />
24. Do I look like a people person? <br />
25. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting. <br />
26. I started out with nothing &amp; still have most of it left. <br />
27. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer. <br />
28. If I throw a stick, will you leave? <br />
29. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed. <br />
30. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed. <br />
31. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. <br />
32. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door. <br />
33. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1? <br />
34. Too many freaks, not enough circuses. <br />
35. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it? <br />
36. Chaos, panic, &amp; disorder - my work here is done. <br />
37. How do I set a laser printer to stun? <br />
38. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted paychecks</div></div><hr />
