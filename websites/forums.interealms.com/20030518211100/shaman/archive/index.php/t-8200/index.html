<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have acheived level 65 and have all my basic aa skills needed for a happy shaman canni 5 regen 3 mgb with a few PoP abilities as well, virulent paralysis, spirit call and radiant cure.  Anyway I find myself being a groups main healer again in places like PoV, and while I can keep up with contant pulls it doesn't allow me too much room for dps, so I thought hey, I'm a priest lets spend aa pts in crit heals and such so it will free up my time here and there.  I wasn't sure if you could crit kraggs mending or not but I have seen clerics critical complete heal so i figured we could to.  Thats where i went wrong.  I am sure there is some long dead thread around here about this and shaman being pissed off since to me it seems all priestly aa pts and PoP extenstion (advanced healing gift/adapt) are totally useless to us since we use kraggs mending and torpor almost exclusively.  Sure I use tnargs too but only to save someons bacon (usually my own) but not nearly enough to warrent crits etc.  I'd like to know what other shaman are spending aa pts on.  Right now I'm going for ND2 then ND3.<br />
<br />
I also had this thought.<br />
max out healing gift and adapt and PoP abilities with them (this will take like 40 plus pts) and snag an improved healing IV focus effect, maybe a mana pres IV too.<br />
<br />
This would turn tnargs into a healing spell that adds 40% to its base 1300 or roughly 1820 (kraggs is 1950).  That also has a chance of criticalling for double healing 3640 about 20% of the time.  bonus is this at least equates itself to kraggs mending as well as has less than half the casting time.  With a mana pres IV item the cost would come out to be the same as kraggs mending (450 - 10%= 405), not significantly more than 400.  Anyway its a buttload of AA to spend to make oneself only a slightly better healer but I was wondering if anyone has tried this or finds my logic totally flawed.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had the same thought as you did. I've already got a improved healing IV item which is nice since it already pushes TM up to 1500ish heal. I figure that a bit more mana for a bit less healed is definitely worth  it for 1/3 the cast time and not having to worry about meming 2 spells.<br />
<br />
I haven't yet started working on the aa skills yet since I'm still going after other things but that is on my eventually list. Since aa points come pretty easily and I expect to spend a fair amount of time camping spells, working on flags and even getting some exp on raids now I will eventually get the aa points to burn on healing skills.<br />
<br />
Just on the pure healing adept side of things I see 12 points for the archtype lvl (2,4,6 points) and then 6 more points for the Advanced assuming it goes 2 per lvl since it's a flat 3% each time. So that looks like a total of 18 points and I would move KM to the back end of my spell book.<br />
<br />
Another 18 points on crits would just be more icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />
