I have fairly high level chanter so I troll their boards too and someone made post to find where would be the best place for you character to retire it was a fun post lots of ideas and I thought it would be nice to see where all those old war veterans would lay down for their final rest when and if that time ever comes. Also why you would choose that place to add colour to the descriptions :D<br />
<br />
I for one think it would be nice to go back to my home town of Halas and sleep there as my final resting place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Halas in front of the trainer is quite a common place for barbarian shaman to camp out. A few of the old timers have camped out there. Ceno for one springs to mind.<br />
<br />
My friend asked me to Lev him and bind him in mid air over the hole. He clicked off lev and went splat. He died about 20+ times down there before he /quit. He wanted something that was going to be unique and I'm pretty sure it was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Someday down the road when and if my time comes, I'll camp out and quit in one of three places, all are sort of a calming/serene place for me.<br />
<br />
I'd camp at the feet of my King and ancestor(yay for RP!), King Raja Kerrath in Shar Vahl, or perhaps where it all began in the shaman's quarters of Shar Vahl, camp whereI first spawned as a young kitten.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if the first two somehow could not soothe me for a final resting place, I would camp finally in The City of Mist right after the two spawns near the bridge.  City of Mist was a huge home to me in my (i think) late 40's early 50's, spent all of my time there, it's like a home.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Good question. For the Monk, it's either Cabilis, or Crystal Caverns (home away from home for many many levels back in the day) or perhaps Raster's cave in LGuk, although I got lucky and bagged him after 6 hours or so.<br />
<br />
For the Shaman, who follows Inny, the stairs in Hate are probably as close to home as it can get, what with Grobb overrun and all.<br />
<br />
The rest will just go to their home cities, except for the Druid, who always wandered around, so I am not sure what the best resting place would be. WC, perhaps?</div></div><hr />

Who knows, perhaps Chutoi can stick his head in to help train the newbie shaman as they learn.  It's a nice thought, anyway, that your character could take his experiences and train others in the ways of the shaman.<br />

<br />
I do like Iceclad a lot, soloing lodi really helped me get better at soloing. Dont ask me why, but until that point, soloing had never been my thing, and he was the first big thing I soloed. So many memories from that camp, and im glad to have it be my final home. Hunting the turtle, like I am captian ahab, for all eternity.</div></div><hr />

I spent so much time there learning where things were, and fighting other players who were also in the town getting spells and such. Come to think of it, almost all of the old world zones bring great memories back. Perhaps I could camp out in the Arena, where a young shaman could make his way through the fields and plains to gain a small bit of advice or so, then I could beat him down and give him a pat on the back.Who knows, good thread though.</div></div><hr />

I think this is the one you're referring to Jenguran...<br />
<br />
Those that cancelled...where did you perma park your shaman? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21161)<br />
<br />
Same still applies for me (except for the fact I returned home to my Shaman where I belong) so I'll just quote myself....<br />
<br />
When I do decide to hang it up for good (which I have for the most part... play an SK on a different server now /em rolls his eyes), I think I'll park my butt in Blackburrow.  That was the first his first stop out of Everfrost, and where I had my most memorable times, back when it was all about the fun, and not about the xp/loot. <br />
<br />
  I'll find an un-twinked newb shaman in zone and put all my dropable equip in a trade window, destroy the ND stuff.... and camp out naked like I started.<br />
<br />
BlackBurrow is still my favorite zone in EQ.  The looong nites breaking and camping Elite Room and / or Ledge.  The zone wide &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE&quot; shout every 5 or so minutes.  The first time I was able to solo Lord Elgnubb, just to say I could, then offering Baby Joeseph Sayer to any melees in zone who wanted it.<br />
