<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's still early days I know, but I'm wondering if anyone has noticed significant price drops in their server yet?<br />
<br />
On Sol Ro I've observed:<br />
- Torpor, now averaging around 60k where as it was 80-100k before.<br />
- Pox of Bertie, Very rare to even see it being sold, but I've seen it going for 5-15k.  Seen it going for 40k in tha past.<br />
<br />
That's the only one's I've really noticed so far, how's it going on other servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't noticed any great changes in Spell price or availability so far... But at 52 I only cast a casual glance at 60+ spells, really. I do find it amusing that people still try to sell Spirit Quickening for 1k though... <br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Tal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On Quell, Torpor still 100k +, Malo 80k, Avatar 25k, Pox 30k, Tigir's 10k, etc etc.. you get the point.   Price gougers still out there.<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The question is, what are the prices of the research components that matter?</div></div><hr />

Malo usually was sold at 40k. I have seen it as low as 25k in the last days<br />
<br />
Plus, i bought Malos for 5k yesterday :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been checking bazaar for words of sapient and revenant every day, so far I've not seen either for sale.<br />
<br />
If you ask me, the drop rate on level 60 spell components is too low, at this rate the higher end guilds will be hoarding them and none will filter down, or they will be auctioned at ridicuous prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its hard to tell if prices have changed when spells are almost never for sale. I think I have seen Pox of Bert for sale twice in the last year. And both times for some insane price exclusively based on rarity and not on usability.<br />
<br />
After it was made possible to research it I check every time I log on and I have yet to see even one of the items needed for sale.<br />
<br />
So to me it looks like SoE *again* managed to mess things up. The last couple of weeks I have primarily been figthing mobs that are low 50s to high 50s and I havent seen a single research item drop. Messed up like only SoE (Verant) can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have not seen any affect of research spells on Karana.  No increase in spells for sale - no lower prices.  May take a while to get research up and running though.<br />

Ugh.  Nothing bugs me more than one shaman charging another shaman too much for a spell that we all need.  Even though the price is much more moderate that some that Ive seen for that spell (60K+) it still makes me ill.  <br />
<br />
And we wonder why our spells cost so damn much?  Be part of the solution, not the damn problem....</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it was selling in bazaar it would have probably just been bought by someone that would mark up the price anyway.  The problem isn't that people sell spells for this price, the problem is that people are prepared to pay for it.  If no-one was to buy these spells marked at 60K etc, then people would eventually drop their prices.<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't have either Torpor or Malo, I am not in a raiding guild though so I imagine that makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">24k is by no means unreasonable for a spell of that power. Not saying it should be that price, but it is most definatly not unreasonable. I have yet to see any change on Torv in regards to spell prices with research now in. People still trying to sell the lev/breath spells for 10-20k, still haven't seen PE, and torpor/malo still above 40k if up at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Malos is down to 25k ish on Stormhammer. Malo is about 30k. <br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh is about 90k still. <br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar is about 30k.<br />
<br />
Quiescence, when it's available, sells for between 30k and 100k with an average price of around 50k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They will drop soon. The MOST expensive I've seen a new research component going for is 1K. Even at that price, both malo and torpor could have all components bought and a very high level researcher hired for under 10K. People will eventually figure that out.<br />
<br />
but the quest is, if once they figure that out, will the prices on spells go down, or the prices on new research components skyrocket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For those of you that didn't know and may have a int caster alt lying around with a lot of unused skill points, unless they changed it in this very last patch you can train research all the way to 200.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">On mith marr <br />
<br />
Fot7- 75k (only 1 copy for sale atm )<br />
Malos- 20-30k (over 10 copies total from various vendors)<br />

Blood of Saryrn- 25-40k<br />
Ferine Avata-30-50k<br />
<br />
Malo-30k (this is kind of funny considering the availability and price of malos)<br />
<br />
Torpor -39-45k<br />
<br />
I have not seen research affect the spell prices for any int casters spells yet. Sunstrike still going at a steady 25k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">On Povar:<br />
<br />
Torpor 40kpp to 60kpp (bought mine recently for 50kpp)<br />
Malo 30kpp (dropped for me)<br />
Pox of Bertox~ 15kpp to 20kpp (bought mine for 13kpp)<br />

Tigir's Insects 5kpp to 15kpp (bought mine for 100pp)<br />
Voice of Beserker 15kpp to 20kpp (don't have yet)<br />
Talisman of Raptor 5kpp to 10kpp (sells high, I'm guessing cause some want to fill out their spell books, I dont know :P )<br />
Bane of Nife 1.5kpp to 5kpp<br />
Form of the Great Bear 500pp to 3kpp<br />
<br />
Lvl 63-65 spells<br />
Vary from 4kpp to 100kpp<br />
<br />
I'm assuming with added ability to gain these spells by research, the prices will drop 25% to 50% in the next few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">On Seventh I haven't seen malo or torpor for sale in quite a while and I check at least 2-3 times a day for spells.  I would guess malo is still around 50k and torpor 60-70k.  Though that is about 20k less than it was pre-pop.  I have seen Malos and Q for sale fairly frequently lately for around 100k each.  Still haven't seen any other 65 spells on Seventh yet but those 2 seem to come up almost everytime I check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Morrighan Dreamwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No significant changes on A Ro. Malo/Malos/Topor/Quixxx all going for around 50k. Funny thing, no one is buying (at least not last week, haven't checked in the past few days). Same vendors are pretty much selling the same spells for the same price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ugh.  Nothing bugs me more than one shaman charging another shaman too much for a spell that we all need.  Even though the price is much more moderate that some that Ive seen for that spell (60K+) it still makes me ill.<br />
<br />
I paid 60k for malo - it never dropped for me when I needed it. I was prepared to work hard for malo and torpor (torpor did finally drop for me after 3 months on GWs (the 168th GW to be exact).  I'm not guilded, I had to get these spells the hard way.  I find the idea repugnant that I should be censured for selling at 24k.<br />
<br />
A couple of blindingly obvious points:<br />
<br />
1.  Shaman who aren't prepared to camp for these spells make the situation worse as they increase demand for the spells without increasing the supply.  Thats simple economics.<br />
<br />
2.  Expect to pay too little for a spell and it is no longer worth those who are prepared to do it actually camping it. Once they have the spells themselves they will just move on.  My group can't do dragons, the SF GW camp is lousy for experience: we either do it for the money we make off the spell drops or we don't do it at all.<br />
<br />
I think I am owed an apology.<br />
<br />
Edit: 'camping' instead of 'doing' in point (2).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">On BB, people have been heckling the sale of malo for 40k.  Not sure if it sold at that price or if the seller lowered it, but haven't seen a copy up in a couple days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Whats on sale in bazaar on Xegony right now, one of each:<br />
<br />
Malo: 60k<br />
Torpor: 90k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So far the researchability (is that a word?) of spells hasn't affected anything on A Ro as of yet- I've yet to see any valuable shaman research parts for sale in the bazaar, even the junk that's there is now priced as if it's the finished, researched spell. For example, the words needed for levitation (just half of the spell recipe) are like 5k atm.  <br />
<br />
I think research was a great idea and I realize that it's still early on, but thus far it's another idea that's great in theory, not working in practice. I foresee the deaths of many, many, many guardian wurms in my near future before I ever see Pox, Avatar, Torpor, Malo, etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Prices seem to be dropping on Prexus<br />
<br />
new 65 spells started around 80k, most down to 40-60k now, seen most of them for sale<br />
61 pet started at 20k, now down to around 2k, most other 61 62 spells around 1k<br />
63 64 spells mostly around 5-10k<br />
old 60 spells malo around 25k and torpor around 30-35k<br />
<br />
wish I had a way to make that kind of money fast for the 65 level spells, hopefully they will continue to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Schysm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I was 2 min from logging off, and decided to check bazaar again one more time for a few spells i was missing.. as im level 60 and am probably missing 1/3 of my 55-60 spells. so i walk into bazaar, open up the window and start scrolling down the list... when low and behold i see POX for sale! i jumped out of my seat and ran around thumping my chest with glee, only to realise i didnt look at the price :(. so i sat down, fully prepared to have my heart ripped out... when i glanced over and saw it was for sale for not 5k, not 10k, not even 20k... but 500pp. yes, five hundred. i was floored, i ran around screaming lookin for the vendor and finaly found her.. only to realise my cash was in bank! argh, so i hauled ass to bank 1 and loaded up what little cash i had, and jammed back to her. still there... i scrolled through the list for what seemed to be a life time when i finaly highlighted Pox of Bertoxxulous.. i fumbled around as i tried clicking the buy button. finaly... it was in my possession! then i noticed while scrolling down further that she had VoB and Talisman of the Raptor for sale too! and i nearly cried when i saw the prices... 250pp each. so i bought up Voice, TotRaptor and Pox for a total of 1k. needless to say, i was a very...very happy shammy. ive never ever seen pox sold in bazaar, nor voice and raptor is normaly 10k.. i see malo/torpor alot more than those 3.<br />
<br />
maybe prices are going down... btw im on Firiona Vie. till i can find torpor.. ill live happily with Stoicism wich has worked just fine and dandy for me thus far.<br />
<br />
good luck fellow shaman on collecting these valuable spells! i wish ya luck.<br />
