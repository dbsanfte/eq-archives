<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
The mood struck me to try my hand at EQ fan fiction.  I've had a rough idea for a plot swimming around in my head for quite a while, but never got it down in print.<br />
<br />
So anyway, submitted for your approval, the first of many installments of &quot;Snowreader&quot;:<br />
<br />
Snowreader<br />
<br />
“I am sorry,” said the Hierophant Aelwyl.  “Her life force is not strong enough.  It will extinguish soon.”<br />
	<br />
Ioemir reached down to touch his infant daughter’s face with a quivering finger; she grasped it with her tiny hand and smiled, gurgling out a laugh.  He fought back the immense weight of sorrow that was suddenly dropped upon his heart.  A Champion of Faydark was taught to accept the will of Tunare without question and emotion.  Why then was this so difficult?  After all, it was a mere infant – one soul among thousands.  What could the life of one elven child possibly mean to the grand scheme of Nature?<br />
	<br />
“Why do you hide your true feelings, Ioemir?” asked Aelwyl.  “There is no shame in shedding tears for those you love.”<br />
	<br />
“A warrior of Tunare sheds no tears, M’Lady.  Not even for those he loves.  How fares my love, Nao’lya?  Will she recover?”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, in time she will regain her strength.  But it was a difficult childbirth.  She is drained, both in mind and body.”  <br />
	<br />
“Are you certain there is nothing that can be done for my child?  Ymeal, have you no healing magic to offer?”<br />
	<br />
The high elf straightened himself from the doorframe upon which he was leaning and stepped to the bedside.  Chanting quietly to himself, he passed a hand over the cooing infant.  A blue, ethereal glow illuminated his pale flesh and that of the young wood elf.  <br />
	<br />
“Forgive me, Ioemir,” said Ymeal.  “No magic I possess can reverse this.  The healing spell I have cast upon her can only delay the inevitable for a short time – one moon’s cycle, perhaps two.  It’s as if Tunare Herself has embraced your daughter’s soul and is drawing it closer to Her bosom.”<br />
	<br />
For the first time in his life, Ioemir was completely powerless.  He had defended Kelethin for many seasons against scores of foes – dark elves, orcs, undead.  But one, tiny infant had rendered him helpless.  The specter of death had no flesh to cut at, no heart to pierce with a well-placed arrow.  Not even the life magic of a high priest of Tunare could mend his child.<br />
	<br />
“Can no one help my daughter?  Can no magic keep her soul in this world?”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl stepped outside and watched the tops of the great evergreens sway to the rhythm of an afternoon breeze.  “Perhaps there is someone who can help.  An old friend –“ the hierophant caught herself – “A former friend.  I only hope there is enough goodness left in his heart to aid you.”<br />
	<br />
“Anything,” Ioemir said forcefully, stepping beside Aelwyl.  “I will give up all the personal wealth I have.  Please, M’Lady!  I beg of you, contact this person.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl’s thoughts wandered briefly to the past.  “Very well, I will do what I can to summon him.  But it may take some time, for he lives far, far from here.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
	<br />
The setting sun’s rays seemed to bathe the great snowy field in a blanket of fire.  Deep blues and purples melted into warm oranges and yellows, reflecting and dancing off of long icicles – remnants of ancient waterfalls that once bore witness to another land, green and fertile.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm Snowreader emerged from his hut, overlooking the frozen village of Halas.  In the streets below, he watched life pass as it had for countless days – merchants bringing in their goods for the night, hunters returning to their homes with the day’s kill, Old Man McGrinnim would be hauling in his final catch of the evening.  Change in Halas happened very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  Then again, time had little meaning to his people.  In a land of eternal winter, there is no way to distinguish one season from the next.  Even the passage of long time is measured only from one generation to another.  Besides, there were more important things to concern oneself with than what hour it was – such as whether there would be enough food to eat, or whether one would live to see the next day.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm stepped back into his hut and draped a polar bear skin tightly across the threshold.  The small, central fire began to die.  He threw another twig into the flames and pulled his cloak closer around him.  Tonight would come to bear what the elder shamans of Halas had begun to suspect – the days were growing colder.  Some prophesized that the coming cold marked the beginning of the Slow Dying – a time when the final generation of all Norrathians would be born and wither away into freezing darkness.  Yet Heldorm was the Snowreader, he who could read the mysteries of the land by its ever-shifting face.  Everyone looked to him for answers, some kind of absolution that he could not offer.  Only the Tribunal could tender such things, and they rarely interfered with the lives of mortals.<br />
	<br />
“Heldorm!” a loud voice called from the distance.  The shaman stood from his fire and peered from around the bearskin.  At the foot of the hill stood two figures, half-hidden from a snowfall that had begun moments before.  One wore the distinct clothing of the Wolves of the North warrior clan.  The other was much smaller in stature, draped in a hooded cloak.  Heldorm trudged to the bottom of the hill, where the watchman greeted him.  “Beggin’ yer pardon for the interruption, Venerable One, but this stranger insists on seeking yer council.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm looked the petite outsider over apprehensively.  He tried to peer under the fur-lined hood, but the stranger shied away.  “Aye, well,” the Snowreader finally said, “no sense in freezin’ out ‘ere in the cold, ‘specially for someone small as ye.  Come in an’ warm up a bit.”  The stranger bowed and continued up the hill.  Heldorm saluted the watchman, who return the gesture and marched back toward his post.<br />
	<br />
Stepping back inside the hut, Heldorm addressed his visitor, “Ye must have important business to travel to these lands.  My people don’t always take kindly to stran –“ He stopped as the stranger removed her hood to reveal a familiar face.  “Aelwyl!”         <br />
	<br />
The wood elf smiled at Heldorm and said softly, “Hail to you, again, old friend.”<br />
	<br />
“Old friend?  I’d say that’s a bit of a stretch.  What do ye want of me now?  Another chance at twistin’ my heart around?”<br />
	<br />
“I see you still have not forgotten the past,” the Heirophant said looking into the fire.<br />
	<br />
“How could I forget it?  An’ I thought traveling ‘ere was against Tunare’s wishes.”<br />
	<br />
“I had to take that chance, Heldorm.  There is much at stake.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm laughed quietly before saying sarcastically,  “Aye, I’m sure there is.”<br />
	<br />
“I thought your heart might still be hardened,” Aelwyl said coldly.  “I just never knew it was made of stone.  Forgive me for disturbing you; I can see this was all a mistake.  Fare thee well, Heldorm.”  She threw her hood back over her head and walked to the threshold.<br />
	<br />
“Wait,” the shaman said with a deep sigh, just as Aelwyl was pushing aside the bearskin, “I suppose ye would not have risked this if ‘twere not important.  Tell me, what is yer problem?”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl turned her head slightly and let the bearskin fall back in place.  “For what peace of mind it may bring you, what I ask of you is not for my own sake, but for that of an innocent child.  She was born with a weak life force, which diminishes by the day.  A high priest of Felwithe has blessed her to the extent of his abilities.  His magic has extended her life for a moon’s cycle, perhaps two.  But she needs something more permanent, something infused with the healing powers of the earth.  You know of what I speak.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm looked back toward his racks of herbs and vials.  “Ye know that I could never find its recipe.”<br />
	<br />
“Surely after all these seasons you have made some progress?”<br />
	<br />
“Some, aye.  But there’s still somethin’ I’m missin’.  I feel that I’m close, but can never quite get there.”<br />
	<br />
“So will you help her?”<br />
	<br />
“I suppose this child is back in Kelethin?”  The shaman asked after a lengthy pause.<br />
	<br />
“Yes, she is.”<br />
	<br />
“An’ I also suppose ye’ll be wantin’ me to come back there with ye?”<br />
	<br />
“Yes, it would bring her poor father some comfort.”<br />
	<br />
Heldorm pushed aside the bearskin and looked down on Halas again.  The streets were now deserted, save for a few patrolling watchmen.  “Well, ye know I have a duty to the people of Halas . . . but I suppose there’r shamans wiser than I that could be watchin’ over things for a bit.”<br />
	<br />
Aelwyl smiled and softly touched Heldorm’s arm.  “Perhaps your heart was not totally hardened after all.”<br />
	<br />
“Alright, let’s see this child.”<br />
	<br />
The Hierophant called loudly upon the great winds of Tunare.  A great gust, which seemingly came from nowhere, blew into the hut and opened a shimmering portal, through which the two priests of Nature stepped. <br />
	     <br />

<br />
Meklozanth ran his shriveled fingers over the orb’s smooth surface, briefly leaving five glowing lines of energy.  The gray mist that once hung motionless inside the orb, now churned and collapsed into a swirling maelstrom.<br />
<br />
“Five hundred years,” the aged Tier’Dal addressed the orb in a raspy, tainted voice.  “That is how long I have searched for the root of life, the very heart of immortality.  And you, my Xanzokek, have brought me to the brink of that discovery.”  Images began to form within the swirling mist – nameless faces of every known race.  “You seek out the dying and reveal them to me.  They mustn’t be too old, however.  The younger they are, the stronger their life force, and the more youth is returned to me.”  The mist slowed and centered in on one specific image – a young child, almost newborn.  “Hail, what have we here?” <br />
	    <br />
The mist diminished somewhat to reveal the child’s features – lightly tanned skin, still darkening to its natural copper hue; pointed ears, not yet their full length.  “Ahhh, a Fier’Dal, and a child at that.  Most excellent.  And tell me, Xanzokek, where might I find this child?”  The misty image panned upward to a rolling canopy of evergreens, above which the first stars of the evening eagerly peeked through the sky’s blue-black veil.  “Kelethin,” the dark elf smiled, beckoning in the air with his index finger.  Behind him, three skeletons clad in chain mail and holding short swords clattered to life.  “Perhaps it is time I paid homage to the children of Tunare.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
While the wood elves of Kelethin were not unaccustomed to hosting other races within their city, a visitor from Halas was a unique experience.  Most wood elves had never seen what they called “barbarians.”  From the moment Heldorm stepped through the portal, he was greeted with stares and excited whispers.  Standing over seven feet tall, the shaman found himself ducking and crouching more than simply walking through the tiered structures of the tree city.  <br />
<br />
Aelwyl led Heldorm to a log house tucked into the south corner of the city.  Outside, Ioemir and Ymeal were talking and drinking from silver mugs.  Upon seeing Heldorm, both elves stood and stared in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Is this the man we seek, Aelwyl?” asked Ioemir.<br />
<br />
“Yes, his name is Heldorm Snowreader.  Heldorm, this is Ymeal Whitesoul, cleric of Felwithe, and Ioemir Enothie, defender of Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm bowed to each and turned to Ioemir.  “Yer the father seekin’ help I assume?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I am at your service,” Ioemir kneeled, still craning his neck to see the full height of his guest.  “You’ll forgive me if I seem taken aback, sire, but I have never seen a barbarian in the flesh before.”<br />
<br />
How Heldorm hated that word – barbarian – it suggested incivility and ignorance, neither of which he considered himself.  Nonetheless, he swallowed his pride and motioned Ioemir to stand.  “Please, no need to be kneelin’.  I’m no king, just a servant of the Tribunal.”  He glanced toward the house, a dancing ring of torchlight emanating from its window.  “The child is inside?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, please, come in.”<br />
<br />
The four entered Ioemir’s house and walked to the large bed, in which Nao’lya and the child lay resting.  The burning torch cast a soft, yellow glow upon mother and child, blanketing them in a serene shroud of light.  Nao’lya stirred and slowly blinked open her eyes.  Upon seeing Heldorm, she gasped and stood up with a start, pulling her child to her.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright, my love,” said Ioemir, comforting her, “he’s here to help.”  The champion gently took the child from his wife’s arms and held her before Heldorm.  <br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” the shamans studied the infant.  “Ye have any warm water by chance?”<br />
<br />
“I heated some not long ago for a kettle of spiced ale.  The water should still be warm.”<br />
<br />
“Take these herbs then, and mix ‘em in some water.  Have yer child drink it all.”  Heldorm reached into a small pouch tied to his belt and scooped out a pinch of dark green herb shavings.  As he poured the mixture into Ioemir’s hand, he asked, “Does she have a name yet?”<br />
<br />
The question caught Ioemir off guard.  “Honestly, we were in such a hurry to save her, we never decided.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, ‘tis a shame.  No child should be without a name.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir said nothing, but began to stir the herbal brew.  When the water was golden-brown, he carried it carefully over to his daughter and pressed the bowl to her lips.  The child resisted some at first, but soon began to take tiny sips until the bowl was empty.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Heldorm nodded slowly, “that should help ‘er fend off any illnesses or bad humors, until I can mix up somethin’ stronger.”<br />
<br />
“So you do know of a cure?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I wouldn’ exactly be callin’ it a ‘cure.’  ‘Tis no disease yer daughter has.  I may be able to whip up something that –“ Just then, another wood elf entered the house.  She paused for a moment to behold the barbarian, but quickly turned back to Aelwyl.<br />
<br />
“Pardon the interruption, M’Lady, but there is a matter that requires your attention.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, thank you.  I must take my leave for now, I shall return soon.”  The Hierophant and the messenger left; Heldorm studied the child and stroked his thin, short beard.<br />
<br />
“Ioemir, a word with ye alone, please.”  The two stepped into the brisk night air, the silhouettes of ancient evergreens towering above them like giants.  “Look,” Heldrom said in a lowered tone, “I’m promisin’ ye nothin’.  Truth is, Aelwyl has more faith in me than I do.  There’s this elixir I’ve been workin’ on for some time now.  I’ve gotten close many times, but ne’er could quite get it right.”<br />
<br />
“What is the purpose of this elixir?”<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s another thing, see, I can’t rightly say since I’ve never made it . . .” Heldorm glanced around briefly before leaning in toward Ioemir and continuing in an even lower tone, “But between you an’ me, I’m thinkin’ it extends life, an’ more.”<br />
<br />
“More?”<br />
<br />
“Aye, I gave some of the batch that I was testin’ to a wounded mason near death back in Halas.  The next mornin’ he was up runnin’ around and doin’ the work of two men.  That man is still livin’ today, stronger an’ more alive than ever.”<br />
<br />
“This elixir you speak of sounds like the answer to our problems!  You say you have not yet perfected it?”<br />
<br />
“I’m still missin’ one ingredient, though, the key ingredient, actually.  And that’s the problem – I dunno what or where it is, haven’t a clue.”<br />
<br />
“Well, can you not give my daughter some of the incomplete elixir?”<br />
<br />
“To be tellin’ ye the truth, I’m not too keen on the idea of givin’ her the complete one even if I can make it.  An’ the ingredients are very potent, even for one a my kind.  The mason I told ye about was a full-grown man.  The effect such a concoction could have on a sick wood elf child could be . . . well, could do her more harm than good.”<br />
<br />
“You have to try, Heldorm Snowreader.  You must try!  Please, I beg of you!”  Ioemir knelt before the shaman again.<br />
<br />
“Now see, there ye go again,” Heldorm looked around nervously as curious townsfolk began to form around him.  “Get up, man, yer startin’ to draw a crowd.”<br />
<br />
Ioemir stood and pleaded a second time.  “Alright, alright,” Heldorm sighed.  “I promise ye I’ll do what I can.  When Aelwyl gets back I’ll have her return me to Halas so I can –“<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid that won’t be possible,” Aelwyl’s voice suddenly announced.  The crowd parted as she approached the house.  “I have just held council with Mother Tunare Herself.  My use of the sacred winds to travel to your lands has upset her.  She has forbade me further use of them.”<br />
<br />
“What!  Fer how long?”<br />
<br />
“I know not.  Perhaps a few days, perhaps forever.  I do not question the will of Mother Tunare.”<br />
<br />
“Very well,” Ioemir said bluntly, straightening himself, “then we must return to Halas without the aid of the great winds.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, we must,” Heldorm said just as Ymeal joined them.  “I can’t do this alone.  I’ll need yer help, and even that may not be enough.  Like I told Ioemir, I promise ye nothing’, but I do promise ye to do the best I can.”<br />
<br />
“That’s all I ask . . . friend.”  Ioemir extended his arm, fist clenched.  Heldorm hesitantly locked his arm around the Fier’Dal champion’s and nodded.  Ymeal then joined them without hesitation.<br />
<br />
“Alright, we do this together.”  Heldorm then turned to Aelwyl with a look she’s seen before.<br />
<br />
“Stop right there, Heldorm Snowreader!” she said with a start.  “You’ve gone mad if you think I am just going to stay here.”<br />
<br />
“Aelwyl, listen –“<br />
<br />
“No!  You listen!  My people believe we are all responsible for each other.  If I stay here doing nothing, than it is no different than walking away into the forest forever and abandoning that child.  I will do no such thing!”  The Hierophant collected herself for a moment and continued, “Besides, what this . . . party needs is woman’s touch.  Allow men to run off on their own designs and Tunare knows what havoc will follow.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm exhaled a long, loud breath.  “I could never stop ye before, so there’s no sense in tryin’ now.  Just try to stay outta trouble, and my way.”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough.  Now that that’s settled, we must prepare for a short ride to Butcherblock.  The fastest ocean-going vessel in these lands docks there.  And we must make haste!  For every moment we spend doing nothing, the more life slips away from the child.”<br />
<br />
The four were given mounts below the great tree city of Kelethin, and rode off into the night toward the land of the dwarves.<br />
    <br />

Part III<br />
<br />
Luclin hung shining in the night sky like a silver coin catching moonlight at the bottom of a well.  Soon after the moon had reached its perch, the four travelers arrived at the outskirts of Kaladim.<br />
<br />
“Halt, there!” a guard announced.  “Who seeks to enter the realm of Kaladim?”<br />
<br />
“Watch this,” Heldorm said quietly, stepping down from his horse.  “I’ve seen the elder shamans do this trick.”  He towered over the dwarf guard, who held his ground, bravely looked back up at the barbarian.  Waving his hand across the dwarf’s face, the shaman said, “Our business is none of yer concern.”<br />
<br />
The guard remained still and silent.<br />
<br />
“*Ahem*, we don’t look like we’d cause any trouble,” Heldorm continued, waving his hand again.<br />
<br />
The dwarf did nothing.  Heldorm looked quizzically back over his shoulder at his companions.<br />
<br />
“Ye will let us pass.”<br />
<br />
“Oh enough of this,” Aelwyl floated down from her horse and strode up to the guard.  “Excuse me, sire, we simply seek sea passage, nothing more.  We will be through your lands as quickly as possible.”<br />
<br />
“Very well,” the guard replied hesitantly.  “Be on your way.  But straight to the docks with you, if that be your only business.  I’ll be keeping an eye on you all.”<br />
<br />
“See,” Aelwyl said re-mounting her horse with a satisfied smile, “a woman’s touch.”<br />
<br />
“’See, a woman’s touch’,” Heldorm repeated in a quiet, mocking voice.  He followed his companions past the dark granite Kaladim gate, where the first soothing scents of the sea reached his nostrils.  As the archway that opened to the docks came into view, a hint of the sea’s rhythmic breathing filled the air.<br />
<br />
The Stormbreaker was already releasing incoming passengers as the four rode up to the port authority.  After all dismounted, Aelwyl muttered something in Elvish to the horses, which soon took flight away from the docks.  Within moments, all were filing onto the ship.  As Heldorm was about to step onto the gangplank, someone draped in dark silver robes nudged into him.<br />
<br />
“Eh, now watch it there –“ the shaman stopped in mid-sentence as the robed figure’s eyes caught his; they flashed bluish-purple, mesmerizing Heldorm where he stood. <br />
<br />
“Heldorm?  Heldorm?” Ioemir shook on the barbarian’s arm. <br />
<br />
“Wha?!”  <br />
<br />
“You were staring into thin air for a few moments.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, I was just talkin’ to this . . .” But the stranger had vanished.<br />
<br />
“To whom?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, I guess he’s gone now.  He was right there.”<br />
<br />
“I think the salt air’s gotten to you a bit, my tall friend.  Come along, we should get this voyage over with as soon as possible.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, perhaps yer right.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm and his companions settled down into a cozy niche on the deck as The Stormbreaker, with a brief shudder and sharp creak of wood, disembarked toward the human settlement of Freeport.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luclin had reached its zenith in the sky.  Aelwyl averted her gaze from the moon and sat next to a dozing Heldorm.  Sensing her presence, Heldorm scooted away and closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Do you think there are people like us on Luclin?” Aelwyl asked, returning her gaze skyward.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t know,” Heldorm responded after an intentional silence.  “Probably not.”<br />
<br />
“Well I believe there is.  Tall, slender men and women with flowing hair and elegant dress; great palaces of emerald glass that shine like the sea in sunlight; ageless forests that blanket the land.”  Aelwyl pulled her shawl tighter.  “I do hope someday we will be able to travel there.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm laughed quietly beside her.  “Travel to Luclin, eh?  An’ how would we do that?”<br />
<br />
“A grand ship that travels through the heavens, perhaps.  Or a sorcerer may yet find a forgotten portal.”<br />
<br />
The shaman just let out a short hmph and dozed off.  Aelwyl rose slowly from the deck and walked toward the bow of the ship.  Ymeal suddenly stepped beside her, “Pardon the intrusion, M’Lady, but I sense some tension between the two of you.  Is everything alright?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, yes.  It is . . . a long story.  I would not want to bore you with it.”<br />
<br />
“No trouble at all, M’Lady.  If you do not wish to speak of it, it is not my place to question your past.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl sank for a moment into memory.  “It has been a long time passed.  Heldorm was hoping for something that I could not give him.  My oath to Mother Tunare overshadowed all others, but he still could not come to terms with that.  So, we took our separate paths.”  She paused a moment to watch a shooting star streak briefly through the night sky, slicing the heavens just beneath Luclin.  “Now our reuniting is bittersweet.”<br />
<br />
“Say no more, M’Lady, I understand.”  Ymeal briefly placed his hand on Aelwyl’s shoulder in a small gesture of comfort, then stepped back to his place beside Ioemir.  The Hierophant stared into the light-speckled darkness for a long while before sliding down onto the deck in slumber.<br />
<br />
<br />
“M’Lady?”  Ioemir’s voice slowly leaked into Aelwyl’s mind, like a cool spring seeping to life.  “It’s time to wake up.  We’ve arrived.”  With a strong stretch and deep yawn, the auburn-haired wood elf rose to behold the bustling docks of Freeport.<br />

<br />
“M’Lady?”  Ioemir’s voice slowly leaked into Aelwyl’s mind, like a cool spring seeping to life.  “It’s time to wake up.  We’ve arrived.”  With a strong stretch and deep yawn, the auburn-haired wood elf rose to behold the bustling docks of Freeport.<br />
<br />
“Where is everyone else?”  Aelwyl asked quietly, still pulling away the soft blanket of sleep.  “I see everyone but Heldorm.”<br />
<br />
“Heldorm is . . . errm . . . negotiating us passage through the Commonlands.”<br />
<br />
“Oh by Tunare, don’t tell me is trying those mind tricks again!”<br />
<br />
“No no, he’s speaking to the local stablemen, I just don’t think he’s getting very far with them.”<br />
<br />
Aelwyl sighed and stepped off of the dock steps.  “Very well, I suppose I need to go find him and set things right . . . again.”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take the three long to find Heldorm.  After all, a seven-foot barbarian arguing loudly with three stable masters tends to attract attention.<br />
<br />
“I don’t get it,” Heldorm fumed, as his companions walked up to him in the stables.  “I offered ‘em a fair price, but still they won’t budge.”<br />
<br />
“Look, folks,” the stable master, a stout, stern-looking fellow, stood up and gestured to the wagons in his possession.  “10 platinum per head is as low as I can go.  I’m trying to run a business here!”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps we should find an alternate means of transportation.  Would you not agree, Heldorm?”  Aelwyl added quickly before he had a chance to argue.<br />
<br />
“Aye, aye, alright.  We’ll jus’ leave.  Wagons looked like buckets o’ rusted bolts anyway.<br />
<br />
“What was that?!” The stable master yelled after them.<br />
<br />
“I said, ‘and ye try to have a nice day’!”<br />
<br />
A large, murmuring crowd of spectators greeted Heldorm and his companions as they entered the open plaza of Freeport’s Western Gate.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, I wonder what’s going on here,” Ymeal asked trying in vain to crane his neck above the crowd.  <br />
<br />
His question was soon answered, however, as a small, loud voice shouted, “Yes, folks!  Step right up and feast your eyes on the latest mechanized wonders from Ak’Anon!”  The four adventurers were able to squeeze through some of the crowd and catch a glimpse at the source of the spectacle.  There, in the center, were a gnome draped in a red robe, and, seated next to him, an ogre – yellow-skinned and green-eyed, smiling gingerly.  The gnome pulled away the cover of a large table before him, revealing several metallic contraptions, the functions of which neither Heldorm nor any of his associates dared to contemplate.  The crowd ooed as the afternoon sun reflected from the polished surfaces of the inventions.  “Firstly,” the gnome picked up a T-shaped object with a screw in the middle and small, cupped panels on each end of the two wings, “have you ever come home from a long day out hunting or adventuring, and all you wanted to do is sit down, relax, and have a nice tall glass of cold ale?”  The crowd responded in a mix of murmurs and nodding heads.  “You sit back into your chair to rest, but that cool glass of ale is sitting there on the edge of your table, taunting you.  You try and try to summon the energy to reach for it but you just can’t quite do it?  Well!  No more!  With the help of my assistant, I will demonstrate.”  The gnome handed the contraption to his ogre assistant who immediately sank back into his seat.  The gnome then poured a tall glass of ale and set it on the edge of the demonstration table.  His assistant then reached out with the T-shaped contraption and . . . just missed the glass.  The ogre squeezed and squeezed on the end of the device, making the two arms open and close with a distinct clicking sound, but never did these arms once touch the glass.  The crowd erupted in laughter.<br />
<br />
“Wait wait, me got it!”  The ogre announced suddenly.  And indeed, he did have the glass of ale.  In fact, he had it to the point that not only did the glass shatter into several shards, but the device promptly followed.  The crowd’s howls grew louder.<br />
<br />
“A waste of perfectly good ale that was!”  A voice shouted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah and of my time!”  Another followed.  The crowd dispersed in a din of conversation and chuckles, leaving the two salesmen alone and covered in foamy ale.<br />
<br />
“Look what you’ve gone and done!  I swear by Brell, you just always have to mess everything up!”  The gnome sighed and began to throw the broken pieces of his invention back onto the table.  “Ah well, get the wagon re-packed at least.  We’ll head on to Rivervale.”<br />
<br />
Heldorm quickly stepped up to the small inventor and helped him pick up the remaining pieces of his contraption.  “Pardon me, but uh I did I hear ye say ye had a wagon?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” the gnome looked up to Heldorm indifferently, “what of it?”<br />
<br />
“Well, ye see, my companions and I ‘ere are lookin’ fer passage to the northern lands.  And well, we were wonderin’ if ye possibly might be havin’ room for us.”<br />
<br />
The gnome looked quickly at the four travelers and scratched his balding head.  “Eh, I’m sorry, folks.  My assistant takes up enough room as it is, and my inventions take up the rest.  There’s just no way.  Sorry, g’day to you.”<br />
<br />
“Did I tell ye we took a shine to yer inventions?”  The gnome stopped in his tracks as the words reached his ears.  <br />
<br />
“Really?  You were?”<br />
<br />
“We were?” Ioemir asked with a start.<br />
<br />
“Aye!  Of course we were!” Heldorm shot a piercing look in Ioemir’s direction.  “In fact, I was thinkin’ I liked em so much that I may be a wee bit interested in perhaps takin some of em off yer hands for a fair price.”<br />
<br />
“Well!”  The gnome’s demeanor suddenly reversed itself.  “Now I can see I am talking to a man of good sense!  Allow me to introduce myself – Ecbus Gearthumbs at your humble service.”  Ecbus bowed just as his ogre assistant stepped up.  <br />
<br />
“Okies, boss, meez loaded da –“<br />
<br />
“And this is my assistant – Blorg!  The smartest ogre in Norrath!”<br />
<br />
“Heywo,” Blorg waved with a wide, largely-toothless smile.<br />
<br />
“A smart ogre?” Heldorm looked amusingly at his companions.  “Ain’t that a contradiction in terms?”<br />
<br />
“Oh no no!  He is smart!  Really!  In large part due to myself, of course, but yes he is quite quick to the punch if ya catch my meaning.”<br />
<br />
“Aye, well, my name is Heldorm Snowreader of Halas, an’ these three folks here are travellin’ with me.”<br />
<br />
“Ioemir Enothie of Kelethin.”<br />
<br />
“Ymeal Whitesoul of Felwithe.”<br />
<br />
“And I am Aelwyl Azuremoon, High Priestess of Tunare.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s a pleasure to make all of your acquaintances!  Now, I hate to rush you folks along, but Blorg and I need to get to Rivervale by nightfall or we’ll lose our lodging reservations.  So if you would be so kind as to follow me, we’ll be off!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Heldorm and his companions soon found that the aforementioned wagon was only a wagon in the fundamental sense of the term.  It had wheels (barely), a flat bed, and what appeared to once be a covered top of some sort.  Heaped in the center of the wagon were countless crates, no doubt filled to the brim with Ecbus’s myriad inventions.  From the moment they stepped on to the rickety vehicle, the four travelers thought that at any moment, they would break through the worm-eaten wood to the road below.  But, amazingly, it still supported their weight.<br />
<br />
“Well, Ecbus,” Heldorm said, nervously inspecting ever facet of the wagon, “this certainly is a . . . errm . . . fine vehicle ye got ‘ere.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, you are too kind, my tall friend!  I know it may not be a looker, but it gets me and my inventions from where I was to where I need to go just as well as any of the rest of them!”<br />
<br />
“Aye, ummm, say where’s that large, ogre friend o’ yers?  Blorg was it?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Blorg?  He’s in front, ready to start pulling.”<br />
<br />
“Ahh,” Heldorm settled back against a crate near his companions, then suddenly stood up with a start.  “Pulling?!”<br />
<br />
“Off we go!” yelled Ecbus as Blorg lifted the tremendous weight of the wagon and began to pull forward.  No more than an hour into their journey, Ecbus approached Heldorm and asked, “So, have you had a chance to look through my collection here to see what ya might want to pick up?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, nay, not yet.  I was gonna do that closer to Rivervale, actually.  In fact, probably after we arrived there, so ye know, I would have more room to look at things.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, nonsense!  Why waste any time?  It will still be several hours yet until we reach Rivervale.  Take all the time you want to look through my wares!”<br />
<br />
“Aye, aye, alright,” Heldorm finally resigned.  “What ye got?”<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s see here.”  Ecbus rubbed his tiny hands together briskly as he scanned the mass of crates.  “Ahhh, here we have a nice item I invented a few years back.”  The gnome reached into an already opened crate and produced a round object with a glass face, behind which were set several dials and numbers; a small copper tube extended from the object’s upper cusp.  “It’s a chromo – er chrono – er time of the day telling brass tube thingy.  All you do is hold it up to the sky, and it sends a magic signal to the sun.  The sun then sends a magic signal back to it, and that tells you what time it is!”<br />
<br />
“Errrm, sounds like too much of a hassle.  In Halas, ye can’t see the sun most o’ the time anyways.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” Ecbus tossed the time-telling device aside and scanned deeper into the stack of crates.  “Aha!  Now here’s something I’m sure you of all people could appreciate!”  Ecbus produced a grim-looking pair of scissors, with sharp, crooked teeth.<br />
<br />
“Now that just looks frightenin’ there, lad!”<br />
<br />
“Quite the contrary, my hairy friend!  It’s perfectly safe!  In fact, it has the patented Ecbus guarantee on it!  If any bodily harm results from the use of this product, then I will refund you the cost in full plus another pair of these . . . errm . . . hair trimming, shortening cutting thingies at only half the cost!  And hey, if it’s not really for you, then you can always buy a pair for your lady friend there.”<br />
<br />
“First of all,” Heldorm began sharply, “she’s not my ‘lady friend,’ and second, I like me body hair just as it is, thank ye.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, a tough sell,” Ecbus rubbed his chin, “Good, I enjoy a challenge.”  He quickly disappeared into the dense jungle of crates and began to rummage around, issuing forth the occasional gnomish curse and unpleasant crashing sound.  Aelwyl, no longer able to contain herself, began to snicker softly.  Suddenly, something blue and gold that had just fallen out of a nearby crate caught Heldorm’s eye.  He looked closer and it found it to be a small book with a locking mechanism.<br />
<br />
“Hail, what have we here?”  Heldorm picked up the book and turned it over in his hand.  Ecbus popped out from inside a large crate and glanced over at what the barbarian had discovered.<br />
<br />
“Ah that.  That’s just some regular old journal book.  Nothing really special.”<br />
<br />
“Eh, I really am takin’ a shine to this.”<br />
<br />
“Well, of course you are!” The gnome leapt from the box and scooted up to Heldorm.  “That’s because that’s no ordinary journal book!  That’s a . . . ummm . . . a personalized, magically locking azure book thingy, yeah that’s it.  Ya see that golden lock there?  Just press your thumb up to the little plate on top.&quot;  Heldorm obliged and the lock opened with a quiet click.  “See!  Now whenever you want to unlock it, the magic locking gold thingy will only remember your thumb, so only you can unlock it!  Neat, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Aye, now that is clever!  Ok, I’ll take it.  All’s I got to spare is five platinum pieces, if that be alright with ye.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, that’s perfectly fine with me, my friend!  (Wow, can’t believe someone actually bought these junky things)”<br />
<br />
“What was that?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing!  Nothing at all!  Tell ya what – I like you, Heldorm.  And because I like you, I’ll throw in a journal for each of your friends here, too.  (Need to get rid of these things, anyway)”<br />
<br />
As Ecbus distributed journals to the others, Heldorm opened his completely and a small stylus rolled out of nowhere into his hand.  Baffled from the lack of an ink well, the shaman rested the stylus against the first blank page.  Suddenly, a small black dot appeared on the paper from the stylus’s tip.  Heldorm looked quizzically at the tip for a moment then pressed it to the yellow page again; another black dot appeared.  Laughing at this marvel, the barbarian began to write in the ancient language of his people.<br />
<br />
*<br />
I do not know why exactly I write this, as I do not believe the events of these coming days will soon leave my memory.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I have never done anything like this before, so I feel compelled to record my experiences for future review. <br />
<br />
This morning, upon arriving in the human settlement of Freeport, we had the fortunate (or misfortunate, depending on your point of view) of meeting two traveling merchants.  It is perhaps the most mismatched duo I have ever seen – a gnome, Ecbus, and an ogre, Blorg.  Ecbus is a fidgety inventor who makes very . . . well . . . interesting contraptions.  Blorg appears to be his glorified pack mule, and totally subservient.  Of course, granted the mental nature of ogres, I am not surprised of this arrangement.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, here we sit, in the belly of a shaking, worm-eaten wagon, heading for the town of Rivervale, where I believe the halflings live.  This will be interesting, as I’ve never seen a halfling before.  I just hope our stay with them will be short, as every moment we waste, the elfchild slips further into the grip of death.<br />

From the Journal of Ymeal<br />
<br />
Here begins the journal of Ymeal Whitesoul, Cleric of the 60th Tier of Tunare.<br />
<br />
My companions and I have set out upon a most grand adventure, and one of the utmost urgency.  The newborn daughter of my long-time friend, Ioemir Enothie, lies dying in her mother’s arms.  A former friend of the Hierophant Aelwyl Azuremoon seeks the final ingredient to a potion that supposedly extends life, and cures all ailments.  This aforementioned friend is Heldorm Snowreader, a shaman of the northern city of Halas.  He is a very proud man, of good heart and (it pains me to say) thick head at times.  I have yet to see his prowess on the battlefield, but I dare say he is quite formidable, and I hesitate to see him angered, as the extent of his wrath is no doubt a force to be reckoned with.<br />
<br />
As for his past relationship to Aelwyl, I can only speculate.  I believe them to be past lovers, or almost lovers.  But as much as the subject intrigues me, I dare not write more concerning it, as it is not proper for a man such as I am to write of such things.<br />
	<br />
Ah yes, this journal would not be complete without taking mention of the curious pair we made the acquaintance of this morning.  Ecbus Gearthumbs of Ak’Anon, and his assistant, Blorg of Oggok (I presume).  They travel from city to city, selling Ecbus’s inventions.  Personally, I see the aforementioned inventions as cheap trinkets, but I suppose some may find them useful.  Nonetheless, they have graciously offered us transportation to the fair town of Rivervale.  <br />
<br />
Ah, Rivervale.  How I long to return there again.  And, perhaps, I will see her again.<br />
<br />
Here I end my writings for this day.  May Tunare bless our journey and keep watch over the innocent one.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
From the Journal of Aelwyl<br />
<br />
Heldorm never ceases to irritate me.  Not only is he pig-headed, stubborn, and egotistical, but he continues to shun me like a beggar in the city streets!  I know our past has been less than pleasant, but I thought there may have been something to salvage.  <br />
	<br />
I just cannot say.  I still hold hope that one day Heldorm will look at me and hold me the way he used to.  But with every passing moment of silence between he and I, that hope fades evermore.<br />
	<br />
But I am digressing from far more urgent matters.<br />
	<br />
Ioemir’s daughter is gravely ill, and Heldorm is her only hope at life.  No doubt the pressure he must feel right now is difficult to bear.  But alas, it is his (and ours) to bear.  I do so hope we are not too late in finding the third ingredient.<br />
	<br />
And now I think Ecbus is trying to read what I am writing, so I will end here.” <br />
<br />
<br />
*          <br />
From the Journal of Ioemir<br />
	<br />
The condition of my daughter consumes me with every passing moment.  Every ray of sunlight that is lost seems to echo a drop of life running from my daughter’s body.  I pray to Tunare that Heldorm is able to find the cure of which he speaks.<br />
	<br />
Heldorm Snowreader – now there is a man!  He is quite complex, actually.  He seems to be loud and quite sure of himself on the outside, but his inner self seems to be very reserved and contemplative.  I have great faith in him.  He seems sure of himself and takes no action unless he feels it will produce a result of equal worth.  He holds the key to my daughter’s fate in his hands, and I have no doubt that he will succeed.<br />
<br />
I am sure there is more to write, but my mind and soul are too restless to focus at the moment. <br />
