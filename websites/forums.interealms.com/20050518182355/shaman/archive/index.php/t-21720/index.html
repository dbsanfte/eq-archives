kanleku's bp finally showed up in lucy. Stats look pretty good and the focus looks nice altho it does have me worried. Specifically the 4th line <br />
4:  	Limit: Effect(Attack Speed allowed)<br />
<br />
in lucy that typically seems to mean limited to x like in <br />
<br />

<br />
5:  	Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed)<br />
<br />
actually means it only works on dots.<br />
<br />
so i'd take that to mean that the bp effect only works on slows. Admitedly the most important part of detrimental spell extension but covering dots and malxxx and other assorted things with the same focus was nice. Who actually has this bp and can you confirm what it does and does not work on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Discordant Time is a completely stupid focus.  GoD is about fast fights.  They hardly last more than 3 minutes.  Balance of the Nihil only gets an extra 5 ticks from this focus.  I'd rather have it affect ALL detrimental spells like Chronoburn and not just slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only one person has it at this time, and that is Grumpf from AO.  Without having it, i can tell you that what you are reading is true, and that it will only work on slows.  It's good that it will work on lengthening the time on nihil, but it not working on our dots, which is the entire reason that I love this type of focus really sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lame. It's not like Chronoburn is a super easy focus to get. This new focus is only a lousy 5% improvement anyway!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow.  I am very unimpressed with this breastplate.<br />
What it should have been is 30% Chronoburn.<br />
What it is is 30% Chronoburn, that doesn't affect any of our detrimental spells besides just slow.  *yawn*<br />
Dots, no effect.<br />
Roots, no effect.<br />
Malo, no effect.<br />
Cripple, no effect.<br />
<br />
If you are capable of getting this, you are fighting:<br />
GoD high end boss mobs that live for about 1.5 minutes maximum (Nihil won't wear off regardless of focus)<br />
GoD trash mobs that live for about 45 seconds in xp groups, or about 20 seconds on a raid.<br />
PoTime gods that are slowimmune.<br />
PoTime trash mobs that live for about 1 minute at most, except in phase 1, where you will have to reslow some mobs, or just use TA or mem Turgur instead.<br />
The GoD BP is just a roughly 70hp increase in stats over time, with a *sacrifice* of a good focus effect.<br />
Would I wear it on a raid?  Ya.  70hp will help a bit here and there.<br />
Would I wear it anywhere else?  Nope.<br />
I can probably find about 19 more equipment upgrades I'd go for as well, rather than &quot;upgrade&quot; my time BP to that.</div></div><hr />

Why would you sa discordant malaise is only for tash?<br />
<br />
Looking at the effect in lucy you get<br />
1:  	Increase Spell Duration by 30%<br />
2: 	Limit: Max Level(65)<br />
3: 	Limit: Min Duration(24.00 sec)<br />
4: 	Limit: Effect(Magic Resist allowed)<br />
5: 	Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only)<br />
<br />
which should mean any magic based detrimental spell that lasts over 24 seconds. In fact since tash is unresistable and not magic based I wouldn't expect it to work on tash. For shaman tho it should work on all our slows, malosinia, cripple and even bane. All in all a much better focus than the bp.</div></div><hr />

No, you are wrong.   It works on spells that have an effect of changing Magic Resist.  &quot;Limit: Resist(Magic allowed)&quot; is the one that is magic based spells.  Notice the difference. http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4207</div></div><hr />

ahh does it work with malos too then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh well, I'd figured since the melees seem to have their time BP effects available on the GoD gauntlets that chronoburn might be on the shaman gauntlets... Unfortunately after checking that's not the case. /Sigh. <br />
<br />
How hard is it to understand that once you implement a focus that affects everything detrimental on one piece, you don't go back and offer one that is less versatile on the higher tier piece of gear that replaces it and expect people to be happy. Especially when the original effect is so hard to come by.<br />
<br />
Another perfect example is Root on ornate pants and disease dot on elemental pants.... what were they thinking. <br />
<br />
Another &quot;might have been&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ahh does it work with malos too then?<br />
<br />
That I'm not sure on.  Since Malos does effect MR it might work, but since it also effects FR/CR/PR it might not.   Can't really tell.<br />
<br />
Still worthless either way, like any mob will live long enough that we need to increase Malos that extra 5% past 18 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">its &quot;broken&quot; as devs told me.<br />
its meant to be working on all detrimentals.<br />
but the guy responsible for focus effects is on vacations atm.<br />
will try to talk to him when he is back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, either way Grumpf congratz on being the first shaman serverwide to have the bp :)</div></div><hr />
