<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, today's my birthday.  I've had a really good birthday, starting with presents and waffles and 3 AA points (ding LR 3!!).  I check my work email account and there's an email from my coworker's husband who works in the MS game department:<br />
<br />
&quot;Brian (Beth's husband) here. We're going to have Brad McQuaid, the creator of EQ autograph some stuff for you. Can you tell us how you'd like them made out?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm SUCH A GEEK! This is the coolest EQ-related thing since John got me a coffee cup with my Saraquael sig pic on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Happy Birthday =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sounds like a very nice birthday, indeed! Congrats.<br />
<br />
Did you get the autograph for Gloriana or some more mundane name? hehe, I know what I'd pick even though no one would understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Happy birthday.<br />
<br />
Scan the autograph and post it. I want to see if he smilies his 'y's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Happy birthday Glory!<br />
<br />
Are we allowed to ask how old? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Happy Birthday Glori! ;)<br />
You can probably figure out how old she is on this thread:<br />

and I see at the bottom of the forums it is Cantiz from TT birthday too.  Happy birthday reptile, wherever you have run off too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Naughty Henora!<br />
<br />
Happy birthday, Cantiz!  I also grouped with a cleric on Emarr named Alexielle today and it was also her birthday!</div></div><hr />

Happy birthday dear Gloriana!<br />
Happy birthday to YOU!<br />

Everybody deserves to have it sung to them.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ha! It brings back semi-painful memories of waitressing in college.  I worked at a Chi Chis Mexican Restaurante and we sang a birthday song to LUCKY guests to the tune of &quot;La Cucaracha!&quot;<br />

btw, don't go to India anymore.  Your company is training up Indians for outsourcing American jobs there.  That's SOOO bad that you would travel there to help them do that . . . tho if you wouldn't I supose they'd just get someone else who would.  It's really gonna be a problem soon tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">:)<br />
<br />
The call center I train in India supports phone calls from that region.  That call center does support North American American Express calls, though.  The agents are trained to speak in &quot;American&quot; accents and work at night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is that what they tell you? :p<br />
Anyway just wanted to warn you of a growing trend . . . don't become a victim yourself . . that would suck.  Not concerned for myself as my job is impossible to outsource, but for computer folks, you guys/gals should be worried/watchful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's true, because I've been there and know what programs the agents support.<br />
<br />
It would be difficult (probably not impossible) for them to outsource my job, I'm actually not a &quot;computer&quot; person, I'm a programs trainer.</div></div><hr />

I happen to work for a company that supports Dell computers that have outsourced to New Delhi and Bombay India and the people that work the call centers are complete morons. Hope that nickel a day they are geting paid is worth it =p.</div></div><hr />

You guys are going to laugh, look at the email I received:<br />
<br />
Hi Jennifer,<br />
 <br />
Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday!  Brett talked with me and I'd be more than happy to send some signed EQ goodies your way.<br />
 <br />
take care,<br />
