I keep hearing a week, but no real conformation of that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Consensus seems to be a week.<br />
<br />
Vis-a-vis the &quot;ubers perma-camping&quot;  they're not doing it for themselves, but for their alts.  Blame the &quot;recommended and required level&quot; bullsh!t put on items for this flurry in twinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not so concerned about ubahs twinking out their alts or whatever, but SOE should know better than to put very decent stuff out there for a week then take it out of the game.  I was hoping this was one of the Old World &quot;upgrades&quot;, and normal people would have a shot at this stuff after the first month of perma-camp farming that the ubahs do for their twinks, but sadly it looks like SOE's vision will let me down :(<br />
<br />
Reminds me of the days before PoP when guilds would take control of Velks or Seb and make you unwelcome because that XP was THEIRS...LOL.  Anywho, thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Edit:  BTW, alot of the peeps were actually looting these just to say they got them.  I watched a few 65's in EP guilds actually loot, not their alts.  But then again, my Ranja still wields his Epics, who am I to judge them if they like the nostagia or whatever /shrug<br />

Um, they have done it on every expansion...</div></div><hr />

Dynamic quests, events and activities will continue throughout the week, and will be more common from now on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That sounds much better.  Even if I don't get anything, it would be nice to get a shot at something :D<br />
<br />
And yes, I have been around long enough to know they do this, I was just challenging the logic behind how long they did it.  And with old zone revamps, I was being overly optimistic thinking it was a permanent change.<br />

Actually, don't always assume this is the case. Yes it probably is in most instances, but I was in the camp for the Fabled FBSS, and there was a time-access warrior there who was still using a soulscream belt for haste. the FFBSS was a nice upgrade for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">True Dirk, amazing that it is somewhat difficult for even EP/Time melee to have 36% haste items.  SOE hasn't really made an effort on making haste items easily obtainable for even the high level Guilds.  Thankfully some of the melee get 40% in their Epics....like my Ranja :D<br />
