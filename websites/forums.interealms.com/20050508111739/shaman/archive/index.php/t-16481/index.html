<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have some serious money issues and I really need to get some equip upgrades, but I've got no funds to get them.  Everyone tells me to go to Dulak for money but it's always camped and I get killed pretty often there anyway... There has to be somewhere else where a 52 Shaman can make some cash that isn't always camped or is too difficult.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Here's my Magelo if it helps... http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=217137</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, your best bet is hill giants in rathe mtns.  It IS the unhappiest place on Norrath though, kind of a theme park for idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try Seafuries in OOT.  I think they might still be exp mobs for you at 52; I was exping on them at 51 I think.  Were really easy kills, not great exp but they each dropped about 5 to 6 plat and the occasional gem and 1 out of 3 dropped a FS weapon.  They also drop sea foam pretty reguarly which always has a small market among tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
You are also in Sebilis range at 52.  When Kunark was a new dungeon it was pretty much 55+, but Im betting that at 52 with todays standard gear (you didnt post a magelo so I cant be sure) you still probably outgear what shaman were in way back then.  Grab a group and head on down there,  Just remember to up your resists and keep your resist spells up as the shaman and wizard mobs there can be a handfull if not prepared.<br />
<br />
I have also found that LDoN yields some good cash.  I usually walk away with a few hundred in plat plus an item to sell for a standard adventure.  Lower level yields might be a bit lower (in my groups I'm usually the youngest player at 63) but still worth checking into.<br />
<br />
If all else fails head over to EK and farm silks and skins for the tradeskill market.  On my server silks still regularly run 2 or 3 plat each and always sell out.  Skin prices vary on quality and seem to sell in spurts; I can have a stack of HQ sitting on my vendor for a month and then the next week be unable to keep them in stock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can make a lot of money via tradeskills, either by farming ingredients and selling them to those that would use them, or by working a tradeskill up and selling products.<br />
<br />
Your best bet for farming is going to be farming acrylia, rockhopper hides, othmir furs, and that kind of stuff.  Check eqtraders.com and your local bazaar to find out what is in demand and sells well.<br />
<br />
For working your own tradeskills up, it obviously depends on how much capital you have.  You can make a ton of money off of fletching, for example, but you're going to need to sink about 100k in to it in order to be able to make anything worthwhile.  On top of that, you'll have to buy the ingredients to make the good stuff since you obviously won't have elemental farming abilties at level 52.<br />
<br />
Pottery is easier than that.  You can get to max skill for around 30k or so, but you're only going to make a few K off of each successful combine.  Still, I am guessing a 30k investment is a bit much for you.  I sure as hell didn't have that much money at level 52.<br />
<br />
The best thing for you would probably be baking.  A few hours a night for a week spent making misty thicket picnics will get you to 250 skill.  It will cost you about 2-3k to get there, but if you sell the picnics you made, you'll make up for the loss.  Once you get 250 skill, you can just keep making picnics.  Make a few hundred of them and throw them on a trader (a mule that you can keep active 24/7 helps a lot, but it still works if you just leave your char up overnight).  I find that if I keep my trader constantly stocked with picnics, I make about 1-3k a day.  This obviously isn't a lot of money, but it is nice steady income.  In addition to picnics, buy all the cheap hero parts you see in bazaar and make hero sandwichs.  Surprisingly, they have a much higher success rate than picnics.  They cost a lot more per combine, but they are quick and easy to make, and sell for a lot more (100pp per sandwich, vs. 5pp per picnic).<br />
<br />
I make most of my money just by selling drops I get while exping, but tradeskills have been a decent addition to my income.  It might not be for you, though.  I have a very high tolerance for doing tradeskills (I actually enjoy it, go figure), but I have a very low tolerance for going to newbie zones and farming greens for plat.  Hill Giants might work better for you, though.<br />
<br />
All in all, though, you should consider just biting the bullet and working on levels.  It is much much easier to make money when you're 65 than when you're not.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide to do, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinwe Ambersky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Check vendors near LDON dungeons for runes, words, etc. Things like Yaeth 63 L-R, Yaeth 65 L-R, Rune of Current, Conglomeration, Incendiary sell for 500-1Kpp in bazaar (check your server price) and you can get them from the merchant for 8-10pp. I was selling them until last month and probably made 100Kpp of research component.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>IceWlaker_Darkmoore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure on level for this but a monk friend of mine took me to the High-elf town in G-faydark this week to kill the PoD. He then proceded to slaughter all guards as soon as you zone in solo with no heals or slow from me(bout 10 of them). Each dropped a sword that sold for 16pp each( i looted them all  =0 ).<br />
<br />
If you can deal with the faction hits this seem a whole lot better than HG loot or SF loot it might even be exp at 52(con'd green to 65). Also a safe place to solo right on the zone line.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deyhawke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you aren't looking for solo cash, get a couple friends and head to veksar.  I duo'd the store camp with a 55 monk (I'm 65) on and off for a couple weeks and made about 100k selling soulscream belts.  Cha-ching fo7 malo and quies.  There's a ton of camps in that zone with lots of upgrade quality gear that you can either wear or sell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, I know this isnt going to be a popular answer but I really wouldnt sweat the equipment.  Just level and have fun and the drops will come.  If you are a good shaman you won't be a liability in your group.<br />
<br />
I worried way too much about pp and equipment when I was leveling and I am speaking from experience on this one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Droga is a great place for loot and cash, just camp a few named mobs, plat is approximately 20pp each, but the items are still selling for 3k and up.<br />
  Oh and Cobalt Scar is still good for cash, the jewel drops are probably 1 in 3.<br />
  AND Rockhoppers are a GREAT form of income.<br />
 The flawless and superb pelts still sell for 200pp or so and drop about every other mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BristolMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm in the same situation as you, a 52 shaman.<br />
<br />
I agree with the farming of silks in EK.  Extremely easy, and highkeep is near by if you want to camp the nobles.  I only play for a few weeks every 3 or 4 months, but this has always worked.  Reactivated this weekend, farmed 140 silks in an hour or so, and sold the silks (not swatches, but individual) for 8pp each that same night in the bazaar.  I'm sure there are ways to make much more money out there, but nothing I've found is this mindless and easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Silk is always good... the sickos on Xev are willing to pay up to 8p per silk for em (yikes!).  Guards are always good for fun and do indeed drop swords that sell for 15-20p a pop.  <br />
<br />
The place I always go now for cash is the Seb Guard camp.  Seb is totally deserted nowadays with LDON having just come out.  At 52, you're gonna need a partner, but even with a partner you guys should make at least 500p per hour each.  Just cross that little bridge near the ZO room, kill the 3 bugs (each drops diamonds, rubies, blue diamonds or some seb gear that usually sells for 80-100p to vendors) then go down, kill a few frogs, then pull the guardian or his PH.  Guardian drops the lammy.<br />
<br />
Then, of course, there's always the nightmare clickfest that is Sow potions...  Easy to make, and if you are patient in the bazaar, you can still sell for 80-85p, so a profit of 30p or so per 10 dose.  That depends on your server though, since I've heard on other servers people basically sell em at cost.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Level 52 you have several choices -- with kei you should be able to get some exp and COMPLETELY wipe out the giant camp in the corner of firiona vae.<br />
<br />
The other possibility is jaggedpine -- every single one of those will-o-wisps has a greater lightstone.<br />
Beyond that there is a very nice exp camp at your level -- the jaggedpine poachers.  They have pelts in quantity and quality -- I got about 15 high quality bear skins there over some time.  The thing all of these camps have in common is that you can get some exp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh there is one other one if you are friends with the dragons -- in cobalt scar you can kill the haunted seachests -- THAT is extremely good money AND should still be blue at 52nd also -- it was light blue at 54..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Those research words aren't going to stay at 500-1000 pp for long, the market's going to wake up really quick and realize the things are dropping ALL the time in LDoN.  Yesterday, someone in our non-guild-gang chat channel said something like &quot;you need words of xxxxx?  I sold like 5 of those to a vendor the other day.&quot;  And someone called him a liar.<br />
<br />
Then I pointed out I've probably seen at least 3 or 4 myself.  I wouldn't pay over 100 pp for any research right now, if that.  They're finally dropping as they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The biggest way to get more plat is to *stop* buying things.<br />
<br />
Basically, the biggest problem I see people having when they don't have any money is not the money coming IN it's the money going OUT.<br />
<br />
pp drops practically *everywhere*.  Sure, there are some camps that yield better pp than others (such as the excellent examples above) but most any camp at all will yield up some sort of loot.<br />
<br />
Stop spending money on alts.  Stop spending money on stat-food.  Stop spending money on those 'little' upgrades (500pp here, 400pp for this, etc).  Treat your bank like a one-way street and only put money in for a couple weeks and see what happens.<br />
<br />
I used to be always broke until someone gave me this advice (on the crucible here I'm pretty sure).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">get LDoN groups, fast money there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you can get 2 or the 3 Ice Giants in Everfrost it's also nice cash very easy. Just tank pet dot, and stoicism regularly. I did it at 49 and 50 easily 2 years ago so no stoicism and a much lower equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail,<br />
<br />
Silk swatches are selling for 500pp per stack on E. Marr.<br />
That's 5000pp per backpack full.<br />
<br />
Dogdog and you could tear spiders up in Eastern Karanas during off-peak hours and make a few kpp per session easily w/ zero danger (&amp; zero exp).<br />
<br />
Burning Woods Giant camp is fair exp and has decent cash loots.<br />
Firiona Vie Giant camp (in corner of zone) is soloable by you and also has similarly decent cash loots, though at 52 might be going light blue to you.<br />
<br />
I would also recommend LDoN adventures.  You will earn ability points (albeit not many at your level) which can become augments will improve your gear.  The cash in some of the adventures is very good, with splits among a full group of 6 netting EACH person 300pp or so.  Win just one or two nice random and sell it for cash and you will be making some decent cash doing that while getting good exp at the same time.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">lol... I really have to laugh at 4 year old suggestions of rathe mts giants... thise things are camped, and poor in comparison to even high hold keep for cash loot drops (kill guards, sell swords). Droga/veksar are good ideas, as is ldon. On an average mission, I get about 250pp ro so, and 1-2 items to roll on, and aa. DONT waste your time in rathe mts.</div></div><hr />
