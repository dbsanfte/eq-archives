<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi again,<br />
<br />
I have a question, my guild just starting to do bigger mobs and i would like to know when i should slow.<br />
Do most of you slow after assist is called, or do you start maloxxx (no malo yet in guild) and slowing on inc ... or somewhere in between?<br />
<br />
I have a hard time waiting, my fingers keep moving to the Slow button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stand next to the MA.<br />
<br />
Malo(s) on Inc (almost zero aggro spell).  Once Malo has landed spam Sini(a) until it lands.  Once Sini(a) has landed spam Turgors until it lands.<br />
<br />
Delay between castings of these spells = 2.25 seconds (the normal EQ spell delay)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your guild doesn't have Malo yet, they probably can't hold up to fully unslowed mob for the time it'd take to slow it the sini route.  I'd go the Insideous Decay/Grummous first, and then magic slow afterwards.  Don't try that malosini until you get the Chanter to Tash, the Mage to Mala and the Bard to OOS (or whatever combination you have of those).  You and all others listed should have buttons made to let the raid or the guild of your success with the spell listed.  You slow the mob, but you do it in conjunction with you teamates, not alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Malo(s) on Inc (almost zero aggro spell).  <br />
<br />
Be carefull with this bit of advice. Its good advice on mobs that dont rampage.<br />
<br />
It is true that malo is a low aggro spell but it will still get you on a rampage list if you cast it on inc.  Being on a Boss Mobs rampage list can be a quick death for a shaman.  Wait about 2 seconds after incoming to malo then start slowing. Generally you will have rampage tanks assigned that are to get on a mobs rampage list. Firing a arrow on inc usually works. the first few people to hit the mob are generally on the rampage list (this includes debuffs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Uthgar, the rampage list is VERY important... I saw a lot of debuffers fall to Vindi before we figured this out.  Top 4 tanks should get on the rampage list, firing an arrow or whatever, before any debuffing commences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or you can try and get on rampage just for bragging rights =D I've rampage tanked Rumble and Vindi (rumble I kept myself alive the entire fight and vindi I kept myself up till he was about 25%) <br />
<br />
Anyway, when you are in a lowbie raiding guild and you a trying to slow (arena giants for example) - stick to the MT like glue. I'd also hope you at least have a chanter for tash, if not get someone a tash stick. Give the MT at least 6-7 seconds to gain agro, wait for tash, cast slow/malxxx. They are both on the same resist check so both have the same probablity of landing. If slow bounces, try malxx. I wouldnt suggest chain casting slow...resisted slows are mega agro. Resisted Malxx is not everymuch agro. Key here is to balance helping save the clerics mana by slowing the mob without having to be rezz'd or healed constantly yourself. Just takes a lil practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its already been hinted at, but the answer as always is - it depends. Practice makes perfect. I died the first few times raiding kael arena in my low 50s, from slowing too early. The tank died once, because I didn't get slow to land soon enough (darned resists). <br />
<br />
In general I'll open with malo as soon as I see the mob (heavy rampagers excluded). I will then alternate malosini and slow until I get aggro or one or other sticks. Note that the 3 second malosini cast time fits in almost perfectly with the 3 seconds recycle time on slow. <br />
<br />
If I get aggro but think I will live I try to channel a quick torpor in, then just malosini for a couple of casts while tank gets aggro back and I heal up. If you get aggro and think you will die anyway, try to channel a final desperate slow attempt. At least you may save your friends, even if you die yourself.<br />
<br />
Tailor the above in certain cases:<br />
<br />
1) Mob rampages<br />
Discussed by others above. Let the rampage tanks engage first. Then maloxxx. Then alternate slow/malosini(a) until they land.<br />
<br />
2) Tank dies / clerics struggle with mana / CH chain starts late<br />
Sometimes a problem on very hard fast hitting mobs. Stand ahead of the force, malo on inc. Run back to tank. Slow before mob gets there. Pray it lands. Stand and if you get a resist, expect to die :) Mainly used on raids with multiple shaman against mobs like rumblecrush, where an unslowed mob engaged on anything less than a top-end tank is gonna lead to a quick death for all involved. Never had to do it myself but I've heard of it being done.<br />
<br />
3) No rampage, tank struggles with aggro<br />
Maloxxx after the tank engages. Attempt two or three times, or until it lands, then try alternating slowing with malosini(a). Add in more maloxxx if you get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another key with standing next to MT is to not stand past main tank.  Malo is very low agro but shooting arrows at Mob is even lower.  So the mob will engage whoever is closer.  If the main tank moves back behind you, then you are dead.<br />
<br />
I do agree that it is very situational.  Some mobs need to be slowed as quickly as possible no matter what.  In general tanks can usually survive a few secs with an unslowed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Standing in melee range when slowing bosses is pretty stupid because of proximity aggro. Get some kind of range focus (Supple Scale Armband is easy to aquire) and stand as far away as possible to get slow on as fast as possible without aggro.<br />
<br />
Standing in melee range works at the low-end when mobs hits for less than 1k but when mobs start to hit for 3450 it's better to back away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Standing way back from the MT is bad advice for a first time raiding shaman.  Bouncing the mob around can lead to a quick wipe if you don't know what youre doing.<br />
<br />
Stick close the MT until you learn the ropes, then once you've got it down you can stand back and fire away from long distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, if you don't know how aggro works you should stand in melee range.<br />
<br />
You can also watch MA and see if he get an early proc in which means that you can slow earlier ( watch for casting animation).</div></div><hr />
