<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I guess thats cool. So it summons a potion bag?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">errr no it summons (just like all other trophies) a no rent 100% wt reduction bag which u can turn in into the bazaar dude and get it to become LORE NO DROP so it won't poof anymore when u log.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Umm, don't you combine the herbs first, then the potion with the seal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wow +50 charisma just MIGHT make alchemy start to be slightly profitable by reducing costs that much.<br />
<br />
haha I kid, I kid. This skill will never be profitable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep Drinnar.<br />
<br />
Also, the recipe was something that wasn't pushed to live servers. On Test, Jolum tells you what you need to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is the actual bag a real bag? like is it 10 slot?<br />
<br />
the &quot;Grandmasters medicine bag&quot;. not the grandmasters satchel which I already have.<br />
<br />
would be cool to have a container have stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doh, just posted this in alchemy.<br />
<br />
According to the dev responsible, the lack of Ammo slot on this was an oversight that will be fixed next patch.<br />
<br />
Relevant recipes are:<br />
<br />
Grandmaster's Medicine Bag = Artisan's Seal + Potion of Mystical Aptitude <br />
<br />
artisan's seal = mounted blue diamond, mounted diamond, mounted black sapphire, mounted jacinth, vial of purified mana, small block of clay, flask of water - combine in a pottery wheel, then fire with an HQ firing sheet in kiln (triv less than 102 pottery, not no drop) <br />
<br />
mounted [gem] = 2 bars of velium, [gem] (diamond, blue diamond, black sapphire, jacinth) (in jeweler's kit, trivial &lt;=142 (diamond &lt;=128)) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah, I was hoping It'd summon an actual potion bag, so you could make potions on the fly if someone gave you the ingrediants, without having carrying around the stupid little bag.<br />
<br />
Who need WR bags anyway? We buff STR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You're not a smither then ;)<br />
<br />
I've gotten over 900 stone in weight doing smithing.<br />
<br />
Then I discovered our no-rent bags.<br />
<br />
This was farming fs for ornate &lt;x&gt; chainmail, but still....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">confirmed, first try at 200 skill with philosophers stone and I got one. I used potion not herbs separated, non trivial and not cheap, looks like a sack when you wield it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just did this at 191 skill, took me 3 tries to make the mystical aptitude, but thankfully the grandmaster was a success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gratz Grubb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">200 skill + 10% mod and i've failed 6 of 6 .... *sigh* i have the worst luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">success on 7th, bank account hurting bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I cant see this making much of a diffrence in prices with the +50 charisma....isnt the cut off for maximum / minimum pricing by the npc's set at 112?<br />
<br />
Gorg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The 50 charisma wont matter, because there is a cap on sell/buy prices. With my lowest charisma buff I get the same prices as I do with Unfailing Reverence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">3 tries, 3 fails, at 200 skill, no mod item.  rather discouraging, to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">4 tries, 4 fails at 190 :(   Guess if 191 succeeded then I will try again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">well if they change it to Ammo as well, that's pretty neat.  Beats the hell out of fishing grubs and the horse can always be swapped in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I feel out of the loop here.  Last I remember, alchemy capped at 180.  When did that change?  People are talking about 190-200 skill.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There seems to be a wide degree of success in making this item.  At 200 skill with Philosopher's stone I made mine on the first try.  My guildmate took 2 tries with 200 skill and Umbracite Swarm Orb equiped.<br />
<br />
Good luck everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Do stats on the item in the ammo slot still not add to character stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">180 skill cap was at level 60 - the level when you could start alchemy gave you a skill cap at 180 ... with th addition of 5 levels the theoritcal cap would be 205 but so far no one has posted a skill higher then 200.<br />
<br />
As to the cha I think 112 is the best price with ally faction.  As your faction decreases the amount of cha you need goes up or so i have been told.  Might be nice but what use is there for alchemy with 210 skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">alchemy cap changed when pop came out and you were allowed to go past level 60. (61-24)*5=185 (65-24)*5=205 but nobody's been able to get past 200 yet so that's the assumed new cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That's what I was thinking happened, but I just hadn't read anything about it =)  Alchemy is so pointless, but I want to max my skill in it hehe.  I want my monk to be a tanking druid.  He'll have port potions, ds potions, regen potions, hehehe.  Ok maybe not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bah, they could have made something decent, and instead we get this. Thanks but no thanks. If it were a container that allowed combines of regular and 10 shot potions, it would be useful. As it stands, if you have the coin to gm alchemy, you have the coin for something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Failed last night, oh well. <br />
<br />
My wife has 250 pottery and has failed her gm trophy 6 times so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I got my pottery trophy at the first try at 241.<br />
<br />
Not going for the alchemy trophy. There's no real reason to have two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Viscerator - no, you don't get the stats from having something in ammo slot.  For those who aren't archers or throwers it's just a convenient storage and display spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think sum folks gots da wrong ideas abouts trade skill trophies.<br />
Dey is a rewards fer having mastered or being close ta masterin a trade skill.<br />
Dey not the goal of learnin a tradeskill.<br />
Der a lotta shamies who, like me, have been keepin der Alchamy maxed as every expantion came along.<br />
Dis is sumtin we kin git a bonus fer havin been doin da work ta git da skill up.<br />
Da stats on it are greats if ya are doin trade skills, not great fer adventurin, but dat da point.<br />
Also ya git a 100% WR bag, so all in all it not a bad reward fer a skill I maxed fer other reasons.<br />
Now, I do wish it was a GM thingy inna a trade dat I could turn a proffit in, but dat an different issue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Whats the approx cost per try? My alchemy is at 190 and I dont have Philos stone so if the cost per try isnt that bad Ill try to combine it soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">if you already have a blue diamond + jacinth + blacksaphire + diamond, and you dont fail any combines to reach the last one, only costs about 3k plat per try.  if you have to buy the gems too, up to around 5k per combine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">8 bars of Velium costs 2100pp<br />
<br />
If you hunt in PoP alot you probably already have the diamond and blue diamond ( or can get them really quickly).<br />
<br />
I bought a Jacinth and BS in bazaar for 250pp each.<br />
<br />
And then you need the skill.  Like ~130JC and ~120 Pottery. Both of which I already had.  But its not that expensive to get either one that high if you dont have tradeskill-enabled friends.<br />
<br />
I aslo saw a completed Seal for sale for 8k. Would have taken less time but more $$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Judcei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I made it tonite on second try with skill of 190.  I failed last nite with a skill of 180.  I have no mod item.<br />
