<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I have just retired my 65 warrior, his main comcern was get to 65 then worry about AA's.  As a 55 shaman now is it the same way or should I invest the time in AA's now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty much for any class Levels &gt; AA's, with the exception of run 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mainly the answer is do whatever you want that makes the game more fun for you... <br />
<br />
I waited until 65 until i did aa though and didn't regret it for a single second. You can get aas easier at 65 because you get groups faster and you go to places with better exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The &quot; conventional wisdom &quot; is to get to 65 first then focus on AA's.  At 65 your spells are resisted less, you have access to better spells and better places to hunt. (Some at 62 I admit).<br />
<br />
However, the telling (to me) point is this:<br />
<br />
People don't look for a 62 Shaman with 100 AA's, they look for a 65 Shaman. (AA regardless)<br />
<br />
Nobody types in /who all 500 AA<br />
<br />
Now you may be one of those &quot; sorts &quot; who wants a title or a big time title in front of your name. In which case I suppose you would go AA&gt; Level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Run 3 then 65 would be my recomendation.<br />

Levels &gt; all (except run 3 wich is a life saver)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm surprised nobody has recommended going to 60 then grinding out Canni V.<br />
<br />
I grinded it out when 60 was max, but you guys wouldn't grind it at 60?  I love it so much, I think I might... unless I couldn't get my hands on Torpor for some reason.<br />
<br />
Of course, if I was actually DOING it, and grinding out levels (something I haven't done since Luclin) I might feel a different way about it...<br />
<br />
But I sure do love Canni V!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can try to get as many flags as possible as well.<br />
Once you get to lvl 65 it gets really slow to grind AA points in non EP zones. That's IMO.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went the 60 and then CaniV and then 65 route myself.  I was happy that I did it that way, but then again I purposely saved AAs from 5 until I had enough to by-pass baroness because I HATED that title, so my way might not be the 'best' way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My suggestiong, go straight to 65, no grinding for AA's.  However do your best to get in on some free AAing err i mean flagging, so you can get run 3 by the time you are 60-65ish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liked being a baron.  The Elder title makes me feel all old and crotchety, like I have to wave a gnarled stick at level 51-58 whippersnappers who come to trample my flowerbed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I have done on my druid, 6 AA's with not one exp point spent on them. I don't plan to do any aa with him till 65 either. I went straight to 65 with my shaman and wasn't disappointed one bit. I did stay at 62 for a month or so with my cleric since I was lacking most of his higher spells, and wanted to get DvA and MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did AA's at 51, 55 and 59.  By the time I hit 60 I had 50 some odd aa.  Why level and close the doors to areas you can solo for exp?  If you are in a hurry, sure go for it.  Doesn't make too much sense to me though.  Your most powerful spell is at level 51, and in most places where you exp at 65, the power of that spell is considerably weaker.<br />
<br />
I wish droga was updated before I turned 65....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree Ronax. It's not like you're going to WIN the game lol. Take your time and enjoy the ride  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I made Baron at 54 then worked it so as soon as I dinged 59 I was able to acquire Canni V. More time spent grinding AAs sub-65 meant more time accumulating cash to buy Torpor, Q (had it banked at 61, lol) etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not in the game to race. I like to take my time and trample the flowers as I go ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play to have fun, period. If I stop having fun, it is time to go. That said, grinding levels to get to 65 never appealed to me. If it does for you, go at it. I am currently level 64 with... 67 or 68 aa I forget which. I don't have any problems getting groups, but I am not a hard core raider either. I am in what you would probably call good bazaar gear, not the best but most pieces are 20-50k.<br />
<br />
If raiding is your joy, getting to 65 should probably be your goal. If tradeskilling does it for you, do what is best to get the stuff you need for that. There are plenty of good players out there who are not 65, and everyone who is 65 was your level at some point. heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess I am just saying, have fun whatever you decide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Velkoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">AA's are really importand,but not till you it 65 or so,i always level my chars up to 65 and then work on aa's defensive or class,depending on what class the char is.For my shaman i worked all the way to 65 (hint* Malos) and then started his aa's Run3/Regen3/MC3/Canni/MGB/SCM3/CA/CS/LR5/ID5/....after theese can start doing healing aa's and since god has offered some really cool aa's like SCS/PC can get those somewhere in between.Defensive aa's are rocking to a shaman since we tend to take aggro from weak tanks really often on slow resist etc and therefore i done them really early before i got into &quot;fun aa's&quot;,LR5 specially,just my thoughts <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Working on LR5 right now, it's definitely a life saver, whether you group or solo.  Can be useful on a raid, but if you need LR5 on a raid, you need to manage your agro better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Velkoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">mmm,i use LR5 in raids all of the time...you never know when you will be needed to kite for a bit till ench's mez adds(if mezzable) like in uqua boss encounter etc...LOVE LR5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks all for your input, I like the idea of getting aa's to slow down lvling so I can save up some cash for some of our more expensive spells.  Ill prolly hit 60 then grind out some aa's or flags, but ill have to pass the trials again. /shudder<br />
(took me 1.5 million tries with my warrior, finally gave up and waited till I had a group of 65's to do it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually the new pet etc that you get at level 61 plus the fact that a death in 61 is sooo very small because it is based on the short level of level 60 makes level 61 a much better level to sit and AA in than level 60 is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I went for canni 5 at 59 ......<br />
I have been a baron at 53 and then a venerable at 56, soloing in Jagged Pine. Yummy horse + Jbb :p<br />
<br />
Was really happy to get canni 5 at 59 even if I only had stoicism, kragg&quot;s and low hp at that time ;)<br />
<br />
It was just kewl for me to think that I could canni 5 whereas some 65 didn't have it yet ^^.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>whytewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I tried 2 things, which seem to go against conventional wisdom, but I liked it.  I hit 51, then did 3 AA's for Run 3, just made life easier it seems, then went full bore at levels until 55m then I did 90% exp, 10% AA (I know people say go all or none, but i liked the occasional ding of an AA while leveling, a fun benefit.) until 61, I think I got 6 AA's during the time for some spell enhancment.  At 61 I went for AA's for a while, I wanted the new doggie at 61, but found more places to hunt, but it may have helped that I had some flags to hunt in BoT and such.  After a large chunk of AA's to which I felt comfortable, I went 90/10 to 65.  Again with the occasional surprise ding of an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So many different theories on when and what AA's to do.  It doesn't make it easy for a newly 51 Shaman to decide.  Lots of good info to sleep on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Innu Endo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I already have a 65 character with over 400 aa's so my baby Shaman is in no rush to get there. As soon as I hit 51 I went 50%-50% AA and Regular Xp and have a blast. <br />
<br />
Of course at 55+ the regular xp bar doesn't move very fast and I keep saying I should change her UI to NOT show regular xp as its rather depressing!<br />
<br />
Been there done that on the get to 65 then grind. I'm trampling the flowers with Cronikk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you can get torpor, get 60 then get canni 5 before going to 65.  It'll make your life much easier.<br />
<br />
There are people out there that are 60+ and don't have Torpor?<br />
<br />
Cripes.  I had it three years ago and I haven't played for two :O.<br />
<br />
Edit - Course, I guess there's some healing spells that are equivalent to Torpor eh?  I'm so lost.  Nm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I like the idea of getting aa's to slow down lvling so I can save up some cash for some of our more expensive spells.<br />
<br />
Lots of things to consider but I'll add another one. Depends on your style of play. If you mostly solo for xp, I'd say stop at 61 and grind out Cann5. If you mostly grp for xp, grind all the way to 65 first.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't slow down leveling to save up cash. You'll find it much easier to make cash at 65 as well as AA.<br />
<br />
And to answer Talamay's question about Torpor, IIRC, Stoicism is pretty easy to get and efficient enough to use as a cann5 heal, though it will take a few casts. Not entirely sure though as the spell came out after I had Torpor already but I did the quest anyway for the hell of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">i think i ground run3/regen3 and the AAs needed for about half of MC3 in highhold in nobles at whatever level is just before they stop being good.. was amazingly fast with a (borrowed) JBB :p then ground out the rest of MC3 and Can5 at 61 or 62.. i guess i felt that people would rather not have an AA-less 65 in their group, its kinda like &quot;SURPRISE! i suck at this game! and now you'll feel bad if you drop me for a better equipped and AA'd shaman!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I would stop and get run 3, personally. Also if you have a horse getting the 3 AAs for the reduced food and drink is worth while. Beyond that get your levels. Yes, style of play does factor into this, but we are not talking about a race either. With levels come issues like lower resist rates on spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">&quot;SURPRISE! i suck at this game! and now you'll feel bad if you drop me for a better equipped and AA'd shaman!&quot; <br />

Haha, this made me laugh.<br />
