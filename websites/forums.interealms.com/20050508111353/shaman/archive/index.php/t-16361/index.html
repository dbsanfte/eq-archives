  It is a clicked effect on an all/all item..  so if the result of the click is droppable and pri/sec.. we win :)</div></div><hr />

When you activate them, they turn into a  hammer, and the gauntlets go away.  Activate the hammer, and they become gauntlets again.  There is no actually summoning of a new item.<br />

Mages lobied for over a year to get summoned pet only weapons that were worth having. I just don't see SoE giving that to just anybody - and if such an item were to exist it would probably require the raiding effort of VT or PoTime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">allah has some transmute pouch that summons &quot;barbs&quot;. it appears there is a new line of items that summon weapons.</div></div><hr />

Got the barb summoning one for my warrior last night (Bloody Ancille's Pouch) - uses a 4gp reagent, and summons 20 arrows, so the items with transmute effects do seem to outright summon items anyway - not change back and forth or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just give innate dual wield to pet.....<br />
enc pet 61 has innate dual wield :/ yesterday, I asked the MLer in our LDoN group to give my pet 2 weapons so dogdog could dual wield, and you know what ? he asked me if I was kidding.....that he couldn t believe our pet didn't know how to use 2 hands without weapons on it.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
I saw that item for sale in the bazaar last night Caanus also.  I was wondering the same thing, but the price tag was too unreasonable to buy it just to check it out.<br />
<br />
Let's find out where it drops and get one on our own.   :cool:  I hate running out of pet weapons, and I have a tendency to get dogdog killed 2 minutes after giving him something with Velium shards on it.  :( <br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

I could get xp in PoP when LFG got really boring.<br />

Jtun is lvl 53 atm, and 2 pieces from epic. The mage summoned items<br />
pretty much make my doggie twice as powerful. Not too mention a 45<br />
hp ds don't hurt. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Frekkels, did you see the Bloody Ancille's Pouch (summon hunters barbs.. arrows) or did you see one that summond the hunter's dagger? <br />
<br />
  Pretty sure I'd spend anything under 50K to get it even if just for testing (not like I got anything else to spend money on now)</div></div><hr />

Both were on sale last night.  There were multiple pouches that kept geting spammed back-back with auctions, and I only saw the Dagger one for sale briefly.  I got caught up in my own sales and when I turned /auction and /ooc back on I didn't see it.  I can't remember who had it either.  :mad:  I don't spend too much time in the Bazaar zone at the keyboard most days.  I'll keep an eye out for you, as that's out of my budget for nifty toys. :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not exactly the point on this thread but I question that seems a bit relevant.  If you have a mage alt that can summon say snake fang daggers could you summon 6 or seven of those and put them in the shared bank camp then log your shaman in and get them?  Just curious then I could have weapons when I want them instead of either farming for a few rusties or buying them for a pp each in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think Summoned items will go in shared bank slot. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jtun Nahseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The shared bank slot will not accept summoned items.<br />
Its the no rent tag on them that causes this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks a ton Frekk, just toss em my name if you see em and I'll try to actually go to the bazaar sometime other than while asleep ;)<br />
<br />
  And it is correct that shared bank will not accept NO DROP or NO RENT items :\<br />
<br />
  Even doing it that way would mean having he ability to run out of them when camping a zone for a long time (like past inis bridge pre-easy Deep.   Or doing PoM now that you can't bind for that ONE last card)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So here's a question... could you use that old newbie neckpiece quest (Initiate Symbol of Tribunal I think its called) to summon hammers for your pet?  Its been like 2 years since I've seen one, but if you can, it might be worth doing the old delivery quest from halas to Qeynos again... Lord knows I forget to get weapons for wondermutt pretty much all the time.<br />
<br />

Unfortunately the hammer it summons is no-drop, so Bitey won't equip it.  If they changed the hammer to tradeable it would finally give some value to this item though.  Or maybe an upgraded version that does summon tradeable hammers.  Maybe w/ a Velium Shards or equivalent proc.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As dirtybax said, it would only work on Fironia Vie server (Imagine getting a 65 cleric to gear your pet with dual cleric hammers.... /sigh...  I dream of that late at night)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Anyone know where to get the Pure Crystal that the pouch uses? I have looked all over without success. Also, what is the actual name of the dagger one? Is it something Pouch?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Arnt the pure crystals further down the porting Mage at each camp?  Thought I saw them there beneath the scrying stones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doh! I think you are right Gheff. I totally forgot there was a &quot;normal&quot; merch option in the camps.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the smack to the head  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bad news all :(   I finally saw the result of &quot;Transmute HUnter's Dagger&quot; and it is a stack of RANGE ONLY throwing daggers.<br />

  Guess we keep looking for an easy solution to pet dual wield :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That is bad news but I guess it makes sense if it were to go along the lines of the arrows.  :(</div></div><hr />

Edited due to stupidity  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No mage summon pet items are Tradeable.  The pets would not use them if they were no drop.  All classes pets are restricted from using No Drop weapons.  This is so NPC can be given No Drop items for the Graphics look and stats but not allow pets to equip them and be come uberpet01.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I would love to be able to summon pet weapons. I would atleast like to see Stackable pet only weapons. I assume that they May Stack in Dog Dogs Inventory also so it may be necessary to make a Prime only, and Secondary only. You would have to carry a Stack of each but would still be a nice addition.</div></div><hr />
