Look at every fight and scroll all the way down to the bottom.<br />

Who cares that it came out to 5dps?  That is to be expected if all the shaman is doing is using his dog and dotting.  On mobs that actually last a while (VT bosses) I normally get between 145-190 dps, dog fully buffed and having mage weapons, bane, tears and torrent (crit).  For elemental stuff though, I really only spot heal, or if it's fire, VS/Bane and I don't bother with a dog here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get some perspective here, notice the post where on the same mobs, a necro parsed his DoT damage.  The DoT damage from the necro placed him consistently in the top 10 damage dealers (often number 2).<br />
<br />
A shaman chain casting Bane + Blood of Saryrn would rank about 20th in damage.  However, the hate generated by that combination would be huge and the shaman would die pretty quickly.  <br />
<br />
Necros can put up high damage using DoTs because they can shed aggro (I'm assuming they do this by FD'ing, someone correct me if I'm wrong).  The low DPS totals for the shamans probably resulted mostly from them using Tears of Saryrn, Velium Strike, or Spear of Torment. One shaman (Gakal on CT, 52 dps) looked like he/she might have been using Rabid Bear to stave off the boredom. My guess is that shaman DoTs on those mobs were used sparingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm why dont they just give us more Magic dots? Get rid of the new disease one and give us a real hard hitting amgic one thats lvl 65 instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, there are certain fights, especially listing those that are parsed, where I would rankpretty high in dmg, and some that I would rank pretty low.  For instance, taken into effect the four mobs that they were fighting, without knowing exact numbers, I would say that I would get between 10 - 20th vs Tallon Zek.  Against Saryn herself I would be prob closer to the middle considering that I actually have mobs to slow in there.  TT I would be closer to the bottom as such cause her ****ing dot always steals my mana regen no matter if I have 500 dps or not, and I hold myself off just to make sure I have mana to malos and slow the adds.  on VZ in the first 50% I would be prob right around 15 - 20 again, however I would go next to almost nil after 50%.<br />
<br />
In fact, i will that I will get out my parsing right now and check to see how i did against these guys the last time I fought them.</div></div><hr />

no, necros can put up higher damage than shamans with dots because its all they have to cast. if you gave necromancers malos and turgurs their damage would suddendly suck!<br />
<br />
you don't really need feign death to shed dot agro on fights over 30 seconds these days nomatter what dots you use. all you have to do is go take a leak at the beginning of a fight, and when you come back, the main tank will have eleventy billion points of agro that you couldn't overtake even if you wanted to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just parsed a fight against Tallon Zek in time (easy for for the most part cause it's one that once I cripple and malos, I really don't do anything else other than dmg.  <br />
<br />
I won't show specifics, but I'll give some background.  This fight was done the day that I got to run around beta and have fun with one of the devs, who I also talked to about the AAs.  As such, I was a bit excited and spent some of the fight bull****ting in the shaman channel about it.  On the other hand, it was also a day that for some reason the pally in my group couldn't stop getting hit, so I ended up healing him a few times.  I'll give specifics if you want, but added up over the course of the 3:23 fight (started from the sec that I did dmg, so I did miss about 20 secs in there where I did no dmg while debuffing) to his death, I did:<br />
<br />
31268 total dmg, most of it in dots.  total throught that 3:23 was just around 154 dps.  Now, if you take into account that I normally don't have to heal that much and normally i'm not as distracted as I was this fight, I didn't use spirit call this fight, and it took a good 30 secs after the main tank engaged for me to get situated into the area and for my debuffs to be done.  I would give myself maybe 170 - 190 dps if I would have just concentrated better.  Maybe more if I was willing to work a bit.<br />
<br />
I think one of my best parsings evern would have been on Fennin.  From the minute that he was engaged I threw five dots on him (bane, bos, pox, ultor and plague) and alternated our two best rains with a little VS mixed in until i got summoned at 5% and smoked.  I was pushing it and I figured i was going to die, but i wanted to see it.  Wish I still had the parsing from that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't know if any of you are in time guilds, but i ALWAYS heal on time gods. I get the 5 dps was from a swarm pet or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i do on certain fights, just depends.  I do alot of healing on the CT, Bert and Inny fights (inny when the adds spawn if I'm not already dead).  I do mostly dmg on the Saryn, TZ, 1/2 VZ, RZ fights.</div></div><hr />
