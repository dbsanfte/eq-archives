<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it is impossible to get 65 in that time (15 days played) without getting  BIG TIME power-leveled. i have a friend who power-levels toons on his other computer. he said it takes 8 -10 days played to get toons to 60. getting to 65 without a power-level would take much much longer.  racing to level 65 can leave the person lacking in skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can't see how people can deal with having a PL'd character.  I get ticked off if my skills aren't cap before I hit the next level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it is pretty much impossible to get to 65 in 15 days without PL. Even insanely twinked with KEI/Focus/Aego/haste etc... a character would not have enough DPS to kill that many mobs in that amount of time. It would be an interesting exercize to figure out some way to generate that much damage, but I doubt it's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With out being PL'ed I dont see it happening. I Pled a rog about a year and a half ago. to lv51 took me 2 real weeks and he had 4 days 2 hours played.</div></div><hr />

lets not forget our friendly counterpart monks can demolish mobs to nothing, FD, you kill however, and bam your exp.  As long as mob isnt running which im think undead mostly dont.  Thats alot easier then relying on the lowbie to put out the dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Damage shields are a huge help up to around level 25 or so. With my druid I've Pl'ed toons to 20 in under 10 hours, tried with my shammy and can't even come close to that, even with sending in dog dog at 49 percent health. At 25 or so Shaman catch up, and by 30 are way aehad. This is of course when Pl'ing a melee, casters would be a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My 50 warrior was shamelessly PL'd by myself.  Nice thing about doing it shamanically:  melee skills stay intact, since you're killing everything yourself (with a dog to help the last half).  Everything except 2hb was maxed before the next level hit.<br />

Go go buffs!</div></div><hr />
