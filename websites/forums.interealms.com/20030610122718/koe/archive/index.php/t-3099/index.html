<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Radoen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a nasty new Virus that has damaging effects.  <br />
<br />
W32.Vote.A is a mass-mailing worm that is written in Visual Basic. When executed, it will email itself out to all email addresses in the Microsoft Outlook address book. The worm will insert two .vbs files on the system, and it will also attempt to delete files from several antivirus products. <br />
W32.Vote appears to be a sympathetic piece of chain mail. The infected e-mail carries the subject line: &quot;Fwd: Peace BeTween AmeriCa And IsLam !&quot; The main body of the message states: &quot;Hi! iS iT A waR Against AmeriCa Or IsLam! Let's Vote To Live in Peace!&quot; <br />
<br />
If a PC user opens the attachment &quot;wtc.exe&quot; on a computer using Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Me or 2000, the worm executes. <br />
<br />
When it activates, the worm first attempts to mail itself to every e-mail address stored in the Microsoft Outlook address book. Then the worm saves two Visual Basic program files onto the computer: MixDaLaL.vbs and ZaCker.vbs. The worm also tries to download and run a file that would install a backdoor to the PC for online intruders to exploit later. <br />
<br />
The worm then executes MixDaLaL.vbs from the Windows System folder. MixDaLa scans every hard drive for files with .htm and .html extensions. When the files are found, the worm overwrites them with the aforementioned message. <br />
<br />
The other component of the worm, ZaCker.vbs, runs after the computer is restarted. The script attempts to delete all files in the Windows directory and overwrite the file used to start up the computer with commands that attempt to format the main hard drive. Because the necessary system files are gone, the last attack fails, but the other attacks result in the PC being rendered unbootable. <br />
