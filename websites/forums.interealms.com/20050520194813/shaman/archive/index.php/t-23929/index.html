I have seen this posted a few times now, and I can't help but to correct.<br />
<br />
Shaman get True Spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3377&amp;source=Live)  at level 61.<br />
<br />
At level 62, we are using True Spirit (which is a level 61 spell), assuming we are using the highest level pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it would be about a week too soon, if they did it now, based on how long the candy store was open for business when previous expansions were released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had heard they were nerfing the xp rate in PoFire....   I have no proof of that yet tho...</div></div><hr />

I think the only nameds that were nerfed were the Raid level ones that guilds were perma-camping since they were dropping Uqua-Qvic level loots, on 20 minute re-spawn timers. Normal, 1-group nameds seem to be popping at the same rate. Was in WoS today for about 2.5 hours (whatever the longest a VoQ can last, heh) and we saw lots of nameds on track, managed to pull 4 ourselves, and 3 of those dropped runes, 2 minors and a regular.</div></div><hr />
