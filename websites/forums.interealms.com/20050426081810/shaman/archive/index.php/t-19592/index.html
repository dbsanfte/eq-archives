<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
 I would like to do the Piglet camp in Tactics.<br />
<br />
I have read the forums on how to camp him but I would like to know how to get to him. I haven't dealt with that zone much.<br />
<br />
I assumed he is in the big pit straight out from zone in,saw a bunch of stuff down there though and some see invis so wasn't sure if that was the right place.<br />
<br />
Could someone please let me in on how to get to the camp?<br />
<br />
I am sure once I got the hang of it I could solo him. Right now I have all my main spells (all 51+ spells anyways,no LDoN spells though). I have some AA's and currently working on MGB but I am so tempted to gwt VP for camps like this lol.<br />
<br />
Sorry for Rambling :)<br />
<br />
Lookin forward to reading your replies :)</div></div><hr />

Just lev, invis, and head into the pit.  Avoid see invis mobs :)<br />
<br />
Also, without vp tactics will be very annoying for you since mobs in the zone tend to break root very frequently.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Waalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So that is where he spawns I take it =)<br />
<br />
Thanks much,I think I will get VP then rofl. think VP 1 is good enough at first? only have 6 AA banked right now.<br />
<br />
Oh,and the corner  Iwill be chillin in,is it to the right or left of the pit (looking from zone in).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info! I needed it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just hang out in the pit for a while.  Every once in a while (30-45 minutes I guess) you will get the message, &quot;You hear the pounding of the hooves.&quot;<br />
<br />
This means a stampede of about 20ish boars will spawn in the stables, run around the pit, and back to the stables where they despawn.  One of the boars is much smaller and is called the piglet.  He drops the good stuff.</div></div><hr />

He spawns in the pigpen which you can enter at the left side (looking from the zonein) of the pit.  Lev, Invis, and run straight from the zonein into the pit and turn slightly left and you will float down into the corridor that leads to the pigpen.  The stampede will come from the left and make a round trip through the pit and back to the pen.  Beware if there is already somebody (or more) in the area and if so, make sure to grab the piglet as soon as you can.<br />
<br />
Don't pull him with anything but a root spell or the rest of the boars will aggro you.  Also, when the stampede comes, stay along the walls (if in the corridor) or keep some distance if outside.  The boars are kos to everyone but don't have too large of an aggro range.  Once the piggy is rooted, proceed to debuff and dot him, but stay *close*.  Make sure he is always facing you, otherwise when he breaks root he will take off back towards the pigpen and despawn.<br />
<br />
Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Waalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wanted to drop by and say,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info guys!<br />
<br />
Did Piglet tonight for the first time without a hitch, first time he dropped WMBS and has made me that much closer to gear I need!<br />
<br />
<br />
Gotta love this community!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There have been a few times when I pulled to the corner getting agro from boars as they pass by the rooted piglet. Should i be rooting him on the way out or the way back?</div></div><hr />

Depends on the zone population honestly in my opinion.<br />
If you have the zone to yourself, or with just a group kiting in the sandbox (above the pit), then wait until he's on his way back.  It is much safer for you and easier to accomplish.<br />
<br />
If the zone has anyone else fighting pit mobs, and you are a bit gutsy, I always advocate nailing him on his way out.  If you are scared of boar aggro (or haven't perfected your root technique), you can use Petrifying Earth.  If you have time, follow that up w/ a Malos.  Then run like hell to the zone-out (or gate with yourself bound at the stone in PoTranquility) if you have big boar aggro.  By the time you zone back (you were already levitated right? ;) ), the piglet should still be parked unless you had a very early root break.  The other groups in the pit are likely still looking for him to come out through the pit to the NE tunnel, which is another easy spot to snag him.  I've snagged him myself there (right before he goes in the NE tunnel) when camping at the NE corner of the pit (too many wanderers path through NE tunnel for soloing)<br />
<br />
Competition for piglet is fierce on E. Marr.  I've seen people come into my corner (called the SW camp - area right outside the pigpen) and watch me pull and fight mobs for some time and then gank piglet right in front of me by beating me to first aggro by 2 seconds.  I've been maliciously trained while killing piglet solo before also.  There are a few people who routinely park themselves semi-afk for hours at a time just waiting for stampedes.  Whenever I'm there, I'm always actively killing the static spawns plus the wanderers and whatever pit mobs I have time for.<br />
<br />
I've also had groups come to help me finish off piglet asking nothing in return and had players respect my camp completely.  I personally respect first aggro for piglet as he is a wandering mob, and I respect other player's space nearby where they are located.  If I'm wandering around the pit and piglet is coming around, he's fair game in my eyes.  If I root piglet outside the pen, it breaks and he takes off again, I don't expect anyone to not try for him once he's out running in the pit.<br />
