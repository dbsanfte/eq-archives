<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ylaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, Im sure most of you have absolutely no idea who I am..Basically what I'm looking for is help with compiling a list of AAs that are misworded, very vague or otherwise have less than useful descriptions so that the descriptions could be changed in the future<br />
<br />
However I need your help to do it since I don't know what every single AA does or is supposed to do<br />
<br />
So what I would appreciate is if knowledgable shamen could help by posting AA's which have incorrect descriptions and then tell me also what they *do* or are supposed to do..<br />
<br />
This is not about balance, so please don't post what shamen need or should get at this point I'm only really interested in getting the facts, any help is most appreciated<br />
<br />
I apologize for posting this in general, but I can't really read through AA forums for 15 or 16 classes so any help you can post here could bring about changes in the descriptions :)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, the easiest one for us is our ward AA, Call of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
In the AA window, it claims to give Endurance Regeneration to everyone around you.   In actuality, it is indentical to the Cleric and Druid wards and provides a small amount of health regeneration.  We were supposed to get a refund for this, like last month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Please, do NOT start a list like this.<br />
<br />
They'll make it a top priority(just like fixing doors in freeport) instead of giving time to things that really need their attention.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The AA skill SCF (spell casting fury) describes it as an increasing chance to score a critical nuke. However the description is missing the fact that your crit amount goes up per level of SCF. You don't get max crits (double) until SCF level 3. This was confusing to me when I first bought SCF1 and only critted for 33% more instead of double.<br />
<br />
The AA skill SCM (spell casting mastery) has been determined by players to save a set amount of mana per spell cast. But its description implies that it is only a chance to save mana, and gives different percentage values than players have measured in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">rabid bear says it boosts all offensive capabilities, but doesn't increase strikethrough, accuracy, or any of that fancy stuff</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
when rabid bear was released  we didnt have any of that stuff so it was just dbl atk and etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just want some specific figures on LR, ID, and anything that says &quot; increases your chance of X&quot;.  Gimme some goddamn hard numbers.<br />
<br />
As it stands, LR5 could increase your chance of avoiding a blow by .0000000000001% per rank and nobody would be the wiser.</div></div><hr />
