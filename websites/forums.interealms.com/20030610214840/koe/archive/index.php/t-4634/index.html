<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anuin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I ordered a new Soyo Dragon+ K7V, an Athlon XP 1700+, and 512MB of DDR memory. Anyways, I backed up anything important on our hard drive, since I planned to reformat afterwards. <br />
<br />
Installing all the hardware goes fine, but when I boot it up, the BIOS will at MAX recognize my 30GB Maxtor (Ultra ATA 66) as 8 GB and that's after manually inputting sectors, heads, etc. On autodetect, it only sees it as 2 GB. The auto-detect on this sort of BIOS is strange--there's no option for me to select among different possible hard drive configurations: it only gives me the one 2 gig drive it allegedly autodetected. <br />
<br />
Any idea what could be going on? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Could also be an odd compatibility issue with Maxtor drives. Other than that, I have no clue.</div></div><hr />
