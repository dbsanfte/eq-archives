<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't wait to learn more about these pottery recipes.<br />
<br />
Spiritstone of Everfrost: Effect: Frost Port (casting time 30), wt 20, SHM/BAR, trivial &gt;221 (everfrost essence) <br />
<br />
Spiritstone of Cabilis: Effect: Field of Bone port, SHM, IKS, wt 20.0 <br />
<br />
Spiritstone of Innothule: Swamp Port, SHM; TRL, OGR, wt 20.0, trivial &gt;190 <br />
<br />
if these are reusable, I think I'll just take my pottery up from 122 when I started making Thurg potions instead of getting Alchemy to 170 for getting myself around...<br />
<br />
But with Fire pots in TD active again, why bother I guess.<br />
<br />
Any of those 1000 new recipes for alchemy yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">these are very high trivial (250+) and it's pretty expensive and a pain in the ass to raise pottery after 148 or so.  I have like 173 pottery because I want to make one of these things for fun.  They do have unlimited charges and they are sellable.  Unlike gate potions you can't hand them to anyone, like melees.  The everfrost one only works for barbarian shaman.<br />
<br />
alchemy was much easier to raise.  With Titans potions you can skillup at 11pp per attempt or so.   I have made 10 of 10 gate potions successfully at 150 alchemy.   To skill up past 188 in pottery it is a minimum of 27pp per attempt I think.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, I missed the unlimited charges part of the spiritstones.  They aren't as crap as I first thought I guess.  Now, if I just had the slightest interest in ever returning to Halas.</div></div><hr />

No.  Why would VI do such a thing?  They hate alchemy.  If they could they'd rip it from the game, shred it into tiny pieces, feed it to diseased rats and destroy it forever.<br />
<br />
Me, bitter?  What makes you think that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only reason I want to go back is exactly that..I never go back to halas..  I hear Halas guards are great exp...and will tick off one more city I'm KOS in :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Alchemy is the only &quot;tradeskill&quot; that doesn't have a Tradeskill Trophy and the alchemy herbs are now being used for the  other tradeskills.  While they haven't ripped it from the game they certainly did a good job of &quot;shreding it to pieces&quot; and destroying&quot; it forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, before anyone thinks of attempting one of these for personal use with minimal pottery skill:<br />
<br />
I'm currently 0 for 39 attempts at the faithstone of Brell. <br />
<br />
196 skill (One skill-up in 39 attempts)<br />
255 Wisdom<br />
Used Geerlock Sculpting Tools<br />
Around 12,000pp down the drain<br />
<br />
1 for 23 Faithstone of Nature<br />
<br />
200 skill + Geerlock<br />
255 wis/str/dex/agil/sta 197 int<br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />
Note: these weren't my attempts...  take a look at this thread tho:  http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerpottery.showMessageRange?topicID=548.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=30<br />
<br />
Attempting these without having 225+ skill is like trying to make Gate Potions with 40 Alchemy Skill.  Sure you might make one or two, but mostly your gonna waste all your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i made 2 of these with a 190 skill .. 2 outta 31 combines .<br />
<br />
key is to use a geerlok pottery tool .. add 5 % to success rate .. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Most of the potters on that board were using geerlok tools.  It looks like you got lucky with 2/31, grats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What does this tell us?<br />
<br />
200 is too low skill in Pottery to try spiritstones.<br />
<br />
Instead of blowing all that plat KNOWING that their skill is still too low (from the failures), why don't people just skill up more and try again?<br />
<br />
&lt;--- is not attempting his first stone until 220</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eoin, it tells us that VI is full of *******s since we can only take tradeskills up to 200 if we have one tradeskill that exceeds 200.  About the best we can do is a 200 tradskill with a tinkered +pottery item that gives +5% pottery skill for a combine at 210.<br />
<br />
We have a guy on our server selling em for 15000pp each.  And people are actually buying them!!!!<br />
<br />
At an estimate of 300pp per try (probably more like 250) that's 50 failures (or 60) before it'd be worth buying one.  At 196 skill, few people are going to fail 50 times.  The guy at 196 and failing 39 times being an exception, I suspect.  :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So, only grandmaster (201+) potters can make these?<br />
<br />
I don't see the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">An item with unlimited charges of gate to a fairly useful destination should be stupid hard to make.  <br />
<br />
Especially considering the effort that Shaman have to put into making Alchemy in order to make gate potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's the solution to EQ's bloated economy. I imagine hundreds of thousands of plat are disappearing on every server every day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I originally disagreed with Eoin, but after thinking about it I agree with him...the same person who can make 'uber-platemail-of-Godliness' shouldn't be able to casually whip these up.  If you want a 250 in tailoring, don't even bother making these - pay someone else to do it.  One person *doesn't* need to do it all.<br />

<br />
It's +5% to skill, not to success rate. Big difference there.</div></div><hr />
