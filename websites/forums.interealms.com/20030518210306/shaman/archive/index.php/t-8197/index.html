<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I switched to nathyns guards from the katta guards and there seems to be a marked difference in the XP I get.  I can only kill one of nathyns at a time, they seem to do more damage.  The kills take longer, and it's usually a dot or my epic that kills one.  The XP difference is huge.<br />
<br />
I had been doing the 8 guards at the twilight sea entrance (6 door guards and 2 roamers) and was getting a much better grind on.  I could do 2, possibly 3 at a time, they died quickly and i usually just had to polish them off with a quick JBB at the end.  I was usually down no less than 50% hp during any fight<br />
<br />
So, for me, nathyns guards just don't seem worth it.   Am I doing it wrong?<br />
<br />
epic, jbb, horse, bane, alpha<br />
<br />
lvl 57</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had done Nathyn's guards for a bit, then tried the regular guards down in the courtyard in front of the bank.  Exp was about the same (about 1 blue/hour with iksar exp penalty).<br />
<br />
Epic and Bane and dogdog, no horse or jbb, KEI and 56th level.  At Nathyn's place I would do the 2 guards and the 2 wolves out front (each singly) then attempt a pull from inside.  Inside pull would usually bring 2 guards, which was easily doable, or 3 guards which were a lot more difficult to deal with (one resist can ruin your day on one of those *g*).  I hadn't noticed a real difference in the amount of damage they did per hit, though it seemed the female 'sentries' from inside Nathyn's place were a bit tougher (could be my imagination, though... haven't parsed it.)<br />
<br />
The other guard camps are easier since it's simpler to get single pulls, and since it's pretty much the same rate of exp, the regular guards are preferrable.  The real reason to choose Nathyn's guards over the other mooks in Katta is if you're concerned about faction - Nathyn's guards give *positive* faction with the regular guards (I envision a lot of barroom brawls between the two groups when they're both off work).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nathyn's is quieter, and you can run if you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
At 58+, I would do the 4 out front - 2 guards, 2 sonics. Then the 2 inside - to single pull, open the door, and stand to one side so only one can see you. Then bring the other back out next trip.<br />
<br />
For the 3 in the back, open the door to the left, and barely stand in it... if you are lucky, you get 1. If you are unlucky, 2. But never 3. Usually I got just 1. Then I'd go back to 2, standing in the same spot a bit more in... then a repop so I was back to the front again.<br />
<br />
So 8 mobs total.</div></div><hr />
