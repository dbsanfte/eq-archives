<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">in my little guild we have hard time to get a full group, so no way for me to get epic 2, so I count on fellows shamy to quickly solve our epic 2 !<br />
<br />
Doh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been solved already, it's just broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a known bug with the final turn in for our 2.0 .<br />
<br />
Dev's were made aware of it yesterday &quot;1/10&quot; . I havent yet recived and updates . ill let you guys all know when i do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also have an email out to Vahlar (designer of the shaman epic 1.5/2.0) with the details of the possible bug!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like usual, Vahlar has quickly responded to my email. She is investigating the issue!<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">stay on em Glori... i hope to hell those who are ready to get it Quar and a couple others dont have to wait for next months patch to finish it.<br />
<br />
you know damn well if it were warr/cler/enc 2.0 bugged they would emergency patch the zone to get it working, we deserve the same level of treatment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's such a weird thing to say, that SOE would value the warrior/cleric epic over the shaman epic. When the shaman epic 1.5 was bugged at the Nadox step, Vahlar had the fix in place the same day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be patient?  Why the **** for?  You already paid them for that content, it should be working.  Wait!  Let me guess, they finally put a big disclaimer on the box: &quot;Warning: Content May Not (if EVER) be Completed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Is that in the EULA too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well they where taking the zone down tonight to fix it. I expect we'll know soon that it was fixed and we didn't even have to wait for the next patch.</div></div><hr />

As a software engineer, I can tell you right now that mistakes are made, and it takes time to fix them.<br />
<br />
Your incessant whining about it only serves to slow them down because they have to placate you AND fix it at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Stuff like this would be understandable, forgiveable, the first year of the game.  Year SIX and they still haven't learned how to QC/QA MAJOR quests?<br />
<br />
There is simply NO EXCUSE for it.  SOE is a bad company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is simply NO EXCUSE for it.  SOE is a bad company.<br />
<br />
But they are still using a 6 year old game design.  A game design which has no easy way to complete the quest without actually doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then move on to a game created by a company that meets your standards for QA. <br />
<br />
I invite you to point one out to me when you find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I stopped playing EQ in...August?  Sometime around then.  On occasion I play WoW, but most of the time I don't play any online games whatsoever.  When I'm sick with the monkey flu I like to see what great blunders SOE still serves up for its paying customers.  :p  Had a real nice laugh reading the title of this thread.  Original Shaman epic going from being the first one solved with probably the best story, to being the last one solved and bugged at that, and the expansion has been out for several months.  To be honest I am sincerely pleased to see that Sony still lives up to its reputation, it really helps reinforce the feeling of &quot;I'm not missing a damn thing.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's always nice to see an old player stop by without a trace of bitterness..... it's such a contrast to those haters who despised themselves for playing as much as they despised those who enjoyed it.... stop by again and share your good natured banter in another few months!</div></div><hr />

not to mention SOE has no ****in clue how the game works period  seeing their game was &quot;bought&quot; from Verant</div></div><hr />

Just FYI, those that have finished the shaman 2.0 quest report the final turn in is one of the most gorgeous and powerful in-game events they've ever seen.</div></div><hr />

Jesus dude you quit the game and don't play anymore.  Quit complaining and move on with your life.  Does coming to this message board give you some kind of secret EQ fix?  Find something else to do or maybe instead of bashing do something to help fix the game you no longer play.  Why are you still coming to the message board?  I have been playing this game since release and guess what?  I AM HAPPY WITH IT.  I still enjoy EQ.  So take your no longer playing ass and your bashing crap and go elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">grats to all those wielding the new beater :) I just didn't have the patience I guess, and my old guild has pretty much folded in the last couple months anyway. would like to see some screenies of the &quot;most gorgeous and powerful in-game event&quot; though, if you have em Glori</div></div><hr />
