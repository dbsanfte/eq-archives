<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tagnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been doing my epic for quite some time now i have finished up to Neh's ring and diary and had my tear MQ'd. I am wondering how big of faction hits Neh's diary and ring are and if it would just be easier for me to do envy and woe a few times then to organize another raid so if anybody knows what the faction is after Neh's part and at what faction you are at after the tear turn in please give me an idea<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it took me about 3 sets of ghiosk books, and woe &amp; envy 5 or 6 times (i did all teh work up to the ghiosk books, was just lucky and got multiple copies while soloing in CoM and decided to skip the Hole)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At the tear turn in, you get the message &quot;your faction with truespirit cannot get better.&quot; If you chose to skip steps, do what ever parts you want to get to that message.<br />
<br />
I acquired spare ghiosk books that dropped in CoM raids, and did all the steps in order too. I handed in ghiosk books the last nite, between the diary turn in and the tear turn in, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
2 guildies in my guild had their items eaten bacause of insufficient faction. One had the tear eaten (no message at all. not even &quot;I will do nothing to assist beings such as you&quot;), the other had high scale kirn eat his icon.<br />
<br />
Tear turn in: almost ally, takes you to max ally.<br />
there is a faction message when you turn in the item from rak, but you are already at max ally.</div></div><hr />
