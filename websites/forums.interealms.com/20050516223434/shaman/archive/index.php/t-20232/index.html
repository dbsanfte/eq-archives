Remember... we heard yesterday about how they were already looking into our HoT spells:<br />

I talked with the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; and he was already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT and will let me know when he has something concrete. <br />

Just to expand a bit on what Brenlo said:<br />
<br />
The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells. <br />

A week ago (March 2nd) they upped its hp/tick by 10 and raised its over all mana cost by 5.  Net benefit 40hp more for 5 mana.<br />
<br />
A few days later (March 4th) they degraded it back to its old hp/tick and then raised its mana cost some more.   Now it will cost almost 30% more mana than it used to before they started playing with it for the same amount of healing.<br />
<br />
Patch day is tommorrow.   I hope all you folks lucky enough to have gotten this spell are ready for it.<br />
<br />
Ok, Ryan and Brenlo, question for you:  How is upping the mana cost an increase in the power of our Heal over Time spells?   <br />
(and please, nobody crow 'working as intended')<br />
<br />
Curious minds (and paranoid shamans) want to know!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As much as I hate what happened to Trushar on test - that was before Brenlo came here, so let us try to be fair. If that pile of crap makes it to the live servers we can just restart this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well... Ryan said that the changes were already in on test.   So I went and took a look at them.</div></div><hr />

To me that reads as &quot;we are playing around with heals&quot; not as &quot;we have finished with the new heals, they are on test&quot;.<br />
I do not quite understand why, if they are indeed testing new heals, the numbers do not change more often. Thats a different tppic though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm pretty sure there's an internal only (alpha) server, and an external (beta-test) server.<br />
<br />
The only one we as non-employees see is probably the beta-test server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm assuming that they keep the ratio..<br />
360hp for 220mana is proportional to<br />
<br />
466hp for 285mana<br />
so I'm assumming 450mana per tick hopefully?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cool... a HOT that heals for 500 a tick on mobs that do 4 to 6k damage a tick!!! <br />
<br />
Weee great help there!<br />
<br />
HoT is NOT what we need... yes for BOT it will make us easily the main healer.....<br />
<br />
For Eplanes, PoTime, and GoD a HOT unless its 1500 a tick does absolutely nothing!!!<br />
 God is all about fast damage coming in on the MT and burst heals from healers.... No cleric in our guild uses anything but there big fast heal for trials 5, 6, 7, because the damage comes so fast that the tank could be dead in 10 seconds... and usually is ... we learned the hard way...<br />
<br />
Give us a freaking 1800 to 2k fast heal that AAs and Focus items works on and just leave the HoTs how they are.... <br />
Unless u want to make them group useable then by all means toss us a 450 to 500 HoT... otherwise dont waste the time....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I strongly agree with the idea that increasing the power of our HoT will do little to help our healing.  Even the best HoT in the game given to clerics has only 15-20% the healing power of a direct heal (see details in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20223)).<br />
<br />
The only way to salvage shaman healing in GoD is to introduce a significant upgrade to Tnarg's Mending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you dont think increasing our HoT is going to help us in healing then i personaly believe you dont understand the healing system in place for us druids and clerics.<br />
<br />
If the mobs is slowed a large HoT and a efficent blast heal will do us very much good. No we wont be healing for a unslowed named mob quading 2k a round, but really, did you think we ever would ?<br />
<br />
We heal with HoTs and blast heals, we do not heal like druids. Im sorry but its the facts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hope it is an improvement across the board.  i.e. including Quiescence.<br />
<br />
If they just improve ancients and difficult to obtain GoD spells then this is hardly any help at all, except for those few privileged folk who won't even appreciate it since it won't help them enough.</div></div><hr />

My MOBs do not arrive slowed. Slow can be resisted. in that case a better HoT will, at best, heal 500 extra HPs. On a 1300 hitter. Unless that HoT goes into the 1000 per tick range it will not help us keep someone alive. Help healing once slow is in, help healing after a fight, sure.<br />
But right now what we need least is more slow healing.</div></div><hr />

       Yeah in kurnak ,velious and luclin.....that was totally different. Another gameplay with low hitter ,no slow mitigation. Now ,they're huge hitter and mitige slow. Really you wanna heal with Hot ? That strange ,cleric don't even try with their 500 hp HoT ,which i understand  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The problem with us getting a new (or improved) HoT is stackability.  A lot of clerics I have grouped with use their own HoT quite extensively, as well as using their AA HoT.  Our HoT doesn't stack and is no where near the power of a cleric's.  So basically, when a cleric is in my group it is a waste to cast Q on anyone except myself.  And even then the cleric is overriding my spell most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">CONFIRMED.  <br />
<br />
They just Raised the mana cost of this HoT.<br />
<br />
Wow.  Talk about a betrayal of trust.   We actually belived them when they said they were going to help us and at the same time they had already done this and were waiting to roll it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Who knows, maybe the code changes take longer than a few days and had already been finished prior to the response from &quot;Spell Guy&quot;.  No, I am not giving them the benefit of a doubt..I rarely do that with any issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We've seen them make same-day changes to spells when it suits them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">update spellinfo<br />
