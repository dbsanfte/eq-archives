<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taylia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, let me apologies if this has been covered already. I could not find a thread that addressed the question I would like to ask.<br />
<br />
As most of us know, the formula for calculating maximum skill per level is, 5 + (5 x Level) for most skills.<br />
I’m aware that there is a skill cap (for example: 200 for 1HS), that is in place prior to 51.<br />
My question is; at level 51, can I max my 1HS to 250 or does another formula take the place of the above stated one?<br />
It seems that prior to 51, I was level maxing most of my skills before achieving the next level. Now, it seems that my skills are not increasing.<br />
Any help in clearing this up would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fyrfytr Blazeseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/nod Xyrauth, although Defense is off. The cap for defense is higher than 200 at 51+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taylia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you :)<br />
I did click on the link on the main page earlier, but was not able to open the page. I thought that maybe, it was still under construction.<br />
That answered my question.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For each level above 50 you go, your defense cap goes up by a measly two points . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anduyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm now 50, and none of my skills seem to be going up.  I assume post -50 means level 51?<br />
<br />
So lower cap is in effect &lt;=  50?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Skills don't start going up until 51...defense should go up 4 points per level now, with a total of 240 at 60...1hs, 2hs, 1hb and 2hb all go up 5 points per level, max of 250 at 60.  Archery and piercing are the same as defense...as for dodge/parry/riposte...I have no idea how those go up, but dodge is maxed at 170, parry at 220 and riposte at 185.</div></div><hr />
