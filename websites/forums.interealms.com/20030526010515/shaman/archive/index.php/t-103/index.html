<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not. Only way to get it is to have a INT caster (enchanter, wizard, necro) research it for you.<br />
<br />
Check http://mythiran.allakhazam.com/ for details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does anyone use this spell though? I got it and after a couple casts went back to using enstill which is IMO our best Root for mana, casting time, stickability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>katthye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for info! <br />
I think all our root spells pretty much stink.<br />
<br />
A gantru moktor adheres to the ground  <br />
<br />
then almost immediately:<br />
<br />
Your immobilize spell has worn off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Geez don't get my hopes up ... just say it resisted lol.  <br />

Thanks for posts again <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Root is best root available, the low low low lvl one<br />
<br />
Hits just as good as any other, for little mana compared to the others.  U can cast around 5 roots to a higher lvl one.  May not last as long if it does actually stick for the max time (does it ever??????) but is much more efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use Paralyzing Earth and you won't need to root again till the current target is dead...nothing better for parking mobs.<br />
<br />
Use root if your just trying to shed agro or are bracer nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">works a ton better if mob is malosini'd first. it will blow your mind sometimes when it sticks for 2+ minutes. But, sometimes it breaks in 30 seconds and that sucks. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've had good success with this spell, especially for root parking.<br />
<br />
Grieg's is the exception.  Has about 10 sec wear-off rate there, but I think any of the roots would.  It's just the zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, around 58 this spell really starts to work well.  I used Immobilize for the duration of the 50s, until I started using Paralyzing Earth again.  At 59, I can root park for as long as I need unless the mobs I'm stickin it to are root-resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used Enstill well into the 50's, and like the original poster, the first time I tried Immobilize I was not impressed and went back to Enstill.<br />
<br />
Decided to give Paralyzing Earth a try when I got it, and it works fine. And there have been many times that I root-parked a mob and it stayed parked long after we were ready to fight it. Even had some stay rooted until they were dead (with a 60 monk beating on them). <br />
<br />
Some mobs just dont stay rooted very well...those gantru moktors, for example. Was hunting in Umbral last night and that was typical experience rooting them. Root, 1 second later root wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's odd, I hate ensill ever since I first used it to kill giants in WW.  If the mob was dotted, it would wear off immediately after it landed.  Since I got immobilize, I love it and don't really use the old root spell anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Okay.. here are the hard numbers:<br />
<br />
Root: last 48s, 2s cast, 2s recast, 30 mana.<br />
Enstill: last 96s, 2.5s cast, 2s recast,  60 mana.<br />
Immobilize: last 60s, 1.75s cast, 3s recast, 80 mana<br />
Paralysing Earth: last 180s, 2.5s cast, 2.5s recast, 100 mana.<br />
<br />
Beside the hard numbers, the other thing to consider is the way root works. Every root spells works the same way: the target get a MR check when the spell lands, then gets another MR check every tick AND every time a DD lands (including the DD components of our DOTs). This means that ...<br />
<br />
... when rooting, Malise/Malisement/Malosi/Malosini/Malo is your best friends. Doesn't even need to land BEFORE the root. Casting Mal* will actually help the root last longer even if cast AFTER the root land. With Malosini and PE on the MOB, the MOB is pretty much stuck in place for 2 to 3 minutes, unless it has unbelievably high MR. Incidently, this also pretty much makes the shamans the best rooters in the game.<br />
<br />
... If you're playing wizard and are rooting/DD'ng, you may as well not bother with anything but the lowest, cheapest Root. Chances are that it will never even last 30 seconds anyway, isn't it?<br />
<br />
... if you're doing crowd control, Enstill or Paralysing Earth are the way to go.<br />
<br />
The last thing that everybody should know about root is the dirty little secret of Enstill. You see, that root is not like the other roots :D Every other root apply more or less the same modifier to the MR check made every ticks and with every DD that lands. Not so for Enstill... It's both durable and fragile. The chances of it breaking over time are low but, to compensate, the chances of a DD breaking it are fairly high.</div></div><hr />
