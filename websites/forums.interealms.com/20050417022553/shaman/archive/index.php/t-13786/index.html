<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been seeing alot of good posts on areas, and a few great guides as of late.  Would you guys want to see some of them stickied?  If so, send me a PM with the name of the post and its creator, and if I get enough votes for one I'll put it at the top for recognition.  :)<br />
<br />
I dont want to put too many up and cause a cluster, just a few of the best per forum.  So, to keep them trimmed, I'll just ammend one dedicated thread detailing all the best posts/guides/ect that our fellow shaman submit and approve.  Of course, I will also remove the post if its original creator wishes.<br />
