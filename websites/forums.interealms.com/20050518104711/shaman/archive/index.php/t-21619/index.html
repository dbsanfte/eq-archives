<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if some shaman expert on UI could tell me how I can eliminate the message about focus items glowing e.g. my ornate boot example.  I like to keep my message box spam to a minimum in case you wonder why I care.<br />
<br />
Thanks much for any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was no prior way to do this up until the patch today. Once the servers come up (estimated 2 hours yet - 1pm Eastern), then you should be able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">umm.. it's only 12pm est right now karaab and you posted a hour earlier.  Either way, i'm sur they are either up by now.. or close to coming up.</div></div><hr />

I'm confused...  He said they're due up at 1pm eastern, so estimated 2 hours to go, and you said it's still an hour to go, and he posted an hour ago...  Doesn't that mean he was right?  /em scratches his head  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm confused...

<br />
I was right, when I posted that at 10:20ish Central time (11:20 Eastern) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nah.. what I got from his message is that they were estimated to be down 2 hours from when they patched (6am est), yet it was 1pm est his time and they weren't up yet (just how I read it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I noticed that when I turned my filter off, it didn't affect all focus messages.<br />
<br />
My Spell Haste Items STILL give me a focus message, even with the filter on, but my Burning Affliction does not (so no more focus spam per tick of DoT damage).<br />
<br />
Go figure... /shrug<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a new button to depress on the &quot;Filters&quot; tab of your in-game options menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guess I posted in the other thread about having the same problem.  Spell haste still emotes, but all the rest are silent for now.  Haven't tried to trigger my ER yet since it is only rank 3 anyway.<br />
<br />
  Spell haste is the only item that I have a doubled up effect on though, I have generic spell haste, then later got both detrimental and beneficial haste which override it.  So it might be the 2 focus factor, or it might just be that haste isn't being filtered so far.  I am glad however to have Mana pres and BA both shut up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is kind of strange that the only one that does not seem to filter out is spell haste.  My Marsingers kept giving me the focus message and I tried in vain to get rid of it.  Oh well...I can live with one.  Much better than in the past.</div></div><hr />
