<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vash</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In PoV the other night there was a 52 cleric LFG...<br />
<br />
the minimum mob would be be deep red... the agro on healers is bad enough right now<br />
<br />
i could only imagin that the first CH on the MT would draw the agro off to the MT right away and leave her in a pool of blood about two swings later...<br />
<br />
<br />
i guess it would have been worse if it was any class other than a cleric in PoV that low, they can still CH...<br />
<br />
i guess they could have won the trial legitamitly but i'm thinking they rode on 5 solid people... <br />
<br />
just wondering what other people think... i was shocked to say the least</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is they camped in the exec room or rode a really strong group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidan</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm baffled as to what makes people &lt;56 think they can get a group in the planes when there are 10+ level 61-64 sitting there LFG.  I've seen lvl 48's lfg in PoN.  What are they thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vash</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we almost grouped the 52 cleric as she was the only one lfg that night.. but we chose to agro kite golems instead just out of the principal of the thing...<br />
<br />
<br />
its taken me 4 hours to find a group before... so many rogues... than you finally get a group and the cleric says wow this DPS is still really nice and we don't have any rogues!!<br />
<br />
/smack cleric<br />
<br />
(we had a mage wizzy ranger monk)<br />
<br />
<br />
i've yet to see any melee less than 60 lfg in PoV yet... i'm sure they are out there though<br />
<br />
<br />
i was under the impression there were lvl caps on the zones... i heard 60 minimum for second tier planes and some would be 65...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guarantee that most of the &gt;55 crowd you see in PoV are people that looted marks before the trial nerf (i.e. a group that completed the trial had extra marks and the person zoned in after the group left to loot one of the extras).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domandred</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay this one I'm gonna have to agree with.  Watching my GF play in PoV there is no reason for a 52 Cleric to be there.  Not only the agro aspect, but I just don't think she is gonna have enough mana to keep up without some down time every 5 or 6 pulls.<br />
<br />
Even if I did manage to fanagle my way into a trials group I still wouldn't step foot into PoV until level 60.  MAYBE if my whole guild managed to flag themselves.  That would give us around 15 level 55+ characters that we could /raid, but still our poor warriors would get chewed to pieces.  Not to mention I would have to chain jolt to keep the agro off me.<br />
<br />
PoN, PoD, PoI fine.  PoV?  Forget about it.  Send those &lt;60 out unless they bring their own /raid.</div></div><hr />

I'm planning to loot one with my 47 shammy alt just for giggles if nobody else in the guild requires one.. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were some guilds on Xegony (and probably elsewhere) that were camping out groups in the trial room then doing the trial with a powerful group who would not loot the marks, then leaving and the camped people logging in to loot.  I have heared that the GMs are now examining the guild logs for the relavent guilds and may be banning people guilty of this exploit.  In my opinion this would be a good thing.</div></div><hr />
