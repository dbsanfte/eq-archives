<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">merick</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While doing some epic work I turned in the soul bound hammer and a friend turned in the sky stone, only I turned in the hammer before he turned in the stone and he ended up with the peice. <br />
<br />
He already has swiftwind and the refined mithril blade.<br />
<br />
I still need to complete the Jade Reaver part to get the ancient longsword from Telin. <br />
<br />
Is the dwarf forging a series of sequinces? or are they seperate. Near as I can figure out if he turns in the hammer I can turn in the longsword to get the refined ancient sword and he can keep the ore till a later date. Is it going to be possible for him to turn in the ore to get the refined mithril blade after he or I whoever gets their SEOC first? <br />
<br />
My reasoning on this is Kinlo is the person to turn in the hammer to in the first place. Can someone just turn in the ore to him and get the refined mithril blade without spawing Usbak? or am I simply going to have to do the whole quest over again to get the hammer from Jael before I turn in the ancient longsword so I don't have to do that part over again too?<br />
<br />
It was too late for any petitions to be channeled upwards, though I am hoping tommorow that mabey just mabey a petition might have an effect and I can get my hammer since my friend already has his swiftwind and refined mithril blade.<br />
<br />
I am in a small guild and this stuff isn't easy for me. I do not know when or if I will even get a Jade Reaver even. Any help in this matter would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The correct steps are this:<br />
<br />
1. Give soulbound hammer to Mairee Silentone, receive Hammer of the Ancients<br />
2. Retrieve swirling sphere of color from plane of sky as told by Mairee<br />
3. Give hammer of the ancients and swirling sphere of color to Mairee Silentone, receive Dwarven Smith's hammer<br />
4. Give dwarven smith's hammer to Kinlo Strongarm, spawns Usbak the Old, receive mithril ore (given to you immediately by Usbak the Old as he spawns)<br />
5. Give ancient longsword to Usbak, receive refined ancient sword (Usbak despawns)<br />
6. Give mithril ore to Kinlo, receive refined mithril blade<br />
7. Give refined ancient sword to Telin Darkforest, spawns Faelin Bloodbriar, get refined ancient sword back<br />
8. Give refined ancient sword to Faelin Bloodbriar, receive Swiftwind<br />
9. Retrieve shattered emerald of corruption from the plane of hate<br />
10. Give refined mithril blade and shattered emerald of corruption to Xanuusus,  receive Earthcaller<br />
<br />
I understand that your friend ended up with the Dwarven Smith's Hammer, the item that needs to be given to Kinlo, and that he already has a refined mithril blade. <br />
<br />
I suggest the following to avoid any trouble: wait for your friend to complete his epic so he no longer has his own refined mithril blade. Get your ancient longsword from Telin. Then, let your friend hand the dwarven smith's hammer to Kinlo. He will receive the mithril ore. Hand your ancient longsword to Usbak and receive the refined ancient sword. Your friend hands the mithril ore to Kinlo and receives a refined mithril blade. After you get your shattered emerald of corruption, head over to Xanuusus. Have your friend hand in the refined mithril blade, then turn in the emerald, and get Earthcaller.<br />
<br />
I hope I got that right.... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In answer to your question, I believe that the only parts of the dwarven forging you have to do all at the same time are steps 4 and 5 in the list above.  You could theoretically do the Usbak part, then leave and come back later and give the mithril ore to Kinlo and get the refined mithril blade.  <br />
<br />
This is based on the assumption that Kinlo is not caused to respawn in some way by the activation of the quest.  I don't think he is, but then I've never actually paid close attention to that.</div></div><hr />
