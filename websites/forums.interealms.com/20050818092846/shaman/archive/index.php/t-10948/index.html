<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i personally agree that Verant has yet again ignored the shaman, while boosting the capabilities of a Dragons quite a bit. I personally don't care how few less percents the Dragon can slow, it's STILL quite a bunch and they are crawling into MY area. Sure, people ask for Focus and that, but it's ONLY because it adds few buffs under ONE buff slot. You all should be happy that there are still only 15 buff slots in the game. Because if Verant one day increases it, to, say, 30, then NO ONE will ask buffs from shaman, simply because Dragon CAN and DOES buff better then we, supposed &quot;King of the Buffs&quot;. King of the useless buffs, I'd say. Not to mention that most classes like Dragon buffs more because these stack with more class spells then shammy ones do. <br />
<br />
I am pretty much even afraid to see, what the heck Verant (or SoE, whatever they name themselves now) will present with the release of new LoY spells. And I am pretty SURE that shamans will get shafted yet again, or at least totally ignored. Not to mention that since the LoY is generally for pre-60 levels, the shamans wont get any &quot;adjustments&quot; or fixes above lvl 60 anyway, and now will be also nerfed below lvl 60. <br />
<br />
And I find those people, who say &quot;You have a class envy!&quot; to be total morons. YES, I bloody do check the things related to MY class and other classes, because I LOVE my class and I see the use of MY class slip more and more behind. We got first - and last so far - new things with Kunark. We not &quot;not so useless&quot; general improvements (AA) with Velious. In SoL we got nerfed already - our main damage spell lines became in many cases useless - mobs are literally immune to poison and disease. Slow got hit first time hard with the appearance of totally immune mobs to Slow. We didn't get anything new or useless regarding the spells, these still remained at Kunark level. PoP came out and our slow is screwed even more, with more immune to Slow mobs and to very common slow mitigating mobs. Our damage spell lines, like poison, are still being totally resisted by mobs. AA upgrades are plainly pathetic joke and spells are even worse. So called &quot;upgrades&quot;, which last 2-4 times less then old spells, which take 3-4 times more mana per cast and which add minimal bonus over the old spells. Indeed, a bloody &quot;upgrades&quot; I'd say. Verant had to think REALLY hard and long to come up with that stupidity. <br />
<br />
And other classes got improvements, which brought them closer and closer to us, in ONLY area where we still have any REAL use - slowing. But you see, for some reason other classes do not have even HALF as hard time slowing the mobs then we do. Sure, Lucy shows that every spell is equal regarding resist checks and all, but reality shows different things. Dragon's lands a Slow on totally unbuffed mob without any issues, I get bloody resisted even after debuffed the mob with Tash and Malosini (common XP mobs). Enchanter slaps slow easily on non debuffed mob in ToV, while my slow wont land with Tash, Occlusion and Malosini all being on the mob already. And these are not rare cases, these are constant cases. So either Lusy is full of crap regarding the spells, or there is something &quot;else&quot; on the spells, what Lucy wont pick up. Whatever the case is, this is the fact. <br />
<br />
Of course, after we get shafted in LoY too - and I bet that we WILL get shafted - there's not too much time left when the SWG is out. So probably I could say &quot;Screw this, it wont matter anything soon anyway&quot;, but I don't because I STILL care about my class.<br />
<br />
So in closing..... If SOE doesn't bring my shaman class up to the level of Dragons... I am going to quit.... I can stand not being as good as Dragons and I think that Dragons will make my class obsolete. Please respond as I will be posting this Class envy post on all the Dragon boards.... everywhere.. and I am sure this will upset lots of ppl.<br />
<br />
I have 15 accounts and you should listen be I really feel strongly about it.<br />
<br />
So.... NERF Dragons.... I want to be better to them...<br />

<br />
In general, shaman are getting sick of being nerfed or ignored.  This has been flaming up a lot lately, but I don't see most shaman on this board calling for nerfs.  As a community, we know how that feels and we are not wishing that on anyone else.</div></div><hr />

From a shaman perspective... No.<br />
<br />
But from a wizard, warrior, and cleric perspective that are all 60... YES.<br />
<br />
From my other characters perspective... if a group can handle pulls like a raging river then all of a sudden come to a trickle because the shaman left... then yes.. they are powerful.</div></div><hr />
