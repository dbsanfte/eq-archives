<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15640">My 3 Ideas, What I would change</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's my ideas for what I would change in EQ at the present time, just my opinions...<br />
<br />
1. Eth/Spec Parchment = Runes. <br />
I'd like to see it possible to turn in 10 Eth Parchments for 1 Spec Parchment, and the possibility turn 10 Spectral Parchments for 1 Rune.<br />
<br />
2. Shaman Slow vs, Enchanter/Beastlord/Bard.<br />
I'd leave everything as it is (75/70/65/50, cast times, etc.) but I'd add a simple negative resist check on the Shaman line, like a -100 resist check. <br />
<br />
Slowing is our primary role, not our only roll, but our primary one. I'd like to see ours have a definate better chance of landing. It's totally ridiculous to me that I am level 65, cast Malo on a giant in BoT and can still have Slow bounce twice.<br />
<br />
3. Unscribe Spells.<br />
Just as you can click a spell in your book and hit delete to remove it, I'd like to see the ability to &quot;un-scribe&quot; spells back to scrolls. I'd be such a boon to my guild if I could pass down Torpor or Malo on to one of the level 60 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Well just my ideas...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">#1:  I agree wholeheartedly.  I assume you mean 5 eths into one spec, though?  This would be easy enough, just have an NPC give out 5 and 10 slot bags in which to combine eths.  Preferably then, also have the same NPC give out a 2 slot bag to combine specs to make runes, as well.  Obviously, by the number of glyphed rune word spells you see in the bazaar, SoE did not intend for them to be rare, and by the fact they're not nodrop, didn't mean them only for the raiders, so it seems the only purpose served by glyphed rune words currently is to line the pockets of raiding guilds.  See elemental tradeskill items for another example of this.  Completely unnecessary.<br />
<br />
#2:  I'd settle for a -30 or even a -10 resist check (most non-lure wizard spells, for example, have a -10 resist check.  -100 would almost completely invalidate the malxxx line except as a tool to help OTHERS land their spells, which, in the end, would just leave a bunch of shamans bitzing about having to use the malxxx line in groups, when they didn't need it for their own slows.  Either way, it's not going to happen, as shaman slow is already the best in the game...we should be happy it doesn't have a +resist check to it, not to mention the fact that we get an unresistable debuffer spell line.<br />
<br />
#3:  This would be great, but is unlikely to happen.  As per #1, I'd like to see it, if only to flood the market with copies of torpor/malo, so that people couldn't charge outrageous prices for these spells.  This would also hugely help wizards to get sunstrike.  For some reason, SoE has decided to make certain pre-PoP spells rare (imho, no PoP spell is truly rare), and I suppose they want it to stay that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">#3: For some reason, SoE has decided to make certain pre-PoP spells rare (imho, no PoP spell is truly rare), and I suppose they want it to stay that way.<br />
<br />
I don't think it was intentional at all. I think it's more a side effect of 1 really crappy zone, VP. Look at all the other expansions after kurnak and you had a high end zone or zones that people hunted heavily and still hunt today that can commonly drop the top end spells. SoV has PoG, WW and ToV. SoL has ssra and other misc targets all over the place. PoP has the elemental planes. VP on the other hand was hardly touched even when kurnak was the expansion and almost totally ignored once later expansion packs came out. This ment even when it was the expansion the spells where rare and it nothing has change to improve that situation. The rescent changes to VP are a good step but far far too late. The key is a pain and the vast majority of the peopl who have them did them way back when and are now the ones doing ssra, vt and elemental planes or even time and there isn't anything in VP that they would touch with a 10 foot pole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i totally agree with the #1 the way we get pop spells is retarded we should be able to turn in the spells we get for other spells or get spells that we dont have (like it checks our spellbook or something) or like your idea<br />
<br />
#2 slowing is our main job and it has been compromised by other classes that can slow almost as good as ours or mobs that mitagate we need some advantage i know we have an unresistable debuff but as someone said even if we use that we still bounce slow in 3rd+ tier<br />
<br />
#3 this isnt a big deal to me i guess to get more malo's and torpor's circulating to lower the cost it might be nice or to hand down other spells we get upgrades of</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Number 1 is an awesome idea, I used to destroy 5 ethereals a day, at least the other way it would be a fun quest to do :)<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Add simple negative resist check on the Shaman line, like a -100 resist check. <br />
<br />
<br />
-100!? you know -15 (malosinia vs malos) is INCREDIBLY large.. this would make the game trivial.. at least for us shaman.. nothing like charismaing yourself up, getting a rune, divine intervention, and rolling the die.. bought my level 59 cha buff and I love it. Even slowing black reavers, you wouldn't even have to debuff.. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. Unscribe Spells.<br />
Just as you can click a spell in your book and hit delete to remove it, I'd like to see the ability to &quot;un-scribe&quot; spells back to scrolls. I'd be such a boon to my guild if I could pass down Torpor or Malo on to one of the level 60 Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be ridicilously stupid.. make prices of spells very low.. takes away the challenge of the game.. for example, I've been missing quiescence for a long time, my guild used to get maybe 5 runes a week (doing pop vt).. today we got 22 runes, our gb is over flowing with 5-6 Blood of Saryns.. we have 9 very active shaman, everyone turning in runes etc and no one getting q..  it's fun asking the spell manager how many more shaman turn ins he's gonna try =] (my point is, it's fun getting your own spells).. just my opinion :) and yeah I want to get it from a turn in not by buying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The rescent changes to VP are a good step but far far too late.

<br />
Got my vp key after I got eplanes access =( sad though I still haven't gone there.. the reason is not the design, it's just that guilds that can be doing vp are looking at bot 2 minis instead.. no one wants to do the work it takes, they just all want the rewards.. can't blame soe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">#1 is a great idea, IMO.  And 100 Eth-&gt;1 Rune is about the right ratio, too.<br />
<br />
#2 is not as great.  We don't need this change.  What I'd rather see is SUBTRACTIVE slow mitigation instead of MULTIPLICATIVE slow division.  i.e. if a monster is 25% slow mitigating, then a 50% slow would slow him by 25% (50-25), a 75% slow would slow him by 50% (75-25).   This would keep the advantage of our slows over those of other classes.<br />
<br />
#3 is just a Bad Idea (tm).  It might fix the malo/torpor problem, but it would crash the spell market for ALL spells pretty quickly.  It would also create bad blood between those who want a full spell book and those who want the spells.  Fix the malo/torpor problem another way and keep spells the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">#1. Definitely agree with this one, turning in eths for spects and spects for runes is something we used to discuss on a daily basis back when pop came out.<br />
<br />
#2. Our Slow is already exellent. If they were to make a higher level version I'd love to see them lower the refresh/recast time. Having a resist modifier consistent with other similarly leveled spells would also be nice. <br />
<br />
#3. Would love to be able to give old spells to younger shaman friends but I think this would be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
(ps... Shrink with no group target limitation !)<br />
(pps... Focus items that would affect Heals over time the way burning affliction affects dots)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How is #3 a bad idea?<br />
<br />
How is our slow excellent? with so many mitagating mobs people are taking other classes over us because they can slow just as good and bring more to the table<br />
<br />
Shrink with no group target limitation<br />
<br />
not sure what u mean but if u mean shrinking people out of your grp this is a bad idea it would be too easy to grief other players there was a very good thread on how to fix this started by penny antics (too lazy to look it up...just search) apparently SOE is just too busy or doesnt care not like they have taken any of our suggestions anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">#1 seems pretty cool, i dont see a good reason not to do it.<br />
<br />
#2 a neg 100 is WAy to much, if you do it maybe a neg 10-15.  However I think its alright as is, though resists do suck.  It would be pretty spiffy.  Also as stated, if there is ever an upgrade to Slow ditching the refresh time alone would be godly.<br />
<br />
#3 dunno both sides of argument are pretty good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How is #3 a bad idea?<br />
<br />
Simple, getting a spell is your character gaining knowledge and power, not renting any old piece of equipment. You scribe it, memorise it, use it. It might make spells easier to get but personally I don't like it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't know what kind of shaman you're playing but I find groups just going to the bank and scratching my arse. I can't put up my lfg tag when I wait on a raid without getting at least 3 tells from strangers looking for a shaman. We're not exactly hurting here even if we do share slow with 2 other classes.<br />
<br />
Our slow is exellent enough to make us essential in any setting post pop. It's good enough that any modification to it will affect game balance. The other slow classes bring different things to the table but they certainly don't bring more. Lowering the annoying recast time and adding a resist modifier in keeping with it's level would be an exellent upgrade as far as I'm concerned. Mitigating mobs affect everyone, not just shamans.<br />
<br />
<br />
not sure what u mean but if u mean shrinking people out of your grp <br />
<br />
I mean not having to leave my group 50 times during raids to shrink everyone that happens to die and need reshrinking or lose their illusions and unshrink or forgot to get batteries for their shrinking device.<br />
<br />
I mean exactly what has been discussed countless times in these very forums. Remove the group only restriction and replace it with a confirmation box like they did with translocate. They'll do it eventually, It's just a question of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">#1 is good idea, just add a quest very similar to Kunark spell quest at FV/OT that require you turn in 4 lvl61-62 spell for 1 lvl63-64 spell<br />
<br />
#2 is dream, -100 resist = unresistable, except very very few mob have immmune to magic like emp/kunark dragon/WtoV dragon(Emp possible slowable with -100 and malos); maybe add -10 or -5 is good enough<br />
<br />
#3 is bad since it will destory spell market, unless you make it this way : you need buy empty scroll from NPC for 10k, then you can now written your knowledge into it from memorise and make spell scroll. maybe empty scroll cost 50k so do you still like to buy it to pass down ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And while you're at it, make all the ornates drop in tier 1, if you can wear it at 55 why can't you get it at 55!? stupid soe.. and make it so that if I am done with it, I do a quest and it turns back into the pattern.. and also would be cool to have a quest to turn my epic back to the childs tear, so I can mq it for friends.. also the smiths make too much money, why don't the tae ew in feerot drop blood? don't tell me they don't bleed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Im sorry Khozik i didnt realise this would ruin your &quot;Uberness&quot; im still wondering (so are alot of other people) how someone so misinformed got in the elementals.
