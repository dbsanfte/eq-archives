<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can also use alchemy for the shard and lacquer if you have a medicine bag.  Thought everyone might want to know that.  People are charging 100pp on Sol Ro per Prismatic vial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Where do ya buy the ingredients?   I get lost at eqtraders.com.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The components for one dye, if no failures cost about 35pp.  I succeeded most of the time with about 147 pottery skill.  Recipe is one unfired vial plus firing sheet in kiln = fired vial.<br />
crystal + lacquer = dye<br />
dye + vial = dye vial ready to go<br />
<br />
I made 20 extra when I was done dyeing my own gear (all black of course), and quickly sold out at 80pp a pop at a guild raid later in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One problem with light colors is the &quot;underlying&quot; base color.  I tried to color match my whole set to the jbb.  Turns out that my cowl of mortality and the coldain skin gloves don't color any lighter then a medium brown leather, and the tae ew and wolf caller parts look like &quot;naked&quot; chain, e. g. barbed ringmail.  but at least I no longer look like a ranger-parrot hybrid.<br />
The nice thing is you can rgb code any color you like, so you can play around a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree; the dyes are a lot of fun.  My druid has 200 brewing and 199 pottery, so he didn’t fail very much.  I was so tired of the same brown leather look level after level after level.  I died all my leather to dark green, with my wrists and feet, which look like metal armor, a slightly tinted metallic color.  The look is really nice.  My shaman still has crap armor that isn’t worth messing with.  I’ll worry about it later when he has some decent armor and the money to pay for his own dyes.  <br />
<br />
With two opal steins my druid can buy all the materials for just under 30pp.  I made extra and sold them for 60pp.  I could have gotten more for them, but I hate ripping people off.  Yet another reason I never have any money. *grins* <br />
<br />
If you haven’t tried the armor dye, I’d highly suggest taking a look at it.  You don’t have to have a dye to play with the colors.  Just click the dye button on your inventory window and go for it.  If you find a combination of colors you like, write down the numbers.  When you eventually get some dyes you can type in the numbers and your good to go.  And each armor slot only takes 1 dye.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lemme get this straight - if I dye my helmet that has no graphic it will then have a graphic??  This I would like.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I went for the Superman look, though some mistake me for Spiderman, but thats ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No, dying your helmet slot will not generate a graphic for armor that does not already have one.  It’s dying the slot, not the armor.  So it doesn’t affect the armor in any way whatsoever.  But the next helmet you put in that slot that does have a graphic will be “tented” that color.  I tried it with my druid, who’s helmet doesn’t have a graphic, so I know it doesn’t have any effect.  <br />
<br />
However, because you’re dying a slot there can be an interesting side effect.  My druid’s leather tunic is low cut, revealing part of his chest and shoulders.  When I dyed his tunic slot dark green it also colored his exposed skin dark green.  I don’t care for this side effect, but I can live with it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Jaeden…  THANK YOU!  <br />
<br />
I tried what you suggested at lunch and typed in /dopropertinting on.  At first I didn’t think it worked.  Even after I zoned it didn’t make a difference.  But after bringing on a couple of other characters to fill their new bank slots with deluxe toolboxes I did a double take when I saw my druid on the character selection screen.  I logged him in and sure enough, all his flesh is now flesh toned.  I even found out that he has slits up the sides of his leather armor. I’d never noticed that before.  So from now on I’ll add your suggestion to any of my posts about armor tenting.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As horrible as that troll is, no compliment intended, I have to say that I’ve seen players wearing armor almost as bad even before the dyes went live.  That was the reason I was so excited about dyes in the first place.  Hardly any of my armor ever matched.  And some armor combinations were truly atrocious.  And although some people will have fun making themselves look as horrible as they can, I think most players will try to come up with nice color combinations.  Well, at least those few that don’t go for the all black look.</div></div><hr />

Time was, you could get an inkling of another player's uberness by their level / weaponry / wardrobe. With AA skills / newbie weapons that look like uber weapons / and now armor dyes, that's all out the window.</div></div><hr />

Prysmatic dye eh? I don't know what you guys are seeing, but all I see is black. TONS of black. So lame. I'd rather see the troll clown than one more &quot;dark knight&quot; imo.</div></div><hr />

I may end up toning down the colors a little, but overall, I like the effect. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Kamidari, I like that look.  It’s a good color combination and you can easily discern the design on your chest plate.  My druid is in very dark green leather with silvery metallic wrists and boots.  But I may have gone too dark.  The process does seem to take some fine-tuning.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Does anyone know how to make your armor true white? Ive tried dying my ss armor white, but it just looks like a light silver with a white shine to it. I'm talking about white as snow white with no metallic look at all. And why do some colors color your whole arm while others just color the chain? E.G. the defaul blue ss armor colors your whole arm blue. But if you change the color to certain colors, just the chain is colored and you arm is flesh toned where there isnt chain.</div></div><hr />

I've seen everything from an ogre warrior in a full suit of hot pink plate to a barbarian shaman in hot pink stockings/bra with fluorescent arms and high heels.<br />

I'd laugh if they did it as a joke, but VI then did away with the dyes and they were stuck looking the way they do. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Heh, I couldn't get the dyes to work. Granted I was xping, dinged, then spent 5 minutes on it. I was rushed and just wanted to log. I type the /dopropertinting on, zoned, and it didn't have an effect. I have an Ikky BP that has always painted my chest dark violet. Was hoping to fix that, but zoning didn't work. Do I have to logout completely?<br />
<br />
After zoning didn't work, I dyed the chest slot, saved it (cosumed the dye), but the chest slot not only still paints my skin, but the BP has its original dark violet color *shrug*. Maybe logging out and back in will fix it. Did I do something wrong? I don't see any posts about it not working so I have to assume something about a pooch and too much booze...</div></div><hr />
