<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There has clearly been much debate on this topic of late.  So let's approach the subject logically and analyze our mana regeneration mathmatically.  This comparison is based on shaman vs necro SELF mana regen abilities only and assuming 0 aa's.<br />
<br />
A 60+ shaman who is doing nothing else but canni-ing and torpor/Q-ing who has no aa's is capable of regenerating approximately 6.0 mps (mana per second) factoring in cast/recast times of the spells, factoring out the mana cost of Q/torpor, presuming 0 lag and only casting other spells and contributing to group activity during the 24s that torpor/Q is running.  (Note on the mps calculation: this assumes using canni 4, casting 8 times, then torpor/Q, pause canni-ing until healing complete, resume canni.  Over all a 76.2 second canni cycle this provides us a 24 second window of opportunity to do something useful).  This results in a shaman spending a full 68.5% of his time Canni-ing and doing nothing else.<br />
<br />
By comparison, a 65 necro (only other pure caster class that trades hp for mana) passively regenerates 8.6 mps with his highest level lich and mana regenerating skin spell up.  Now then, if you factor out the mana cost for a lifetap over time to maintain their hp, necro mana regen works out to about 5.4 mps.  During which time they are dealing 10.5 dps MINIMUM to a mob (best lifetap over time, cast at the minimum frequency to heal maximum possible hp).  Additionally, they are not limited in their use of their other abilities.  They can FD, cast DoTs/nukes, and not impact the efficiency of their mana regen at all.   <br />
<br />
So, by using active mana regeneration we gain a 0.6 mps edge and simultaneously sacrifice the ability to do anything else 68.5% of the time without serious drops in our regen efficiency.  <br />
<br />
SO it works out that we're giving up the majority of our time to casting canni for a whopping 11% edge in mana regen in a best case scenario. Then we are further penalized by having higher mana costs for all our other spells.  <br />
<br />
Admittedly, the fact that KEI/Tranq/VoQ all stack with our canni while it does not stack with necro lich muddies this up.<br />
<br />
Therefore, my suggestion is to change the bearform line of spells into a passive hp to mana conversion spell for shamans that allow us somewhat lower amounts of mana regen amounts than we can accomplish with canni-ing at those levels (i.e. Form of the Bear would be like casting canni 1 once per tick instead of twice, Form of the Great Bear would be like casting canni 3 once per tick instead of twice.) and add a 3rd Bearform with the equivalent of casting canni 4 (or even lower the efficiency from 1.8 hp per mana to 2 hp or even 2.2 hp per mana on it) once per tick.  Flag each of the Bearform spells to block your ability to be effected by regular canni while in bearform to block abuse.<br />
<br />
This way, shaman's no longer HAVE to actively cann to be efficient.  We have the option to use a passive mana regen that is less efficient.  This gets sticky when we factor in our AA canni, BUT, this makes the AA canni only marginally more powerful then it already is (by a factor of one cast of Canni 4).<br />
<br />
It's just a thought, submitted to the community for your opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its a great idea..maybe could use a little work on the numbers, but a sound idea nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
They could also use bearform to attach a proc to shaman (like the cleric hammer) instead of making it a passive mana regen. <br />
<br />
2 hp/tick and 10 wisdom isn't a reason to use bearform, but either of these (passive mana regen/ proc for added dps) would be.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear could be a combination of passive canni and proc damage!  Anyway, it'll probably never happen, but would be a nice, useful ability for us if they made it happen.  Wouldn't it be funny to hear people say &quot;WOW! I cannot wait to get rabid bear AA!&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I absolutely agree with you thyramon that canni needs an improvement.<br />
<br />
Canni was supposedly one of the defining abilities that let shaman excel.  Instead it seems like it is the excuse to give us inefficient gimp spells, and premature arthritis :P<br />
<br />
I'd be happy if Sony just made a meaningful improvement to canni iv, so I would not continuously be canni dancing instead of refreshing haste :).  All Sony has to do is scale canni iv out to a reasonable lvl to where I could get away with canning once or twice between ldon pulls instead of constantly canni canni canni and I’d be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd love it if they made rabid bear actually useful.<br />
<br />
Please note, I REALLY want them to get rid of that 30 sec recast time after using voice of the beserker or any of that line... Not just the spell gem itself greys out, ALL the spells do.... so no casting for 30 sec. Too dangerous for my groups!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/laugh there is a shaman in my guild who has said bearform adds ft /cry<br />
<br />
the passive regen, proc, would be great, but as long as it comes w/ an updated graphic too,  being good is about as important as looking good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of course this would mean that you can't use it while sitting on a horse...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No horse, no regular canni.. IMO stupid idea. and VOQ is something important to consider in these calculations.<br />
<br />
If you are going to ask for something IMO do it right just give me something like 400 hps -&gt; 200 mana conversion or whatever is needed to be in line with canni 4 ratios and I'll be happy. Rabid canni I'll be happy. but something like weak necro form is lame. or just let me canni 5 with 0 recast time =b</div></div><hr />
