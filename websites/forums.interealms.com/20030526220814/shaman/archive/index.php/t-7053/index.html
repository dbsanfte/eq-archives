<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ajjag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 39 you receive Togors max slow 65%.  At 51 you receive Turgur max slow 75%.  <br />
<br />
Even though I have Turgurs, I primarily use the economy 39lvl version.  At what point does it become a better alternative to use the higher level spell.  At 51 the 1% increase for 75 extra mana doesn’t seem to be worth it.  Am I missing something?  It seems to me that you would not see a significant difference in damage done by the mob until 55 or 56, unless resists of spell lvl vs. mob’s lvl becomes an issue.  <br />
<br />
In a raid situations, when mana is not quite as much a factor as in the exp grind, I could see the justification of the higher lvl spell.  But, in the typical exp groups I cannot justify the extra mana usage.  Am I wrong? Am I cheating my groups by not using the higher lvl spell?  Am I overstating the obvious? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The difference I think is the cast time.  <br />
6 seconds to cast for Togor's and 3 seconds for Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Resists generate aggro, evidently more than landing a successful slow.  I'd rather have a 3 sec casting spell than a 6 sec in that situation ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Resists don't generate any more agro than a successful landing of the spell.<br />
<br />
You just notice the resists more because the mobs hitting you faster and you're stressing trying to get it off ya while you try for another slow.<br />
<br />
If slow sticks and you agro, then it's still cool.  You can pretty much ignore the mob at that point and go on casting whatever else you were gonna cast while it tries to hit you every now and then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Togor's casts in 5 seconds and lasts 3 minutes at 60<br />
Turgur's casts in 3 seconds and lasts 6+ minutes at 60<br />
<br />
Togor's gets resisted a lot less that Turgur's does, I have made my conclusions from 4 ToV raids now. <br />
<br />
I first found Turgur's reliable at 54 onwards. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like Turgurs now at 51.  It lasts seemingly forever compared to togors, casts faster and the slow is noticably more effective when sneaking an e-bolt in between mob swings.  I pulled a gnoll in jaggedpine with turgurs and got two( oracle and warrior) more with it.  I rooted the first and pulled the other two outside.  A ranger buddy and myself rooted one of the two and mowed them both down and then went back to the first.  He was still slowed and turgurs lasted the entire fight with the gnoll.  Togor's most certainly would have worn off in that amount of time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Has anyone noticed it's easier to land a slow after a lesser slow has landed?<br />
<br />
Or am I just crazy?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banaldi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I disagree with your assumption that a resisted slow does not generate more aggro.  <br />
<br />
A ways back when VI added the disease component to slow, we were getting hammered every time we cast slow.  What VI did to fix it was when slow actually lands, they give a -400 to the casters hate to counteract the extra aggro the disease component instills.  A resisted slow does not place the -400 to hate, thus does indeed generate a lot more aggro.  You are correct that a resisted slow makes more aggro than when it lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But a resisted slow won't land the disease counters either, so I'd think it would balance out to be the same aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banaldi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not true...  When you attempt to land a disease DoT that is resisted does it not generate aggro?  Same thing with a resisted slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can't recall where I read it, I'm 99% sure it was in the library of Graffe's on agro of nukes.  The point is, a resist generates the same amount of agro as if the nuke had hit for max (I'm assuming they meant a full resist).  When a mob resists Slow, it generates the full agro but doesn't get the -400 agro from the spell.   I agree that resist seems worse on resists.<br />
<br />
I'll go looking through Graffe's when I get home later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hm.  I've always felt Turgur's seems resisted much less that Togor's.<br />
<br />
I do know one thing, tho.  I'm tired of bouncing spells off blues that land every freaking time on yellows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The resistability of togors vs turgurs is an old one. Some old spell info I had showed togurs with a plus 15 vs magic and targars a plus 25 vs magic. I am not sure of the truth of the old info that I had.<br />
All that aside, the greatest use of togurs and turgurs is for those short fights with low numbers where slowing asap will determine the outcome. Sont and Kland are 2 experiences that I found the 2 of use. We did Kland with 25 or so once and what I did was aternated between turgurs and togurs till one stuck. the refresh of turgurs is too long, but once your gems refresh you can use togors 2-3 seconds before turgurs refreshes and vice versa.<br />
The main difference is casting time and duration though. I would not use turgurs on THO or Lcea for example but ToV yardtrash defenitely etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i've used turgur's since 51 and won't go back.  it cost a little more mana but cast time is almost half and slows more.  75 mana isn't a whole lot, when you are nit picking about 75 mana, you need better gear / more mana or cani a bit more. <br />
<br />
also the aggro thing, a resisted slow doesn't give more aggro, you get more aggro when you resist,  then land slow.  you are producing double aggro that way, so depending on the situation and your hp/ac just use malosini/malo and play it safe.<br />
<br />
no matter who you are, you're gonna get summoned/aggro alot.  that is the duty of a shaman is to get beat on and regen it, not figure out how to avoid aggro.  If you wait till the mob is at 90%, sre you won't get aggro but just hope the tank lived through it, especially on high end raids.<br />
<br />
theres my 2 cp's do what you will with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have both memmed until I can get a feel for what i'm camping.<br />
<br />
Reason for both?<br />
<br />
If tugurs is resisted, there is a refresh time. Instead of waiting for turgurs to reset, you can cast togors. <br />
<br />
As well it can work the other way too. <br />
<br />
Been hunting in new planes alot and i notice that tugurs is a bit too fast casting to get agro. Using togors is good sometimes. the casting time lets the tank get agro. If togors gets resisted, you have a 3 sec tugurs to back that up.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what the situation is though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you're up stuff thats very resistant always go for tugurs first, it bounces go for togors, then rotate. You can chain cast the 2 with only a very short delay between them.<br />
<br />
In HoT I was able to slow stuff faster at 57 than a shaman at 60 because I was using togors then overwriting with turgurs.<br />
a 60% slow is much better than a 0% one.<br />
Sometimes I would land togors and never get turgurs to overwrite.<br />
That means if I had just used turgurs the mob would have never been slowed.<br />
<br />
It's all about lvl based resistance.<br />
<br />
Btw resisted spells DO generate more aggro than non resisted ones. A perfect example of this was a grind group in PoD the other night, spent a few hours doing exactly the same thing each pull. had a ranger being MT and using snare for aggro.<br />
Slow before it reached camp, cripple, epic.<br />
If slow bounced I got aggro.<br />
If slow didn't bounce it happily wne to the ranger.<br />
If cripple bounced it came after me.<br />
If cripple landed it went for ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">According to my own experience, mobs that resist my slow(s) agro more than if they didnt resist my slow... <br />
<br />
Example: Trial of Execution - 4 mobs, 1 is being tanked by warrior - 3 others have just gotten the normal *i saw you* agro...<br />
<br />
Casted aoe slow - landed on 3 of the 4 mobs, the mob that resisted agroed on me...<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also noticed this in regular xp groups - especially in sewers. When they dont resist my slow, i rarely get summoned or agroed. But if they resist, I almost always get summoned and beaten at...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ajjag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for all the input.  <br />
When I am soloing I find that pulling with Togors works best.  I am able to keep the dog alive while keeping mana topped off.  I have been using Tugurs in groups for the quick cast. <br />
Because I am 52 I usually end up as secondary healer on raids.<br />
But alternating between the two seems like the best approach in the rare instances I get called on to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As for resisted spells... I also play a paladin and will tell you if you really want to get aggro ...pray your stun resists cause the mob WILL turn.  Resisted spells is best way to get aggro from experience.</div></div><hr />
