<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something has been gnawing at me since last night.  I wanted to ask you opinions.  <br />
<br />
For Elemental raids (not gods, just mini's and such) do you slow the 'yard trash'?  I know this sounds odd, but bear with me.<br />
<br />
I'm in a guild that recently had a large portion retire from EQ completely, we went from a very strong Elem guild, to just barely making minimum (with a few 2-boxing) to 85% rule raid in 2 applicants. <br />
<br />
Last night we had 2 shaman on raid.  One main, the other was my bot.  Before the raid I asked the main shaman, if he would like me to take Malos duty.  He replied with the most rediculous response I've ever heard.  &quot;I'm not going to bother slowing, only the named.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, here comes my question.  Do you slow the yard trash?  Personally, I see this on raids.  I am an OT, my main is an SK, my job is to non-damage aggro and tank until chanters can get stuff mezzed.  Sometimes pulls are large enough that loose mobs will go after nukers, chanter, clerics.  Would you not want these mobs slow? It's one thing if all mobs ONLY hit the plate wearing tanks, but we all know this doesnt happen.<br />
<br />
This isnt an isolated incidence either.  This shaman is constantly afk, doesnt respond to buff requests (3-4th time to ask before you see something) and when asked to help a fellow guildie shaman in the past (only 2 'mains' in this case were on that night) &quot;Sure, lemme mem slow real quick&quot;...<br />
<br />
Last night, I did the MGBs (focus at start, and tribunal about mid way) all slows but 2 (yes, he slowed TWO mobs all night), all malos (only when I got resisted and nameds) and 90% of the post rez buffing.  I didnt get to play my main character but a few instances, because I was picking up his slack.<br />
<br />
Was I over-reacting, do most shaman not bother slowing yard trash or mobs in an event that aren't the 'final named mob'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That sounds like a poor shaman to me. I slow (slow, malos, malosinia whichever is my job that night) everything I can during raids. I don't care if it dies 10 seconds after I do it. I still did the job I was asked to do. <br />
<br />
When there are 2+ shaman on our raids, malos, slow and malosinia are assigned to individual shaman and we all cast at whatever gets pulled in. For buffing someone gets focus and someone else gets boar.<br />
<br />
I find it strange that the leadership of your guild accepts a shaman who does little to nothing to continue raiding with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd kick that shaman in a heartbeat, or leave myself.<br />
<br />
  On raids, I Balance, Sinia and then Turgur instictively.   We normally have 3 to 6 shaman on at a raid, and I actually feel bad some nights that I am hogging jobs, but I am faster to react, and all I care about is getting the mob's DPS to rock bottom ASAP.<br />
<br />
  Any mob that lives long enough for the casting of turgur, NEEDS slowed (and on a raid that means 4 seconds for someone with NO focus effects of their own.  Tribute spell haste and get BoR from a cleric.  Have someone call malos and start to cast turgur roughly 1 second after they start theirs).  What else are you going to do?  Watch American Idol reruns?<br />
<br />
  It is a personal insult to me if anyone dies before I do on a pull, unless it is the named and we lose a tank to lag or damage spikes midway through the fight.   Hell, I got nicknamed Kenny shortly after getting Nihil since my aggro shot through the roof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya, he's just a poor shaman, dont follow his example.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of mobs in the elementals (air and PoEb spring to mind) that are capable of very significant damage, and I pity the poor tanks, particularly the offtanks, that have to work with that clown around. There is a misconception among some that because a mob dies quickly, it isnt worth slowing. It might not be mana efficient but it sure as hell reduces the chances of someone going belly up.<br />
<br />
If I'm raiding on my shaman, I slow everything unless I know someone else has allready done it, as do the other shaman and BLs. Slowers who dont slow just suck ;).<br />
<br />
On the standing around doing nothing bit, unfortunately that is a common problem. Sometimes people who are raid leaders or co-ordinating some function might excusably do that, since those sorts of activities take up a huge amount of time. Other people just go along for the ride to get raid points and collect loot, without pulling their weight. It isnt as obvious with casters, but its easy to see melee parasites, since they spend most of the raid standing on one spot. And its allways the same people too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We normally have 2-3 shaman per raid .. we debuff everything that moves. It's that simple .. if not for saving healer mana, then you're saving enchanter lives. I don't get it .. saving an enchanter or a cleric by casting slow is something i first learned on pull team in public Hate raids back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, I'll play devils advocate on this one.<br />
The way I look at it, the offtanks are going to get a heal wether I slow the mob or not. Stuff dies so fast I toss a nuke instead of a slow.<br />
<br />
This is especially so if it's a controlled &quot;pull&quot; of like 3 or less mobs in the Eplanes. We have tanks, offtanks and healers for everyone, and if people aren't slacking, then they get healed and tank just fine without a slow on it. With mitigation you can't even tell the difference half the time anyways. I only really worry about nameds as well.<br />
<br />
The times I think it's more important is when unexpected adds show up or mobs that split/spawn adds and things are getting out of control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, I'll play devils advocate on this one.<br />
The way I look at it, the offtanks are going to get a heal wether I slow the mob or not. Stuff dies so fast I toss a nuke instead of a slow..<br />
<br />
A lot of the times, this is what I do, except I assist-heal instead of nuking.<br />
<br />
Playing a caster in water is extremely annoying, and if you get aggro from a slow you are unable to heal yourself because you're being pushed backwards through the water.  Other healers are often still floating very very slowly across the XY plane and haven't come to a complete stop yet, thus if they try to heal you they are going to get interrupted, even though they aren't being hit and are practically immobile.  On top of this, tanks often have a hard time holding aggro in water because they're getting pushed all over the place and it is common to get the &quot;you cannot see your target&quot; message in water, even though the mob is right in front of you.  Water mobs also have very low HP and die very fast, until you get to the regruas.  Given all these factors, I typically do not do much slowing in water.  If I see a mob that is coming from behind, or a mob that is loose and attacking casters, I will try to slow it because I can take a beating better than most people, especially if I get it slowed.  However, if it is being tanked by a plate tank, I just heal.<br />
<br />
That's just for water, though.  In every other zone I slow everything I see - it is especially important in air because those mobs are beasts.<br />
<br />
edit - Also, a general rule for deciding whether or not you need to be slowing:  If you aren't slowing and people are dying, you should be slowing.  If you aren't slowing and no one is dying, you can do whatever you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, Visc, however, this shaman isn't 'thinking' like that.  He's got a different game loaded on another PC (he told us so at Fan Faire).  He just doesnt give a damn really.  <br />
<br />
Now I box my own again. (just got my PC fixed)<br />
<br />
When there are other people relying on you to do your job, wether it's the 5 others in the group, or the 30+ others on a raid, that job needs to be done.<br />
<br />
/shrug, I've always thought he was a lazy s.o.b., but I thought perhaps being the only shaman, he might surprise me.  All it did was solidify my point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It sends two bad messages to everyone on the team if you don't do your job.  The first one is about the importance of doing your job, and the second one is about you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On quite a few raids the trash dies in 10 seconds or less. In that situation slow is not worth it. That certainly does not mean you should not slow adds or assist heal though. Generally when you have MOBs die that fast you do not pull them one by one so there should be plenty of offtanked MOBs to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kick his butt to the curb.  What the heck does this guy think he's doing on the raids.,..DPS?  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can understand not slowing the &quot;primary raid target&quot; yard trash, but the adds SHOULD be slowed, IMHO. <br />
<br />
I slow everything, because I think its important. Even the primary can flurry on a Chanter and blow him out in one round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">To expand on Blazz and give you a perfect example.  Let's say you're doing the general in the first castle in Fire.  Puller brings back 3-4 mobs one of them being a caster.  Melees engage 1st mob while CC puts the rest on ice.<br />
<br />
Don't bother slowing the 1st mob.  It'll be dead to fast.  All the others ones should be properly debuffed and slowed though.<br />
<br />
As far as that other shaman, have your officers have a nice talk with him because he's just being lazy.  Slackers like that do not belong in raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds like he's just had enough and is long past time to retire.  When a boxed shaman outworks him, its time to hang it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree.  The guy basically is providing zero.  He shouldn't be looting anything at all.<br />
<br />
On the subject of healing in water, there is no reason casters and healers have to float.  And the disruption of their spell casting is more than enough reason that they shouldn't be floating.<br />
<br />
And on the subject of slowing in general, I have always advocated, if you have nothing else to do or if it is particularly important, slowing things even if they're already slowed just to try to keep higher aggro than your chanters.  Frankly, they're more valuable than you are, and more vulnerable.  I would rather the mob runs for me if mez breaks or wears off than that it runs to the chanters.  Heck, it's not like we usually are crying out for mana so badly that it's a cast we just can't afford.  And a tank with a good weapon will still get aggro regardless.  If he doesn't -- better you than the chanter anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;There is a misconception among some that because a mob dies quickly, it isnt worth slowing.

<br />
but it is mana efficient, malos+slow= what? 600 mana? (pulled that outta my ass)<br />
vrs res+focus+boar+voq+god+tribunal+symbol+9+sd+sv+ranger atk buffs (2)+soe+whateverelseIamforgeting=several thousand mana+time to recast. <br />
you would have to slow a couple dozen mobs that didnt need slow to = one single death from a mob that needed it. <br />
<br />
that shaman sucks ass :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">that shammy gives all us shammies who know what the hell we are doin a bad name.<br />
<br />
I slow EVERYTHING on a raid that can be slowed.  When there are multiple shammies, one malos the MA i slow the MA and then adds are FFA, but everything gets slowed.  We can have the MA's mob slowed by 98% with spell haste and 2 shammies on the job.  If a mob goes after a non-tank class, at least its slowed and they dont get one rounded (unless its Reparm then it doesnt matter you'll get eaten if he was fully slowed. :p )<br />
<br />
That shammy is NOT someone to follow, and doesnt deserve to be called a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If it moves slow it. If its mezed debuff it. If someones bleeding, heal them. If you get a tell for buffs /rt buff them. Unless its a ranger who just beat the shamans on a piece of chain  :p <br />
<br />
Boot that shaman out. Hes worthless and just taking up raid space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm going to jump on this discussion-bandwagon late.  <br />
<br />
I slow everything.  That includes trash.  Do I really think it makes much of a difference?  Probably not, honestly.  I still do it though, because -- bottom line -- what else do I have to do?  :)<br />
<br />
When our guild raids, we have (usually) around 5 shaman.  On the trash, we all just slow the stuff that we see.  When we're clearing trash, its usually not 2 mobs at a time -- its usually a bunch.  It sometimes takes the off-tanks a few seconds to catch up with the pull and deal with things.  With us shaman slowing, everyone is slightly less vulnerable, the healers don't have to work as hard, and (sadly) the off-tanks know exactly where to look to find the next mob to off-tank (ie: for the nearest shaman).<br />
<br />
It seems to work good for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There is a few things a shaman ALWAYS should have loaded slow, malos and Q, and if these are not used all the time then the shaman suck IMO.<br />
but yesterday my guild did the FR script and i really didnt see the point in slowing anything but the named since the DPS in that raid was so high that the mob normally was dead before i got poison DD off, only thing i really did was F8-&gt; assist -&gt; heal.<br />
so there could be reasons for not even trying to malos and slow.<br />
Get the GoD slow then it becomes worth it again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">GoD slow + Fro script = ramp to Fro painted redder than the rest of the zone with fresh Caanus blood :)<br />

<br />
  Damn that was a fun night, went down 6% exp even after all of the bodies got a 96% rez :) (yes, that means 25 deaths.. and no, the ramp really isn't all that long)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If it is going to live more than about a minute, I slow it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would say that I slow every mob on 75% of the raids I go on. The only time I don't slow is when a mob dies in less than 10 seconds. In that case, I keep the mob targetted and use the health of target's target to tell who is getting hit. If that switches from the MT, I quickly target that person and start spamming heals.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What was the encounter?  <br />
<br />
Depending on raid dynamics or dps, there might well be a couple of encounters where it's just better to do something else than try to land slows on trash.  <br />
<br />
He sounds lazy for sure, but it's not a given that you should robotically slow.  <br />
<br />
Esp. if bards and beastlords are shooting off their slows because they love spamming their slow message first to show they are hot stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If it is going to live more than about a minute, I slow it.

<br />
I'm totally with Weiss here. It all depends. I'm not in the EPs (knocking on the door though... RZ down to 46% on last attempt!) but on many of our raids I find mobs are mitigating and resisting slow a lot, and dying in 20 seconds or less. The clearing up to saryrn's tower was an extreme example where I totally despaired ... I was getting so many resists and mobs died so fast it wasn't worth slowing. I'd malos on inc and then throw a spear of torment, by which time the mob would be just seconds from death.<br />
<br />
Now if we're clearing Sol Ro's tower, I'll leave the main assist's target as I know that there's a solid tank there and the mobs gonna die fast, but by heck I'll slow all the adds because one of those unslowed will make fast work of a chanter or cleric.<br />
<br />
Clearing VT, typically have a load of mobs about. None of em hit that hard but they have quite a few hp, so I'll slow all the adds, and if the MA mob is taking a while to get down I'll slow that too. <br />
<br />
It comes down to a few things:<br />
1) Is the raid having to wait for clerics to med up? If so, you should be slowing more (or help healing if you are already slowing everything)<br />
2) Is the raid having to wait whilst people get rezzed? If so, you should be slowing more (or help healing if you are already slowing everything)<br />
<br />
If neither of these are issues then the slowing and healing is probably fine and you can help speed things up with some (pathetic, but it all helps) dps. There IS a case for not slowing in some scenarios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Zol, that shaman is a disgrace.  It is the job of the shaman to debuff everything that is inc.  Especially in your situation, where the strength of your guild has been diminished, slowing the trash can be a raid saver.<br />
<br />
I agree with the other posts...let your officers know this guy is a weak link and give him a chance to shape up.  Otherwise, he is a waste of pixels.<br />
<br />
Otani <br />
<br />
&quot;I live to buff, I debuff to live&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If it was a full out normal raid, perhaps our make-up, class balance and DPS would have been sufficiant to justify.  However, our GL recently retired, as did our entire pull team.  Over the past week, we've lost over half our guild (from 50+ active on any given raid to 25-30).  Alot retireing from EQ outright, some goiung to other guilds EP guilds, some staying in EQ, but retiring from raiding.<br />
<br />
For this particular raid, we had no BST (our 1 left), 2 bards (officers that are 'acting' leadership in the interm and focused mainly on getting raid ran), as I mention, the 1 shaman, 3 warriors, 4 clerics (1 was also a bot)... 2-3 rangers, no rogues  :(  , umm...only recall the 1 wizard, 2 mages 3(?) pallies, 1 SK, 3 chanters, 2 monks... missing 1-2, but that was really it.  Oh, yeah, 2 druids. We had 28 mains.<br />
<br />
Our DPS you can see was very low.  We did 1 named in water, Ghohim the Wise, them moved to air to take 1 avatar.  Zin of air is always interesting.  Adds coming from everwhere.  And the split spawns that can be anything from 1 'baby' mob (which I know now are immune), a yellow con, or that annoying Warlord guy.  I dont think I need to tell you the stuff that roams, ranging from blue cons to red. /shudder glass spiders<br />
<br />
As stated, our entire pull team retired.  Our new team is inexperienced and is doing their best to learn where mobs are and pulls that are controlled, yet not too slow.<br />
<br />
This is not a situation I'd say is one where you knw that mobs will die quickly, where you know the capacity your guild can handle adds etc.  It is new for us.  We're re-learning our strengths and weeknesses.  With so many gone, including many officers and 'veterans' to the guild, we are starting over.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, on multiple pulls I did find myself slowing the adds first, then checking the target the MA was on to see if it was lasting long enough to warrent a cast.  Almost everything slowed on 1st try (blues, yellow/red I'd malos 1st, I wanted to live)  I pulled aggro once on 1 resist.  (he only has about 90aa, so no SCS yet, no GoD spells)  I patched healed when I could (nameds esp, just set SK on auto attack and alt-tab over).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">/agree<br />
<br />
When we raid BoT Towers (and that's still a 'raid' for us), we slow everything down to the little elementals.<br />
<br />
When we move into NToV, we will be slowing everything down to the little drakes and chickens.<br />
<br />
I can see a circumstance where yard trash dies so fast that mana is better spent on Qing the MA than slowing, but I cannot understand people who go AFK during a raid, or are there but don't contribute at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Skin that bear and make a nice rug outa him. Because he's obviously not using it.<br />
<br />
It really depends upon the raid strength and what zone were in if slowing is gonna be job #1. If it's not then I'll just spam heal folks. Of course we usually have at least 3 shaman though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I assume you use dkp of some sort..... if so, does he get the same dkp that you do? If the answer is yes then he clearly needs to be doing more work.<br />
<br />
While there are instances where slowing might not be required, in my guild I can't remember the last time we had no adds on a pull. Given the opportunity of splitting and single pulling earth or air rings I would kill myself before I sat through one of those. We have as many mobs in camp as we can handle (hopefully) and all shaman are busy.<br />
<br />
We might not call slows on trash to save spam, but they are being slowed.<br />
<br />
It depends how your guild plays, but I would just ask yourself the question about points. If you are doing four times the work for the same points then it's unfair.<br />
<br />
If he gets 1/4 of your points then you can live with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Easy rule of thumb for me? On a large raid, if it doesn't Con RED , I don't bother slowing it. Unless there is more mobs in camp then tanks. We never bother using mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">From your description the guy also seems to think malo is only worth casting to help land his own slows.<br />
It helps ALL casters who use fire/cold/magic/poison whether he notices it or not.<br />
If I were you I'd start hotkeying /rsay %t Malos and slow, as well as /rsay /t me for buffs. Might put some pressure on him to lift his game when you make it obvious that you are doing all the work.</div></div><hr />

I hate that zone with a passion. I swear every single MOB there was coded to specifically resist my spells.<br />
<br />
And yes, that is exactly the situation not to slow in - why bother preventing 5K of damage and quite likely getting aggro along the way? Especially when your tanks are nowhere close to being in danger. As an added bonus, leaving MOBs unslowed has a higher chance of killing overaggroing wizards.</div></div><hr />

Just set up a debuff channel, and then tell anyone who cares if the mobs are slowed, tashed, malosed, siniad, etc to join it. Spam your slow messages in there, keeps raidsay nice and cleaned up. We also have a heal channel, where all healing spam goes. Once again, anyone interested in seeing those messages has the option to join the channel. If you dont care whether its slowed or whether tank_01 is getting a heal, dont join.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was I over-reacting, do most shaman not bother slowing yard trash or mobs in an event that aren't the 'final named mob'?<br />
<br />
<br />
If it moves it gets slowed.  Thats  my motto better safe then sorry.  IF mob dies in under 15 sec I don't slow.</div></div><hr />

Blazz, we have a channel, but it can be pretty pointless to look at when you are doing a ring event. Having &quot;A Dusty Devotee is slowed&quot; message is irrelevant if there are 4 in camp with the same name. Also, if our healers like to know when the mini mobs or boss mobs are debuffed, but could care less about the trash. We don't want to have two sets of hotkeys, or have the healers join a spam channel.<br />
<br />
So, its a good idea, but doesn't work in our setup. Thanks though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well, in that case, then no raid info is good.  Because it isn't perfect.<br />
<br />
Hey, you have to monitor what's going on in all ways to make sense of the rapid inflow of information.  Sometimes you won't know which mob is slowed when there are multiples of one type, but sometimes you will know that NONE of them are, which is vital, or that some have malos or malosinia, which can tell you when trying a slow can just get you smeared, or trying to tank a mob can just get you killed, or trying a mez or a tash is more dangerous.  It's particularly useful for chanters, who often want to wait for a malos to land first, etc....  <br />
<br />
A lot of information is only useless some of the time, not all of the time, and the some of the time makes it worth it.  But, you definitely have to monitor things alertly.  <br />
<br />
We put out debuffs in a debuff channel, and I get to duck out of endless casts of malos or malosinia or slow or root or cripple because of it, saving mana and the time spent canni'ing mana back.  And it really does help keep the raid channel clean of spam, which is a big help.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I find it incredibly useful overall.  The times when things are a little hard to decipher seem no significant drawback at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Read this statement:<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night we had 2 shaman on raid. One main, the other was my bot. Before the raid I asked the main shaman, if he would like me to take Malos duty. He replied with the most rediculous response I've ever heard. &quot;I'm not going to bother slowing, only the named.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Only 2 shamans in raid and the other one is a bot.  It is quite overbearing to be the only shaman in a raid at times.  In between keeping everyone's buffs up, spot healing the tank line and keeping your group alive as well as dispelling any diseases or curse... why bother slowing thrash if you have the healing power and DPS to take these mobs out fast enough.<br />
<br />
This response may have been just for that event, ask your main shaman during other raids and you'll get a different response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">If you read his later posts he says that they have had a lot of attrition of late, and were barely able to raid at all, so they were probably marginal in the dps/healing departments. Given that fact, the attitude of the other shaman is surprising.<br />
<br />
When we raid in the elementals we usually pull numbers of mobs at once (its faster that way). Slowing is pretty standard under those circumstances. I suppose you dont need to in all scenarios, but why take the risk if you dont have to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">everything gets slowed, period.  Most stuff is malosed by the time it's in camp, and slowed as soon as the tank is on it.  Too many accidents can happen with the &quot;don't bother to slow&quot; approach, and it's just not fair to your guildmates.  Your job is debuffing, while you expect tanks to pick up the mobs.  If you die because the tank isn't &quot;bothering&quot; to off tank the mob  you would be pissed too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">My favorite thing on raids is playing who can slow first with the other shaman in the guild, and buffing immediately on rez without being asked. Can't imagine leaving anything slowable unslowed. Also, Malosinia is a boon to all the caster dps. The only catch is that I never want to require another healer to heal me. It is all in the timing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">/agree<br />
<br />
When we raid BoT Towers (and that's still a 'raid' for us), we slow everything down to the little elementals.<br />
<br />
When we move into NToV, we will be slowing everything down to the little drakes and chickens.<br />
<br />
I can see a circumstance where yard trash dies so fast that mana is better spent on Qing the MA than slowing, but I cannot understand people who go AFK during a raid, or are there but don't contribute at all.<br />
<br />
Hehe, watch out for the little drakes :D<br />
We were in ntov a few nights ago and our bard puller brought in a pair of drakes (emerald something), both an even con at 65.  Did the standard assist/malos/slow.  Appearantly our tanks had fallen asleep at the wheel a minute.  Got malos on first mob and before I could attempt to slow, there were two of em flurrying their butts off on me.  Two drakes, four flurries, one splattered kitty.<br />
Laughed so hard I nearly fell out of my chair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Deaths slow raids down more than any other thing.  Do what is needed to prevent deaths.  Slow is not always the best way to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Since our DPS and our heals suck so bad, and most people are talking about clearing trash, not bosses, slow has a darn good chance of being the best way to do it.<br />
<br />
And I still insist that I'd rather have the aggro on me than on a chanter.  Or even a cleric for that matter.<br />
<br />
I don't fancy DPS shamans any more than I fancy DPS druids, frankly.  (And they're actually good at it in the first place!)  If people are dying, I could give a rat's behind about how much DPS anyone's logs show them doing.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I feel like adapting that famous phrase:  &quot;DPS is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was Miidori, wasn't it? The same retard Shaman who, when I had to use the restroom and asked him to take over slows, responded, &quot;I don't know where it is.&quot; and never has it memmed. <br />
<br />
That twit is half the reason I retired from Wisdom. If it weren't for Failbhe I'd have been doing all the slowing and debuffing my damned self.<br />
<br />
Yes, Zol. Slow the yard trash. Slow everything that moves that nobody else has slowed. If you die, you die. Get a second healer in group if needed. I usually had Aayalan in group and Sinine with me hotkeyed out of group. Just remember, slow smart. PM me on the old guild boards and I'll explain that further ;)<br />
<br />
You've got the potential to be a great Shaman if you ever switch mains, Zol. I miss you guys. But, for the love of God, kick Miidori while you guys rebuild. He was always a dead weight. The whole game on another PC thing really irks me, too. There were so many times I felt I was the only Shaman there, and that just proves it.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, when this Shaman does slow, it's uaually when the MoB is at 20% or lower on very high HP MoBs (it would take him ~30 seconds to slow something I got before the tank even touched it), caused several wipes during Xegony attempts because Xegony was never slowed, despite his being the main camp Shaman. He's just an idiot. I could go on and on with the Miidori Stories.<br />
<br />
If the guild hasn't died, rally the vote to kick him. For now, I can just warn all my friends in the other EP/Time guilds to watch for his app and deny it immediately if they see it. He is truly a blight on the class.</div></div><hr />

Damn I miss you shamangina.  Our 2 shaman would have made the perfect dysfunctional couple.  Both cross-dressing freaks, but the kids may have actually come out normal  :p<br />
<br />
We're trying, getting harder everyday, watching more leave.  Can't wait till Miid does, one can only hope.  (and if by odd chance he ever reads these boards, I don't care, but I doubt it, that would take effort)<br />
<br />
There's about 20 of us left.  Just the 1 officer now.  But most left seem to truely want us to go on.  I hope we can.   Watch your PM's hun, I'm taking you up on that offer  ;)</div></div><hr />
