<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about to make a new Shaman. I have literally no idea on starting equipment, don't worry, I'll do a search later, but if anyone can just drop quick equipment tips, please.<br />
<br />
What I'm really wondering though, is why the heavy emphasis on AC/HP? I realize this must have something to do with the way shamans play, probably soloing. <br />
<br />
I plan to basically solo my way. I have a monk and I'm pretty sick of grouping, but I plan to group along the way so as to not have any idea how to do it at all. But how does a shaman solo?<br />
<br />
I get the feeling do we basically DoT and just tank the mob? My love in EQ has always been rotting, don't ask why, it's just incredibly fun for me. Do you think it's possible/smart for me to rot all the way to 60? If it's a bit slower than other forms of shaman soloing I won't mind. But if it's possible, but just barely and the the point of stupidity, I'm not that into it, and would accept any ofther form of soloing anyone can offer.<br />
<br />
My thanks for you're help in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hello, and welcome to the Crucible!<br />
<br />
Do a quick search on AC/HP and you'll get a TON of wonderful posts about this very subject.<br />
<br />
Same for soloing tactics.<br />
<br />
Basically, once we get cannibalize, HP=Mana.  And the greater our AC, the better we can maintain our HP, and thus our mana pool.<br />
<br />
It is possible to root/rot at least to 52 (where I am) although you'll find that critters that give decent xp in the 50s tend to have sufficient hit points that you will end up meleeing<br />
<br />
If you end up with a Jaundiced Bone Bracer... even then, you'll melee as your blasts break root repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Keep your offense/defense, 1hb/2hb/piercing maxed if at all possible.  It will help a lot later when you slow things and they come at you instead of the frantically-taunting warrior.<br />
<br />
I personally love maintaining agro through most fights.  The warriors, however, are welcome to have and keep the Coterie.<br />
<br />
edit:  There's a thread that has Magelo profiles.  I'd recommend some of the cultural smithed stuff (all but kitty have excellent stuff... and I dunno bout kitties) as being worth your time.  THey sell around 100-300 per piece.  Totemic's perfect, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here is why AC/HP is important and I am sure most would agree.<br />
<br />
IF and this is a big IF...you only plan to root/rot and solo to 60 and then continue to solo after 60 sure you COULD get by with mainly wis gear.  It isn't the best guide out there but please read my guide in the Combat and Tactics section where I talk about ac/hp and DEFENSE.<br />
<br />
The shamans best spell is undeniably the 'Slow' spell...it doesn't define us as a class but it is what really sets us apart from Enchanters. Sure Enchanters can slow but have you ever seen what happens to an Enchanter who doesn't successfully land his/her slow and gets mob aggro?<br />
<br />
One word...Splat.<br />
<br />
Why? Because the chanter doesn't have the AC or HP of an equivalent level shaman.  Not even close. Most chanters love and appreciate a shaman in there group if for nothing more than to act as a mob buffer that keeps them alive.<br />
<br />
Here are some questions for you...<br />
<br />
Are you never going to raid? <br />
<br />
Are you never going to draw aggro off your monk? (Suprisingly easy with dots and resist on slow)<br />
<br />
Are you always going to fight the staple of lvl 60 aaxp and nothing else? (Staple = Toilers, Shrooms, Spiders etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess you could root + dot things all the way to sixty, just remember to keep defense maxed. It's probably the most efficient way to kill things. I prefer it much over jbb, especially after having received affliction bonus items.<br />
<br />
The emphasis on hp/ac is because you're going to get hit, a lot. If you ever group, slow is going to draw a bunch of aggro. You might say that, well, because it's slowed, it's not going to do any damage. Wrong. It's much better to be hit for an occasional 50 than 100 over and over. You'll want a lot of hitpoints because of cannibalize. Cani is pretty much 2 hitpoints for 1 mana, like 48 hp for 24 mana, 72 for 36, and... I forget the others, but without a lot of hp you'll find yourself healing more often. That and the getting hit thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get the feeling do we basically DoT and just tank the mob?&quot; Well, kind of. There's not much of a choice on things that summon, but on stuff that doesn't, just root + dot. At 60 with my amount of ac, I don't bother slowing them because I can just torpor, and barely take more than 300 melee damage in a fight, so it's not mana efficient. But I'd advise that, since you're not going to be as equipped as a character that's been around for 2 years, you should slow AND root. It really doesn't matter which root you use, but I prefer the one with the fastest casting time.<br />
<br />
&quot;point of stupidity, I'm not that into it, and would accept any ofther form of soloing anyone can offer.&quot; No, there's no wrong way to play, as long as you're not getting others killed and having fun. Do what you want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So the AC is there so we can maintain our mana pool if we get hit, right? <br />
<br />
Okay, this is what I've grasped about a shaman, correct me if I'm wrong, somebody.<br />
<br />
The reason WIS isn't necessary for Shamans is because we keep a smaller mana pool (until you start getting uber gear of course) and we basically cannibalize all our health. AC is simply there to keep our health up, so when we do get hit, we don't lose that much HP, which is in fact really mana that looks red on the screen. :)<br />
<br />
As for the questions, how do they pertain?<br />
<br />
Yes, I plan to raid quite alot. For AAXP.. I'm not sure... I'll probably do those staples you named quite alot, but I'm not one those exp grinding machines like most people that can just exp grind on one mob without ever getting tired... I'll probably take a couple vacations to other places, yes, but I usually stick to normal mobs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Thanks SO much for the help, this is making so much more sense. I'm really starting to like the way a shaman is played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why AC/HP?  Two major reasons and one minor one:<br />
<br />
1)  Post level 24, we can cannibalize, to turn hit points into mana.  Since we also get regen spells, this lets us regen mana faster than any other class, period.  If any other class needs more mana than they have to cast x spell, they have no choice but to wait.  Shaman can trade their health for mana and be ready to cast in an EXTREMELY short period of time, relatively speaking.  This means that the relative size of a shamans mana pool is markedly less important than anyone elses, assuming they have a decent pool of hp to cann from.  Hp=mana, and since hp has two functions (generates mana AND keeps us from being dead) and mana only has one, many people consider hp to be far more valuable.  Hp can also be regained fairly fast with relatively cheap equipment/free spells.  High ac simply helps to protect this valuable hp pool by reducing the amount of it that is lost when we draw aggro, which brings me to...<br />
<br />
2)  Aggro.  Shaman catch aggro, it's a fact of life.  Between debuffing, healing the melees, and dotting, we tend to piss off the mobs.  Ac/hp gear helps us survive when this inevitably happens so we can keep doing our job.  This is somewhat less of an issue currently since they nerfed disease aggro (/rude Verant, way to screw two classes at once) but is still a very important consideration, especially since they might actually correct this at some point.  Here's hoping, anyway.<br />
<br />
3)  It lets us do neat stuff like ghetto mezzing, where you grab aggro on a mob by slowing it, then drag it away from the party and root it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can root/rot to 60, I suppose, if you really want to, but I'd recommend tanking at least some every level.  Later on in the game, having low ac simply won't be a viable option, so you're going to want to keep defense skill maxed.  It's easier to do this a little at a time while you level than it is to try to raise it 50 points at once when your like 46.  And yeah, basically shaman soloing is dot, slow/debuff the mob, melee.  You can switch it up, root/rot first, then tank when root breaks, tank while debuffing/dotting, then root, etc.  Try different stuff.  The neatest thing about shamans is the wide variety of tools we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HP <br />
first, HP is one of most importance stat for all class, a caster can easily choose 100hp over 100mana item, while warrior will choose 0ac/100hp over 100ac/0hp item;<br />
second, we have ability to convert hp to mana, so HP have addition meaning to us(necro too) which pump HP as our top stat list<br />
<br />
AC<br />
you can still play well without AC; just like chanter can take agro from tash without ac; but you will lose lots of fun play by this way; just remember we can tank as good as ranger, this is part of fun to play shaman since slow is big agro spell; AC is just an option buy highly recommend area<br />
<br />
Mana<br />
more wis mean more mana,bigger mana pool; but bigger mana pool is meanless, it doesn't make you regen faster, and we don't need FM to get job done.<br />
ask yourself how often you are FM when solo or group? more mana is good for long continue fight; only druid/wiz will med FM before next kite or cleric need more mana pool for big fight; shaman have fastest mana regen(over 100mana per tick at top rate) which 2-3 time faster than other class so we will never worry about mana pool like other class, and never run out of mana in big fight<br />
<br />
another small factor is that many high level AC/HP items have good amout of Wis/mana too; which can easily reach 200wis and higher<br />
<br />
hope you see the picture why AC/HP &gt;&gt;&gt; mana pool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you would like to root rot mob, soloing.. I would like to suggest another class.  Our class defining spell is slow.  And to take the most advantage of it, you are expected to get hit.<br />
<br />
Druid is perfect for root rot because of better DPS dot, and snare.<br />
<br />
Having more HP doesn't mean more mana, but it does mean better mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
You want high mana pool, or better mana regen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah don't listen to these people.  Listen to the troll, the troll knows (just kidding).<br />
<br />
If you are planning on soloing to 60, it is entirely possible as a shaman.  When it comes to solo xp, the three limiting things are HP regen, mana regen, and damage output.  The amount of total hp and mana matter a bit but if you are optimizing your xp, you shouldn't ever be full on either.  HP regen is accomplished by sitting and regening or, in the case of the shaman, heals.  Mana regen is accomplished by medding or at higher levels canni.<br />
<br />
Considering this lets discuss the various things:<br />
<br />
AC:  A lot of people misunderstand AC.  AC is a damage reducing effect by making the miss or by reducing the damage.  Now, there is NOT a max amount that AC will help.  But after a certain point, AC has a quickly reducing effect on your damage reduction (soft cap).  What is often misunderstood is that this AC is not based on what zone you are in.  People often quote 1200AC being the soft cap.  This is not really true.  AC soft cap is verus THE MOB ATTK value.  So, if you are attacking a low level mob, the soft cap may be at 600AC.  The result is that someone with 700AC and someone with 1500AC would take similar damage.<br />
<br />
So how does it matter to you?  As a general rule, if you are in melee range of the mob, you should be trying to max AC to the soft cap based on the mobs you are killing.  There are lots of ways to work this out by just analyzing the log files or just working it out.<br />
<br />
HP:  A lot of people say HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS.  I don't necessarily agree with this.  HP does equal mana, but high HP is exactly the same as high wis and therefore high mana pool.  High HP doesn't help you gain HP back faster.  It does matter at lower levels cause you are more likely to live and therefore not lose xp from deaths.  Don't get me wrong, at the end game, high HP is really necessary cause of canni5 and the aggro you get from mobs.  Most end game equipment allows you to go for max HP while maintaining high enough AC to reach soft caps for most/all mobs as well as high enough mana pool cast what you need to cast.  The main reason why most people are convinced on HP is your don't have the reducing affect that you have with soft caps in both ac and wis.  100 hp is a 100 hp at all levels while +10 wis and 10 AC means different things depending where you are at.<br />
<br />
WIS:  Although no one mentioned this, +Mana goes into this category.  In fact at lower levels, +mana is more important as it will likely add more to your mana pool than +wis items but do the calculations yourself.  Wis/mana items add to the total amount of mana you have.  Similar to hp, a high mana pool can save you from death, but if you are soloing correctly, you shouldn't ever get to the max or min of hp or mana.<br />
<br />
DPS (Damage per seconds):  This is the thing that is not oftened mentioned.  In my opinion, DPS is the MOST important factor in leveling quickly.  If you are meleeing, that means a good weapon.  If casting damage spells, that is the new focus items that improve damage.  Why is DPS the most important factor?<br />
High DPS does so many things.  You kill mobs faster and therefore get xp faster.  You take less damage from the mob cause it is dead and doesn't have a chance to hit you which makes your downtime less cause you lost less HP.   I also put into this category any mana free DPS which becomes important to shamans at higher level (note 1st level shaman can get epic and jbb useable at 45th).  DPS doesn't just mean during the battle but also any related downtime.  With manafree right click damage items, you don't use mana so you your effective DPS is raised.<br />
<br />
SO, if you understood my above statements, DPS items then +mana/hp regen items should be your priority (fungi, iskar breastplate, FT items, mana saving focus items, etc.).  After that, it totally depends on your method of xping.  If doing a lot of melee range action (not necessarily meleeing), try to reach the AC soft cap for the mob you are on then go for HP then +mana (via +mana/or +wis items).  Of course you need to judge for yourself whether xyz item is worth abc item.<br />
<br />
(getting lazy here)<br />
<br />
Lets go over briefly the different methods a shaman solos.  Which method you use depends on what equipment you have and what level you are.  Just try each one and see which allows you highest xp per hour/minute etc.<br />
<br />
1. Melee Man:  Melee the mob to kill it and just use your mana to heal and add extra damage if you have the extra mana.  This is the typical method for killing mobs at low levels.  DPS (weapon) &gt; HP/MANA REGEN &gt; AC &gt; WIS<br />
<br />
2. Root Park:  Root the mob and DOT it up.  You might be using the method at various points in your career.  This method really becomes efficient when you get canni and don't have a good slow.  Slow is a relatively mana expensive spell.  If the slow doesn't save you enough mana to make up the mana you would use otherwise for heals/damage, why bother.  With the root park technique, slow is probably not needed.  The only important thing is MANA REGEN and DPS related items.  DPS items (mana saving focus, damage improvment focus, mana free dps) &gt; MANA REGEN &gt; ALL<br />
<br />
3. Pet Kite:  In this method you gain aggro by Dotting the mob up and summon your pet.  The mob dies as it runs after you from both the dots and pet damage.  pet taunt off and if it aggros on pet, have a high aggro spell ready.  The negative thing about this is our DoTs get reduced effectiveness because of xp code about how much damage they are reduced for not being in melee range.  Obviously you need the pet and you don't need to slow the mob.  Just damage it up and run (sow please).  DPS items (see Root park) &gt; MANA REGEN &gt; ALL<br />
<br />
4.  Slow Melee:  Probably the final way you will xp.  You slow the mob.  Stay in melee range and take the damage so you get full benefit of DoT damage.  Then DoT, melee, pet, right click items.  Whatever will get you a sustainable and high DPS.  This method becomes really effective at 60th level cause torpor is SO mana efficient heal.  When should you use this method?  Just do the calculations on how much mana you save from not needing heals and killing mobs faster verus slowing the mob (may be slow spell and any debuffs). DPS items &gt; mana/hp regen &gt; soft cap AC &gt; hp &gt; any extra AC &gt; WIS/MANA<br />
<br />
There are lots of other methods but not solo.  I would recommend duoing with melee as a really good xp method.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great post Crashem! Very nice discussion of AC caps/mob ATK rating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks.  Some of the post is a little unreadable as I was tired and was getting lazy.  Hopefully you guys can make heads or tails of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Havanna, as everyone else has said, HP/AC is a better path to take for various reasons.<br />
<br />
In the end it boils down to the fact that slow generates massive aggro, and unlike a chanter, we do not posses the ability to stun/mez adds.  To componsate, a high AC and alot of HP will keep you alive long enough to park the adds(ghettomezzing), or even allow you to tank them until the first mob is finished.  <br />
<br />
HP = mana, AC = more HP(less damage taken) after your whacked a few times.<br />
<br />
shamans regen mana quite well at high levels, so mana pool is not really and issue.  Sure its nice, but it just takes longer to med to full, and more wis and less HP makes canni less effective, as you put your health at risk.  <br />
-<br />
<br />
At high levels, slow tanking is far and away the best way to exp, Wis does nothing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">please do not flame me for saying so but what if you only plan to use the shaman to duo with yourself and not raid much. I mean the shaman would be used to buff the meele and heal/slow  but never really anything else. Would you still go AC/HP and I would try to keep def maxed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sisthar: HP/AC is good choice for all situations, especial  Solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">understand how it is good for solo but if you are not going to be using the shaman for anything really but buffing another character that will be doing all the damage etc. why is HP more important?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">HP = Mana<br />
<br />
AC = HP<br />
<br />
Remember that, and you'll do fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bah don't you all read my post.<br />
<br />
HP REGEN/MANA REGEN/DPS &gt; ALL<br />
<br />
for leveling at least.<br />
<br />
NOT AC NOT HP NOT MANAPOOL<br />
<br />
People are big on HP at the minute but for leveling high HP is just as useless as high manapool.  Proper leveling should mean you aren't max hp or mana.<br />
<br />
Good example what I mean:<br />
<br />
When leveling, I would rather get POTG over AEGO, even though AEGO is a lot more hitpoints because POTG gives mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No matter what you're using your shaman for, you need good HP and AC, because shamans take a lot of damage if they cast slows, and sometimes notable damage if they cast heals.  <br />
<br />
At 51, especially, the 75% slow spell they get is very high aggro.  It can be very difficult for people to get aggro off a shaman who has slowed a mob.<br />
<br />
And don't forget the tricky part -- slow doesn't always stick.  Sometimes you have to cast it two or three times(let's try not to think about the times you have to cast it more than that).  Often, anything more than two or three tries is suicide for the shaman, since we don't have near the hitpoints melees do unless we have extremely good equipment.  For instance, at 60 my shaman has usually at least 1000 less hitpoints than melees do, and sometimes more than 2000 points less.  Sometimes ... more than that.  For reference, my shaman has full ToV, crystal chitin gloves he likes better than the ToV ones, epic, and a shield of wurms from North ToV.  Not the greatest, but comparably equipped melee have many more hitpoints than I do.<br />
<br />
Anyway, shamans can and do get aggro.  You will get it when you heal stuff, when you root it, when you slow it, when you DOT it, when you blast it -- you name it.  Unless you play your shaman as nothing more than a mule to haul around coin loot and bandages for your monk, you'll get hit a lot.  Especially after level 51.<br />
<br />
So you might as well prepare for it.  My shaman meleed mobs very well at 52, so you can melee a lot.   He didn't cause much damage, but with regrowth and slow, he could take it.  But do it solo -- groups don't need you being low mana when they need a heal because you've been busy working up your melee skills at their expense.  You'll be remembered if you're a clown who likes to melee when you've been added in to HELP the melees.  They REALLY need your heals and slows; your melee is extremely trivial, to say the least, compared to a real melee's.</div></div><hr />
