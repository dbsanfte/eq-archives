<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greymane shadowbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently lvl 61 with 19AAs (Run3, Regen3, MC3) and play 100% of the time with a 61 SK (sometimes we group with a 60 CLR).  My xp is set to 100% AA and getting Canni 5 is my goal for this weekend.<br />
<br />
I rarely go on raids because my guild is very casual.<br />
<br />
After getting Canni5, I was thinking of getting Spirit call 1, as this would definitely help my and the SK's DPS.  (Btw, I have horsie, JBB, Pox and Torpor but no epic).  How does SC1 work?  Do I only have to cast SC1 once when I am in the zone, or do the pets poof after each fight?  <br />
<br />
I've read may people recommend getting VP, RC or ND but I don't think they would be useful to us at this time since our regular camp is always single pulled by the SK and the mobs are not casters.   My hp is 2200 unbuffed so I will be getting ND but it is not a priority atm.<br />
<br />
Does getting SC1 sound ok?  After that, I am unsure what AA to work on next.  Please advise.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spirit Call re-use time is 12 minutes, and the spirits last 60 seconds. So it's nice for spurts, but doesn't add a lot to overall DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SC isn't a big dps boost; I use it more for fun, or if I get caught out running from A to B without the right spells ready, let loose the dogs and it buys plenty of time  to either sort out my spells or just run to zone.<br />
<br />
If you really intend to stick with that one group all the time, and never move from that one camp and have no interest in VP and RC, then I would look at the following (order is my preference, and easily debated for ages!).<br />
<br />
SCR 3: 30% Longer buffs, means you save mana, save time, and get less hassle. Particularly good if you find yourself doing haste. Also extends torpor, if (or when) you have it, which is a massive bonus.<br />
<br />
QB 2: Quicker cast times. Not so much for the buffs, but for torpor/quiessence. If you don't have torpor yet, I wouldn't bother. I say QB2 because with a focus item and cleric buff you are going to be near the 50% limit anyway, and QB3 is a whopping 9AA.<br />
<br />
SCRM: Like SCR3, 8AA points to extend buffs an extra 20% (50% total now).<br />
<br />
ND3: More hp. Nuff said.<br />
<br />
SCF3: You want more DPS? SCF3 will help significantly, if like me you use rains and nukes quite a bit. Works on both, unlike DD focus items that won't effect our rain spells.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, as you are worries about DPS first and foremost, you should actually go for SCF before the others. You really need to go all the way though, SCF1 doesn't activate often enough to make any noticeable difference., its more just for fun! SCF3, I am assured, is miles better.<br />
<br />
And if you start finding yourself in other situations, I do suggest VP and RC. RC saved me, or a group mate, quite a few times by providing a quick cure to root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As Goldark said, Spirit Call is not a significant DPS increase in the long-term.  <br />
<br />
If your primary concern is DPS, get SCF1/SCF2/SCF3, and start working spear of torment and the poison rain like there was no tomorrow.  You will notice a definite increase in your DPS, especially with your rains (which do surprisingly good damage since you get not 1, not 2, but 3 chances to crit each time you cast them).  <br />
<br />
After getting the spell casting fury trio, you might also want SCM1/SCM2/SCM3 to save you some mana so that you can increase your DPS even further.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, this advice ONLY makes sense if your primary goal is DPS.  It will not make you a better shaman, it will just make you do more damage (which is fine).<br />
<br />
Edit:  Spelling.</div></div><hr />
