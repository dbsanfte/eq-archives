<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deciimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, i read somewhere that this was soloable by a 65 Shaman, &quot;easily&quot;... ok, we all know our pets lack DPS, so in reality, is this only actually soloable to a 65 Shammie that has all 65 spells (dots, etc) and KEI on or is there some trick to the pull? Clearing the room seems doable, but how do you get in or pull w/o getting the entire room or multiple adds, etc... <br />
Any info would help, never solo'd much, and this kinda confuses me... 7 mobs... that take forever to kill alone... hrm... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard that you can invis in and fight him in his corner without adds,  of course I haven't tried it personally but it sounds like it could work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deciimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd just really like to find out :)  Like i said, i went in there, and checked it out, and pulled a random mob outside the room by the fountain to see how tough they were, and i killed it solo, but it took forever... <br />
<br />
Does one have to solo all the way in and clear everything? if so, i think i'd rather just bring a tank and duo it lol... what a pain...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkforest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can invis in and stand right behind him and kill him.Do not attack any kind of push will aggro the gobbie to your right facing him.Just keep him dotted and slowed and take the stuns.A very trying fight you wanna get him crippled or his proc is gonna annoy you to no end.First time i fought him i went oom with him at 3% tried to attack and bam adds next time i finished the fight oom but in good shape hehe.<br />
<br />
edit sorry used bos and bou on him with epic keep the epic on him the small amount of damage helps a ton :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shrink twice, stand behind him in the corner to avoid him pushing you with melee, and break invis by casting slow.<br />
<br />
Then, unleash hell with your dots - I usually just use BoS and Ancient Bane, but I also have Bane now, so it will be even easier with that. I usually end fight at about 50 mana. You'd be amazed how far he can move without agroing the others in the room. Agro range is tiny in droga - I love it.<br />
<br />
Loot hammer if it wasn't a PHer, reinvis, and run to next PHer to clear it too.</div></div><hr />

Open with malo, as you can usually cast 3/4 of the spell before he notices you. You'll need it on to not waste a bunch of mana on resisted poison dots anyway.. might as well get it out of the way when you can.</div></div><hr />

I usually hit him with sini after I land slow, just because it's a pain to slow him while you're getting stunned :)</div></div><hr />
