<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Talking with a vendor for a guild spell bank and he wanted 2k for our 55 pet puff. I felt like telling him where to stick it. Later that night I found another shaman who felt the same darn spell was worth 100pp and agreed to sell it. Amazing how nice shaman's can be sometimes...BTW that same guild bank vendor pulled Malo out of their guild bank and started the bids at 60k...<br />
<br />
The only other spells I have seen exceed the price of Malo and Torpor was Funeral Pyre Of Kelador. Some necro was offering 100k for it on Sol Ro. I just don't understand why any shaman would pay that much for malo or torpor, it's just insane. Main point is:<br />
<br />
1) If someone paid $100 for 10k on EBay...it would cost them at least $400 just to buy Torpor, on my server at least.<br />
<br />
Sad... Anyway, what did YOU pay for Torpor? Or did you get lucky and bag it on a raid? I'm curious, because 60 will be here soon, and the bank account isn't exactly overflowing. <br />
<br />
Thanks for feedback in advance.... :). It's 6am, so sorry if the post is...scattered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heya Garf.  Only reason funeral pyre gets that high is because it only drops off a high level named in SSRA and might be the best dot in a necro's spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">... and cause necros are infamous farmers who have the cash to compete with other farmers about spells :D<br />
<br />
Garf looks like you folks have someone in control off guild bank who takes his job too seriously milking big cash off guildies just to get fat guild account to show. That is sad. If our guild sells something for guildie twinks (no costs on anything for primary chars) it's sold at 1/3 of the going market price as standard. Try to atleast talk to your guild leaders/officers/members that you'd get 1/3 price for those spells etc. Should be quite fair enough. Besides, malo is 99% raid spell (meaning benefits go to guild not the shaman him/herself mostly, unlike could be said about torpor. malo 90% guild beneficial spell, torpor 10%)...<br />
<br />
I don't have Malo. Thank god we have many mages since Mala seems so common they have all it and bank has some spare copy too. I got torpor when guildexp group got it off from emp in OS crypt and turned it in to guild spellbank (I love my guildies sometimes) and guild assigned the spell for me. No charge. Like there should be none. Guild is supposed to help all its members and that way all who are part for mutual benefit.<br />
<br />
Try to get that guild banker in some sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am getting mildly twitchy over torpor myself at the moment.  I had it in my bank when I was either 53 or 54 and our guild seemed to be regularly killing dragons (I won mine in a non-guild dragon kill).  We then had a 60 shammie who didnt have it and couldnt find it for sale anywhere, so me being the fool I am gave him my copy.<br />
<br />
I am now not entirely sure that I made the right decision.  Morally, yeah I know I did, and if there is such a thing as Karma there will be a copy for me when I get to 60.  Selfishly, I know this game isnt like that and that I will be banging my head against the table when I hit 60 if there isnt a copy waiting for me.<br />
<br />
Gonna have to start doing a helluva lot of Juggs and crypt runs me thinks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got the impression the spell seller Garf was talking to wasn't from Garf's guild. I would never sell a spell to a guildmate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got Torpor off a guardian wurm. You could give that a shot. It's rare of course. A lot more rare than a fleshgrinder, I have seen a few of those drop. Another option is VP, supposedly drops a lot more there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The number 2 uberguild on my server is currently wtb a copy of Torpor. Spelldrops are fine and working as intended :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I ended up paying 100k for my copy of malo.<br />
I saw a grand total of 2 copies for sale in a 6-9 month period.<br />
I missed buying it the first time I saw it for sale.<br />
Not having malo makes me a vastly inferior shaman on the raids I go on.<br />
I also use malo in regular xp camps in certain places.<br />
I've gotten so much use out of it, I don't mind what I had to pay for it.<br />
IMO Malo, and especially Torpor are worth whatever price you have to pay to get them.  They are that good.</div></div><hr />

prolly cuz they are out killing other things in sol/sov and not worrying about kunark dragons/vp?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've been suprised with Torpor lately. Had 4 copies drop in the past 2 weeks for guild. 1 from Talendor, 1 from unknown single group kill, 2 from severilious (think it was him, could have been another talendor.)<br />
<br />
Sorry days jumble together. 1 level from getting it. With 4 copies in guild bank and 2 59 shamans and the rest 60.. The future is looking bright :)<br />
<br />
No copies of Malo that I've seen in the past 4 months.<br />
<br />
The thread about &quot;Torpor drop rate increased&quot; could be valid.  We're not the only guild who has had quite a few dropping.  Then again, it's all randomness and everything looks as if it has &quot;improved&quot; when the random table is working well for you :)<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lately, I have seen Malo not selling in the auction channel quite often for right around 50k, but Torpor is still pretty hard to find for sale or trade.  <br />
<br />
Torpor has a pretty mythical status on Xeg that I never knew about till the other day while waiting for one of the Nexus ports to fire.  One cast of Torpor got all the peeps who were waiting on the plat chatting about shammy spells and I heard some things that I didn't know and must have missed along the way.  I never knew that Torpor is &quot;a DA that CH's as well&quot;, &quot;an uber stat buffer&quot;, &quot;or &quot;a huge party mana regen buff&quot;.  Pricing suggestions from this l33t crew ranged from 100 to 200K.  I would guess that this explains why most peeps equate this spell with a winning lottery ticket.  Wonder if a fat guy named Ed will deliver a copy of Malo to my house??<br />
<br />
Your best shot at Torpor is to whack every dragon that walks RoK and coerce your guild into doing VP for spells.  If Sebilis is your only option, just keep /ooc and /auc off and it is actually a pretty fun zone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For the past 2 weeks, I've seen Malo and Topor auctioned more then usual. Everyday there are several different people shouting &quot;Taking offers on Malo/Topor&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've also heard that the past few days, Topor dropped off Emp in Seb. Malo dropped off the juggs. Juggs have been camped alot more regularly as well.<br />
<br />
Call me crazy but w/so many people auctioning lately, I'm thinking drop rates have gone up some. Verant did sneak in a small patch last week(txt file about flickering screens causing seizsures(sp?) Or maybe its just me, I'm just crazy. Btw, I still have not acquired either spell...so perhaps my theory is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I recently purchased Torpor for 15k and Malo for 15k. Very reasonable prices I thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Diced about 50 golems last night.. maybe 70 if you include the Bard Trak going down..<br />
<br />
<br />
0 Malo<br />
0 Torpor<br />
0 Shaman spells<br />

Someone say something about intended...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Spell drop rates are insanely random.  It would be nice if a specific set of spells dropped from specific mobs so you could maximize your chances of getting the ones you want instead of just drawing from the lotto everytime you kill a Kunark dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Paid 23k for Torpor and I feel that was fair. I was actually surprised to get it that cheap as I had previously offered 43k to someone else for it and they laughed at me. It was every PP I had in the bank.<br />
<br />
Now as far a Malo goes I would pay 15k for it but not one PP more. I feel this is a spell that is a benefit to the guild more than it is to me so it is the guilds responsibility to help me get a copy more than it is my responsibility to go out and sell everything I have just to get one spell. Sorry people but if a guild wants me to use Malo then they better help me get the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a scroll of Torpor waiting for me in guild bank, we have 4 in fact and only 2 shamans that plan to be 60 soon.  We have 1 60 shaman and 2 soon to be 60 shamans (level 59) that still need malo though.<br />
<br />
A few days ago we had 2 torpors drop off Talendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The best source of Torpor is Kunark dragons I think. Sadly, they are farmed by manaburn wizards on probably most servers, which means you get to pay big bucks for it if you want it.<br />
<br />
I got mine off Emperor Chottal when I was 57. It was the only 60 spell I had when I finally got 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Torpor dropped for me off the overking on a chardok raid a long long time ago. Havent seen anything useful drop on him since.<br />
<br />
Lately we have had great luck with sontalak. We get a malo or torpor pretty much every time we kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Traded Fungi for Torpor straight swap, breaking my 'holy trinity'. It was the first copy of Torpor I had seen on auction for 6 months, such is life on an old top heavy server. (spent last 3-4 months pretty much exclusively in Kunark hunting for spells when not raiding and only had Malo drop in the 59/60 range..)<br />
<br />
Some friends and guildies think I'm mad trading a fungi for a spell, I disagree as a torpor shaman is 10x more powerful than a non-torpor shaman with fungi /shrug, my only regret is not being able to pass the fungi to my casual monk twink ;)<br />
<br />
Also, working on canni5 is a bit pointless without torpor unless you have a cleric to mana-bitch you...(hence the monk twink, vicious circle heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">torpor &gt; holy trinity</div></div><hr />

I'm lvl 57 right now, fast closing on 60, I'm really glad I got it when I did though, because the day I hit 60 I'm plan to go lose it learning to solo some large mob :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What are you talking about?  Torpor _is_ the holy trinity.  Anyone want to speculate on the cost of Remove Greater Curse?  Demand is lower because not everyone hunts curse-filled zones, but it's pretty rare and very useful.  When I scribed it, I had the feeling that I was disolving a small fortune.  Come to think of it, I've never once seen it for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, RGC must outweigh Torp/Malo by quite a bit pricewise.  The only peeps I ever see looking for it are those without a clue as to its rarity or large guild bank mules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, I don't plan to get Malo before Torpor, because I'm not in a guild that does alot of high end raids. Although if I hear someone auctioning it for less that 15k, I'll grab it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Believe me I tried like hell to get my spells without buying them.  <br />
<br />
I killed Emperor Chattol about 30 times, add another 50 placeholders.  I killed Overking 5 times or more, Gorenaire twice, Servilious 4 times, Trakanon 5 times (Including Prot and that frog thing), hundreds of juggs, Guardian Wurms, damn near all but VP.  Nothing.   For Months, nothing.<br />
<br />
I got sick of waiting.  So I saved up the cash, and I paid 60k for Malo, and 50k for Torpor.  I didnt want to but I just had to.  Completely fed up trying to actually earn my spells, so I bought them :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I didn't pay anything for Topor although it came out of the guildfund. Malo dropped on a VP raid. I've seldom unmemed either of them as they are just too handy and usefull. Both raiding and single group/solo stuff.<br />

I keep losing the rolls on RGC. /rude paladians,</div></div><hr />

My guild's given all of its copies so far to pallies.<br />
<br />
Clerics need to heal and shamans need to debuff.<br />

Pallies gotta have something useful to do after they blow LoH.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Sontalak is one of the best sources in the game for Torpor. We've gotten 4 copies off him, including one that now resides in my spellbook. The others are stored in the guild vaults for any future shaman recruits, who are, realistically, not going to have it.<br />
<br />
I've only ever paid another player for a spell 2 times...1k for talisman of epuration, and it was well worth it. 7k for Khura's Focusing. I am (more or less) the only largely active guild shaman, and trying to buff 40+ people with focus of spirit was driving me insane. Everything else I have has been a drop.<br />
<br />
For the record, on our rarest spells:<br />
Malo: Gorenaire<br />
Torpor: Sontalak<br />
Pox: Emperor<br />
Tigir's: Emperor (unscribed...I may sell it rather than scribe it)<br />
Bane: Tolapumj<br />
Voice of the Berserker: Sontalak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Drop rate is too rare unless you're doing VP/Sontalak/Gorenaire on a regular basis.  Which is extremely hard to do even if you wanted to, because those mobs can be VERY highly contested.  You're much better off just camping loot to sell or trade for malo or torpor -- you'll do it in far, far less time.  If you ever find the spells for sale, that is. ;) Uber guilds often still have to advertise to buy these spells at top prices for a good long time.<br />
<br />
100k used to the be the standard price on my server.  I got it for my fungi tunic and 50k.  Fungi was worth 35k at that time, so I feel lucky to have gotten it for the equivalent of 85k.  First, to have gotten it at ANY price, EVER; second, to have gotten it for a decent one.  I got it long after I was 60.<br />
<br />
Malo I looted off Severilous in my high 50's.  Some dude who was a 60 shaman came into our guild about a week before and my guild officers heard I had gotten a malo on a raid that like 2 or 3 of my guildies were at, and all the rest were another guild I had never even heard of.  Was the only shaman there.  Stayed up till 6 in the morning to help them out killing Sev to return a favor my guild had incurred after our whole guild was begged endlessly to do it(what the favor was, I never knew).  Told them they had to be kidding me.  Maybe if I had known the guy or something, but after staying up all night without guild support, I wasn't about to give a spell I thought I was already awarded by the other guild, a spell I might never see again, to a stranger.  I did get a copy of malo from a friend sometime later who I gave to a shaman in our guild who I thought deserved it, though.  Sorta.  Well, the guild deserved to have another shaman with malo besides me, as I was the only one at the time, and people were screwed on some mobs if I took a day off.  Doing so lost me my chance to trade it for torpor though -- so it was a long time indeed till I saw torpor.<br />
<br />
I've seen severilous drop malo quite a few times, but torpor only once(long after I bought my torpor, of course :P).</div></div><hr />
