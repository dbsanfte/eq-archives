<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kusala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just my 2 cents but would really like to think that the stuff they added in the last 2 upgrades should have really been just patched in and have other zones and problems fixed instead of creating more problems and a new race to excite the old gamers to stick with it. <br />
<br />
 Gettin pretty tired of being forced to have to buy Expansions to play....... You might say that you dont &quot;have&quot; to buy them to play.  But in situations where people want to use the raid grouping and xp you do.  Thats why I will not buy this new expansion.  This is only my opinion and hope I dont get bashed for it.  Just wanted to complain a bit i guess. <br />
<br />
 One more thing THERES TO MANY DAM FROGS NOW :P<br />
<br />
I dont play anymore anyway but still looki in on things to se whats up gave account to brother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Understandable,<br />
<br />
i have a frog, but ive never actually gone ingame to play him, <br />
<br />
lvl 1 warrior =)<br />
<br />
the only reason i got LoY was for bank space, lfg tool, and that kind of thing, <br />
<br />
i personally think those should have come free, after all we do PAY to play this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye you pay to upkeep the servers, replace broken stuff, the customer serveice although minimal now, and the patches we geti n between expansions.<br />
<br />
Seriously of all the problems I have with Sony, them selling expansions is not the least of it. This game has saved me so much more money in the long run it's not even funny.  I've no cause to complain considerign in the last what 3 years now is it? I've spent 540-550 dollars for hours and hour and hours of entertainment. <br />
<br />
I've got plenty of problems with sony, but this ? Never.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a really good point and a angle i think we all forget to look at things from at times ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One point I left out. On top of the obvious entertainment value I dont even want to begin to think of the money it's saved me on games for both consoles and pc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syndromes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are a few features LoY presents that appealed to me.  The extra bank space especially.  Of course without the LoY expansion, I wouldn't have been created! &quot;Frrroooaaakkk!&quot;  Every expansion has its own pro and con and of course there will be those all for it and those against it.<br />
<br />
In the end though it all comes back to the very sole source... VI/SONY is a company... they make money on a game they created/produced/delivered.  The only way to continue making a profit is to build off of their platform.  Which is why movies have sequels and games have expansions/add-on's.<br />
<br />
So far I'm enjoying PoP and LoY, but I do hope they put an end to the expansions for a little while so that others can catch up some and enjoy the game with everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I figure I've paid roughly $650 over the 3+ years I've played.  During that time I've logged approx 250 days /played, which is about 6000 hours.  That comes out to about $0.11 per hour for entertainment.   I challenge anyone to find any other form of entertainment that come close to that.   Other games, no way, I used to buy a game a month and within a few weeks be bored with it.  Even if I watched TV for 10 hours a day my cable bill costs me about $0.16 an hour at that rate.<br />
<br />
There have been 4 major expansions in 4 years.  I for one get a bit tired of an expansion right at 8-10 months old.   And if there weren't expansions you would still be sitting in Sol B waiting to get on the Window Room list. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think honestly, this expansion is a bit of a let down after PoP (which I think they did an awesome job on).<br />
<br />
However.. that said.. The new Froglok race rules ;)  They are so adorable!  The new zones are ok, I guess.  I love my leezard, Lumpy! (that was worth it right there) and the extra bank space has us all breathing a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
And cooooool alchemy potions that are really useful! and fun!<br />
<br />
I'm not sorry I got it, but I'm ready for them to wait at least a year for the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with everything about the value of this game. You really wont find a better deal than this, unless your entertained by bouncing a rubber ball off the wall for a year...that might be a better deal.<br />
<br />
PoP was great, nothing I didnt like about that expansion. Cut down on some twinking, flag system is cool, no more begging druids and wizards for ports, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
LoY is awesome except for one thing. They put god damn fribbits in the game. Havent seen the new zones yet.. dont really care to. I bought the expansion for the utilities it adds to the game. Seeing all these frogs is really starting to piss me off, I swear, I could live off frog legs for a year im so mad.<br />
<br />
But, I am getting kind of sick of having to buy a new expansion every 6 months, not really at the cost, mostly because its annoying. They keep giving us stuff that they COULD give us for free, but they figure, what the hell, lets make some more money.... no problems there, but then they make me get off my arse and drive to the store to get it. Thank god LoY was downloadable, haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, you may be one of the few who like it ...<br />
<br />
About LoY: Yes, they could have patched it in, but don't forget they are a company and want to earn money. Reminds me of /raid feature just being available when you buy PoP.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jaradis<br />
  you da man. .11 cents an hour, I guess some people just can't afford it huh.<br />
<br />
haha<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Sure they should be in patch for free (like in other mmoprg......and before sony) ,but if some people ,per example like you , pay for them......they will be costly....more and more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wonder if all these features will make it into EQ2 ?.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kusala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hehe thought that may happen.  Ok<br />
1. never said it wasnt a good deal for entertainment.<br />
2. Stonebrunt was a freezone  they could have just kept adding zones that way AS In Cazic Thule..... revamped unused so WE HAVE A CRAPLOAD OF THOSE!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
 I am sayin we dont need expansions for new zones fix what we have so we don't crash all the time due to bugs.  Fix customer service so we get what we pay for.  Fix broken quest revamp old zones that are unused.  GIVE US WHAT WE PAY FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMO if SOE had any brains at all they would make the software for the game free, like linux, <br />
but keep the monthly fee, <br />
<br />
i mean in all honesty how stupid is it to have to PAY for a freaking game, the Pay for it again and again every month? <br />
<br />
yeah i know &quot;our money goes to sever upkeep, patches, and the police force they have known as &quot;GMs&quot; <br />
<br />
but trust me, they make PLENTY of money enough to be able to afford to make the software a free download.<br />
and even enough to make the first month free also.<br />
<br />
and im absolutly sure that they would attract MANY more gamers that way, <br />
<br />
i mean what serious gamer would refuse a free month of gaming?<br />
<br />
i know i would have jumped on at bata if that was the case. <br />
but i couldnt bring myself to spend my hard earned money on a game i had to keep paying for month after month, <br />
especially with how crappy the graphics were, and still are.<br />
<br />
<br />
gah. after 10hours of work my spelling sucks....but then again it sucks anyway <br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes I'm sure Sony has done you all a favor by saving you money. Their in this for our benefit, not because some Japanese executives get to buy a new round of yachts on us.. yeah right. They net obscene amounts of money.<br />
<br />
 They will keep putting out expansions as fast as you folks will buy them. Bug fixing gets put on the back shelf, and customer support, because no one is going to pay extra for that. I for one didn't buy this last expansion.. So what am I going to do with the $22? Spend it in on U.S. goods in a token gesture to try to help out the economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I couldn't have put it better myself, Helios.  I haven't bought LoY, nor PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kusala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Very well put indeed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hell LoY is worth it just to make a frog and tease trolls about losing their starting city. Never liked trolls anyway =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tossyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I will admit I have a froggy Alt, but I do enjoy playing him..Heres how....<br />
I got him bound in Panieel right near the cliff above &quot;the Hole&quot;. When I get sick to death of the sight of Frogs running up ad not even asking with &quot;Buff Me Plz&quot; or &quot;Can I give you 100pp for a PL I need to get to lev 20 and only lev 6 now ?&quot;.. I load up &quot;Icanttakeit&quot; and leap..  At least it makes me feel better and rids the world of another stoopid frog.</div></div><hr />
