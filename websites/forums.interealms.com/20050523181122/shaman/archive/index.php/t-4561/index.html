<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently aquired a ft2 book in UP that can go in my range slot. It gives 2 points of mana per tick and it can stack with other ft items. Its the only ft item I have until i get done with my soltice earing quest. Is it even worth giving up the wis bonus of my range slot item?(howling harpoon) I was thinking the 2 points per tick would really add up after awhile. But with cann its hard to say how useful this is until perhaps I get other ft items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you had something useful in your Ranged Slot (like a Golden Idol of Rallos Zek) I wouldn't do it.  But with a harpoon there?  go ahead and change them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would definatly use the UP FT2 book over a howling harpoon yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally i'd use it.  Coupled with any horse (if fighting out door) you can sit on the horse and it reads it as sitting (medding) while casting, running, and there is no added sit aggro.  Very nice, im always on horse when hunting out door :)  At ft6 (which i am at) i can really tell the difference!</div></div><hr />
