<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A guildy of mine recently grouped with another 60 sham in a pickup group in PoP.  Sham was playing the healer for a bit.  My guildy told me that the Sham was healing with a spell that gave the effect &quot;Your body pulses with health&quot; or something similar to that and healed for 700ish or 1k.  <br />
<br />
Someone shed some light on this for a confused Sham.  What spell is this?  Have I completely missed a whole line of spells?  I was embarrassed to say I didn't know which spell it was.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I just realized that Kragg's gave a different message from the caster to the recipient.  As the caster, it was always &quot;so and so&quot; feels the mending of Kragg.  I guess I had never realized what the recipient of the spell gets.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response.  Ok, I feel stupid now.</div></div><hr />
