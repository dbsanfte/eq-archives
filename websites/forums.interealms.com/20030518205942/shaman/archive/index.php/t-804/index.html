<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read thru these boards almost on a daily basis, I have learned a wealth of information from everyone here, Thanks! By looking at the price of these I see that they are extremely desired. I already know that it is a Rare Drop of a named MOB. <br />
<br />
What kind of group are we talknig about here. Is it your standard Old Sebilis group? Does anyone know of any tactics on how to camp or what force is needed for this item that could point me the right way?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lenard-Tz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">an ideal full group would be shaman cleric tank rogue ench dr00d<br />
<br />
it really depends on the abilities and level of the players youre with<br />
<br />
if youre 60 with torpor you can solo the duke room and camp just outside the door out of view of the guardian<br />
<br />
very easy to solo once youre in his room &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
you could get down there with just a rogue as a partner, many people have done it, just invis past the crypt guardians into the individual rooms and kill the skeletal xxxx</div></div><hr />
