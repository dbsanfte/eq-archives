<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to do the Kromriff Military Leggings quest last but the quest borkled on me. After giving the Broodmother the control harness she went to the giant fort but Fergul Frostsky never spawned outside the fort. <br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone had successfully done this quest recently? I'm hoping it was maybe just a one time goof.<br />
<br />
On the upside I did get the coldain military bracer and cann II quest finished this weekend so 2 out of 3 I guess isn't to bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I witnessed the same thing the other night.  Though after much shouting and carrying on - it turned out someone killed Fergul after the quest had begun and therefore ruined the poor questers chance at a wonderful pair of pants.  <br />
<br />
As I see it - make sure that both giants are popped before you make your turnin to the Broodmother, make sure the zone knows that you are questing the leggings,  and make sure your party of friends goes after the right one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Be VERY sure that BOTH nameds are alive when you turn in the belt. Then be VERY sure again noone touches them till the BM is near them. The origional giants will then despawn and respawn outside the fort. When they respawn you can kill him.<br />
