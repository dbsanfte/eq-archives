<br />
Sad thing is that if it was 2k, he||, even 4k, I'd have to seriously consider buying it.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sold Can 2 the other day at the bazaar for 2K.  Went fairly fast, but if I had been awake I probably would have given it to her for way less.  The xp for the quest isn't shabby at all either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, so what the heck is McMerrin's feast?  I saw the spell for sale on torv. for 1500 pp, lv 39, SHM only.  Never seen this spell on a spell list though.<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
McMerrins Feast is not a spell. notice it doesnt say Spell: in front of it.<br />
<br />
Not sure what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Micky's Feast is Can II, correct?<br />
<br />
25k for BoN sucks too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes McMerin's Feast  is the title of the spell Canni 2.<br />
<br />
I didn't get mine until my early 50's right before I got Canni 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">wow even if i COULD sell this spell for 2k then it's damn worth gettigna few copies<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />

yeah yeah all u high lvls laugh at me for wantign 2k but for me 2k is godly :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've seriously considered doing it, just so i can sell.<br />
<br />
I've seen it go for 3k, went pretty fast too.  I never did it, too lazy, but 3-4k isnt a bad amount of cash...to me atleast :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow the prices there are just sad.<br />
<br />
25k for Bane? Bane tops out at like 5k on Saryrn. Avatar 2k, Tigir's has been sold for 10k, but averages I'd asay around 5. Why ANYONE would PAY for acumen is beyond me. Malo is still up there at 65, torpor 25-30, pox 5-8k or so. <br />
<br />
If you have enough cash to purchase Canni 2 for 2k, then you have enough free time to PL your shaman from 39 to 54 in under a week. <br />
<br />
Sure, if I had 2 k to spend on canni 2 as a lowbie I definitely would have, as I took about 3 months or more to get to 54 from 39, all by myself. But 500pp was a treasure chest full of cash to me at that point, 1k+ was inconceivable. Canni 2 is a great spell but if you are only going to use it for 1 maybe two weeks, why spend that much cash?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know where you buy your spells Durn :) I always see Bane for 2k tops, Avatar for 10, Tigir's for 5.  Malo is 65, true, but i have seen torpor being sold once, and it was 50k, and never even seen pox ;\<br />
<br />
Saryrn's economy can be wierd sometimes...prices fluxuate alot.  i saw an item drop from 10k, to 5k, and back to 10k as its standard price in the space of 3 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bane of Nife goes for less than 1k regularly on Prexus.  Last time I looked it was about 600p, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Airess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just curious,<br />
Am I the only one that has noticed that the price listed in the window for McMerin's Feast is not listed at 2k but rather at 20k?<br />
<br />
As for buying it, I've always loved wasting my spare time on quests so while I can't remember what level I actually did it, I much prefered the quest to trying to buy it.<br />
But that's just me, I still run off to Kael to duo the arena whenever I have spare time just cuz I think bashing a giant in the kneecaps for a while is amusing. People never seem to mind when I offer the MQ's for 1k or less a pop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wonder if he ever sold it.<br />
<br />
It's never for sale on Rodcet. I could sell it for 5k easily I think.<br />
<br />
But dealing with Karnors and yun shamans aint worth 5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That's nothing.  I saw a copy of &quot;Spirit Strike&quot; our lvl 14 DD selling for 2900pp in the bazaar last night. <br />
Yah, the vendor one . . . yah it doesn't drop . . . yah it's lvl 14 . . . ok.<br />
<br />
Hmm, i used to sell copies of Micky's Feast for 500pp.  Maybe prices have gone up?  Easy enuf quest really, nothing to it.  <br />
<br />
Made 28k last night while asleep.  Not bad heh.  woot i'm rich again lol, was broke after buying my horsie.</div></div><hr />
