<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to share a little something I've been doing quite a bit lately, it may or may not work on your server and it's not a sure thing, but I've made about 400k off of it over the last couple months.<br />
<br />
If you've spent any time in the new Droga or have done any research on the Droga quests you know that there are a few pretty nice items you can get. Each quest has 4 components and all of the pieces are droppable.<br />
<br />
I've been a bit bored with actually &quot;playing&quot;, although I do find some enjoyment hanging out in the bazaar, buying and selling items.<br />
<br />
Once I knew the components for a few of the quests I started searching the bazaar for the pieces, and I've had luck finding a lot of them for sale individually for a very low cost. Over the course of a week  or two or I've been able to gather some components and then sell them all as a set.<br />
<br />
I do go and see if the turn-in mob is up before I gather the pieces, and on my server they have been.<br />
<br />
Here are the things you can look for and the results of each. You could of course go to Droga and farm the pieces yourself too, I've just been having luck finding them in the Bazaar for very little money, I guess some people don't know of the quests.<br />
<br />
If you're in the Bazaar with some time to kill do a search for some of these components and see what comes up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
Cialin's Ice Staff<br />
Earring of King Dronan<br />
Mark of Imprisonment<br />
<br />
Those drop EVERY time from the named.  They are extremely common.  I must have 3 or 4 earrings of King Dronan on mules, and I've given away a half dozen others.  I can't sell them for 200pp in the bazaar.<br />
Cialin's Ice Staff is also a common item.<br />
<br />
It is the x3 items that are normally very hard to get &amp; on E. Marr at least are very costly to buy in the bazaar.  If you've been lucky in this regard, congratulations!  <br />
<br />
Good idea to keep a lookout for the items.<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What type of search criteria would I use in the bazaar to find these items?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Buk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is what I use:<br />
<br />
For Cialin's Ice Staff I search for &quot;cia&quot;<br />
For Fetish of Ice Mastery I search for &quot;fetish of&quot;<br />
For Blade of the Depredator I search for &quot;blade of the&quot;<br />
For Mark of Imprisonment I search for &quot;mark of im&quot;<br />
For Earring of King Dronan I search for &quot;dronan&quot;<br />
For Sash of the Cave Lord I search for &quot;sash of&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have better luck searching for the more unique parts of the string.  It can be anywhere in the name of the item.<br />
<br />
Sash of the cave lord = &quot;cave lord&quot;<br />
Blade of the depredator = &quot;depred&quot;<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok Not to hijack this thread. But on these quests. Do I actually have to hail and free the slaves in droga to do the turn in of these items? <br />
<br />
If I was to find the correct freed slave up in there spawn points and I have the items he wanted for turn in? But never actually freed him will I get quest credit?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edited: for clarity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zodiax:  If the prisoners are released, anyone at all can hail them and turn in the required items.<br />
<br />
You do not get ANYTHING for going down into Droga and doing the 'free-the-prisoner' event,  no flags, no items, nothing, other than a happy feeling of doing good. (or a sick feeling when you realize you wasted 2-3 hrs...whichever way you look at it). :)</div></div><hr />
