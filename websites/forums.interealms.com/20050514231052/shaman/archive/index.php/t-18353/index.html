<br />
EDITED: Fixed up the links as it stuffed them from my cut past into notepad<br />
<br />
I used to play on SZ and still read the boards and so forth. What I am posting is a rip from Fefael who used to play on SZ and posts regularly on Graffe. Soon as I read this post it was deleted so I am glad I made a copy. The more people who know the sooner it will get fixed I hope<br />
<br />
POST BELOW<br />
<br />
Here's how to get anyone on your server banned, how to dupe piles of plat and how to Voicegraft onto any NPC in the game (as well as other players). Aditionally with a bit of extra work, grant yourself full GM powers!<br />
<br />
I've e-mailed SoE twice, with no response in the period of a week. I flamed Absor here yesterday, though that was probably counterproductive, and it's been /petitioned and reported on many servers.<br />
<br />
For example, many on this board know Neuro (from Fury's Edge - and a really nice guy). Look at what a hacker on his server had his character saying:<br />
<br />
www.fohguild.org/forums/s...eadid=9846<br />
<br />
or how about here, on the Ranger forums:<br />
<br />
forums.interealms.com/ran...adid=31744<br />
<br />
or the infamous thread already here on www.graffe.com with the screenshots from Sullon Zek: <br />
<br />
www.graffe.com/forums/sho...adid=11546<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, how do you do this? Simple.<br />
<br />
#1 - Get a free EQ account. Go here, and they will e-mail you a functioning key for EQClassic, you can even download the entire client from their FTP server: cmt.ubisoft.fr/eq_keys/uk/<br />
If you get banned, who cares! Make another account!<br />
<br />
#2 - Download and compile Macroquest2.0: macroquest.sourceforge.net/main.php<br />
<br />
Now you will be able to do all kinds of fun things in your own UI window, including massive macroing of pp dupes, zonewide targetting and looting, etc. Of course, you will also be able to add your own custom plugins that allow you to connect to IRC servers, live databases, all kinds of cool stuff. Which leads us to point #3<br />
<br />
#3 - Download the plugin to control NPC's and PC's! I'm not going to provide an exact link, but if you have a forever-hacking.net account, just surf into the EQ section and take a quick peek around, I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. There's also plugins available for GM powers and other fun to abuse tools.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, just simply install the MQ2.0 UI, log into your free account, and have fun making NPC's like &quot;Fefaels_Mother_SUCKS&quot; or, even better, just say stuff in /ooc with my name, and then get someone to report it. Woohoo, I'm now banned.<br />
<br />
Absor. This isn't on an emulator. This isn't news to the community, and based on feeback to the SOE staff, it shouldn't be news to them either. FIX IT. And do it damn fast, your game is hemoraghing credibility as we speak, and this is spreading like wildfire. Considering that posting on a public message board seems to be the only way to get attention to something broken this severely, here it is.<br />
<br />
I know it's harder to fix than it sounds too, but somebody needs to get cracking on it, or EQ as a credible game becomes Diablo in a hurry.<br />

This sounds like something you could be arrested in real life for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Raph Koster said in the laws of online gaming: The client is in the hands of the enemy. No one at SOE (back then VI) cared about this.<br />
<br />
The EQ client is the single most permissive there is. The server trusts the client too much. And when you have a free key generator it will just get hacking into overdrive. There is no chance of SOE being able to do much unless they pull off the key generator site ... or actually fix the client. They should have called Lost Dungeons of Norrath the Hacked Dungeons of Norrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps it is intended to bring in new customers by basically giving them the game for free and letting them try out EQ Classic for 30 days before their first monthly fee?  Sony isn't making money off of EQ classic software anymore anyways since they are including it with basically any EQ package you buy.</div></div><hr />

   <br />
  Yeah the free key isnt designed to be free forever just a starter keycode so to speak. <br />
<br />
   Unfortunately the side effect is makes it harder to ban the hacker since they dont even need to use their own account to do the hacking. Who needs 30 days if they are ready to hack they are going to do it now now. PLus all the people who keep giving out their info in game. Promised time keys and whatever else and give their info and its all over. Remember never ever give your info out or your in for trouble. I know some people give it to a friend and your playing with fire but never ever give it to a person you dont know for a promised anything. People giving out their info and getting hacked and banned in a short period of time.</div></div><hr />

It is legit, and you're correct.  It's where I got the key for one of my accounts a while back.  You just have to switch the billing information to American.  Have to set up billing info on the station website rather than in the EQ client because you can get the site to ask your country of origin.  Just a little FYI in case anybody else wanted to trial 2-boxing or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ahh ok. I successfully obtained a registration key from the Ubisoft link, but when I went to play (on my discs not the FTP client) it kept telling me my account had expired.<br />

<br />
EDIT: No...&quot;duuuh &quot; on my part re the Credit Card.<br />

As an aside, the UBISoft account only allows you access to the original three servers. (Or so it says). Can I get a confirmation that the Plane of Time isn't off of Odus, Faydwer or Antonica?</div></div><hr />

Did you set up proper billing information?  You need to set up the information before it'll let you start a trial period or it'll keep claiming expired.  It needs a CC, it just won't charge it for 30 days.</div></div><hr />

It's amazing that folks would do stuff like this within the game :(  And here I was all proud and happy to struggle and claw my way to 65 only to see guys who've just basically set their PC's on the equivalent of auto-pilot then go grab a beer or something and watch TV for a few hours while their character plays itself :(</div></div><hr />

not unless he likes moving around to different class Bs every month. They probably ban more than just one IP address from the blocks he comes from within his ISP.</div></div><hr />

So it's not such a big threat really, only on Sullon zek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I checked it out too.. things like:<br />
[eb],[speedhigh] so they can run really fast, beathe underwater, stupid things that are easily detectable if they were a big deal.. <br />
<br />
The loot thing with MQ2 means once the mob is dead you click on the corpse then the macro will loot fast! you can do that easily using a button with /loot written in it..<br />
<br />
The shaman macro..<br />
Okay, Problem is, I am not at Home and have no Everquest at work. <br />
Well this is my first Macro and I don't know if it will work. <br />
<br />
Sure sign of trouble =b also this kind of stuff is for 6 boxers etc who want to automate things, if it worked. Not like there is a macro where you click on start and the thing goes 1-65 for you...<br />
<br />
Also the damage this macroquest does is when trivial content with good loot is automated, like in sebs where bots camp stuff for days on end.. it you won't see a 6 man macroquested team doing a dungeon crawl... <br />
<br />
My whole point is, crazy things like talking through someone else I doubt is being done though something like macroquest or xbot(sp).<br />
<br />
Like to add that if every shaman I met that barely talked and played like a nitwit was just some macro bot then 99% of eq is being macrobotted!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually MacroQuest is so much more than just a macro programmer. Initially F-H used to make their own offset programs to do these hacks, but since MQ2 is so robust as to allow plugins, they decided to take advantage of MQ2 because it has the built-in ability to circumvent the &quot;checks&quot; that Sony has placed into EQ.<br />
<br />
The &quot;checks&quot; watch for changes to specific offsets, for example the speed offset: there is a piece of code that checks the value at that memory offset and reports it to sony ever so often (30 second or something like that), MQ has functionality that takes care of this reporting so that you are not caught when modding the speed offset.<br />
<br />
That is only a small example of the offset protection offered by MQ. <br />
<br />
The reason you only see the small things on the FH forums such as speed, eb, fisheyes are because those are all that are released to the &quot;level 1&quot; people (people that are newly registered, or people that havent been able to contribute). Once you become a trusted member there are 3 more levels (level 2, level 3, and o.0), as you gain levels, access to the higher level boards open up. It is here you will find the bigger hacks such as changing your ID (so you can effectively take over other mobs and speak through them etc...) along with a multitude of other offsets deemed &quot;to risky to be nerfed&quot; and not shared with people lower on the access ladder.<br />
<br />
No, i dont cheat in EQ (which things like this most certainly are) but I am a programmer by trade, and I am amazed by what the MQ community was able to do with EQ. Things like this interest me and therfore I am rather familiar with the project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm just a CS major so not by trade =] I still don't believe that chaging offsets locally is affecting a server side char. but I guess what you are saying is the client changes you into that person or makes the server think you are that person.. the whole idea sounds doable depending on programming but also pretty insane.. and very hard to believe =b<br />
<br />
damn crazy info..</div></div><hr />
