<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK . I was in high pass the other nite and grouped with some straglers. I needed to level so i went with what was available.I was the highest lvl there at 23 the lowest at 19.<br />
 My bitch is that they had to set a loot schedule ( which is ok ), I told them that i wasnt going to loot for gear just cash. I had split on and I only looted 1 in 5 corpses. But wouldn't you know they bitched every time I looted. What is up with this? Is this a common problem or did I just get a bad group?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like a bad group to me. There's no escaping them permanently I'm afraid, unless you find a good guild and hunt with them exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, bad group. <br />
<br />
Though from a different perspective, I could see many other problems, say another person didn't get his/her fair share of loot (say 1 outta every 10 corpse), or few people didn't want share on, or you looted while you were in battle and they wanted you to concentrate on the mobs, or they were paranoid and though recieving cash was a bad thing ?? <br />
<br />
Ah, I hope everything gets better for you..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am assuming you mean they said XXX loots until he/she gets a bronze or 1-3pp (whichever comes first)? In which case you should have sat on your hands and waited until your turn in the rotation. (They arent looting that bronze to use, they are selling it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TraccAnkeeel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why group at lvl 20ish if its cash or loot you wanted? Go solo some mobs and keep the hoard all to yourself. While they are running round aimlessly looking for mobs, you can be looting and on your way to your next.<br />
