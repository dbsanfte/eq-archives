<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>antisocial86</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 5 troll shaman, trying to build faction with Freeport, whats the easiest way other then running around whacking orcs? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What you need to ask yourself is why do u need faction with freport.<br />
It takes a LOT of orc kills to get friendly enough with the guards so that u can hand in their belts for more faction.<br />
If you are thinking about the epic then none of us needed the faction.<br />
We used inviz and that was the end of it. I am a troll and i never once needed fp faction. It is a useless city that offers nothing of value to a shaman (besides the epic). No need to bank in fp either simply GET to fp and click portal to pok.<br />
<br />
Don't waste your time killing orcs the xp ain't that great and fp faction is simply not worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check out these Freeport quests. The only thing I am aware of that will attack you in the Freeport tunnels are the drowned citizens, but you don't have to worry about them if you avoid water in the tunnels.<br />

You can shortcut the quest dialogue by targetting Nestral and Harkin and saying &quot;who Janam&quot; and &quot;where Rebby&quot;. <br />
<br />
When I first started playing the game about 3 years ago I decided I wanted my troll to have Freeport faction so I could work on smithing. I did these quests 60-100 times (I can't remember) using one account by letting my human monk alt do the turn-ins to Janam and Rebby, running back to the tunnels and dropping the return items on the floor in a nearby deserted room, camping the monk, logging in my troll who picked up the items and handed them to Harkin and Nestral thereby allowing my troll to get the positive faction hits. My troll now cons dubious to all the (corrupt) East and West Freeport guards and ally to all Freeport merchants. <br />
<br />
Note that these quests do not fix North Freeport guard (non-corrupt) faction (which you can get by killing 1000 orcs in East Commons), nor does it fix the N. Freeport bard faction (which I believe you can fix by hunting in Castle Mistmoore), nor does it fix faction with the caster guild in W. Freeport (some Arcane place) which I don't think can be fixed, nor does it fix the monk Ashen Order faction in W. Freeport (which you can also get by killing orcs), and there is &quot;a woman&quot; near Janam and Rebby and another npc in a shop near them that you will need to avoid as well. The caster guild is easily avoidable by invising or taking an alternate route through the city, but otherwise you will still need to con until you figure out where you can and can't go. Also the bank is in N. Freeport :( and, as I very recently discovered, there is one shop in E. or W. Freeport (somewhere behind the buildings in a pit) where there is a guard on N. Freeport faction.<br />
<br />
Was getting the faction a pain? Yeppers. It would be MUCH quicker to do this using an alt that can bind and gate and has sow, and a two box setup wouldn't hurt either. Besides being able to do tradeskills in Freeport (which is no longer a big deal due to Shadows of Luclin and PoP), there is some novelty value in my troll being able to move about E&amp;W Freeport unhindered, and the comments of other players are always interesting when they see him in the city.<br />
<br />
I think you have to have some kind of personality disorder to want to do this.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a gnome necromancer that I played to level 20 and hope to play again some day.  His goal is to be able to walk down the streets any player city and not be attacked.  Of all the “evil” race/class combinations, gnome necromancers have it the easiest when it comes to faction work.  Without any faction work my gnome could walk into both Freeport and the dark elf city without getting killed.  However, I also have to be very careful when I kill things.  I can’t, for example, kill orcs in Crushbone or I’ll tick off the dark elves.  But what fun would it be without a few insurmountable challenges? <br />
<br />
I did the above two quests with my gnome and many of the guards actually like him now.  He’s far from ally, but it’s a good start.  As stated earlier, with all the latest expansions there really isn’t a need to do faction work.  However, sometimes its just fun to set a goal and try to achieve it.  So if you want Freeport faction just to have Freeport faction I wish you all the luck in Norrath.  It will take work, but I’m sure you can achieve your goal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus you get banking faction in North Freeport.  <br />
<br />
I've done it twice with twinks.  Not much reason not to do it.</div></div><hr />
