<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My shm is lvl 53, and wears a diamond wedding band from TofS for resists and a velium jasper.  I was thinking of getting a set of 6/65 rings for more AC/HP, but was wondering if buying that is a waste at this level, since there are better high end rings available.  My guild is not NToV or similar capable, so no Ring of Fire drops please :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">...Shadel Bandit Ring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wear a Shadel Bandit Ring and a 6/65.  The 6/65 is one of the best bargains you can get right now, aside from the Shadel which is free.  Another great ring is the mage focus ring.  For raids, I wear a 6/65 and Naki's Studded Ring.  It's free, has decent stats, and a great effect.  Jasper rings are junk, so it's good that you're looking to get rid of it.  If you end up with 2x 6/65, you won't regret it at all.  They're the baseline by which all other high-end rings are judged.</div></div><hr />

On my other finger, I have either a plat jasper ring (6 wis) for tradeskills, a velium diamond resist ring (for the casters) or a 6/65 ring for just chillin.</div></div><hr />

Just because Im white, had a blackman as a best man, married a hispanic, had Jews, Muslims, and Hinuds at my wedding being organized by a Hippie doesnt give me any rights to refer to them by slang semantics... by doing so(even though it maybe fun within my friends), gives the wrong perception to others....<br />
<br />
Take a deep breathe and smile knowing that this part of the thread is done.....<br />
<br />
.. and now back to rings.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can I get some more info on the cultists please?  Looks like a great shaman ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cultist ring info (from Allakhazam's) - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10565<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Got one of these for each member of my group the other night. They were dropping about once every 45 minutes of clearing the camp. There are 3 normal types of mobs at the camp, and 2 named mobs. The ring is the only really worthwhile item they seem to drop, and it seems random off any of the normal mobs. The Sebilisian Battlemaster (warrior), the Sebilisian Revenant (sk) and the Undead Sebilisian Lich (necro). The normal mobs seem to be level 51-55 and the nameds are both level 60, a necro with spectre pet and an SK (1001 pt HT ). Nameds hit for about 250-270.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The ring description says no longer droppped and I'm not familiar with those MoBs.  Never seen them, none of my tracking group members commented on them during various OS key camps.  Was this part of the patch where the added stuff to TT then removed it the next patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">From what I understand, these were dropping briefly a couple of months back, but they were quickly removed from the game.  I'm guessing that VI screwed up and patched an update into the game prematurely.  According to a good friend of mine, they have returned to the game, and he's been camping them with some of his guildies.  I'm planning on trying to check into this over the coming weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What about Djarns Amethyst Ring?<br />
<br />
MAGIC LORE<br />
AGI: 9<br />
HP: 80<br />
ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
I always thought this would be a nice upgrade for one of my 6/65 rings. Anyone have an opinion on these rings (risk vs. reward, vs. other rings, etc.)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Last time we went to Efreeti Lord, two of those dropped.<br />
I drooled  over 80hp.  The policie was guildleader awarded the items, so they both went to monk.<br />
<br />
..<br />
Curse him :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I use a djarns and a shadel.. 6ac/65s are sweet though.. I miss the extra 10hps I lost going to the shadel =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The conventional wisdom shared by this forum and those at Monkly Business is that HP and AC are of approximately equal importance (ignoring caps and all of that of course).<br />
<br />
Therefore, 6ac/65hp &gt; 0ac/80hp.  The difference between losing 6ac to gain 15hp is not worth it.<br />
<br />
The AGI is meaningless IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">9 AGI will give you something like 2-3AC and insignificantly increase your rate of miss/dodge. Velium FO definitely &gt; Djarn's.</div></div><hr />

My goal is 10th and 9th coldain ring.<br />
<br />
19 raw ac on fingers<br />
19 str (bah, crap, without rings and self buffed, I have 255 str anyway)<br />
19 sta = more hps<br />
150 hps<br />
19 rm<br />

Add a free 10hps/tick regen who is instant cast for raids ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The agi on Djarn Ring is far from meaningless if you constantly suffer ac penalty from having less than 75 agi.<br />

Fungi has neg 10agi, Lodi Shield has neg 5 agi (Both are excellent items for  shammys)</div></div><hr />

At least 4 large 2nd lvl guilds on Veeshan were doing this camp to equip members.   Sad that it goes this way but what do you expect with a Not Lore ring with this lvl of stat's.</div></div><hr />

AGI buffs make this a non-issue.<br />

A guildie was in a mixed group camping them this weekend, and a guild about whom I have nothing good to say comes in and invokes PnP on the camp. :mad:</div></div><hr />
