<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 61 shaman, I have been playing EQ but not the shaman class exclusively since beta III off and on with a few breaks in between play &quot;periods&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have always had a shaman and feel I have adjusted well to the ever changing &quot;style of play&quot; that is expected of a shaman at the core of who we are and what we do. I know of course there is no RIGHT and WRONG in playing your class, and everyone will do their thing and opinions may vary.<br />
<br />
But that never stops me from thinking, am I doing all I can do to be a good shaman? Have I heard all the opinions I need to hear to decide how best to serve my group, my guild, and myself? I always have to say no.<br />
<br />
You see how often do you group with OTHER shaman? Me not so much. I hardly ever see other shaman and when I do it is a guild mate for the most part, and at times I find people might be more inclined to say &quot;hey do your thing&quot; rather than say.. &quot;Hey man why do you wait for a mob to be at 95% health to slow sometimes, but other times you do it at 90%&quot; Sometimes of course I do it right away. It depends on the puller, it depends on the mobs, and it depends on the group. Frankly it depends on me and what I have decided is appropriate for that situation. <br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
SO here it is, my big plea for your sharing your thoughts, knowledge and insight. I have read the forums, I have played for years, I have asked other shaman their opinion before. But I am asking you know.<br />
<br />
As a level 61 Shaman what do you think...<br />
<br />
What spells are essential in this level range?<br />
What gear is essential? Anything in particular you think no shaman should be without?<br />
What is your basic strategy in groups as a general rule/ Assuming nothing for other classes. What spells do you use first, when?<br />
<br />
Again there is largely opinion here that you can provide, and that's what I seek your opinion on how you play and what you would tell to another shaman who wants to better her/himself.<br />
<br />
Thanks much for any wisdom you can provide. I have read the forums as I have said in the past, but sometimes reading an old post is no substitution for a good discussion.<br />
<br />
Help a fellow Shaman out with your Knowledge, and in turn maybe other Shaman as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Turgur's Insects<br />
<br />
2) Anything that keeps you alive<br />
<br />
3) (Talking mostly LDON here)  Really, as far as basic strategy, mine depends on the group makeup.  At 65, most times I try to slow right off - if it bounces, then I use Malos, and try to reslow (other than nameds - I Malos them first).  If I have a competent group, then the cleric knows enough not to heal me when I'm using Canni, and to heal me when mobs are beating on me.  The only time I use another spell first, is if I'm pulling - sometimes I'll root one, so I'll get a smaller pull.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a competent tank, then you might need to run beside them, or wait for them to get good aggro, before you can slow - otherwise the mob will be running all over.  Lower chances of this with a Pally or SK tank, although the melee changes should help warriors on this.<br />
<br />
After that, it depends on the situations &amp; groups...  Poison dots for slower DPS groups, nukes/rains in fast.  Pet, if I'm not pulling.  Root, almost always, unless we're mezzing - and if I offroot one, then I always try to stick a dot or two on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1.  Torpor &amp; Malo<br />
2.  Epic, Veilous quest armor, Ornate armor, LDoN armor.  Hit point gear.<br />
3.  Use the malo-line on mobs inc, then slow.  You are not a primary healer, don't let others make you believe different.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) Turgur's, Malo(sini), Torpor, Khura's Focusing, Canni 4, yer pet (alpha'd)<br />
2) Epic, Tae Ew armor and Velious quest gear, Ornate gear, bazaar deals.  Go for +hp +mana +sta +FT +wis +ac +resists +regen gear.<br />
3) In PoP and LDoN, which is the primary exp places these days, you need to debuff quickly.  Take a few hits if you have to.  I Malo(sinia) and slow asap.  Paladins/SKs won't lose agro if they know what they're doin.  I slow early even with warriors and let the mob hit me a few times until the warrior gets agro.  After that, make sure groupmates have necessary buffs, heal during emergencies or when the main healers are LoM... nuke, DoT, etc...<br />
<br />
When ya get real good, you can do some pretty neat stuff.  A few days ago I was the main tank/slower/healer for my PoV group.  Slowed on inc, DoTed and Crippled, and Torpor'd/Tnarg'd myself until we got 'em dead.  Non-stop pulls for an hour.  It's just a matter of getting a feel for what you're capable of, and never limiting yourself, even if your gear is limited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excellent. Thanks much for the adivce guys I think I am on par with the suggestions thus far, I do see however I am needing to spend money on a few spells. Malo namely is 20k on my server if it is even avilable (seen it once in two weeks)<br />
<br />
I have not yet tried tanking using the tactics mentioned above though I do want to once the spells are in my grasp.<br />
<br />
What is the basic line of thought on Bear form? I find myself using it in situations where I am either without KEI, or when I feel liek it. Is this something you have on all the tiem for the added regen and wisdom? I mean it makes sense that we would I guess.. but what is the current mindset on this? Does it matter THAT much?<br />
<br />
You can view my item set up below, I don't think I am too terrible when it comes to items, but hey maybe I am .. who knows!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think what you are missing the most in your current gear is an item with mana cost reduction.<br />
<br />
But the main question is this:<br />
Do you plan on racing to 65 or do you plan on a slow path?<br />
If you go fast skip malo/torpor and buy Malos/Q<br />
Get Tnargs<br />
Work on some LDoN to get FT (and if you can get a good group do hard missions for the drops)<br />
<br />
And gear wise:<br />
Go for HP till you feel save in the groups you have, then go for FT/focus items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If nothing else you need Torpor and Malo, no question. If you like to solo, the 61 pet spell is an absolute must. Focus is also important.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I would be looking to try to finish your epic - there is nothing in shammy epic that cannot be accomplished with a single well balanced group of 60 - 65 players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It really depends on what you do most.  If you raid a lot, Torpor isn't all that important, but it's nice.  Level is more important for raiders, so race to 65 as quickly as you can and get Quiescence, THAT is a useful spell on raids.  Ditto with Malo/Malos... get the level 65 version instead of blowing 20k on a spell you won't use much, if at all, after getting the upgrade.<br />
<br />
If you mostly LDON, Tigir's Insects is a great second slow to have loaded.  Slow a big pull on inc with that and it makes it manageable while you get Turgur's in on everything.  Wish we had an AE malo.  I don't use DOTs in LDON, DD all the way (of course, I don't have Bane yet, either).  In general I don't cripple unless the mob rampages.<br />
<br />
Get an Improved Healing IV item (like ornate sleeves) and ignore your mini-CH in favor of your blast heal(s).  Tnarg's has a 3-second cast time compared to 10 seconds for Kragg's, is only 50 mana more to cast than Kragg's, and with IH4 heals around 1430 average.  In situations where I'm the backup healer Kragg's is useless... if the cleric's CH isn't gonna land, I don't have time to cast mine either.  I use Quiescence if I have plenty of time, Tnarg's if it's an emergency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) turgur's, MalXXXX, greater immobilise (any root series, and/or get the VP AA), spot heal, HoT (ie: torpor/Q), and Cann4<br />
2) What Cush said, &quot;anything that keeps you alive&quot; focus on HP/AC gear.<br />
3) depends where you hunt, but in LDoN I don't bother with Malos.  I load 2 slows (usually Turgur's and Tigir's (yes, AE slow)) and chain slow till it lands.  The reason for AE slow IMHO is taking down multi pulls, helps a TON and the cleric (when we play with one) ends up meleeing/nuking because he's got so much mana.  Keeping a root up is handy, even with VP to handle all the aggro I generate with chain slowing.  I slow everything, root whatever aggros on me and back off to Q myself.  Then factoring in mana spent on resists and self heals, I cast Bane on the mob with the highest aggro on me and Nuke whatever mob the MA has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Must have spells?  Turgur's, Tnarg's  and Focus.  This are the minimum needed to do your job in a group. Torpor and Malo are strong additions but I would not put them in must have catagory.<br />
<br />
Gear: whatever it takes to get AT LEAST 900 AC and 2500 HP self buffed. Tae Ew chain is probably the best value for the plat if you are buying it.<br />
<br />
Tactics: one thing not mentioned yet is working with a chanter.  We could write a book on this one.  Splitting adds for easy targeting, malise and slow the mezzed mobs to draw aggro in case of mez breaks, try to keep track of which mob is about to break mez or has been mezzed multiple times -- these will require extra debuffs of maybe a root to keep it off the chanter. Shamans and chanters have overlapping duties but we also mesh so well.<br />
<br />
Another point of advice: if you have canni 5, keep an eye on Virtue and know when it wears off. :eek: <br />
<br />
Bear form is any time I can not have a mount ... usually.  I'll click it off if I need to slam but if it comes to me having to slam then we are in a piss poor situation and something has to change. A couple of points of health regen is never a bad thing and the extra WIS is -- well, it's free.  But all in all, I just like looking like a bear in groups.  It makes you easy to see and pick out from the crowd of PC's and mobs so people tend to follow you for that reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Okay.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot I really appreciate the advice guys.<br />
<br />
I am at the Hole portion of the epic so that is next on my agenda. Will be working on the suggested spells items in the meantime.</div></div><hr />
