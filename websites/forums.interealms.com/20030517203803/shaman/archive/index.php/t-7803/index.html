<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Salilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 54 shammy.. desperate to hit 55 soon.  I am looking for fun places to solo... as well as places where it will be easy to get good groups.  I have grown bored with the Ice giants and KC...   Any suggestions will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chardok.  Entrance and exit and lev tunnel camps are good for 51+ shaman, some of it is even soloable. There were tons of posts on this in the hunting sections for 50-60.  Use the search feature to dig this up.<br />
<br />
One place that will pop up is the entrance to the Hole, doubltess the best solo exp I saw for any camp in the 54 lvl range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Head to the moon!  I've solo'd and grouped in Maiden's Eye and The Grey, and grouped in Umbral Plains.  The mobs tend to have a lot more hps here so I've found it more effecient to group.   If you prefer the old world mobs, Sebilis is also a nice place to group.  There are some really nice drops here.  Only advice I'd give for Sebilis is get with a group you trust.  Twice now I've been burned by commie looting clerics gating out with all the loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Scarlet Desert is another place on the moon worth looking up. It is not nearly as dangerous as Maiden's Eye and I've spent a lot of time there before PoP came out. City of Mist is said to be easy to solo but a lot of stuff may be lt blue at 54. If you want raw exp though head to the planes. The generic group make up in the new planes requires a Chealer, a slower and a mezzer. So finding a group should not be a problem.  On a good day you can walk out with several yellow in xp maybe even a whole lvl depending on how long you stay. On a bad day the planes can be endless frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hole is great solo exp. First 13 entrance mobs are soloable at 54, and by the time you kill the last one its only 1/2 mins to the repop of the first one... so you get a nice cycle going</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aracane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umbral Plains seems to be a good spot , nice group exp and slowers are a must.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with whoever said the Hole - get a good group of friends and you can spend weeks exploring this zone :)<br />
<br />
The xp is still good at 59 (not as good as PoP though), and the loot is tolerable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm I misread the original question, sorry - The Hole is probably not a great place to find pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rockhoppers in DSP got me through 54 in three days.  (I was playing like a madman to get to 55 so I could join my guild in ToV).</div></div><hr />
