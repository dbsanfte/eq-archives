<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, young shaman here, that has spent the most part of his time soloing.<br />
<br />
I'm lvl31, and working backwards, I hope to regain lvl32 soon (damn resists).<br />
<br />
Anyway, thought I'd ask a few qeustions.<br />
<br />
1)  Soloing, I normally pull with a Slow.  But now that I'm high enough lvl to group with my brother in-law (he plays a lvl33 Paladin) I'm finding that slow sometimes is useless.  In order to take advantage of his Undead spells we're currently fighting in the Tower of Unfrozen Shadow.  Most times, by the time I get a slow to stick the ghost and such are 50% or less health.  Should I bother?<br />
<br />
2)  Soloing pre-lvl34, I know it's dangerous.  But are there any tips?  Like I said, I normally pull with a slow, then run back to fight spot.  Turn around and try to root.  Once I get root to land, back up and EB and Affliction.   Then of course I try to keep it rooted until these have a little time to work.  After I apply my second EB, I normally throw in a nuke and let Root break and melee mob to death (normally there around 40% health when I throw out a nuke).  Anything I'm missing?<br />
<br />
3)  When my brother in-law isn't on, I'm trying to slowly de-lvl - err, I mean, lvl by soloing in Iceclad.  Cougars and Shadow Gaurdians.  Died twice to Shadow Gaurdians so I gave up on them.  I ran into a lvl34 BL at the Gnome Igloos that basically told me the reason I was having such bad luck was I was to low lvl for these.  Should I try something else for awhile?  When do Cougars become more mana-efficient?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />
<br />
Oh, and any equipment recommendations, please let me know.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

They don't hit for much and pre Luclin they had the best HP/XP ratio of any mob around your level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) If your bother is going to whoop ass like that i wouldn't cast slow on em.  Just a waste of mana.  Save it for heals or dots.<br />
<br />
2) Root and rot worked best for me if I remember.  Root the MoB, desease DoT it,  Poison DoT it, reapply root when needed.  It's mana intensive but it works pretty well.  You dont melee much but once you get dogdog you will be meleeing alot.  Understnad that using this will mean that you will fall behind alittle whith the defense cap but you said you wanted to lvl. <br />
<br />
3) Grats to you for trying to hunt outside the usual lvling places i.e. LoIo or HHK.  Cougers at around 35 I think.  I think Luclin has a nice mid lvl zone.  Sk isnt too bad now that everyone goes to LoIo.  Upper Guk maybe, or Lower Guk with a group.  Spectres could be good in Oasis.  Frontier Mountains is usually farmed but you can get some good loot for your lvl there ex. Forest Loop.<br />
