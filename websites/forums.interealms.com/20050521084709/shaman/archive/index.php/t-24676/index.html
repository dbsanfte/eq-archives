<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So after reading that Grim and Glor somehow got Rtytan to promise innate DW and a 4k hp pet at the fan faire (did one of you run interference while the other kicked him in the coin purse until he conceded?) I started thinking that it would be really nice if we had some sort of way that we as a community could reward those who make large contributions to it.  Not just small contributions, I mean like &quot;they've spend as much time helping the community as some people spend raising children&quot; kind of contributions.  People like Glor and Sunmoon are who I really have in mind, but other possible candidates might be Belgar (old shaman website guy), Sammana (new shaman website guy), or Grimbear in a few years (so far he has been awesome, but I envision this as more of a long-term achievement award kind of deal).<br />
<br />
But then I realized this idea had two problems:<br />
1) How do we determine who deserves this reward without it becoming  some retarded popularity contest or flame fest?<br />
2) What the heck do you give people who probably already have whatever droppable items they might want in-game, as well as a custom title (the only real forum reward one can get)?<br />
<br />
Like any good shaman, I have enough wisdom to know that these people deserve something special, but not enough intelligence to work out the details.  Still, I wanted to get the ball rolling, so here were my thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) If someone felt that a person deserved this &quot;Shaman Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; or whatever, they would nominate them by creating a poll saying yay or nay, and the first post on the poll would explain why this person deserves the award.  This person could not have any RL relation to the nominee (no husbands nominating wives or empployees nominating their bosses or anything), and they would have to coordinate the reward effort if the person won.  Then, if the nominee got a really large number of positive votes (I'm thinking 100-200 more yays than nays) and a moderator can confirm that they aren't all coming from recently created accounts with no postcount, then the person get's added to a thread in the Medicine Cabinet called &quot;badass mofo shaman&quot; or something, and they get whatever reward we come up with.  The advantage of doing things this way would be that voting is annonymous, but people can still debate the nomination (in the poll thread).<br />
<br />
2)  One idea I had for a reward was a custom t-shirt (we could all pool a few bucks to have them made).  It could have their name, character pic (either a SS or custom art), plus their Crucible title and some additional title like Shaman among Shaman (or is it Shamens ...;) ).  Or we could just steal Glor's title (&quot;a tribute to the class&quot;) and use it for all of them.  We could either have these shirts done by a pro (I am sure there are places on the 'net that could do this sort of thing for $30-$40 per shirt, maybe even less) or use one of those deals where you print out a transfer and iron it on to a shirt.  Either way, the reward would be affordable enough that 10 people donating $5 each could cover the costs for each winner.<br />
<br />
An alternative idea I had was that we could commission some custom character artwork for these people.  This could just be a new signature pic or magelo background, but I figured many people already like their current ones, so I was thinking maybe we could have a single picture, which we update with each new achiever, that looks like one of those comic book super-team portrait kinda deals (y'know, the ones with the heroes all standing in a row striking some sort of cool pose, maybe on Greek columns or something).  If we did this, then the pic could be put at the head of the thread in the Medicine Cabinet, and maybe somewhere on the webpage too.  The advantage of this plan is that there is less work to go through in the real world: you'd just need to collect the money, send it to the artist of the person's choice along with the main picture and tell them to go to town but not add more than X pixels of width.<br />
<br />
The idea behind both these rewards is that they wouldn't be anything too huge, but they would both be something that makes the rewardee feel special and like all their effort has been appreciated.  If we went with t-shirts, then they'd be able to wear them to fan faires (or down to the grocery store, whatever floats their boat) and strut around with pride.  And if we do the portrait deal, then they would have a public symobol of their accomplishment, which they could show off to all their friends (EQ or otherwise).<br />
<br />
If we wanted to go all out, we could even combine the two ideas: add them to the portrait, then send them a t-shirt with the new portrait picture on it.  But while I think these people deserve some special kudos, I want to keep the price down so that it never becomes prohibitively expensive to reward someone.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, this is all just sort of in the pipe dream stage for me, so please feel free to shred the idea to ribbons.  But I'd really like constructive criticism, because while I don't know what form it will take, I really do think that there should be some way for our community to recognize the incredible contributions that a few individuals have made to improve things for all of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that it sounds like a nice idea, but would be impossible to implement in any meaningful and practicable way. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

Dude, no offense, but the day I'm seen in public with an EQ t-shirt on will be around the same time Satan dons a parka.<br />
<br />
Nothing says &quot;Woman repellant&quot; like ANY piece of clothing that even hints of the internet.  <br />
<br />
Let's just Bronze Glori (figuratively) and Sunmoon, the dude who originally had this site, Sam, Eduin, Tudamorf, Talamay and Nixx, buy a cyber-6 pack for Mill, a lap dance for me and call it a day.<br />
<br />
Get Valgoth some dog food, the liberals a clue, a copy of &quot;Elements of Style&quot; for TEH 1337 DEWD posters, Litgruv, Laughing, Grup, Krup and all the folks who suffered through three years of Sony indifference towards this class (benign neglect perhaps) a loud &quot;Huzzah&quot; and leave with our dignity.<br />
<br />
And trust me on this - a t-shirt with www. anything on it does not scream &quot;dignity.&quot;  It screams 'something' but it ain't dignity.<br />
<br />
Or as somebody much wiser than me once said (in reference to EQ), <br />
<br />
&quot;One day we're all gonna look back on this and laugh - nervously.&quot;</div></div><hr />
