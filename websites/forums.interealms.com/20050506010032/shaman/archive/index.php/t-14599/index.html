<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there any websites dedicated to 2-boxers?  I tried a search but did not find anything concerning websites for 2-boxers.  I enjoy 2 boxing and want to chat with others that do without getting flamed.  Thank you for any information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why would you get flamed?<br />
<br />
Though perhaps if you managed to work in something about CHA affecting two-boxing skills...  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like to know if there are any 2 box websites out there myself. I've been 2 boxing for over a year (actually use eqw and 1 box) and still think that theres alot I need to know/could use. I find that most groups I'm in don't even know I dual box unless I tell them but I know that I could be more effecient. As a dual boxer using eqw I can't effectively canni and keep my ranger on the target alot of times like I would like to and it would be nice to know if theres a way to fix this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Interesting little tool here: http://www.xylobot.com lets you tell commands to the other char including which spell to mem, when to heal, what spells to cast all with a /tell.  Though Sony doesn't want you to use 3rd party programs, just use this with WC3 :p.  I could never get this thing figured out so don't ask. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I 4 box, so a site for just 2 boxing is useless to me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have played up to 5 chars at once, but it just isn't that much fun to me since it is harder to chat. Lately I've been running 2 or 3 which is not to hard, ussually SK / Shm / dru, or SK / SHM / bard. There is not much you can be taught about 2+boxing, just do it and make your own style as you go. I have never been big on using bot programs, but I can see them making life much easier if I was going to run a full group often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">3-boxer here. It's all matter of personal style I guess. Only macro I use, is /assist key and all tied off my monk. <br />
<br />
It's fun having people give me grief over it, then watching them die off, as Me Myself &amp; I finish my mobs and their train as well...more so when they start asking me for a Rezz, which might explain something.<br />
<br />
Monk(63)/Shaman(63)/Druid(63) btw *wink*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I 2 box also and any new info would be appreciated - can always learn something new!<br />
I have an assist key that - assists my other guy, casts slow and sends dog - all by pushing 6 once.<br />
Have been having fun lately pl a Wizzard - he is harder to set up statedgy for than was my warrior, druid, and sk - but I am getting the hang of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've got the same hotkey grick. I also use the F-keys for healing and stuff like you would in a normal group. 2 boxing isn't to difficult, i just suck at keeping the ranger on the mob since the damn wolf pushes mobs all over the damn place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same problem using eqwindows with a ranger and cleric. Remap the toggle target key - it defaults to 'tab'.<br />
<br />
I sometimes 3 box (currently mage, ranger and high level cleric). I use EQW on 1 box for mage/ranger and a 2nd pc for cleric, all hot keyed up to heal. Cleric has 'hide' which is very useful to.<br />
<br />
I've also played shaman/monk/druid and chanter/druid (did that one a lot using charmed pets).<br />
