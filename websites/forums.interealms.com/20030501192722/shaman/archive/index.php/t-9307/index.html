When I think &quot; 4-0 &quot; it's usually a Malt Liquor.</div></div><hr />

At least we seem to be doing well in Rugby atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was talking about the 4th Test of the Ashes Series, or the &quot;boxing day test&quot; in Melbourne, Australia v England.<br />
<br />
The current score is:<br />
<br />
Australia 6/551 dec &amp; 0/8<br />
England 270 &amp; 387<br />
<br />
Australia trails by 99 run with 10 wickets in hand, and one day to play. Australia leads the series 4 matches to 0 and if we win tomorrow, it will make it 4-0, on the way to 5-0 in Sydney next week.<br />
<br />
BTW, i am talking about cricket :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah cricket. Who gives a flying sheep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The current score is: <br />

Translate for those of us across the pond?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coralis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">6/551 Dec  - means 6 men out and 551 runs scored.  Dec means 'Declared' - The Aussies decided to end their innings before all their players were out, as they had scored enough runs.<br />
<br />
England 270 runs scored and all players out and 387 runs/all out.  <br />
<br />
Cricket has 10 outs to an innings, and 2 innings for each team in a game.  Each batsman (read batter in baseball for that) stays in until they are out.. and scores runs by running up and down a 22 yard pitch.<br />
<br />
It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the general idea!<br />
<br />
Test matches can last 5 days, and it can still be a drawn game after that!<br />
<br />
BTW - The Aussies did win, and are 4-0 up in the 5 game series.  They are the best team in the world though!<br />
<br />
/em Grumble's about the bad state of English cricket :(</div></div><hr />
