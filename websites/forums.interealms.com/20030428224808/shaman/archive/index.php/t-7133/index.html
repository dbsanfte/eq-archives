<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i think the thread itself has run its course. alot of great ideas in there. My idea is this ...<br />
<br />
Take the &quot;reasonable&quot; ideas expressed in the thread and post them in a new thread and sticky it to the top.<br />
<br />
name it  &quot;Voice of the Shaman&quot; or some ****e . this way we have a 1 post thread that is locked stating the things we want. Locked is imported , no more talk . a simple representation of , for the most part, the things we all want.<br />
<br />
This way when VI comes in they dont have to read anything but 1 simple and reasonable post on the things we as shaman desire.<br />
<br />
Just a thought ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Someone remove the post count from being visible please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, please do. Spam spam spam! Nothing personal Litgruv, I also dislike people who spam /ooc and /shout. I hate putting people on /ignore, but you're headed there really fast - stop spamming, p l e a s e.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">eh ?<br />
<br />
What , someone cant post here alot ?<br />
Put me on ingore , please.<br />
<br />
Im at work, i have nothing better to do right now then read forums and reply back.<br />
<br />
I dont post and go<br />
<br />
POST COUNT  +++ BABY<br />
i couldnt give a rats ass about my post count , so if neither of you have somehting productive to add to this thread.<br />
<br />
door ----&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, maybe it's time to get a new job where you actually work? Yes, it's allowed to post here a lot, even about pointless things (which is why you're headed for ignore). What I'm saying is that you seem to post here because you simply because you're bored at work and need something to pass the time, so you come here in search of smalltalk. Go to a chat room. I *know* I'm not the only one who's tired of seeing you spam the forums with pointless chitchat. I realise that you don't give a good g*d d*mn about being on mine, I just wanted to let you know that you just might be headed for the ignore list of some people who actually have something to say. <br />
<br />
And for crying out loud, change that stupid sig and get a haircut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im sorry you are bitter and feel that way. Add me to your ignore list then, im not changing what i do or how i do it . ive met and made alot of friends here that send me tells in game to tell me how much they enjoy my posts.<br />
<br />
my advice would be for you to stay into your own thing and stay out of mine. topic with me and you and our firend up there is over. Have a nice day<br />
<br />
/embraces your ignore list<br />
<br />
Back to topic. i think this is a good idea still :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good thing you have those people to validate you, Lit. Aaaah, this will be like the time Yahoo finally added a spam filter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok , first off , let me appoligize for responding to your attack that way. It was kinda childish and misrepresents me i feel. So 1 last post to address this issue.<br />
<br />
I do not &quot;spam&quot; these boards. I DO post alot , sometimes they are silly , sometimes they arent shaman related ,but if all we talked about shaman 100% you have to admit it would be boring after a while. <br />
<br />
Im sorry you feel the way you do and cant take the good in me with what you feel is the &quot;bad&quot;. I &quot;feel&quot; i occasionaly have some good tips and opinions. I do not claim to be god of shaman knowledge , i dont even claim to be supa uba with tons of knowledge. I come here to learn and if im lucky i get to teach to once in a while.<br />
<br />
It seriously saddens me to see a fellow shaman feeling this way especialy when i feel its incorrect. I can only echo what was in the other post . I cant be who i am not spiritabe. Simply dont read the threads/replies if you cant take me. Put me on ignore if thats what you desire. /shrugs<br />
<br />
Sorry i never got the chance to know you and never will simply cause of the amount that i post here.<br />
Peace to you and i wish you well. seriously.<br />
<br />
Please dont turn this topic into me. I think this is a seriously descent idea. Which is why i posted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grand Shaman project still has its uses.<br />
<br />
and to continue the 'theme' of this thread:<br />
<br />
+1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">naa , not saying it has no use . ofcourse it does. to me its become a database of info on all the things we all want. I was just thinking , that its a lil abstract. If it was compiled into a short 10-20 list of things we might have a better chance of getting some things. Making it very clear the things that will make us happy instead of them having to wade through all that.<br />
<br />
Was just a thought /shrugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I happen to agree with Litgruv on this one- I think it would be a good thing to have a semi-permanent thread outlining the general consensus of this board as far as what we'd like to see for the class.  Kind of a &quot;if you're only checking these boards once a month, look here first&quot; synopsis for the devs, newbs to the board, or visitors from other classes.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;you post too much&quot; stuff... just because someone posts a lot doesn't mean they don't have the occasional good idea.  I seem to remember &quot;The Grand Shaman Project&quot; was proposed by Lit before Land took it over... but somehow no one took it seriously when Lit posted it- because it was Lit posting it.  Kind of silly, if you ask me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, Litgruv was also the person who didn't know what PE was (and posted a thread about it rather than just looking it up).  He also admitted to having very limited raid experience after he was berated for posting his Magelo.<br />
<br />
It's kind-of hard to take class balancing advice from someone who doesn't even know what our spells do.<br />
<br />
Good luck finding one thing that shaman agree on, let alone a list of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, but at least he's apparantly trying to improve whatever perceived deficiencies there are,and has asked some interesting questions.  Many shaman here just seem to lurk, uncloak to post a troll or a flame, and recloak.  Come out of lurk to troll some more.<br />
<br />
/agree Megumi.  We're likely the most fractious class in the game.  Shaman seem to be supremely self-confident, don't we?<br />
<br />
And one other thing, out o'sheer curiosity:  Abe, how is your sig better?  Aside from a half-naked Britney Spears, evidently...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whoa, let's not get into an ugly slander-fight here. My point with Lit was not against his personality, rather that he should maybe consider if posting so much - sometimes about subjects with no connection to the shaman community - could annoy some people like they got on my nerves. He's on my ignore list ATM, and as he said it's your choice. I didn't write my previous posts to bash him personally, just to point out that he was annoying some people.<br />
I'm sure Lit is a very nice guy RL and in game as well, so please let's keep it clean gentlemen :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Shandy posted while I was typing this. My sig owns all, because Britney &gt; All ;) <br />
Yes, it's a joke and my trademark (/gsay By the power of Britney, I torpor thee &lt; %t &gt;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ROFL!<br />
<br />
I find it actually quite humorous of someone to spam a thread with complaints about someone spamming the boards... talk about irony...or is that hypocrisy? Whichever...<br />
<br />
I enjoy being able to spend all day on the boards from work. My job is that GOOD, not bad. ;) Jealous you can't? hehehe<br />
<br />
Next subject in this multi-level thread... :)<br />
<br />
Magelo profiles, experience, or lack thereof, on raids, etc.:<br />
<br />
Uninformed?:<br />
<br />
I apparently missed the issue with not knowing what PE is, but then, a month ago, I didn't know what the hell it was...and still don't have it. If he was given a tongue lashing instead of taught, then SHAME ON EACH AND EVERY SO-CALLED &quot;LUMINARY&quot; HERE! You're a pathetic disgrace to the ideals of the class! Now, if he was helped, or straightened out and helped, then I take it back. :D<br />
<br />
Lack of raid experience:<br />
<br />
Not everyone, from the moment they log on their newbie_level_01 shaman, can jump right on in and raid places like VT, Emp Seru, Ssra, etc. Shamans, above and beyond being mystics and seers of the spirits, they are also supposed to be teachers, not *******s with a god complex. Leave that for...I won't say it... Someone makes an idiot remark, teach them the error of their ways. Simple. :)<br />
<br />
Magelo?!:<br />
<br />
***?! Are you all shaman or egocentric necros?! Bashing someone for the gear they have in their Magelo?! That's worse than tacky...that's pathetic. I don't have much decent gear in mine, either... I have a small circle of friends, and a small, but fun guild. I don't have access to the ub3r 1337 **** y'all may have, but you'd just be a pathetic, worthless worm to insult me for it.<br />
<br />
Now...if any of what I said pisses you off, chances are that's guilt tuggin' at your flame cords... Those that the above doesn't apply to have no reason to feel &quot;attacked&quot;. If there's any misrepresentation there, unbiased opinion of misrepresentation, I'll reiterate my apologies...<br />
<br />
As to trolls, lurkers, etc...<br />
<br />
I've been called a troll once or twice. I guess it's because I'm opinionated, and stubborn when it comes to my beliefs, and I'm not ashamed to speak my beliefs... That's not being a troll. I don't post to try to get a flame war going...THAT would be trolling. I'm posting my stubborn opinion on an issue, as well as my opinions on other things being said. When I feel strongly correct in my opinion, I express it. <br />
<br />
If we all have to be sugar-coated lemmings, let's just shut down every damned message board having to do with EQ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/em uncloaks<br />
<br />
I'm watching this thread for clues to how people generally feel about it.  The GSP has been a &quot;work in progress&quot; and I admit much of the final posted stuff (page one, post one) took a lot of selective choosing and is probably biased a bit towards what I thought was both reasonable and popular.  <br />
Fact remains however, the points outlined in the GSP haven't been officially voted on.  I'm tempted to post about 30 polls and make people vote yes/no on each subject.  But that would be spamming in the worst sort of way, even if it is for a good cause.  <br />
<br />
Unless people want me (or someone else i guess) to post those polls, perhaps 5 a week or something to keep down the spammage.  I dunno, I'll do it if you think it's necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lan, I think what's posted is about as close to consensus as this board is ever likely to get.  I have no complaints about the thread, and have been very happy to see the few concerns I have get addressed by others.<br />
<br />
Abe, hilarious!  I can just see it now.  There MUST be something about a half naked Britney Spears that's magical:  my teenage son certainly slows down for about 18-24 seconds when he sees a pic of her, then suddenly seems much happier...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Landragoran,<br />

<br />
Nice echo of somone elses words. please think for yourself and be orignal if you wanna insult me k?<br />
<br />
PE is a effect off a weapon , our spell is Avatar or  Primal Avatar , so if you wanna tell me how uninformed i am please get your facts correct. Im sorry if im not raiding the very highest end of the game and that i didnt know that effect on that hammer, but if you think at level 60 STILL i cant possibly have a remote clue about ideas for our class , then neither do you. period.<br />
<br />
As far as finding things all shaman agree upon ...<br />
<br />
I have faith in us , unlike you , i see many things said over and over again in that thread and i see no reason why they cant be compiled and placed in a neat and orderly fashion so they can see it.<br />
If you cant be positive to me, then kindly place me on ignore like the other shaman that doesnt know me did and have a nice day. We will bolth be happier.<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The other option is just give him 1000+ posts so he can have his custom title and shut the hell up.  I'm glad to see I'm not the only one that noticed his constant barrage of useless and misinformed crap.  And please Litgruv, call me ignorant and post a link from dictionary.com again, very original.  Here's one for you, since you seem to understand it: <br />
<br />
si·lence   Pronunciation Key  (slns)<br />

Refusal or failure to speak out. <br />

posting twice now makes me bad .<br />
<br />
<br />
You know what , i dont know alot . In the same respect i do. <br />
<br />
I try.  I do my best to help us and some of the things i do turn into good things  , if you cant see the results of some of my threads around here , then your blind . Period.<br />
<br />
I dont sit on my ass and complain in a lil thread and never do anything about it , i stand up to help you/me and everyone in the best ways i know how. IM not the voice of the shaman , im not uber , I NEVER CLAIMED TO BE ROFL . So you flaming me for NOT being uber is hilarious to me cause i know im not. Anyone remember a thread i posted about being a gimp ? ;)<br />
<br />
So the next time you rip someone down , take a look at what you do around here and see if you still feel uber enough to **** all over me.<br />
<br />
thnx for ruining a thread that could have been something useful for us. <br />
<br />
im done with this ****e and people that got NOTHING productive or useful to do or say. Have fun flaming ...<br />
im going back to try to be productive and positive for us  :p<br />
<br />
<br />
peace ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm not flaming you for not being uber, I'm flaming you for being ignorant (uneducated, not unintelligent) and still posting constantly, if you don't know for sure, don't post it as such.  And, if you aren't sure, maybe you shouldn't post so damn much.  Your original attempt for a GSP was hijacked and Land started one that's working, I realize some of your threads have useful information.  It should not however take you 900+ posts to start one useful thread.  If you haven't noticed two of your recent posts got booted to here for being completely useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im moving on , if you wanna flame me , or follow me into threads to one up me ( not that you are , ive been on other forums is all) then whatever.<br />
<br />
Id like to just bury the hatchet. I hate arguing to begin with , i truly hate that its being done here of all places.  All i wanna do is help you and everyone here. this stuff about my post cound heh , im not posting to get a title.  I didnt evne know there was a title thing at 1k i thought you had to be friend with the mods or something.<br />
<br />
Anyway....<br />
