<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm no Shaman expert but you have too mcuh wis gear and not enough HP/AC, main thing is get some new rings, perhaps velium fire wedding rings 6ac 65hp or better seeing as you can get some really good ones at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 Velium Fire Wedding rings (or, one VF wedding ring/one Shadel Bandit ring)<br />
<br />
2 Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings.<br />
<br />
A Crystal Spider Eyes.<br />
<br />
Dunno what to suggest for wrists (aside from a JBB, of course).  You've got a 213 WIS and a 105 STA..switch 'em.  If you're OOM, you can canni.  If you're out of health, you're dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Making an assumption on your available plat:<br />
<br />
Sentry bracer, Enshrouded veil, SBS, Earring of Twisted leaves, and just stroll through bazaar by slot looking for gear that is a little heavier on hp/ac.  You have lots of Wis you need to lose to balance your character a bit. :)  <br />
<br />
The upgrades I suggested would run around 2.5k at the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What valrik said, plus...<br />
<br />
enshrouded veil is a usually cheaper alternative to crystal spider eyes<br />
spider fur belt<br />
sarnak battle shield<br />
goranga idol for range<br />
dusty soriz boots or barbed dragonscale if you have a money tree at home<br />
clattering bone necklace<br />
rope bridle<br />
<br />
You in a guild that can farm armor from kael or HoT?  kael really sucks for that, drop rate is abysmal...if you're not in a guild, when you're 55, see about joining a guild that does hot or wtov.  ss/kael armor is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for that guys.<br />
<br />
I will give you an update on my equipment soon.<br />
<br />
What do you think is the average a lvl 53 shaman should have, as far as HP. AC and WIS go?<br />
<br />
I know this differs from person to person, but surely it's possible to give a rough estimate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had like 1500 at 53, but I was still wearing a lot of wis gear then.<br />
<br />
/duck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok<br />
<br />
Ao I bought a Velium Fire Wedding rings and also a Shadel bandit ring.<br />
<br />
My ac has finally gone over 700 unbuffed:) and its got a bit more to go when I finally max out my defense as well.<br />
<br />
I think the next thing I'm gonna buy is the sarnak battle shield. goes for around 900 on Quellious.<br />
<br />
thanks for the advice guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Might wanna work on the Beginner's Magic Manual, too.<br />
<br />
All peices are buyable and you've got a pretty decent Range item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">arms go for cc arms nice ac and some hps and sta<br />
face crystal spider eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">max your defense.<br />
<br />
its free AC, doesn't take up a slot and according to you magelo, you are over 30 pts behind.</div></div><hr />
