<br />
What's the best way to increase my faction in massive amounts?<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead of time.</div></div><hr />

The best place to raise CoV faction is in Kael.  Arena raids are very good for this.  You can also collect storm giant toes (NOT frost giant toes) and giant helms to turn in in SS after you get at least to Dubious.<br />
<br />
All Velious faction work is pretty slow, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best way:  participate in King Tormax kills.<br />
<br />
Remember, there are two factions in SS, Yelinak and Claws of Veeshan.  Kill giants to raise CoV, kill uber giants to raise Yelinak.  Best bet, go to Allakazam's and look up the factions, they have great lists.<br />
<br />
If you need Yelinak, and yours is fubar'd, expect a long boring bunch of faction grinding.  CoV is pretty easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Easy way to check CoV faction without going into Skyshrine (for me) after Kael raids was to run through Wakening Lands on the right wall with invis.  Then, eventually, you'll see a big blue dragon named Rolandal.  Take off invis and con him.  He's on CoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>brett_sc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rolandal was white last time i checked :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rolandal is blue/white ;P<br />
<br />
Vindi kills will get you a full faction level increase.  Ie; you can go from Amiable to Warmly in one hit.  Many raids might let you pop over and smack him one for the faction hit.<br />
<br />
Giant Helm turn ins are also pretty large faction hits.  I think I went all the way through Amiable with 6 helms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the CoV faction gods must hate me... several arena trips, lots of general giant kiling, and one Vindi kill and I am still dubious - turned in 7 giant warrior helmets and am still dubious!   :(  Oh well, back to the arena....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got lucky with my CoV faction. At least, imo, I did. I have helped kill Vindi only once and done a few small Kael raids/pick-up groups and got to kindly with CoV. Tonight, after only a few hours of fighting in Kael (Tormax area, then Arena) I got max ally with CoV. Woot! I am so excited. If you wanna get CoV faction up quickly, help kill Vindi (it seems to me). Usually if some guild is going after him, they'll let you tag him for faction as long as you agree to not do anything that could mess up their strategy. It's worth a shot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did a couple more arena trips and the faction is now up to amiable.  Those giant warrior helmets seem about useless, btw... I turned in 6 more and no change.  I have heard people tell me the helmets made a big difference in their faction; maybe I have just been turning in as I reach the lower end of a faction level and haven't realized it /em shrugs  Anyway, the arena trips have helped the most for me.  Even the Vindi hits haven't been very big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Claymoore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i have gone from max kos to max ally bout 5 times over all heh.. best bet is to solo at bank in kael for a bit and follow up any raids that head in to kill vindi, statue, or KT.. KT is the best hit overall.. vindi isnt that big.. bout equal to id say 45mins or so in arena.. still cuts down the time tho =)</div></div><hr />

In all seriousness, a good Tormax hit is 500 hits to your faction standing, which can bring you up 1 whole standing (IE dubious to apprehensive). Even Vindi is some good hits (50ish? not sure off hand). Barring that, get a pick up group in Kael, the entrances are 1 group doable, and I have seen a well organized group of six handle the bank area (granted they were level 60's and had a monk single pulling). When you get to non KOS turn in a few helms and watch the faction fly.<br />
<br />
Personally I prefer Dorf bowling.....easy kills, turn in the occasional head and go drink some ale with my good pal Tormax :-)</div></div><hr />
