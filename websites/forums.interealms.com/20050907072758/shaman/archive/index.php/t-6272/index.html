<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Download latest firmware</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Linksys Router Firmware (the 4 port, anyhow) (http://www.linksys.com/download/firmware.asp?fwid=1) <br />

I used to fix mine by setting the DMZ to whatever machine I was playing on.  I recently went wireless and now I use a D-Link 4 port + wireless, doesn't happen on that particular router.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinwe Ambersky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If the latest firmware doesn't work downgrade to 1.40.1. I had the same problem a couple of month ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used to get kicked constantly but called up linksys and they helped out.  I really don't remember exactly what they told me to do though.  I would suggest calling them if nothing suggested works.  Now my problem is I go ld every night at almost the exact same time.  It starts around 12:40 and I seem to go ld about another 3 or 4 times within the next 2 hours.  I assumed it was probably my cable provider but could this still be linksys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ugar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had the same problem when i set up my linksys router.  I spoke with the techs and they told me to open all the data ports &gt;1023.  I haven't had any problems since then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Milhouse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Check out this site (http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,4223731~root=equip,16~mode=flat).  I don't have that particular model router but the fix does work on mine.  I believe it's an issue on all Linksys routers (might be wrong about this though).  Not the fix I would like to do but it works.</div></div><hr />
