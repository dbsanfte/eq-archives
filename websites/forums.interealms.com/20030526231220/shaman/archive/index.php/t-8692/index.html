<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It is sad when I visit all these EQ based websites and they ALL assume that you have been playing since EQ's release... how long is a &quot;tick&quot;? I thought a tick was a little hashmark on a health or mana bar... so I am lost... I have been using a DD spell instead of DoTs because it appears to do WAY more damage than something like this:<br />
<br />
30 damage, plus 6 damage per tick for 21 ticks.<br />
<br />
Which tells me nada about what the spell does. Then I was told today about kiting and DoTs being great for that. Please someone help this poor Vah Shir from making stupid decisions instead of &quot;come to me and rot bastard&quot; ones :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Every six seconds is an EQ &quot;tick.&quot;  Mana and hitpoint regen goes up on the &quot;tick&quot; bard song pulses on the &quot;tick&quot; and dots do damage on the &quot;tick.&quot;  The little dreamweaver in your inventory screen will spin on the tick.<br />
<br />
So, in your example (I guess this is the level 19 Affliction?):<br />
<br />
30 damage + 126 (6 x 21) = 156 damage for 75 mana<br />
<br />
Compared to:<br />
<br />
130 damage for 100 mana for the DD spell Ice Strike (level 24)<br />
<br />
You can see that dots are more mana efficient (as long as the mob lives throughout the full duration of the dot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are times you'll want to use nukes though.<br />
<br />
1) a group that is killing things far to fast for your dots to even get halfway done<br />
<br />
2) the trials (where dps is king)<br />
<br />
3) when a monster is about to gate back to its spawn - nuking helps kill it before it does...</div></div><hr />
