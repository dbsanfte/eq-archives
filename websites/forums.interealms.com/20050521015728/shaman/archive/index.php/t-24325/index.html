<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sequi the Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I finally got a hold of a Tattered Cloak of the Fallen (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70183) and was really excited to go try it out. Much to my suprise only some of my spells were effected by the focus...malo, slow, root, disease dot....<br />
<br />
So I went and did the research:<br />
<br />
Affliction of the Dragorn  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6432):<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 15% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(70) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4:  Limit: Effect(Complete Heal (with duration) excluded) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Invunerability excluded) <br />
6:  Limit: Min Duration(48.00 sec) <br />
7:  Limit: Effect(Reaction Radius excluded) <br />
8:  Limit: Combat Skills Not Allowed <br />
<br />
Number 6 is the problem.  Min Duration 48 seconds means the spell has to have a minimum length of 48 seconds.  Still being confused I took a look at what my previous focus item had for requirements.<br />
<br />
Extended Torment IV  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4462&amp;source=Live):<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 10% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Min Duration(24.00 sec) <br />
4:  Limit: Effect(Complete Heal (with duration) excluded) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Charm excluded) <br />
6:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
7:  Limit: Effect(Reaction Radius excluded) <br />
8:  Limit: Combat Skills Not Allowed <br />
<br />
Someone help me here but is that not the same focus effect besides the fact that one has a different duration and one has a different min duration?<br />
<br />
The new focus effect seems sort of worthless to have if all it does is extend one dot and spells that dont really need to be extended already (ie Slow, malo, etc.).<br />
<br />
This needs to be fixed in my opinion so please first of all look at my data, make sure I didnt stay up late and am losing my mind and if you agree that a 48 second duration is wrong and needs to be lowered to stay in line with previous focus effects then /bug /feedback for this to be changed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't think it's a /bug or /feedback issue.  If it were actually &quot;Extend Torment V&quot; then it might be, but it isn't.  There are already numerous focus effects in the game that behave similarly to &quot;standard&quot; ones, but not entirely.  My personal pet peeve is the 8th shawl, which is great in terms of making buffs last longer (20% over the normal 10 or 15% from Extend Enhancement), but unfortunately it doesn't affect Q.  So I either have to wear a seperate EE item for Q, or get a shoulder item with EE and swap the shawl in when I buff, or buy the tribute effect, or something.<br />
<br />
But hey, I have a Velious (well I guess really Luclin) era item that I still use and love, and which used to be better than any raid item.  This way of doing focus effects makes &quot;magic items&quot; more unique, which I think is really cool, and it also makes equipment progression less of an obvious path and more of a personal choice.  ET affects Bane, but AotD affects whatever our 66+ DoT is, so you have a choice of which appeals to you more.  Or if you want to put in the effort to get both, at least this way you gain some benefit that neither one can provide on its own.</div></div><hr />

There were alot of items pushed out in the haste to get expansion out. Lets hope they get fixed sooner rather than later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That was intentional Buzcam. Its a dual purpose effect and I actually like the idea..no need for 2 items for a focus effect. You will notice..some of the items are also DOT dmg increasers and DD increasers with same effect. Whether its actually working is the question but expect it to work both on Beneficial (buffs) and extend your Dots/SLows that are &gt; 48 seconds. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">shame about the cloak :( would have been good<br />
<br />
hopefully there is a focus effect out there to increase the duration of our L66+ curse and poison line of dots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes Claw except the way it is coded, it effects neither cause it is limited to the other type always :(<br />
<br />
You cast a detrimental and the limited to beneficial checks and it does not go off.<br />
<br />

<br />
IT WORKS ON NEITHER.<br />
<br />
They need to either fix it working for both or cancel one so it works with detrimental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The same goes for HoT focus effects.  By doubling the minimum duration required SOE effectively got rid of all HoT extension and DoT extension for spells that run under 7 tics.  I'm not so sure that the new damage foci work with DoTs at all, and if that is the case, they managed to whack Burning Affliction-style effects as well.<br />
<br />
SOE also tossed out the &quot;general&quot; (det/bene) focus effects for mana pres, spell extension, and spell haste.  This was already sort of happening on Time+ gear and SOE finally managed to kill all the great old VT effects, which in many cases were better than anything in EP+, by limiting them to level 65.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just read patch message. /bug /feedback of facade of fright seems to have not worked. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah hulcror drops a simular mask with the same effect and yes it doesn't do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since when has SoE ever put everything that they've done in every patch message.....<br />
<br />
oh.. and the Nadox problem was solved weeks ago.  The problem that the warriors were faced with was a lot worse than our problem.  Their Ghulak spawn used to be on a timer of something like 5 days +/- 12 hours.  So, you had to get really lucky to get it.<br />
<br />
Druids also took forever to solve their epic cause half of the stuff wasn't working correctly, and the half that did work gave them text that made almost no sense.  Basically had to get lucky.</div></div><hr />

The effect on the cloak is a design issue, not something GMs can deal with, so petitioning wont help. You need to contact the devs (through the channels indicated), not the GMs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sequi the Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">With this morning's patch (Oct 25th) it appears they fixed the duration on this affliction line so that it now works on shorter duration spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It was changed to 24 seconds on test about a week ago, so thats not too surprising ;)</div></div><hr />
