<br />
Focus effects have been updated - it looks like Focus IV ones will stop at 65, whereas some of the &quot;named&quot; ones have been updated, eg:<br />
<br />
Fury of Druzzil   <br />
09-07 01:24 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Limit: Max Level(65)&quot; to &quot;Limit: Max Level(67)&quot; <br />
<br />
Marr's Gift   <br />
09-07 01:24 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Limit: Max Level(65)&quot; to &quot;Limit: Max Level(67)&quot; <br />
 <br />
Discordant Disease <br />
09-07 01:24 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Limit: Max Level(65)&quot; to &quot;Limit: Max Level(68)&quot; <br />
 <br />
There have been new focuses added to level 70, including some generic Focus V ones.<br />
<br />
Shaman spell changes:<br />
<br />
* Vindictive spirit has been mentioned on another thread (recourse added)<br />
* Spirit Veil now has the &quot;invis&quot; icon and is now self only and beneficial. No mention of invisibility under the description, but they've been tinkering with other invis spells of late as well. The duration of 10 minutes, plus the self-only bit makes it look very much like a fixed duration invis.<br />
* Our root PH spell has been changed to &quot;Shroud of Erana&quot; - it's a 15 minute self buff with a recourse sounding spell next to it, Shroud of Erana Parry. This was our Malos PH, which now does nothing at all. I'd suggest we'll be getting a similar thing to that druid defensive type spell. <br />
<br />
Then after some small wording changes to other spells and some bits that look like the &quot;Origin&quot; AA spells, there are some new bits.<br />
<br />
Some of them have &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;prophet&quot; or &quot;heyokah&quot; in them, but I'm not sure what they're for - could be AAs, I guess, as they don't currently have classes or levels associated with them. Some of them are listed as &quot;focus effects&quot;, which is pretty straightforward, but others are mysterious.<br />
<br />
For example,<br />
<br />
Krekk's Presence   <br />
Slot Description <br />
12:  Mitigate Melee Damage by 10%, 750 total <br />
Mana: 0 Casting Time: 0 <br />
Recast Time: 0 Fizzle Time: 0 <br />
Location: Any Time of Day: Any <br />
AE Range 60 Interruptable: Yes <br />
Short Buff Box: No Target Type: Group v2 <br />
Spell Type: Beneficial Category: Unknown(-99) <br />
Source: Test 09/07   <br />
  <br />
Classes: None <br />
Duration: 1 min <br />
Autocast: Krekk's Presence Recourse <br />
  <br />
Cast on you: The spirit of Krekk guards you. <br />
Cast on other: Someone is guarded by the spirit of Krekk. <br />
Wears off: The spirit of Krekk fades. <br />
 <br />
The recourse is a self only buff that increases your chance of resisting a spell by 15% for a minute - and there's a similar set of spells with upgraded stats (Kreljnok's Fury).<br />
<br />
And this one:<br />
<br />
Prophet's Gift of the Ruchu  <br />
Slot Description <br />
10:  Critical Damage Mob(70) <br />
11:  Chance to Critical Hit(50) <br />
12:  Increase Hitpoints v2 by 400 per tick <br />
 <br />
Mana: 0 Casting Time: 0 <br />
Recast Time: 0 Fizzle Time: 0 <br />
Location: Any Time of Day: Any <br />
AE Range 60 Interruptable: Yes <br />
Short Buff Box: No Target Type: Group v1 <br />
Spell Type:  Category: Unknown() <br />
Source: Test 09/07   <br />
  <br />
Classes: None <br />
Duration: 1 min <br />
  <br />
Cast on you: The spirit of the Ruchu strengthens you. <br />
Cast on other: Someone is strengthend by the spirit of the Ruchu. <br />
Wears off: The spirit of the Ruchu fades. <br />
 <br />
Note that both of these are group spells - and the duration is reminiscent of melee class disciplines. <br />
<br />
There's also a somewhat amusing spell been added:<br />
<br />
Grace of the Order Strike  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease HP when cast by 250 <br />
2:  Decrease Chance to Avoid Melee by 7% <br />
(duration, 3 ticks)<br />
<br />
Grace of the Order Parry   <br />
Slot Description <br />
6:  Increase Movement by 125% <br />
 <br />
Debuff the mob then run far, far away!  :p <br />
<br />
I doubt it's a shaman spell (name suggests a proc of some sort), but what melee class would want to hit and then leg it?<br />
<br />
After that there are some new cleave type effects, then bits that look like item clickies (mana pool enhancers etc).<br />
 <br />
To sum up - even at this stage, there are still some quite big changes being made. The addition of a defensive type spell for us looks very promising IMO....  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speculation, of course, but maybe the clicky effect on one of the epics?  Or some other class weapons, since there seems to be a large number of new spells with the same effect.  It seems like a lot of the new ones are item click spells and level 70 focus effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Speculation, of course, but maybe the clicky effect on one of the epics? <br />
Bah, can't believe I didn't spot that - during the first epic you become &quot;Heyokah&quot;, so that would fit in perfectly with being a focus effect on the new epic.<br />
<br />
10% hate reduction on nukes and DoTs - not sure how much effect that would have in practice though!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Discordant Disease <br />
09-07 01:24 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Limit: Max Level(65)&quot; to &quot;Limit: Max Level(68)&quot; <br />
 <br />
There have been new focuses added to level 70, including some generic Focus V ones.<br />
This is pretty big for me. It also indicates that a LOT of the focus effects I was concerned about will be extended through lvl 70 spells. Marrs Blessing for example, will almost certainly be extended to lvl 70 (its the upgrade to Marrs Gift, its on a T5 Time item and a couple Gates items). <br />
<br />
I am gonna guess that we will be seeing more and more Named Focus effects extended spell-wise in the coming days before OoW goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also heared focuses will loose 5% per lvl now instead of 10% for every lvl beyond cap now too. Can anyone corfirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Discordant Disease <br />
09-07 01:24 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Limit: Max Level(65)&quot; to &quot;Limit: Max Level(68)&quot; <br />
<br />
Cool, now my shoulders will remain useful on the new DR spell, the one I won't use much ;)<br />
<br />
Discordant Ice is now at 68 cap, which means for our 69 nuke its going to be either 40% or 41% based on rounding, so still solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Either they listened, or a dev finally got a clue.  Regardless, there are steps in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently it looks like VT and earlier named effects stop at L65, as do the Focus IV type generic effects.<br />
<br />
Elemental and Time foci seem to go up to 67 (including Marr's Blessing), whereas the GoD foci go to 68.<br />
<br />
There is a precedent for this, though, as if you check the history for VT level effects (eg Focus of Mediocrity) you'll see they were originally to go to L63, then right at the last minute were changed to L65 for PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Currently it looks like VT and earlier named effects stop at L65, as do the Focus IV type generic effects.<br />
I can live with this. Hate to lose my Crown, but its time to get another item for that focus anyway. Crown has been good to me for a year. <br />
Elemental and Time foci seem to go up to 67 (including Marr's Blessing), whereas the GoD foci go to 68.<br />
I am getting the impression they will change these. Marrs Gift is lower than Marrs Blessing, and not available until Time-Mid-Ikky. Gonna take a guess and go with lvl 69 for Marrs Blessing (and similar upgrades from EP focus effects) since Marrs Gift is 67.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's very doubtful imo. <br />
The GoD foci seem to go up to 68, the chances for *any* PoP(which includes Time) foci to scale up to 69, and thus higher than the newer GoD ones, is rather small</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually the Focus effects that go to 68 doesnt start till Qvic in GoD (even then, some equipment only have 67 focus effects).  Everything before that to elemental planes are 67.</div></div><hr />

I can live with 67 for EP, 68 for Time and some common Gates, 69 for the advanced Gates. Honestly, I can live with 65 for Marrs Gift, 67 for Marrs Blessing, but they shouldnt be the same, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Marr's gift is available on the ring from Silverwing VP quest, so technically is available to everyone who can get into VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jratkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can look at it this way also.  We get a heal at 67, and our next heal is our ancient at lvl 70.  So, according to this if the focus effect effects up to 67, 68 or 69 it really doesnt matter past 67 much.  It will still be useless to our next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Marr's gift being 65 or 67 is kind of a moot point for us, since they bumped our heal from 67 to 68.  I haven't looked at all 3 classes' heals, but does anyone have a heal from 66-67?  Bit of an odd change if not.<br />
<br />
--edit-- <br />
Okay, I must be completely bonkers.  I'd have sworn they moved it from 67-68, but lucy is coming up 67.<br />
...old cache data, nevermind ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Still, it'll only be one level depreciated instead of 3 levels depreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You can look at it this way also.  We get a heal at 67, and our next heal is our ancient at lvl 70.  So, according to this if the focus effect effects up to 67, 68 or 69 it really doesnt matter past 67 much.  It will still be useless to our next one.<br />
<br />
Our new heal is at 68 on Test atm, not 67, but still.  Discordant Healing will not be useless on the level 70 one.  At 5% reduction per level difference its still going to be a 36% focus item.  <br />
<br />
With Discordant Healing:<br />
<br />
Yoppa's Mending @ 40% = 2499 healed for 558 mana or 4.48 hp/mana<br />
Ancient Wilslik's Mending @ 36% = 2672 healed for 585 mana or 4.57 hp/mana.<br />
<br />
So Ancient Wilslik's is still going to be an upgrade with Discordant Healing.  Once we get a 40% OoW focus, it will be 2751 healed for 585 mana or 4.70 hp/mana.   So you are only losing out on a max potential of 79 hp healed by using the Discordant Healing focus.  So it still makes the older focus worth having.   I am pleased with the current changes.</div></div><hr />

Please explain, is the focus change a &quot;dumbing up of the game&quot; or is removing the use of reagents a &quot;dumbing up of the game&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">removing reagents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I seriously don't see how removing an annoyance factor can be seen as dumbing up (are you being sarcastic here, since I was sure it was dumbing down, but English is not my first language).<br />
I'll just decide to be in disagreement, since the cost of the ingredient is trivial, so this is merely an annoyance factor in my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">it is dumbing down... my post was dumb because of what i was commenting on ;) but seriously, why should there be no reagent on such powerful spells? when you can raise hp like that IN ONE CAST, there should be some kind of penalty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">What Tikoko describes is more of a balance issue, personally, I don't think it's a big deal with all the cash in the economy.  That said, it is dumbing down the game because it's more convienient.  Clerics and healer BOTs don't need to remember to stock up on peris anymore.  That's one less thing to differentiate to conscientious cleric from the EBayed healer BOT that was becoming all too common.<br />
<br />
Cleric: my f*****g PC is toast again, gotta reboot.<br />
Shaman: ***?!<br />
Cleric: won't let me cast symbol<br />
Shaman: you just cast insert_spell_here, you should be able to cast symbol ...<br />
Cleric: so?<br />
Shaman: You got peri's right?<br />
Cleric: what?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Removing Regeants hardly has anything to do with dumbing down anything but now that it requires no regeants i still want an explanation why shaman spells have such a damn short duration... why is it we need extended buffs at max level to even reach a cleric or enchanters spell unfocused and un aa'ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">bah removing regeants for my pally is huge. Its so annoyng to get way less time on duration on the buffs and have to use dots too. No group symbal and casting on my friends in full group when using Druid buffs and my symbals was soooo annoying going through 6 dots an hr. I dont see how that is dumbing down the game though? <br />
<br />
 Not like it was a game where casters had to go collect bat wings and guano and lizard eyes and have regeants for every spell they cast. <br />
<br />
It was one very readily available regeant that was really at this time in the game just an annoyance.</div></div><hr />
