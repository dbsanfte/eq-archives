<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know we preach HP and such, but is there a point where some value of AC equals a HPpoint?<br />
<br />
hit points can be looked at as good for being able to take a couple of hits, but most of us view them as an extention of our mana pool.<br />
<br />
at some point tho, you need a bit of AC.  you get aggro for a sec, you get summoned, you, you get the point.<br />
<br />
i guess that if we never got aggro, we would all wear the highest HP / sta / mana gear and not care about AC, but it doesn't really work that way.<br />
<br />
so gimmie some thoughts on AC versus HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of people seem to be comfortable with getting their AC to 1k+ then just getting in as much as HP as possible. Without letting that AC drop below 1000. <br />
<br />
I don't really play by an 1 AC = X HP. Though an item with high AC does attract me, especially if there are HP's with it. <br />
<br />
For now I'm just working on HP as much as I can while still trying to improve AC. I usually look for upgrades that have increases in both those stats. <br />
<br />
For dmg avoidance though I plan on working on Combat Agility in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on what you are fighting.<br />
<br />
In melee combat its a comparison of AC + random vs ATK + random  (**SIMPLIFIED VIEW**)<br />
<br />
This is where the concept of softcaps came from.  It is possible to reach a point where your AC is high enough that the mob hits at minimum frequency or for minimum damage.<br />
<br />
In each expansion the average attack rating of the mobs has gone up, thus a higher AC value is required to hit that sweet spot where you take minimum hits for minimum damage.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It can be very difficult to give stat to stat comparisons because many things in EQ are based on &quot;tiers&quot; not just raw totals.<br />
<br />
Example might be that the difference between 975 and 1000 AC would be more dramatic than the difference between 1025 AC and 1000 AC, even though the point differential is the same.<br />
<br />
This can be pretty easy to measure with something like a resist statistic, its much more difficult with a stat like AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dude, chill.<br />
<br />
Ceno is right; I use the JB BP for the click too.  He wasn't suggesting that you actually wear it.<br />
<br />
The 3 pt DS doesnt do much, but the AC that the proc offers stacks with just about everything, and it lasts about 3 hours.  Plus, its sometimes nice to have the first couple of buff slots filled with something that can replaced easily if you get dispelled.<br />
<br />
Now, onto your question.  The calculation of damage avoidance and mitigation is not a linear function, so there cannot be a hard rule for AC ~ HP conversion.  That is, going from 800 to 900 ac will give you much more mitigation/avoidance than going from 1400 to 1500 ac.<br />
<br />
Given the ac available on most shaman gear, you will likely be best served looking for HP gear first and worrying about AC as a secondary stat, along with wisdom.  As posted above, most gear that has good HP, also has acceptable AC.<br />
<br />
As a general rule of thumb, an unbuffed baseline of 3k HPs, 200 wisdom, and 1k AC is good for a 65 shaman with no AAs, and can be achieved using only droppable or single-group farmable gear (see my magelo).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, I can tell you there has been a bunch of study of this subject on the melee boards.<br />
<br />
Quick summary of findings:<br />
<br />
Pre Pop - Basically 1200ac soft cap for AC - meaning that anything above that was pretty much worthless.  Many studies, pretty much accepted...Did shaman need to be at the full cap and perhaps give up some hit points?  Probably not, thus the 1000 ac and max your hit points mantra you see on this board.<br />
<br />
POP - With the mobs Attack rating rising so was the impact of player AC regarding damage absorption.  Warrior board studies show ac of 2000 still provides increased absorption compared to 1900 ac.  Many studies, pretty much accepted.....Do shaman need to be at or near the cap? Again probably not if you have to give up hit points.  What is POP &quot;sweetspot&quot; for Shaman? Well it certainly it varies according to how much you get smacked around, but the &quot;mantra&quot; on this board from folks who have read the melee boards and adjusted from pre-pop suggest 1200+ with anything over 1500ish probably overkill.  Some peeps still hung on to 1000ac as the mantra even in POP because they did not believe that the damage absorption (even being that far below the soft cap) was worth giving up hit points - which is certainly true if you are not getting beat on too often. But, I for one saw a significant difference from 1000 - 1200 AC and it was not necessary to give up hardly any hps because of the nature of the better armour which had both excllent ac and good hit points.<br />
<br />
LDON - I have not read any studies yet, but just my observations of the mobs hitting for 250-300 lead me to believe that the AC &quot;softcap&quot; in normal LDON is between the pre-pop 1200 and POP 2000+, with my best somewhere aroun 1400-1500ish.<br />
<br />
What does this mean?  Well I for one sincerely believe that shaman who try to max hitpoints while keeping ac at 1000 are not utilizing the most efficient combination of hps and ac for POP, raiding and LDON.  Unless they are super passive shaman and are not getting smacked around at all, I think increased ac is adviseable and actually easy to obtain these days.<br />
<br />
I think that this forum is most valuable to the newly 60-65 shaman who just got Q (or Torpor) and canny5 and is trying to figure out what the heck to do with hps vs ac.  Well my advice would be to get about 3000-3200 hitpoints minimum unbuffed even if that means falling to the 1000 ac mark buffed with virtue (now thats pretty weak AC in my book for pop mobs, but others may disagree).  There is almost no disagreement that there is a significant breakpoint at 1000 according to many studies so don't fall below that!<br />
<br />
Once said shaman has the necessary hit points to safely and easially use canny5 I suggest that he continue to access his upgrades trying to hit the next significant ac mark of 1100, then 1200 all the time trying to continue to grow hit points but not at the expense of AC.  At 1200 AC I think the shaman is probably at the point where most pieces of armour he is looking at as upgrades give both excellent AC and hitpoints so just upgrade slot by slot pretty much trying to keep the same or better ac and adding hit points (and mana).  Thus at this point AC will grow much slower than hitpoints, but both will grow because of the nature of the &quot;good&quot; armour.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">. I do use VotB but that is just my personal choice I like the added ac from it.  I used to use VotB over PE for the AC bonus as well, until I got the Primal Cudgel which casts group Primal Essence, and was so much more convenient.  Anyway, at that point I noticed that PE stacks with the Ranger buff Call of the Rathe, which VotB doesn't.  CoR gives all the AC benefit of VotB plus a 10 point damage shield.<br />

<br />
So... i cant answer your question, but I hope the above helps.<br />
<br />
I tend to agree with this view of things also. The ac vs attacks with random components involved does mean that at some point your ac gets high enough relative to the mobs attack that they pretty much hit the hard coded mins that verant has put in. We all know that no matter what your ac is a mob always has a chance to hit you. After all those pesky skellies that attack you still manage to hit and not miss every single swing possible. The other interesting thing is that the other end applies too. If your ac is too low the attk side will almost always win and you'll be at the maxes for a mob. The result if you graphed it would be an s curve. Starts off fairly flat when your ac's too low. At somepoint it starts to curve up when your ac gets to the point that it's able to help you start avoiding/mitigating blows and then levels back off when you hit the max. If your ac happens to fall into that inbetween point then it can have a very definite effect on how often and how much your getting hit for. If on the other hand your above the max or below the min it isn't gonna do much.<br />
<br />
The other thing that seems to be involved is that relative level seems to have an effect too. A level 55 player trying to tank a level 60 mob is going to be less effect than a level 65 even with everything else the same. This is easiest to notice right when an expansion pack comes out that raised the level cap. Watching my roommate go from 60 to 65 on his warrior and the difference it made in tanking the golems in valor etc was noticable even with no gear/aa changes.<br />
<br />
Ac definitely doesn't hurt expecially when it comes to stuff an expansion or 2 old. Usually gear has improved enough that as a shaman you can actually have ac better or equal to what tanks where sporting with a bit of effort.<br />
<br />
Personally I've never worried too much about ac it's just come with the better quality gear I've gotten just like wisdom and mana has.</div></div><hr />

Ummm... They're called junk buffs. Most people that have the JBBP use it only for the ac buff and wear something different. Also, it's possible to have an item and not have it in your magelo profile. Goodness knows I don't have everything in my profile. Your response/attack was totally unwarranted.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well I for one sincerely believe that shaman who try to max hitpoints while keeping ac at 1000 are not utilizing the most efficient combination of hps and ac for POP, raiding and LDON.

<br />
I wholeheartedly agree that more is better, probably well into the 1500-1600 range.  Some of the studies you quote on the warrior boards, etc., do suggest a gain even at 2000 ac, even if this is generally against PoP gods or other high-end nameds.  Against these gods' minions, 1500-1600 is probably a realistic softcap.<br />
<br />
However, thats not why I think 1k is a good rule-of-thumb value.<br />
<br />
Rather, its because thats the point at which the opportunity costs of AC in terms of HPs starts to be really expensive on droppable gear.  Without AAs, 1k/3k/200 is about the limit of what you can get with only a single group or with bazaar purchases.  Thus, I suggest this as a baseline for the 65/0 AA shammie who is looking to buy some upgrades.  <br />
<br />
Once you get into raid gear, there are many, many better options available, and the goal point should probably be closer to 1.4k/5k/355.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I stick to gear that allows me to have 1200 ac, or the old softcap, while maximizing hitpoints.  In old world, including LDoN I seem to mitigate fairly well at that level. Hitpoints are 3250 or so unbuffed, which is plenty for even self buffed can-5 and wis is 220ish (dont even look at it unless it drops below 200),</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't have a Wild One Wig in my profile, but somehow it is in my backpack....shocking! :p<br />
<br />
Generally, higher AC gear that will put you past the 1.2K AC range also has high hitpoints so you can't really seperate the two.  There are a few oddball items out there with next to no hp and high AC that are tagged SHM, but they are rare.  Just browsing some high-end profiles will point this out.  <br />
<br />
I would definitely follow what Snugglegutz said and &quot;worry about your hp first and the AC will follow&quot;.   In strict terms of utility, AC is ONLY used when you are actually in melee, but hitpoints are used CONSTANTLY to give you mana through Cannibalize and soak up nuke/AE damage along with absorbing random melee hits.  I would only sacrifice hp for AC if the gains were ridiculously good...like ~40 hp for 100AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In planes of power, most mobs dont care how much AC you have. They can hit for max even if your AC is 1200 in a tier 1 zone. HPs. Just get hps. Im up to 6k raid buffed.<br />
<br />
Mobs can allways hit for max no matter what your AC or aa skills are. However, it's the average hit that is important, since that determines how much damage you take (which is what the original poster was referring to). To reduce that, you need higher AC, and having the avoidance/mitigation lines of aa skills helps too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between 1804 AC, and the ~1500 or 1600 AC that the other shamans have in my guild is staggering.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make much of a difference when say Fennin Ro hits you with his targetting laser and decides to swing his hammer, but when dealing with trash like tier 1 rings, sol ro mobs, ldon clearing - on the typical garbage mobs on the way to bosses, or cc mobs, or xp mobs the AC makes a world of difference.</div></div><hr />

I use the JBB buff all the time but I actually keep it in 2nd slot, and grim aura buff from gobby earring in 1st. It's saved my buffs more times than I can count. PLus extra ac never hurts.</div></div><hr />

I am willing to bet the attack has more to do with Guild then with Ceno personally.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Prejudging Ceno based on his guild affiliation rather than the content of his post (which was valid) makes the attack rather childish IMO. As others have stated, magelo's often don't show every item a char has now or has had in the past. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Judging Ceno negatively based on his guild affiliation also shows a profound ignorance of the history of this board.  FoH shamans (Kazlaaz and Oogah come to mind) have been some of the very best contributors this board has ever seen.</div></div><hr />
