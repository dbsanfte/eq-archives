<br />
Ol Tundra and his stupid dog don't take kindly to Evils in his neck of the woods - hehe.<br />
<br />
Will an evil race camping IceGiants directly inside the front gate still draw aggro if Tundra wanders by? Does Tundra ever get that close?<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: is IceGiant loot better or less random than HG loot?<br />
<br />
As always - I appreciate your opinion )<br />
<br />
Thanks !<br />

<br />
loot is about the same...gems/plat/fs<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ps <br />
<br />
Tundra has a bear not a dog :)<br />
<br />
<br />
GL there...only problem u will find is that it is heavily camped...everyone and their uncle know of this place</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IIRC, long long time when camping giants, Jack and bear did path nearby but it might have been a mob train. Mob is close to TJ pathing,  TJ aggroes, kills mob, another mob in aggro range, TJ kills it and so on. You might get a chain aggro and TJ and bear might show up in your camp.<br />
<br />
You can always pull giants inside, near Perma zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tundra and his pet never walk close to IG house and I think they never pass the river, <br />
IG is same cash loot as HG, it alway camped by druid/necro and too much hp to worth the mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't JBB em either =(,so ya they are mana heavy kills,but just enough time to med to full for next pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Malxxx and you can JBB just fine.   By the time you can do IG's the HG's are green.  So it's either seafuries or IGs....  IGs always had better cash for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a troll shaman, and did a quest to get unkos there. I can and have bought spells there and other things. Its a simple newbie quest, but you have to do it a ton of times. Kill millions of gnolls in Blackburrow, which gets you unkos to halas merchants, then get as many white polar bear skins and do the newbie quest in halas with em til the guards are unkos, then hand in all the gnolls fangs to the guy at the warrior guild for even more faction. There is no way to get unkos to the rogues in halas, which only eliminates the bank. Getting unkos is great, there is a vendor out in the tundra at loc neg 2700 pos 3500 or something that i sell loot to, and i can run right back to the IG while pet parks there even before the next IG spawns. Tundra Jack does occasionally path by the IG house, not close enough though. I have seen em kill a few peeps who got chain aggroed, while they demanded to know why i lived :P.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Halas Merchants are on MerchantsofQeynos faction?<br />
<br />
That's the only faction hit on a gnoll it could possibly be, and that doesn't sound right for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually what happened is that he killed a bunch of gnolls and probably invised in to Halas droped invis and coned a merchant.<br />
<br />
And found them to be Dubious.<br />
<br />
:) <br />
<br />
As all merchants are to people that are KOS because thats the lowest emrchants can be!<br />
<br />
He probably assumed that he got faction from the gnolls or that Halas merchants were part of the qeynos merchant factions.<br />
<br />
It probably fit his &quot;facts&quot; well. IMO it's an easy mistake to make.<br />
<br />
For that very same reason it's safe for evil races to get bound in the South East corner of the gypsy camp. The only non-merchant there is in the North West corner.  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I also assume that he used the old invis trick(that no longer works) to get to indifferent or better. I plan on getting my Iksar monk to be non-KOS there as well(but my monk has sneak)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After 45 'game' years, Tundra Jack is still looking for Permafrost. So unless he gets trained to Perma by some other Evil player, you won't have to deal with him at all at the IG castle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you're right, the gnolls in blackburrow do give faction with the merchants of qeynos, but also with the people of the north (or something, its the halas vendors), I killed plenty. I got up to apprehensive or so, then went to Macs Quilts and the lady in there takes white polar bear skins (1 per quest) and gives 1 gold and a leather armor piece and faction. I killed polar bear cubs and auctioned to buy them for 5pp per. Dont remember how many it took, and after i got to dubious with the guards i was able to go do the gnoll fang quest in the warriors guild in halas (3 per quest). This got me up quickly to ally where i am now (I had a lot of gnoll fangs). If you just hunt gnolls in blackburrow you will only get unkos to the merchants. To get unkos to the shamans/warriors do the polar bear quest. Its impossible to get unkos to the rogues, which means the bank is the only unaccessable area. Once you are unkos with the shamans/warriors you can do numerous quests for faction with the guards. Look it up</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry but you are wrong.  I've spent over 100 levels in Everfrost/Blackburrow among my many characters and you can not raise ANY Halas factions by killing Gnolls.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Fri May 24 01:23:43 2002] You have slain a gnoll pup!<br />
[Fri May 24 01:23:43 2002] Your faction standing with Sabertooths of Blackburrow could not possibly get any worse.<br />
[Fri May 24 01:23:43 2002] Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos could not possibly get any better.<br />
[Fri May 24 01:23:43 2002] Your faction standing with Silent Fist Clan got better.<br />
[Fri May 24 01:23:43 2002] Your faction standing with Jaggedpine Treefolk got better.<br />
[Fri May 24 01:23:43 2002] Your faction standing with Merchants of Qeynos could not possibly get any better.<br />
<br />
Killing Goblins doesn't give you any faction with Halas either.<br />
<br />
You had to have done something else to get your faction to apphrensive, because killing gnolls doesn't do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ok, my evaluation on the ice giant camp:<br />
Great experience from 49 - 51 (wouldn't want to solo them without ebolt), exp slows down to less then a blue an hour at 52, not worth it really at 53. I would suggest taking the inner hall) spawn, less folks running around mistakenly aggroing the second front spawn (usually known as north ans south).<br />
Root, turgur, ebolt, plague, and when root breaks just mellee him with dog.  Make sure you have them slowed, they can be dual wielding and take of 250 dmg in a single round.  The spawn cycle is 6 min, and I usually had the mana back up in time to take every spawn as it pops; once you time it right you get 2 kills out of every alac.<br />
Cash is about 300 pp per hour, more if you have a bot to cash in al the loot.</div></div><hr />
