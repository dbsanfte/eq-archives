<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I got my greedy mits on the spell Tigirs..Its supposed to come with a 200 pt hate decreaser and a 50% slow..Now the slow, not an issue, but for some reason, I had hoped I could cast this sooner say at 97 percent then wait till 90% due to the hate decreaser...Any pointers on this?  Also, I Acumen claims a quickening of the mind, increased vision, and increase in stamina regen..What exactly is the quickening of the mind good for..I dont seem to see any benifit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basically, the aggro on any slow is high enough initially that it has a very high chance of getting aggro even with a hate reducer.  Tigir's is really a situational spell and if you are using it then you should be casting it on a group of mobs so most of them wouldn't have been aggroed at all yet anyway.<br />
<br />
As for acumen, stamina has been removed from the game entirely but it does grant a great vision effect (ultravision) and also see invis.  Unfortunately the spell adds no other effects other than vision enhancements now so the &quot;quickening of the mind&quot; is all fluff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bah, now that bites..lol...OH well, was hoping for a bone there...he he..thanks for the reply..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now, if they want to THRILL all the Shaman out there they should replace the STA component on Acumen and Acumen of Dar Khura with a MANA REGEN component.<br />
<br />
Every other *&amp;@$ class in EQ gets a Mana Regen - why not Shaman?  Even our damn bastard child gets some Mana Regen!<br />
<br />
/me heads over to the EQLive boards to put that bug in the Dev's ears.  Perhaps if some others picked up on it the Devs might even consider it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SOE believes there is too much mana regen already, they wouldn't give us any stackable mana regen. Only hope would be to get non-stackable regen. i.e. it won't with SD or 9 or KEI or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SD &amp; KEI do stack.  I think 9 should stack on there as well.<br />
<br />
Now, I agree, it should take the place of one of those . . . perhaps 9 or SD.  Basically you could stack KEI+9+Acumen or KEI+SD+Acumen . . . but not 4 of them.<br />
<br />
I'd have no problem with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Clerics mana regen is self only and wont stack with 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make sure you use Tigir's on your next multi mob pull, before the Enchanters get the chance to stun.  Its a real rush......to your bind point that is. ;)<br />
<br />
I use it in LDoN sometimes.  I love to see the &quot;Mob Yawns&quot; x3 or 4.  Its actually kinda useful if your are farming Bane weapons for Emp in the mines of Ssra.  If you have only a sudo AoE group it works well to have 2 Shaman cast that on random mobs in case the Enchanter gets any stun resists.  Helps keep the Wizard or Mage alive long enough to finish up the mobs.<br />
<br />
Oh and it comes in handy in VT as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking as a warrior...an endurance regen would be great.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yup, get to bind point quickly if stun is resisted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only time i ever use Tigirs is PoE mud ring. Other than that have enough shaman to cover regular slows on a raid. Never considered using in a single group..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ive replaced Turgurs with Tigirs in my LDoN groups.  Single pulls are boring, so I have the puller always bring back a few, but never more than 4.  Toss the slow, toss a root and a VP or so and in 50 seconds the puller is off getting more.  <br />
<br />
I've never noticed a huge agro problem with it before.  Yes, I will agro any mobs that havent already been locked down by a melee, but thats why I have lots of AC and HP.  I would hazard a guess that Tigirs has about 60 to 75% of the agro of Tugurs, beucase even a ranger can taunt off me really fast if Ive only got Tigirs agro on a mob.<br />
<br />
Only place that Ive had a problem with Tigirs is Takish.  I dont know if its just me. but resists in the Takish themes are worse than any other camp Ive been to.  I can usually guarentee at least one resist per group of 4.  In other themes Id be suprised to see one resist in 3 or 4 casts of Tigirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use tigirs all the time, but I'd trade it for AE malos any day:)<br />
<br />
Like other posters have noted, its situational.  I hardly ever use it on tough mobs, its mostly useful for farming, or content you can be sure to survive multiple mobs on you.<br />
<br />
For instance, farming shards in Ssra.  3-4 skele's is the typical pull when not doing AE groups, so I wait for them to all swarm the MT, then cast tigirs, and root the adds.<br />
<br />
When in AE groups, its nice to use Tigirs to drag 4 mobs at a time to the center of the AE action.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes, on highly magic resistant mobs, where even after malos, slow won't stick for a couple attempts, I use tigirs as a backup slow, even on single pulls.  With the refresh time on Turgurs, having a second slow memmed can really help out.  <br />
<br />
Basically, expect to get just as much aggro overall as you do with Turgurs.  Expect to get 3 mobs on you when you cast it, plan for that, and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Situational is right! The only time it works for me the mobs have to stacked closer than a drood's quad-kite...which means someone is going down fast. I have yet to meet a tank that would rather you Tigir's instead of rooting ie: opening distance&gt;than slow.<br />
<br />
Yes, it can be a lifesaver but too situational to be a game changer.<br />
<br />
ps. I almost fainted with excitement when i was first handed the spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aniha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you can take a beating somewhat - I find Tigirs wonderful for LDoN when you get those 3+ mob pulls. My standard LDoN spell lineup of Turgur, Tigir, Torgor allows me to throw Tigir's out, drag adds my way where I can root them, VP them, or dog them while I Turgur/Torgor back and forth any that Tigirs didn't stick to.<br />
<br />
Yeah it's great to see 4 &quot;yawns&quot; messages. Just remember sometimes you will see zero. You need to be able to handle having 4 unslowed mobs head your way. Surprisingly, in over 200 LDoNs I believe I've only died once to Tigirs - and that was an 8 mob pull where I chained Tigirs a few times with lots of resists heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The thing I hate about Tigirs is that all you see are yawn messages, but when you see &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot;, then you have to scramble to figure out which is the unslowed mob.<br />
<br />
I use Tigirs when my friends and I go to Chardok.  Basically, the pally trains us with about 20 mobs, and the chanter and I get to work with mezzing and slowing respectively.  It's fun watching 20 pairs of arms swinging at you from &quot;one&quot; body.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tirgirs is a great spell.  I currently use it in the following places:<br />
<br />
LDoN normal - Great for AE style groups (melees using Coral Hilted Tulwar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25994) only adds to the fun.  Nothing like a AE proc).<br />
PoE rings - we normally have 4-6 mobs inc on pulls on all but vine ring.<br />
Vex Thal - AE Slow on 20 mob pulls.  Oh, and the AE proc sword adds to the fun.  Just take all the mobs, throw them in a corner, stick tanks on Eoms, and load AEs.<br />
Time phase 1-3.  This is situational.  In phase 1 and 2 it depends on the trial.  On phase 3, its just nice to have semi-slowed mobs on inc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most the time, to avoid ping ponging, I'll just target myself, run into the mess of mobs, and AE slow myself.  9/10 times I'll resist it while hitting the mobs near me.</div></div><hr />
