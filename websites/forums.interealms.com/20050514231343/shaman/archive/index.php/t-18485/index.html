<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There's a lot of ideas floating around at the moment, a lot of them very good ones, it would be a shame to see them just sink off the front page.<br />
<br />
Some people keep saying that it would be pointless as no one will ever agree.  However I know they are wrong simply for the fact that the crucible used to have a stickey for shammy ideas.  It was all well thought out, and modified as people came up with improvements.<br />

I am aware that Sunmoon doesn't want this site used to post demands to SOE.  But I think a simple list saying what we'd like to see done for our class is harmless, I can only ask that you reconsider.</div></div><hr />
