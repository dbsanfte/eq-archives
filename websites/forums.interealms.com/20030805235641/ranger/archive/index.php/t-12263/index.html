<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tirwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I feel pretty safe that no one really knows me well, I'd like to be able to get an unbiased opinion on this.<br />
<br />
I'm in a small guild, only about 8 or 9 actual people. This is not the problem. Here is something that happened a few months ago. One of my guildmates was being stalked, for lack of a better term. She tried to politely brush him off, but she didn't get anywhere. Prior to that, he'd been bugging me about her constantly. I tried to be polite about it and all, but I wound up adding him to /ignore, the first time I'd ever done that. I told the guild leader several times about this as did my guildmate. He made the comment the comment that sometimes she brings these things on herself. Then, he bugs another one of our guild members. I tell her to put him on /ignore and don't tell him anything. Our guild leader is in guild chat with us at the time. A week later, I'm playing one of my alts, and he starts bugging me. I put him on ignore. My husband is getting pretty sick and tired of what he's seeing, so, when I log and put my merchant up (who is not tagged), he tells the guy to leave us alone. At no point did he use swear words. A few days later, the guild leader is ranting about an &quot;incident&quot; with this person and that there was a complaint. He demanded to know why he wasn't informed first. I pointed out that he was repeatedly told about it and did nothing. He ranted about it for awhile and then said not to worry about it. But it still bothered me that he couldn't stand up for his people.<br />
<br />
Several months ago, a couple of my friends from Uber_guild_01 were getting tired of being on call all the time. Their alts were made &quot;probationary&quot; members. This was all well and good, but I did notice some things. Every time my friends would offer to help with something, our guild leader would turn them down. This ranged from help on quests to offers of equipment that they were letting rot. It seemed a little rude to me, but I shrugged it off. Several weeks ago, they left Uber_guild_01, and I noticed they were playing their alts a lot more. I also noticed that when they said hi in guild chat, they were mostly ignored. So, for the most part, they wound up with only me to talk to in guild chat. A few weeks ago, I noticed they sometimes had guild tags from Uber_guild_02 on their mains. I didn't get a chance to ask them about it, but my guild leader sure did in guild chat. I wasn't there, so I have only his statement that he told them he was offended that they had gone off and joined Uber_guild_02. He said he was talking to an empty guild chat for 10 minutes before he realized they'd detagged and left. Personally, if he'd been going on for 10 minutes, I think that's a rant.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it comes down to this, and I'd like some opinions. I should also mention that there are 2 members who are guild leader pets. While he'll help any of us with a CR, he almost exclusively groups with them. I'm inclined to leave the guild, but these are mostly people I've known for several years. I don't want to leave any hard feelings, but if my guild isn't going to stand behind me and is going to snub my friends/would be guild members, I don't see why I'm not better off guildless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Myrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are guild worth it?<br />
<br />
Yes - I know mine is.<br />
<br />
Is yours?<br />
<br />
It doesn't sound like it. If the guild is that small, and the leadership is screwed up, I'd say it's time to bail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The second paragraph sounds kinda like some members of my old guild.  The powergamers were a seperate entity from us more casul players (and this was a relatively small guid.  10-15 on a good night on, maybe 50 or so all told in membership, but most MIA).  They eventually all splintered off into their own guild.  Lots of hard feelings between everyone.  They claimed the only reason they included us on their raids for their epic pieces and such was &quot;to give the guild something to do&quot;.  Seemed they thought they were doing a favor for us and they didn't really need us, and probably could have done things smoother and faster without us &quot;tagging&quot; along.  Which justified them NOT helping any of us with our epics in some way.<br />
<br />
Yep, lots of hard feelings.  I'm still in contact with a few of them though because they treated me well enough, but were forced to make a choice bewteen being loyal to a then-stagnating guild or moving on with the powergamers.  I can't really blame them for their choice.  They wouldn't have had much fun if they stayed behind like I did, and at the end of the day, that's why we play, right?<br />
<br />
Your guildleader sounds kind of.. well..  Unstable.  Maybe new leadership is called for?  Sounds like the guild is ready to disolve.  Why not look to merege with another guild, or take your friends and find a new guild to hang out with?  Of the two options, merging sounds to be the best option to me.  Get some new blood into the guild but not lose contact/have hard feelings with those that would have otherwise been left behind.<br />
<br />
As for the first paragrpah.. I've dealt with an in-game stalker.  Some guy in UO developed an irrational fetish concerning me.  It was pretty hard to ignore him, as he made a bind stone for himself at all of my houses and was some how able to aquire neighbooring pieces of realestate.  He also hacked my home system and somehow picked up some of my RL data.  Turns out he was from a nearby city so then I had to deal with him as a real life stalker as well.  The police did nothing, they didn't seem to beleive me that I was being affected by an online stalker.<br />
<br />
Eventually I got into a confrontation with him.  Ended up with me re-arranging his appendages.  I never heard from him again.  Sometimes I wish I could do the same to people in game as well =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would have to say that guilds are definately worth it.  The trick is finding the guild that is right for you.  If you are a casual gamer, find a guild that is more based around fun, maybe some roleplaying, and just enjoying the game.  If you are up for phat lewtz, go join a guild centered around raiding.  There are a million and one different guilds out there, each with their own view on enjoyment.  Just look around, visit website, get to know people, and see which guild you would enjoy.  If nothing else, the guildchat will give you something to do while you solo. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd agree with Eolair except for the part about raiding guilds.  I'm in one, 99% of my friends are in one, and while loot is nice, it isn't the number one reason for me or my friends to be in one.  The main reason for us is that we get a kick out of figuring out how to take down a particularly difficult opponent on a regular basis-- that's what we consider fun.  The loots are only icing on the cake and are thought of more as tools needed to take down even larger opponents.  If I can rephrase, the loots are a means to an end and not the end in itself.  <br />
Personally, I look askance at people who are way too focused on loot.  It turns Everquest more into an on-line Barbie dress-up than a modified game of chess.  My last Barbie doll got chewed up by the dog eighteen years ago, and I ain't interested in acquiring new ones.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tirwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I actually got to talk to one of my friends last night. This is what he had to say....<br />
<br />
He had, in the past, said more or less that he liked having his alts in our guild. I was there on one occassion and heard that. GL said &quot;We'll discuss that later&quot;.<br />
<br />
From our GL's post about the incident -<br />
I was a bit more then annoyed that this was contrary to what they had talked to me about just a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
A couple of weeks ago, they were already in Uber_Guild_02.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on the night in question, GL commented about Uber_Guild_02. My friends indicated that it was their mains' guild. He said that it was just Bad_Guild_01 reformed (the guild in question being on our do not assist, etc list).  They said that it was a recent guild, mostly made up from the remnants of Uber_Guild_03 that had disbanded a few months ago (and we were on relatively friendly terms with them). Then he brought up the fact that he was unhappy with their mains not being in our guild. So, my friend was like, np... and then hit /gr . My friend wasn't upset about it. He was under the impression that the GL was mad about the guild they were in and not that their mains weren't in our guild.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm.... well, I think my GL was ticked at being wrong about Uber_guild_01 and decided to make an issue out of something. Otherwise, why not mention that in his post? <br />
<br />
I'm more of a casual player than a power gamer. I've been playing for a little over a year, and I've mostly solo'ed my way to 47.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eowyna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guilds are worth it aslong as they are focused.<br />
<br />
Raid guilds are great as long as you like to raid.<br />
<br />
Family guilds are great as long as you like to relax and chat and not really raid.<br />
<br />
As to the stalker issue =P my responce is always I R a 45 year old guy IRL ( have your gusband start talking sports or cars or whatever ). that usually sends them off looking for some other fantasy.<br />
<br />
If you want to do alot of the game content it requires a raid force to do so. You could check out the Open Raid scene but personally that's way to much drama for me, as open means every lowlife dreg on the server  can come mess up the raid, while whineing about the loot the won't get.<br />
<br />
As to the alt's and mains issue .. folks will play there mains and focus on them, exept when they are burned out and want to chill fora bit, to expect them to do anything when in chill mode is silly. Let them relax be friends with them , whatever perhaps someday  they'll be useful in some raid for some quest or whatever. BUT they are primarily going to be loyal to there mains guild.<br />
<br />
As to Uber ... that is totally in the eye of the beholded if you think they are above you .. you're wrong they are folks as well. Same money, loot ect issues.<br />
<br />
So in short yes ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guilds are definitely worth having. I don't know much about the situation, but this is just my opinion.<br />
<br />
I'm confused by a few things, but from my perspective, the guild leader is making the situation a bit more difficult than it should be. I'm not trying to offend anyone at all, but I don't agree with how he has followed through the situations. <br />
<br />
First off, it is mentioned that the guild is small, I do not see why having just an alt and not a main in the guild would create problems (For much larger guilds, having proper attendance for raids, keeping a good reputation, or whatnot, being in just one guild is important) .  If the people leave alts in a guild for non raiding purposes, I'd say welcome them in and enjoy the time spent with each other. There is no need to make something out of nothing.<br />
<br />
Second, regarding the &quot;stalker,&quot; a more proper reponse could've been taken place instead of the response of &quot;you brought it on to yourself.&quot; The stalker could've been warned for &quot;harassment&quot; (since his constant tells made you and your friend /ignore him) or could've been removed from the guild (though I'm not sure if he is your friend or friend or a friend or how much it would affect the other people.) <br />
<br />
Guilds are mainly the raiding type, or close friends/family type (sometimes both). It is always possible to address the issue with your guild to see if any changes can be made (regarding the &quot;my guild isn't going to stand behind me and is going to snub my friends/would be guild members&quot; issue.) The whole guild can discuss and maybe find a solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
You have to ask yourself &quot;how much your guildmates mean to you?&quot; If the only thing stopping you from leaving said guild is because you don't want others to think less of you, I would recommend that you follow through, and if they were good enough friends, they would respect your decision. If you really care for your guildmates and they do you, then you all can always work something out. <br />
<br />
I hope your situation works out alright.<br />

I wish all uber/raid/powergaming/insert_another_name_here guilds were like that, unfortunately I was in a uber/raid/powergaming/insert_another_name_here, and it was a totally different experience, member input was ignored, we simply followed like sheep, did what we were told (without being told why) and pressed &quot;a&quot; on our keyboards when told to. It totally demeaned and disheartened me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colphax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahh, guild drama...you can't avoid it, but you can minimize it.  One of a guild leader/officer's main tasks is to mange the guild drama, and it sounds like your guild leader is definately failing in this regard.  First of all, he/she failed on responding to a harassment charge, multiple times, and only got involved when he/she was personally involved.  Secondly, he/she is actually creating guild drama by hounding publicly on the people who have their mains in another guild.  If someone wants to do something with thair mains that the current guild cannot do on their own, harassing them about their mains will do nothing but alienate them from a guild that they would prefer to keep ties with on their alts.  Ranting in a public guild channel is almost always a bad sign.  These sort of things are best handled on a tell or private channel basis.<br />
<br />
If a guild leader or officer rants publicly, there must be a valid reason that everyone must understand.  If the rant is deserved, it can be constructive, but if there is no real, valid reason for the rant, who will stay?  I would not.</div></div><hr />
