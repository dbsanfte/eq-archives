I like articles like this.  They ensure that I don't forget why I quit EQ. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are about 2 things that are interesting for me in that article.<br />
<br />
An interesting new feature of OOW is the ability to choose your title. Characters get titles when they reach a certain quantity of AA points. Everyone starts out as a Baron/Baroness, then advances up to specific titles. Knights are Duke, druids and shaman are Elder, casters are Sage, except necromancers, who become Lich, rangers are Hunter, and so on.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, many people like their lesser title. &quot;You wouldn't believe how many letters I get every week from people saying 'You know, I liked my old title better,'&quot; says Crosby. Some people simply liked how a lesser title sounded with their name. So, even if you have 600 AA points, you can go back to being a Baron.<br />
<br />
Ehh.  INteresting, and a good thing for some.  I have many wizard friends that hate being called Sage.  I have a SK friend that designed his name to center around Sir, and when it changed to Duke he was heartbroken.  Yay for them.<br />
<br />
And the company isn't done with the game after this title. There are at least two more expansions planned after OOW.<br />
<br />
The gods weep.  Dont get me wrong, one side of me is happy that the game that I have loved to play or 4 years is still viable enough to warrant expanding the play world.  The other half of me screams and rails  that exery expansion in the last 2 years has been incomplete and added to the generally poor state of certain classes today.  <br />
<br />
I think that if SOE really wanted to endear itself to some of the players out there and engender some real, old school affection ala Kunark/Velious, one of those expansions needs to be a general fix to Luclin and beyond.  Work on all the little inconsistancies, fix broken quests, finish some quest lines, expand spell lines and just try to flesh out and repair some of the thin spots in previous expansions.  This snippet was telling for me:<br />
Crosby says SOE would like to go back and fix its old zones for this and other issues, but that, like other redesigns, are lower on the priority scale. After all, bards are still playing their stringed and percussion instruments improperly, except for the Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
If they truly want to go back and fix these things, small as they may be, an expansion designed to retrofit all these changes is a great idea.  After all, one of the biggest beefs that I have with EQ is not the big stuff (shaman healing, charm overpowerdness), but its the little day to day quirks that have not worked correctly in 5 years.<br />
<br />
In my spare time I enjoy painting.  Try as I might though, most of my paintings are never done.  Two days ago I took a painting off the wall thats been hanging for over a year and made some changes to it.  Why?  Because the more I looked at it the more I realized that it wasnt finished; it wasnt right yet.  EQ is much the same.  There are still so many small things  that can be fixed.  I know that if development for EQ was my job I would be a wreck because of all the little things that are just plain wrong with it.  The number of broken quests would make me lose sleep at night.  Improper animations (2HB anyone?)would cause a constant frown to play across my face.  I take pride in my work in all things, and the inconsistancies of EQ would shame me.<br />
<br />
Well, time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EVery time they go back and fix little things like doors not working or whatever people rail against them to fix class balance or whatever, you can't please everyone.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The gods weep.

Whoa, are you saying you think that classes were better balanced in Velious then they are now? As much as I like to complain about class balance I do think that class balance is much improved compared to Velious (or heavens forbid, original EQ), both in overall class desirability and power and in regards to content balance.<br />
<br />
What changed though is the leveling curve. People spend a much lesser amount of their time leveling then back in Velious and a much greater amount of time grouping and raiding with people of their exact same level, number of AAs and gear.<br />
<br />
Class imbalance is much much noticeable in such a setting then it is when you routinely group with people as much as 5 levels higher or lower then you and with staggering gear differences. That is not even going into how general game knowledge (don't confuse this with playing skill) is much more widespread today then it used to be back then.<br />
<br />
I remember warriors giving up half of their AC for 30 more dex. I remember routinely having more HPs and AC then the tanks I grouped with even if they went for all AC and HPs simply because I used to spend a decent amount of time looking for gear upgrades. I remember grouping with sub-50 people while I was nearing 60.<br />
<br />
Today I group with lvl 65 people, mainly from my own guild, with a similar number of AAs and similar gear. Since we are a raiding guild the mindset and playing skills/knowledge also tend to be similar.<br />
<br />
Thus any imbalances are much much more visible today then they were back then. In Velious I would not have noticed that I tank worse then warriors just by playing the game. In Velious I would not have noticed that clerics had mana regeneration issues just by playing the game. The gap in gear, levels, knowledge and skill within the group of people I grouped with was simply too large to notice anything like that.<br />
<br />
That does not mean class balance was better back then.</div></div><hr />

Well on a positive note, gaming companies like SoE tend to go out with a bang and not a fizzle. So i expect that is OoW sucks ****, that the next one or atleast the very last one will be very good. Something to look foward too i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean?  OoW is going to be filled with &quot;park&quot; zones.  These zones are peaceful with scenic beauty of Norrath's nature.  You won't have to worry about monsters bothering you.  One zone will have a golf course and another with have a day spa which will include an aromatherapy oxygen bar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I personally would not buy an expansion that just adjusted old stuff, I am interested in new zones and exploration.<br />
<br />
I agree twofold.  It seems ridiculous to buy an &quot;expansion&quot; that doesnt expand, but reworks the core continents.  First, we should expect that over time, things should be fixed gradually, especially glaring errors.  Fortunately, we could not be charged for such an expansion.  Every expansion is based upon Antonica/Odus/Fay.  Any expansion that would rework these lands would require all users to have access to the content.  There cannot be two versions of the same zone going on, imho.<br />
<br />
I think one of the things that challenges me as a player is that my mind works in a way that I need to visualize places like a map.  I started the game between Velious and Luclin.  At that time, it was neat to look at a drawing of the original continents, with Kunark to the southeast and Velious to the southwest.  I could see myself adventuring to new lands by looking at the map.  There was the whole, crap I'm in Cobalt Scar, I am lvl 30 and dragons HATE me.  I look on the map, and geez, I'm a long way from &quot;home&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ever since Luclin, since it is a different planetary area, they seem to forget people like me.  PoP of course, it a whole different issue, since it is planes...   I had a big problem with LoY.  Where is it?  Ok, its somewhere off of Stonebrunt, on Odus' south shores.  But I don't see an island on any map.  Then there is the lands of Taelosia.  Um, this is off of Nedaria's landing, which is to the west of that hippy treehugger zone in the far northwest of Antonica.  I can only assume that this land is quite far away, since that boat was a huge huge huge pain until the magic TL gnomes.  Plus, it was so far they needed a &quot;floating city&quot;  So lets say it is on the other side of the planet.<br />
<br />
It would be neat to friggin develop a map for us to visualize where we are, sony.  Exploring is one of the things I love about this game the most.  The danger and excitement of not knowing what's around the corner.  Would be nice to have a map to visualize the part of the planet I'm on.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp here, but I think it would help &quot;tie&quot; everything together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I personally would not buy an expansion that just adjusted old stuff, I am interested in new zones and exploration.<br />
<br />
There ya go - the reason why old content never gets fixed.<br />
<br />
Crosby [Brenlo] says SOE would like to go back and fix its old zones for this and other issues, but that, like other redesigns, are lower on the priority scale. After all, bards are still playing their stringed and percussion instruments improperly, except for the Vah Shir. <br />
<br />
SOE has not figured out how to suck money out of players to fix old content, so fixes are on the back burner.  On the basement stove.  The one that is not hooked up.<br />
<br />
And as long as we keep pouring money into SOE for new content, their priority will be to build the new revenue sources rather than fixing the game-changing bugs that exist now.  And if it follows the GoD formula (as it appears to) it will suck for shamans anyway.<br />
<br />
My money stays in my wallet for this one - at least for now.</div></div><hr />

Fixing content people don't do any more is similar to fixing the door of an empty building. It's not the sort of thing which should enjoy high priority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure they have.  It shows up on my monthly credit card statement. =)<br />
<br />
Personally, I think fixes, old zone reworks, and game events would act as a nice motivator to retain people and bring them back.  We know that &quot;apocalype&quot; is coming with big pointy teeth since EQ2 will be about the aftermath.  I wanna see some crap blow up.  I wanna see this war and be a part of it.  It will happen in Antonica, so lets make it happen.  A graphic revamp of the mainland, which like I said previously has to be free due to the fact it is the anchor of the game and you can't have two versions of the same zone, would be a great time to work this.<br />
<br />
At the same time, when redesigning this, they can add zones in antonica itself.  The lore in the game states the rise of the second Rallosian Empire.  It would be nice to breathe some life into central Antonica.<br />
<br />
Imagine this expansion: &quot;Second Rise of the Giants&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Free content for all:  Graphics Work for the majority of Antonica proper with new mobs that have to do with the coming age of war.<br />
<br />
Expansion content:  Centered around a huge fortress in the middle of the content, north of Rathe Mtns, east of south karana, west of the ro deserts, south of the commonlands/kithicor.  This will be the staging ground for the new Rallosian Empire.  All the orcs, trolls, ogres, giants, and such come together to start building a large complex inthe middle of the continent in &quot;secret.&quot;  This will be a giant castle with different zones in it.  Some are areas where catapults are being built.  Some are forges where they are preparing weapons.  Some are magic academies training dark magics to ogres with their newfound intelligence.  <br />
<br />
This would be done in two parts.  The zones in antonica would be changed groups at a time.  The zones that will act as the entry to this fortification will be revamped and in the background you can see building in the distance, but the entrances are not available yet.  This will foreshadow the building of the empire.  Eventually, these zones will have mini fortesses in them, guarding the entrance to the innards of the expansion.  These entrances will be for lower level characters.  When the expansion is launched, the interior of Antonica will be opened up.  The races of the world will have the goal of sabotaging the Rallosian Empire's war preparation.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is just an idea I had that I think would breathe life into the game and help tie a link with EQ2.  For those who do not know, one of the &quot;ages&quot; leading up to the breaking up of norrath and luclin blowing up was the rise of the Rallosian Empire, which lay siege to Freeport and Quenos before they were wiped out by Greenmist, the same as the whole Shissar lore in Kunark.   This expansion would not be the siege itself, but the rise of the force and the world's need to sabotage what they see as a growing threat.<br />
<br />
If anything, hope this idea was entertaining at least, I need to get back to work now. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">While I agree in thinking new content is probably the priority, I do think there should be at least some changes to old content. The game isn't entirely about being 65, (although perhaps people will disagree), people do level twinks. <br />
And when old content isn't priority I still think they should look at old content when bringing in new zones to the game. They proved they could do it with that dungeon in Loio.(name slipped mind) Or provide a few zones with emphasis on story, or a few novelly themed low level zones.</div></div><hr />

Veksar, one of my favorite zones.  Great challenge, appropriate loots, zone design, mobs look cool, and the lore behind the zone is pretty neat.<br />

Aye - mine too.  And that's the problem. The bugs have not pissed off enough of us into quitting -yet.  But when you look at the goodbyes from many long-time players, one of the things mentioned is that they are tired of EQ bugs, so they have moved to less troubled games, like WOW.<br />
<br />
I understand not investing in fixing display bugs or even old broken quests, I am much more concerned about game-affecting bugs like getting stuck in the landscape and mobs under the world, or mobs walking through walls then pulling the whole zone on top of you.<br />
<br />
Our level 65 cleric got pecked to death while he was stuck in rocks in a green (to him) zone he was running through last night. The night before, we were working in Sirens Grotto for some shawl quest drops and the puller got stuck on the seaweed trying to return with our targets.  <br />
<br />
These bugs are what need to be the priority.  What kind of a Bull S*** fix is it to wait 30 seconds then get sent randomly elswhere in the zone?  Or wait 28 seconds and get sent naked to your bind spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The new epics will not be replacements, but complimentary. For example, the cleric epic will likely be a shield.<br />

Hmm, I wonder where that leaves us? Not to mention Druids, Enchanters and Wizards.<br />
<br />
You will not have to have your epic (SKs and magicians, rejoice) but you will have to go through some extra steps if you don't have your epic already.<br />

Not a big deal for most shaman but I think some people/classes were expecting not to have to do anything extra at all.</div></div><hr />

The way it sounds, the task system for the low levels, more zones for the Gates crowd (is there one?)... but nothing for everybody else except the already boring AA grinding in the Planes and Crap Dungeons (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=81941#M81941) ... /sarcasm on - great marketing there</div></div><hr />

I have canceled my subscription and figured I'd renew based on the expansion.  Unfortunately, as a level 58, there is absolutely nothing in this next expansion for me, a mid-level casual player.  Low end mission system and high end GoD-capable zones.  Hell, I don't go to GoD at all and spent my money to buy it the first day, never again.  This is truly the nail in the coffin for me.  I hope to play EQ II, but if SOE continues to be this clueless, I may just stick with City of Heroes and WoW.  At least I'll be having fun and will know that the company actually gives a damn about it's player base.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I bet they continue the trend to phase out the shaman in favor of the beastlord.  Seems that more and more folks are seeing that beastlord is better addition to most groups than shaman.  And if not the beastlord, then the enchanter.  I believe that is the way sony wants it. <br />
<br />
Since shaman is the only class I've enjoyed playing ( or had time to develop past low 20's) I will probablly leave EQ if they don't do some serious adjustments to the shaman utility in the next expansion.  And I mean something a bit more accessible than GOD where the shaman is rarely a desirable addition to group.</div></div><hr />

If they actually DID market research, they wouldn't have even bothered to announce another expansion until around Christmas, at least.<br />

<br />
Personally, I'm looking forward to the new expansion.  What would happen if they went back and redid old places and fixed some of the broken content IE more doors and stuff.  Well, I could care less.  I'll continue doing what I do everytime I log on.  Look for something fun to do.  Bust out my beastlord and bot the ranger if I'm a bit bored.  Maybe work on some tradeskills or old quests (hey, i just recently soloed everything to get my 8th ring from velious).  <br />
<br />
Really, GoD isn't that hard.  Sure, I have a bit better equipment so it's easier for me, but there are places where the average equipped player can go to.  Ferubi has elemental level experiece.  Mobs there hit a little bit harder, but have less hps than the elemental mob.  Nothing in Riwwi summons.  Qinimi named (some of them) can be soloed by just about any class.  Vxed and Tipt is great experience and the mobs there have been nerfed so many times that it's easy for anyone to go through (did a vxed run this past weekend where I had 1k more hps than the tank).  <br />
<br />
I still just think alot of you ventured into an area that was prob. over your head, got into trouble and got smoked, and now are too afraid to go back to Gates.  Personally, I'm loving it.  BiC quest although long and hard, promises to be very rewarding in the end (can you say a removeable augment that fits on any piece of equipment)<br />
<br />
Really, there is a double edged sword going in some areas.  Some people whine about how the &quot;ubers&quot; are chewing through content so quickly.  Others whine because the content is too hard for them.  You can't please everyone and finding the happy medium can be very hard.  I think that Uqua is one of my favorite zones right now.  It's challenging and hard.  At any moment you know that if you aren't paying attention, you can and will wipe.  My guild hasn't beaten it yet (partially because of lack of warrior support), but when we do finally, I know that all the blood, sweat and tears will have been worth it once we get into Qvic.  Honestly.. i'm not happy in EQ if I'm not raiding.  That's why I play.  Sure, a close second is getting on and talking to friends that i've made, but if it wasn't for the raiding then I wouldn't still be around.  Can't beat that excitement for me.</div></div><hr />

You post on a Shaman forum about how when you want to have fun you bust out your Beastlord isnt this as bad as ex EQers coming here and complaining.<br />
You had 1k hp more than the tank and i bet your dads bigger than his dad.<br />
Seriously i dont care how hard GoD is my problems not with it being hard as im nowhere near equipped well enough to go through it though have done a bit there and found it tough but doable with a decent group.<br />

Not so. I love GoD. In a way it reminds me of my Kunark era days, when you could get into gritty fights where you are barely in controll of the situation, and it feels great to beat it. As opposed to endless grinding in some safe spot that has become the norm. You guys just got soft after SoL/PoP/LDoN pampering.</div></div><hr />

Err.. I think that you misquoted me, but that's okay.  Really, what i said was that when I log on I look for something fun to do.  If I get bored, I bust out the beastlord or bot the ranger.  <br />
<br />
Go back to it and you'll see the point of... I had 1k more hps than the main tank in Vxed, was that we did okay (obviously I don't have that many hps so the tank must not have had any) without needing a tank with 10k hps.<br />
<br />
Think my biggest beef is just that I hear so many people talk about stuff being too hard, so they are unwilling to try it again or even go there period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">at one time the INTENTION was that a company would keep a seperate LIVE development team to add new content for areas/continents you already owned... which in large measure justified a monthly subscription fee.  remember that when the 2 first seminal online games launched even the marketing people at OSI (UO) and 989 (EQ) didn't know if people WOULD pay a monthly fee.  if you assumed that online games would have a shelf-life approximately like regular games (generally a year would be optimistic) a company COULD make profit only by charging a high box or subscription fee (say 80 - 100 bucks) and derive operating revenue and also an equivalent profit from that.<br />
<br />
assuming you're not some moron-come-lately for whom MMPOG have ALWAYS existed...like the cellphone and processed cheese... the promise of &quot;live team support&quot; for new content has always been a red herring: primarily a marketing promise to make a monthly subscription palatable.  there's no question about that.  after all, it was just as likely as not that NO EXPANSION would EVER be released for EQ (I'm sure very few of you know that all the designs for the continent of Kunark were done PRIOR to EQ's original launch... but were shelved indefinitely as too ambitious when antonica, odus and fayder were polished and released.  originally smed really didn't expect eq to go more than a year or two MAX and gradually promising to release the new zones already envisioned seemed a safer bet than planning on an expansion for a game that no one expected to even outgrow the level 50 cap<br />
<br />
now, 5 years down the pike it's become clear that &quot;live support&quot; for additional content is a nonstarter... not only for EQ but for ANY MMPOG.  a new zone every year or every year and a half doesn't consititute policy but a treat.  just as seeing a GM on Halloween and Christmas doesn't constitute customer support.  zones released are like the Fabled spawns or 5th year anniversary events... someone's pet project or released because other mmpog are going live...<br />
<br />
this isn't the case only for EQ.  NO MMPOG supports regular publishing of content by a live team.  just like it was at one time the thing to PROMISE support, it's now become accepted by convention, that just like EQ, game developers just dont do this.  in fact a game like guildwars.com is basing its entire revenue model on the idea that MMPOG consumers BUY EXPANSIONS (and unlike other devs who screw people coming AND going with subscriptions AND expansions, arenanet's only gonna get.. less desperate... people once)<br />
<br />
why is this?  how can an entire GENRE, not to mention the largest mmpog studio in north america get away with wholesale deceit of its consumers on the main selling point for its enormous revenue model.  has the system broken down?  where is my congressman???<br />
<br />
simply put, soe just didn't know what the hell it was doing.  &lt;--- not facetious.  the main problem is that although smed and brad had PLAYED MUDs they hadn't ever run one... certainly not a big one like EQ.  they didn't know what ever good GM knows as prime directive... that MMPOG are not STATIC.  Part of what distinguishes a GOOD MUD from a BAD one isn't how the game's originally designed or laid out but how skillfully THE GM changes the balance of the game as its players and player base chang.  Bartle's seminal paper identifies the 4 archetypes of online players and what good GMs would do is ANTICIPATE when they planned a game, how it would change OVER TIME so it would remain fun and balanced as players and content changed... too many gankers in town?  beef up guards.  too much MUDflation? hasten item decay.  not enough players?  add shortterm epic items.  etc etc<br />
<br />
what smed and brad never envisioned was EQ going 5-10 years with 12, 15, 20 expansions.  they never understood that a live team WOULD exist but that they'd mainly be occupied with tuning EXISTING content to new released content.  even if a development team could somehow release balanced, bug-free content that delivered what sony promises, a live team would have to exist to look after larger play balance and gameplay issues that come from 1) raising level cap 2)new added AAs 3)MUDflation 4)competition from other games etc etc<br />
<br />
the problem for me... and for players in general is the fact that from day one, the development team CANNOT release an expansion actually completed.  and the live team CANNOT actually do its job of actually balancing the game and making it fun.  but never think that the live team hasn't done a LOT to improve the game over the years... ironically it's not been any sort of systematic implementation of benefits via THE VISION but individuals who's had pet projects and developed it on their own and championed it through the bureaucracy... although to good effect:<br />
<br />
remember there was a time when there was NO casting bar.  the was no &quot;%T&quot; for you to macro messages.  there was NO auction channel.  there was just the OLD crappy UI with the game screen literally 1/3 of your screen in the middle.  there was NO pet window, no visual representation of what buffs your pet had.  NO numerical health or mana.  ONE experience bar that seemed &quot;busted&quot; as literally some momos wouldn't see movement for literally weeks and people actually PETITIONED.  NO spell wear off message.  NO random.  NO loot message.  A lot of what people mean when they talk about the old school/rpg feel of the game back then is simply the fact that the game WAS clunky like an old RPG you played back in 90 or 95... married to that old interface where you could get one line of text out at a time couldn't macro or announce in-game targets or assist... you WERE playing a MUD.  a lot of the **** going on didn't even appear visually on screen.<br />
<br />
I think even old school players forget what the actual playing experience was like 3 years ago.  I dont think players can appreciate what it's like to sit looking at your spellbook, listening for footsteps because you cant see where the hill giant is that you're kiting.  and you have to time your dots because that's the only way to keep track of when your spells have worn off.  and only knowing from experience if your heals are gonna hit your tank in time because there's no casting bar.<br />
<br />
so no... it wasn't a scam to promise live support.  persay. just gross incompetence.  I suppose you could possibly have basis for a class action suit charging misrepresentation of hundreds of dollars per person in subscription fees... but the live team as it is (of course most of the devs and ALL of the support and executive people wear both hats) HAS been busy... of course mainly just ripping off other game's UI and ideas but it IS something.... dont ever say they haven't done anything</div></div><hr />

the big problem is something new we've never seen before... sony used to be a terrible terrible company with very poor development protocol and very talented people.  now with the game dying it's lost its cache and its corporate diet of feeding people **** at work and running the studio like a college project sends talent fleeing to sigil, arenanet and NC soft.  they used to swamp the live team with so much that it was effectively paralysed from doing any substantial anything, now it seems with OoW and GoD on top of each other the same thing is happening to the development team</div></div><hr />

As much as I like to complain about class balance I do think that class balance is much improved compared to Velious (or heavens forbid, original EQ), both in overall class desirability and power and in regards to content balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do think class balance has improved somewhat in general, but that wasnt what I really was thinking about when I wrote my statement.  What I was thinking of was the expansions themselves.  The first two expansions were solid.  They had a story, they had their own lore, and they worked well (I think).<br />
<br />
Then you had cat people on the moon and Hatfields and Mccoys in outer space.<br />
<br />
Then came PoP.  Generally, an interesting expansion and, from a development standpoint, the best expansion to date.  Its the best expasion because even a year after its release its still the measuring stick by which you are measured as a player (elemental flagged/geared/time geared/farming quarm) even in the current expansion.  But its not that much fun after about a month of flag work, and while the rewards can be good, the un fun things that you get to do to get there outweigh some of the fun (IMO)<br />
<br />
What bothers me the most about the last few expansions  is the tenuous thread that links them.  The Wayfarers Brotherhood just doesnt seem like a good vehicle to base expansions to me.  /shrug  I mean, its interesting, but the link from LoY to LDoN with the Gromzek stone and then into GoD just doenst make sense to me.  Truth be told though, after PoP I stopped looking at the lore in the game, because it all just got silly to me.<br />

-EQ was like it was when the anniversary rolled around a few months ago in that GMs were everywhere in EQ doing something with the player base,<br />
-content was sufficiently tested and debugged before it rolls out,<br />
-quests were not only as important as raiding, but more prominent in the game,<br />
-petitions were answered relatively promptly as opposed to not at all,<br />
-more content like veksar, cazic thule, and plane of mischief was created,<br />
-and developers and PR people actually listened to the player base.<br />

PoP is a terrible expansion.  It's still a measure a year later because of artificial speedbumps.  The flagging system was designed to block player's progress, not provide entertainment.  Trials != content.<br />
<br />

<br />
technicaly its not new content. Its fixed content. Veksar has been sitting around forever but never went live due to map issues which i cant remember off the top of my head. When they were able to fix the problems, it went live is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">&quot;And the company isn't done with the game after this title. There are at least two more expansions planned after OOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think they are REALLY, REALLY trying to outrace the ubers who are eating up content... there's no other rational explanation... sigh.<br />
<br />
PLEASE, for the love of GODS, STOP RELEASING EXPANSIONS!  Can't they just go back to how they were with Kunark/Velious/Luclin, and actually let us enjoy, figure out, and /bug the expansions first?  /sigh<br />
<br />
P.S.  I remember promises about Veksar and rumors about its existance as far back as EQ Classic, so Litgruv is definitely correct.  I guess when they give us Winged Courier in RandomExpansion021, it will be widely known as new content, as well... heck, why not, it's been sooo long  :)<br />
<br />
ANOTHER thing... increasing the size of your world further with a million expansions will NOT help the fact that the past-its-peak Everquest population is already spread so incredibly thin that finding a group pre 51 is a severe headache most of the time (tried makin a newbie on another server a few months back, only to find myself alone with the tumbleweeds in all my ancient hunting grounds). <br />
<br />
First make the remaining EQ populace happy by fixing your content, pump the playerbase up a little, THEN give them more room to play.  We're going to end up with 1000 zones and 1000 people per server, with the forced grouping mechanic still in place.  <br />
<br />
In fact, I'd not be surprised if some of the reason for putting PoP books in was that so many zones were being ignored due to new ones, that people just wanted to skip through them, which is an incredible shame... those zones are EQ history.  Level 65 and never been to Guk?  Shame on you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Not so. I love GoD. In a way it reminds me of my Kunark era days, when you could get into gritty fights where you are barely in controll of the situation, and it feels great to beat it. As opposed to endless grinding in some safe spot that has become the norm. You guys just got soft after SoL/PoP/LDoN pampering.<br />
<br />
So, the pages and pages of problems presented on every classes' message boards are to be ignored?  Ah, says soe, here's someone who loves gates just the way it was, ignore the 'soft, pampered' folks!!  Everquest is a mass market product, tailoring to an upper tier is bad business, forget about whether or not its good gameplay.<br />
I'm not really sure why anyone equates near hair trigger death with enjoyment.  Living on the edge is a rush for a lot of people, but judging from feedback, its not for the majority of players.  This is, after all, our entertainment we're talking about.  Frustration is not fun, not compelling, and ultimately costs soe subscribers.<br />
I'd be all for them having a server just for folks who want to experience a harder challenge.  Make it so even the slightest human mistake would wipe you and everyone around you.  My suspicion is that it wouldn't be very populated, at least not for long.  But, it would give something to do for those who whine about how easy everyone has it now.<br />
Games should be easy to play, its entertainment.  Thats different from not challenging.  Would you go to a movie where you had to turn the spool with a handcrank?  Sure would be 'hard', but would it be enjoyable?  And yet, people go back again and again to watch a good movie even though its 'easy'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">The most rational explanation is simply that the twice-yearly charges for expansions are increasingly relied on in the profit expectations of SOE.  <br />
<br />
Lets remember that Sony is a Japanese company and that Japan for most of the last 12 years has been in a long recession, or at least a stop-start economy that was having real problems.  To a certain extent I don't blame them for doing whatever they can to make money, I just simply want a product that does something for most players, the way Kunark or LDON did, that's all I ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Really, GoD isn't that hard. Sure, I have a bit better equipment so it's easier for me, but there are places where the average equipped player can go to. Ferubi has elemental level experiece. Mobs there hit a little bit harder, but have less hps than the elemental mob. Nothing in Riwwi summons.<br />
<br />
        It's not only the challenge ,there something more important : the fun. GoD is NOT fun . With lvl 70 it will ony be worst. Fun raid encounter are in PoP and they will be trivial . lvl Increase is a so bad choice  :(</div></div><hr />

Nicely said. Pop is the expansion that most noticably &quot;broke&quot; the game. Its not all bad but the mistakes it made had to be fixed in consequent expansions ie, Ldon for the grouping game, GoD for lower raid sizes. The divide between the raider and the grouper is still being fixed. (although it seems the raiders say GoD is the mythical fix while casuals don't seem to agree.)<br />
Not being negative though, I think each new expansion is a step in the right direction, even componentially it being essentially a fix, OoW while perhaps desperately announced in  light of its competitors has some nice ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I don't talk about pop trial or pathetic pop zone (sony is unabled to make good zone)  ...ect but about pop boss encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Sumdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">We shaman have some very real issues, no doubt about it. I'm fairly new to these boards (I've only been reading them for about eight months), I rarely post. But like a few others, the I'm not playing anymore, shaman suck and the new expansion sucks people are really starting to turn me away from this place. Everything evolves or it is run over by something more adapted. Of course the game doesn't hold the fascination it once did for you. Nature of the beast, nothing is ever as good as it was the first time... Why bother posting about how something sucks if you aren't even taking the time to investigate it yourself. Problems in MMORPG's isn't isolated to EQ, nor is it something new. One thing is for sure, if your opinions are based on what you read and not what you do, its pure hearsay, and I they don't hold much weight. Wanna bitch about whats new? Participate! Kinda like voting... if you dont vote, I dont give a damn what you think of the president...</div></div><hr />

I used to go into the caves in Plane of Earth for experience. I used to see how far we can get into Sol Ro's tower with just me, a wizard and a paladin. I like a challenge.<br />
<br />
Yet I hate large parts of GoD.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is because incredibly onsided content does not equal a challenge? Maybe it is because making CRs more painful does not equal a challenge? Maybe because a select few classes having it a lot easier then the rest does not equal a challenge? Maybe it is because making half of my spells worthless does not equal a challenge?<br />
<br />
Or maybe it is a combination of all of the above.<br />
<br />
As to this expansion having a Kunark feel . . . well, I see trains again but that is about it. I remember naked clerics doing CRs in Sebilis - in GoD they cannot even reach the zone. I remember my healing actually making HPs go up instead of making them go down slightly slower. I remember slow actually being worth casting. I remember being able to tank. I remember wiping not because of some named outhealing the cleric's fastest heals on a plate tank but because we ran out of mana and repops on top of us.<br />
<br />
GoD is nothing like what I remember from Kunark.<br />
<br />
But I guess I am just a pampered spoiled brat, not knowing what is good for me. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I admit, I'll all for making things fun, yet difficult, to a point. However, considering the majority of the player base is considered &quot;casual&quot;, and with the crappy experience rates in LDoN, a death can be a huge loss without a cleric and can easily set you back at least 2 hours. As a result, the &quot;casual player&quot; isn't going to take the risk of something that'll more than likely take 'em out in 1 round, if they only have 2 hours, considering with how it is anymore, it'll take 2 hours just to get to your corpse, let alone 2 more hours trying to gain the experience back because of no resurrecting classes around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">So Murtak, basically what you are saying is that it is just too hard for you? I can understand that. Going into fights without appropriate class types of course will make it seem more difficult. Using your example, going into sol ro with yourself, a wizard and a necro would make it much more difficult. If you are going to fight trash for xp or specifically going after a named, you need an appropriate tank, healer and bla bla  bla. Trying to do it without isnt going to work to well, but then it wouldnt work to well in Sol rol either.<br />
<br />
I think your big beef is that your role in GoD is somewhat different from before, and you can't adapt to that. You tend to focus in on those functions that you could perform in other situations, but not on some new situation, at least not to the same degree. But that is true for most classes to a greater or lesser extent. With every expansion all classes have undergone waxing and waning of their relative importance, it is part of the evolution of the game and is cyclic in nature. Once warriors were top of the heap, then it was knights, now apparently it is warriors again. No doubt sometime in the future it will be knights again. Thats the way it goes.<br />
<br />
There aren't any classes which contribute nothing to a group (unless they are afk or something like that). Of course one could play the numbers game and come up with the most efficient combination, but that doesn't mean that other combinations are useless. They are just less efficient. And the fact that one is not part of that most efficient combo doesnt make you useless, except in your own mind.<br />
<br />
On the cleric thing, I'm not aware of any xp zone in GoD a cleric couldnt reach naked as long as they are taking standard traveling precautions. At least, our clerics have no problems, perhaps your guild clerics are different.<br />
<br />
In GoD for the first time in a very long time groups are having to face hard nail biting encounters where you do or die. The last time that really happened was in kunark/velious.</div></div><hr />

When I made my post, I wasnt thinking about the expansions from strictly a players point of view.  I happen to agree that most of the speedbumps, as you call them, are counterproductive for all but the most vigourous (those that willingly spend dozens of hours a day) of players.  What I meant was that from a development standpoint PoP was one of the better, if not the best, expansions to date. <br />
<br />
How long did it take your servers uber guilds to break Time?  On my server it took about 8 months.  A good portion of that time was because of unfinished content but Im not going to comment on that, even though that was a hinderance to most top guilds.  Here we stand less than 2 months into GoD and already my server has 2 guilds nearing the end of GoD content.  One of the reasons for that is the insane gearing that happened because of PoP, but Im not ready to dismiss the idea that guilds are already nearing the end of GoD because the scope of GoD wasnt near that of PoP.  True, there were speedbumps put into place (Trials and insane mob DPS stand out here) but by and large most of the PoP style requirements of 100+ PC's throwing themselves at gods/boss mobs were not to be found.<br />
<br />
Im not saying that I like PoP all that much.  There are parts of PoP that I find interesting and good.  Unfortuantly, not all the parts that are interesting are good, and not all the parts that are good are interesting.  When I log in to play I want to go exploring and test myself against some of the mobs out there; having to get 99 of my friends together to go bash and grind our collective heads against content isnt high on my list of things to do.  While I havent explored much of GoD (a trial or two and some exping in Ferubi, quimini and Barindu) I find, while much harder than anyting Ive been up against yet, its much more satisfying than an equal number of PoP zones.  It reminds me of places like the Kael plate cycles and arena when I first got there and running through Sebilis for the first time.</div></div><hr />
