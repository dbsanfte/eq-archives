<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fieryfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone list some items with extended affliction 3, ive seen a few with EA2 but at 49 that wont help much. Also my profile is in my sig (Karash) is there anything i might be able to trade for something with EA3?  Thanks for you help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can find a list at http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2749<br />
<br />
X * Extended Affliction III * Coldain Military Wristguard  being the most reasonably obtainable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fieryfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Awesome thanks i should have used search first hehe thanks for the link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As the above said, the coldain military is definately the easiest to get. Bring along a druid friend or something, and you should be able to easily duo it. If you're patient, it's probably soloable.<br />
<br />
Me, at 49, and a friend, 60 druid, did him easily. Total pushover. He snared, dotted, and camped to avoid the (small) faction hit. I tossed an ebolt and scourge, and that pretty much killed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Korf Brokenhammer. What a pushover. Easily soloable and light blue to 60. One Bane of Nife, One Curse of Spirits and Pet. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">at 55 i think it was without bane etc..no epic no jbb it was shocking how hard he actually was i expected like one ebolt dog and me to kikk easy and wasnt that easy...so he's harder then you think. &lt;shrugs&gt;</div></div><hr />
