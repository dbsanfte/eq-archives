As there is no message, but hey to each his own I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The opinion cited several artistically significant instances in which teen-age sex was portrayed, including William Shakespeare's play &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet,&quot; and the recent movies &quot;Traffic&quot; and &quot;American Beauty.&quot; <br />
While I agree we need laws to protect children from predatory behavior, telling people what they can write in fiction is beyond the scope of protection, and qualifies as suppression of free speech. Most Supreme Court decisions are 5-4. The fact that this one was 6-3 is significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bear in mind that this decision explicitly addresses adults made up to look as if they are minors. It does not address actual child pornography and it does not address the issue of limiting access by minors to pornography. In my opinion the court made the correct decision for this specific scenario.</div></div><hr />

And even then in the area of documentary I'd be inclined to allow pictures to be permissable as they are not there for the sexual enjoyment of the reader but as a photographic transmission of information usually conveying the horrors of such things.<br />
<br />
The other problem I'm having lately is the prosecution of people who own copies of child porn not of their creation either on computer or on paper.  The people who need to be stopped are the producers of this crap and while I disagree with the choices in viewing/reading of child porn buyers I'm not sure I agree that it should be illegal to own copies of said material just should be illegal to produce said materials.</div></div><hr />

I'm somewhat torn on this issue. I'm not a big porn viewer of any kind, but I can understand where mistakes can be made quite easily on the part of the user. The person downloading it doesn't KNOW what it is until it is already on his (or her) hard drive, or thinks that the actors are actually 18. There's no way to really prove intent when seeing that someone has downloaded child porn. I know that when seeking certain MPG files, I've inadvertantly downloaded things that are quite questionable, just because the name didn't make clear what I was going to see.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, those that make money selling child porn wouldn't be in business without customers. You start making it undesirable to be one of those customers, and at least they aren't making as much money on it any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly its too easy to pass a 17 or even 16 or 15 year old off as 18 which is the legal age.<br />
<br />
The provider could lie about the age of the &quot;model&quot; and yet the downloader would be nailed.  The downloader was attempting to be lawful (if not morally corrupt) but was duped by the supplier which is technically in any other market misrepresentation and therefore the supplier is completely liable and the buyer isn't.<br />
<br />
Secondly its WIDE open door for abuse and blackmail.  Say the government or some other party wanted to frame or blackmail a person they could upload pictures of very small size say a JPG into a crowded and rarely looked at directory say one of the system directories and then call the authorities on it.<br />
<br />
The real owner of the system never downloaded the stuff and never wanted the stuff but simply because its on his machine he can be arrested.<br />
<br />
More over in applying this a hardcopy found in a home.  Someone breaks into the house while you are not there plants a magazine in your dusty bookshelf then calls the cops.<br />
<br />
Mainly because of the Social backlash against this kind of stuff even if the pictures were found to be a plant you still show up with a warning on your permanant record and you would run a high risk of being a pariah if it got out in the public.  The way the laws are set up and the way its handled essentially makes you guilty before proven innocent.<br />
<br />
Like I said morally I think a lot of the child pornography law is dead on... but the technical side of things makes this hard to enforce and easy to abuse.</div></div><hr />

Shall we go back to the movie ratings question?:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarkaukar</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I have read, most child porn is just that, child porn.  Not teenager porn, but children that are under the age of 12-13, and by looking at them, there isnt any doubt about their age.<br />
<br />
One can not compare a 15-16yr who is made up to look older to a 10yr old, or a 18yr made to look younger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a movie has a reason to have child porn in it, i dont mind them using computers to generate children or using an 18 year old actor that looks younger etc. <br />
<br />
Hell if a porn wants to have children in it fine as long as they are computer generated or 18+ made to look younger.  <br />
<br />
As long as there not really using children, i dont care. <br />
<br />
I think what the supreme court did is good.</div></div><hr />
