<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought kitties couldn't wear the vest, is this something they changed?<br />
<br />
Or is it that I am being over anaylitic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kitties have always been able to wear the vest. The tunic is the one we don't have access too.<br />
<br />
The vest was put in specifically for us kitties as it includes our classes only and has a required level of 51 (to prevent kitty twinks I'm guessing).<br />
<br />
It is also ultra friggen rare. Took me months to find one and when I did ding 60 I sold it for a very nice premium over the price of the regular fungi even with its limitations (got 150k for it). <br />
<br />
I have seen two on the market since the bazaar went in, including mine.</div></div><hr />
