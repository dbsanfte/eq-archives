<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been dodging the game since I had heard it came out, and now after looking at some of the info on the game I really want to play it..How do I get ahold of it, is it live yet?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Certainly isnt live yet. But its still atleast as bugfree in beta as EQ is now. And its far more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Some people think that it will be released in november. So far Blizzard have said they intend to release in the US first AND require that people sign up with a US address and a US creditcard giving all sorts of lame explanations for why this should be neccessary. A month or two later it should be released in Europe and &quot;some time&quot; after that it should be able for non-US people to request to be moved to play on US servers. Lots of people are not too happy about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nobody knows, and you get it with money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The WoW pre-order boxes showed up at Best Buy this week - that might give you a hint of how long until it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There have been lots of mid-november release dates floating around for some time now.  Open beta sign-ups are coming soon and open beta will be a great chance to try the game if you haven't.<br />
<br />
I would highly, highly recommend trying it in open beta.  WoW is incredibly fun.  Even if you're not that interested in it and have no intention of buying it I'd recommend trying it just to have some fun for a few days.  It's fun starting at level 1 - it's not a game where you feel like you have to level up to &quot;get to the good stuff&quot; so even playing as an open beta noob will be enjoyable.<br />
<br />
WoW will be available via retail purchase.  They have no plans for download/purchase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">26th november for US and korea players <br />
<br />
27th january for EU players <br />
<br />
( got a email about it from the place where i preordered it saying that EU players are baiscly F..... and have to wait 2 months more ... got the 2 release dates in the same mail ) <br />
<br />
there was somthing about EU players being able to play at the same time as the US ones if they have a beta box ... i have no idea what that is though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So far Blizzard have said they intend to release in the US first AND require that people sign up with a US address and a US creditcard giving all sorts of lame explanations for why this should be neccessary.<br />
<br />
you may thing it is lame but you havent taken everything into account then ... the reason to keep US / EU and a few other places seperate is that you have a better ping to the severs ( less lag ) so people dont bitch about the game being laggy ... you are also able to have support centers located in that area that can deal with local problems in the prime time of that area <br />
<br />
yes it also means that people are unable to play with some friends and i agree that is a bad thing ... but not as bad as having serious problems playing the game and no support what so ever since it is allways closed when you are able to play and having a massiv amount of korean players flooding other servers playing IGN with items ( yes the last part was a generealised and somthing i havent experienced personally but only read about )</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is though that I live in Europe and I am able to  play the beta on the US servers just fine now. Much better than EQ.<br />
<br />
And if I had a choice between having local support and being able to play with my friends in the US I know what I would choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Open beta will probably start next week sometime. Since they closed down the closed beta account creation servers on Friday. The Open beta will most likely last a month, and we are looking at release at around the end of Nov.  Also they have mentioned a couple of times that it will be released this year for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as you said the connection is better than EQ in beta ... hard to tell how it is going to be when all servers are up are running ... and some people still use old 56k modems ... <br />
<br />
and yes a great number of people would rather play with their friends than on a &quot;local&quot; server ... how ever i think that they count on having a low average age atleast in the begining of the game that could be another reason to have local support since young players might be unable to contact oversea support and to fix some of the basicly problems others might find trivel</div></div><hr />

Where'd you see that Div?  I've been looking for a source for a while now to link my guildies to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">lol.  so yourself a favor and ignore anything you read about preorders from retailers.<br />
<br />
I can't quote you the exact source but I did read first hand multiple instances of statements from WoW reps that clearly pointed to US retail before year's end.<br />
<br />
As well there are many many signs that point to impending retail; ie announcement that they are about to take sign ups for open beta.<br />
<br />
Ultimately your best and only definitive resource is:<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/</div></div><hr />

If you go to www.worldofwarcraft.com and go to the news archive and find the news post where it says &quot;World of Warcraft Stress Test Beta Has Ended - Block on 09/12/04&quot;. The news post states:<br />
<br />
As of 6:00pm PDT, the World of Warcraft stress test beta has come to an end. The past week and a half proved extremely helpful to us in evaluating the performance of our game infrastructure under heavy loads, and we hope that all of the stress testers enjoyed their sneak peek of World of Warcraft during that time.<br />
<br />
With the end of the stress test beta comes the end of the stress test contest. We'll be notifying the 576 winners (top 3 players of each class, of each faction, on each of the 12 stress test beta servers) as soon as possible, and in addition to those winners, we will also be selecting as contest winners not just the 48 players who would have won had the contest ended at the original deadline (top 3 players of each class, of each faction, across all stress test beta servers), but an additional 96 players who were next in line at that time (next 6 players of each class, of each faction, across all stress test beta servers).<br />
<br />
Should any of the players who would have won at the original contest deadline also be among the 576 selected based on the updated Sunday deadline, we will select the next person down on the list to avoid having duplicate contest winners. That makes a total of 720 players moving on into the closed beta test! All contest winners will be notified by Blizzard as soon as possible, so please do not contact Blizzard to inquire about the contest results.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all of you for participating in the World of Warcraft stress test beta. We look forward to seeing you again online in either the closed beta test or the upcoming open beta test, as well as in the retail version of World of Warcraft when it launches later this year! <br />
<br />
There was a few other mentions of this date, I think also somewhere when they explained that in Europe the game wont go retail this year but rather a few months after it goes retail in North America and Korea.</div></div><hr />

Tigole just posted that the next push is 2-3 weeks away and that open beta will NOT be staring before that push.</div></div><hr />

Link to post please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Div - I need to pass that on to the gang.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I donno where you saw that, but I just searched for Tigole's posts on the WoW msg board and I can't find any post that states that. The last one he posted is about respawn tweaks in Scholomance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Same here Div (hence why I asked for a link :)). Tig may have posted on one of the fansite forums.<br />
<br />
Even so, Tyren posted in HERE which indicates it may be very soon after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yea stygiana must have gotten confused with an older post or something. If Tigole did post on another forum (most likely FoH or LoS forums) I am sure we would have seen links about it somewhere.<br />
<br />
Still I hope OB gets released this week so I have something to do with my spare time heh :)</div></div><hr />

Anyway, printed posters have been seen with 15th Nov printed on them.</div></div><hr />

I talked to couple different game stores and they are quoting Nov 15th. I know they are wrong alot but thats what they are saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a small sample of upcoming stuff:<br />
<br />
--Hunter Talents and imrpovements<br />
--Pally Talents and improvenments (very cool changes!)<br />
--Some *awesome* changes to the warrior<br />
--Tons of tradeskill polish<br />
--Lots more quests... newbie zone polish, plus additional Horde content in the re-vamped Kalimdor zones (ashenvale, desolace, stonetalon, etc.)<br />
--More flight paths<br />
--More Graveyards<br />
--Onyxia &gt;=]</div></div><hr />
