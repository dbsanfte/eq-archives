At level 39 we get a proc where it's a buff that has a chance to go off on every swing we get another one at 52 and another one at 55.  Basically I hardly ever use the dmg procs durring a raid due to the agro they produce, but I use Jolting Blades alot.<br />
<br />
k it all boils down to when I have 2 procs up such as Call Of Fire and Earthcaller from my main hand it feels a though when the game decides it's time for me to proc only 1 of these proc and they're sharing the same proc % table.  I base this more on when I get booned and have 255 dex.  I do notice that yes I am procing a lot more, but the procs are a mix of the Lifetap and EC.  I don't have logs to back it up or prove it, but I tend to notice that I do better with focus and a dex of 190 procing Earthcall or Conflageration (steel hilted flint dagger), then asking for boon and getting 255dex but with a second proc attached to it.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone else feel that this is true where procs share 1 % table or do you guys feel that each proc has it's own % to proc table?</div></div><hr />

I have been soloing a lot of late to try to make my final level and was using Call of Fire to help increase the damage. I notice what Keyan notice to the point of thinking that Call of Fire was reducing the chance of Earthcall from proccing. Most upsetting if this was the case because a soloing ranger really needs to have Earthcall proc as soon as possible. :)<br />

Period.  If the chance is successful, there is then a second internal /random to determine which of your procs will fire.  Now, whether there is a greater chance of one proc firing over another, I cannot say.  <br />
<br />
So, yes, in a sense, having a second proc up will reduce the number of times either will proc.  Basically, you will proc the same number of times as normal, but that number will be spread over both effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot say that CoF decreases the chance of Earthcall going off, cause I have been in way too many fights where Earthcall was the only proc, and it didn't go off for two fights in a row.  <br />
<br />
So I would say that one doesn't have anythin to do with the other.  Earthcall might go off early, it might go off late, it might not go off.  Doesn't change with CoF.</div></div><hr />

In fact, I think I remember VI actually saying that each weeapon has it's own percentage rate for proccing, so i assumed the spells just work the same way and have their own percentage rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd noticed this awhile ago, but dismissed it as myself just imagining it. I'm stil not convinced weapons proc any less due to one of those buffs, but I can see how it might happen in the code.<br />
<br />
1)Weapon swings.<br />
2)Does Call of Fire proc? Yes, go to step 4. No, go to step 3.<br />
3)Does Earthcall proc? Yes, go to step 5, No, go to step 7.<br />
4)Cast Call of Fire. Go to step 6.<br />
5)Cast Earthcall. Go to step 6.<br />
6)Resolve spell effect.<br />
7)Resolve next attack and repeat from step 1.<br />
<br />
In other words, I expect only one spell effect can be produced by a single action (attack in this case) and Call of Fire just happens to be the first one checked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was around 44ish...I had just gotten my FBSS *woot!* and was threeboxing at the giant fort in FV. Was using two yak proc weapons (SSoY, DHY) and also using Call of Sky.<br />
<br />
Snare-pulled a verdant back to the group.<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
<br />
Opened up the fight with double attack and dual-wield both firing on the opening round. The result?<br />
<br />
Four MISSED melee attacks and EIGHT, count 'em EIGHT procs! Each attack somehow procced Yak AND Call of Sky even though the melee had missed completely!<br />
<br />
*sigh* I did manage to SS it, but the drive storing it died about a month later. Never heard of that ever hapening since then either.</div></div><hr />

When praying for a swarmcaller proc, I always click off &quot;Call of Sky&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walkerofplains</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe another question about procs =\  I was under the impression that procs are all or nothing.  The last major procing weapon that I had was a flux bladed axe and never did I ever proc for 20 or so.  With a steel bladed flint dagger which procs 625 I've noticed on mobs in ssara temple or slimes in CT I can proc for 25dmg - 400dmg on a mob, although while fighting in HS, seb, or any older world (preluclin) it's never been resisted and never been partially resisted.  Should it be like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pipswich</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I habitually put call of sky or JB up if I do not want to proc something else.   I decided while soloing shrooms in FG that I could almost never slow the dern things if I used another cast on proc.  Its not parsing but until I see parses I am gonna behave like Pavlov's dog's were smart enough too..  and leave cof and jb unmemed and uncast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greym</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a small point that refers to the original post, boon overwrites call of sky, so it will never go off if you have boon on. Not sure but i belive it does the same for the level 54 jolt spell as well. Its a stacking issue, as boon has the lifetap proc built in. Inate weapon procs do work with boon however.</div></div><hr />

The spell message says &quot;your weapons&quot; are covered in rolling flames, or something similar.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't ever have CoF up when soloing because I am just not sure how this works, like others have mentioned already.<br />
<br />
Just tell us Verant :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamas</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a firm believer that if you're using a proc weapon and actually want it to proc, don't use call of sky/fire. <br />
<br />
As an example I was in Velk's the other night and another ranger was using a Swarmcaller and getting the slows off fairly often. Then he must have had call of fire envy or something because he cast call of sky, and after awhile I noticed no more tagar procs on the mobs, but was seeing the &quot;concussion of air&quot; message occasionally.  I told him that if he wanted to land the slow, to remove call of sky, which he did, and immediately began to proc tagar's again. I had noticed the same thing happen to me the day before when also relying on a SC to do slows for my group; once I remembered to remove call of fire, I began to proc slows more often.<br />
<br />
While either *can* proc, it seems to me that the spell-imbued procs have a greater chance of occurring than innate weapons procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People 'feeling' that it procs more or less really isn't a reliable measure.  Procs are extremely random as it is, and if you're looking for an Earthcall proc and getting a few CoFire procs, you're going to take more note of that situation than if you just get an EC proc early. *shrug*<br />
<br />
I've not noticed any differences with EC procs when soloing shrooms, whether I had Call of Fire up or not.  Certainly you can go a whole fight with no procs without COF up, and proc lots even with COF up.</div></div><hr />

What I wonder is how can you know for sure?  Because Earthcall could go off on first swing, and Call of Fire go off on the double attack or off of one of the swings in the offhand that might have gone off.<br />
<br />
I know you don't even have to have weapons equiped for Call of Fire to go off because I use it in Hand to Hand fights to get the edge :D  So my fists proc.  What I don't know and haven't bothered to test is, will kick create a proc?</div></div><hr />

If I saw it now I would presume it was a client timer/display problem as I would have expected to see it rarely but regularly - not never.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriana</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So.<br />
<br />
I soloed a bunch of mushrooms last night without CoF to see if Earthcall would proc more that with CoF up at the same time.<br />
<br />
I still had fights where it would only proc at the end, and a bunch of fights where is procced in the middle, and some where it didn't proc at all.  And that is with 159 Dex, which I don't think is too shabby.<br />
<br />
Looked to be about the same to me as when I had Cof up.  So I will keep both up as I have done in the past.  CoF going off 8 to 10 times in a fight adds up to a decent amount of free damage.  After Earthcall procs I swap out Earthcaller for a Rev Whip to get more procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK.. I paid a lot of attention to this when I first got Call of Sky, as I was dual wielding proccing weapons (yay DHY/Flamesong!). Proc buffs can proc off either weapon (just try using two different weapon types, the proc happens before the attack). Also I did not notice any significant decrease in flamesong/ykesha procs while CoSing, so I believe they are independant. I have, however, never personally seen 2 procs off the same swing. I've also never seen 2 procs on a double attack, one for each swing.<br />
<br />
It should be noted (and this I actually parsed): each proc buff (and I assume proccing weapons, we just can't test it as easily since it's hard to find different weapons with the same proc) procs with a percentage that is modified by the delay of the weapon. So slower weapons will proc on a higher percentage of swings than faster ones, such that no matter what weapon you use, you will get, on average, a similar amount of procs in a given amount of time. So switching to a rev whip &quot;to get more procs&quot; with CoS/JB/CoF doesn't do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shion graywords</div><div class="date">05-30-2002, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just recently borrowed a Steel hilted flint dagger.  Now ive been using it full time, since its new to me to determine its usefullness.  It usually procs once per fight, on greens, so the fights werent that long.  However since i was Farming faction on greens, I dont bother refreshing Call of sky all the time.  Now.. when I actually put Call of sky back on, I went 4 or 5 fights in a row with no proc.  <br />
<br />
I think that they CAN both proc, that the proc percentage rate from your weapon is decreased.  <br />
<br />
Therefore if your Proc percentage rate was 8%, then call of sky would take an amount of that percentage for itself, since that is your BASE proc rate, based on your dexterity.  therefore i would imagine if this assumption were correct, that the &quot;call of XXX&quot; effects took more of you proc percentage then 50%.  perhaps more like 60%~call of sky, 40%~ weapon proc.  Which would explain why the &quot;call of XXX&quot; spells go off more than the weapon procs..<br />
<br />
Note: they could both proc, but you would have a significantly less chance of procing with the &quot;call of XXX&quot; spell up.<br />
<br />
That of course is only my theory, in which I have no evidence to support it either way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I haven't logged any of this, just observed it.<br />

For Earthcaller, I get an unusual number of procs on the first swing when I hit autoattack. I also seem to have a significantly higher chance to proc immediately after casting snare.</div></div><hr />

Screenshot, please.<br />
<br />
I've been religiously watching my text go by looking for this exact event since the day Luclin released, and I have never seen it happen, over the course of many many thousands, perhaps millions, of swings.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying it has never happened for me, and given the failure of anyone to ever produce a log entry or sceenshot of it happening, I reserve the right to have tremendous doubt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finlin</div><div class="date">05-30-2002, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is impossible to fire two procs on the same hit (my main is a lvl 60 SK and I have never seen it happen since I got our proc spell... and that was awhile ago... over a year at this point =p).<br />
<br />
Think someone said this before earlier in the thread but my personal opinion is this is how it works:<br />
<br />
Roll for proc buff proc... <br />
if it is successful fire buff proc<br />
if it is not successful roll for weapon proc<br />
if it is successful fire weap proc<br />
<br />
So you will never get both... if the first proc goes off it never rolls the for the second proc... this means that it seems like your weapon proc rate decreases when you buff yourself with a proc... and it does slightly... because all the times you successfully roll the first proc you miss a chance at the second proc... and due to the streaky nature of the random number generator if it was possible to proc both at the same time... you would probably see that ALOT more then you would think... that is why I positive you can't proc both (and if you did it was probably a bug of some kind)<br />
<br />
Couple other random notes:<br />
After I cast a spell... there seems to be a MUCH greater chance of my buff proc firing immediately after (not sure why but I am a firm believer that casting a spell gives you a better chance of procing)<br />
<br />
Proc rate is tied to weapon speed sooo... if you are slowed you should still proc the same number of times over the course of a min as if you were hasted; therefore, you get a greater per swing proc rate while slowed... I would even go so far as to say that you tend to proc more times per min while slowed... maybe there forumla has a bias towards slower weaps... but at the very least when hasted you proc less per swing and while slowed more per swing; however, in general you should still proc the same amount of times per min<br />

Weapon procs are of course Dex related and I think use a different system than buff type procs personally.  I dont have proof to back this claim at all, but just what Ive seemed to notice.</div></div><hr />

They both have Fiery Defenders.  They are both human and have horrid dexterity.<br />
<br />
What I've noticed that struck me as odd is, the one main tanking proc'd a LOT more often with FD than the one not main tanking.<br />
So, we decided to try somethin.  Paladins taunt using Taunt, Flash of Light and Stuns pretty much.  The one main tanking casts quite a bit more often than the one not main tanking.<br />
<br />
This got me to thinking, I started casting meaningless spells during fights right at the beginning and have noticed my proc rate with Earthcaller and Call of Fire go up.<br />
<br />
Whether this is merely a perception thing, I don't know.  Just seems to be the way it is.  When I solo, I cast flamelick 2 or 3 times in the beginning and shortly thereafter an Earthcaller proc happens or Call of Fire proc occurs.</div></div><hr />

Its alot like D&amp;D...you have an ability and in order to perform you have to &quot;roll&quot; a check. You add in all your modifiers that pertain to that skill and then you roll the dice. If the number is higher than the action requires then the action is performed. EQ uses the same system to perform DW checks, Procs, Successful hits, ETC. The number rolled is of course generated by a random number generator, so that much of it is random. <br />

Assuming you are dual wielding both hands have a chance to proc tho main hand has the higher chance due to more swings I suppose. Is the Earthcaller in Main or off hand?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kensei</div><div class="date">07-07-2002, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never seen two procs on the same swing, which I would expect given how many levels I've matched spell procs with weapon procs. Sequential swings, yes, not sure if I've had a proc for both swings of a double attack. I would have expected to see that happen if it were possible, so until I actually see it happen or see a screenshot of it I have to assume that any anecdotes reported are due to faulty memory (no offense meant).<br />
<br />
However, I've also seen no evidence that having CoS/F up reduces Swarmcaller procs, and I assume that the same applies to Earthcaller. Some weapons proc more than others - my Frostbringer procs a lot more than Swarmcaller - and spell procs happen more often yet. <br />
<br />
This suggests that even though my observations are that having a proc buff up doesn't seem to affect the rate of slow procs, there may well be some restriction on multiple procs on the same weapon, and if so that could affect the rate of SC/EC procs, depending on what has precedence. Unfortunately, as far as I know no one has done a sustained test of this, only tried it both ways and developed an impression of how it works. Without doing the work, the best answer you'll get is opinion.</div></div><hr />

Maybe its just my luck, but all the call of sky procs I've seen were from my main hand weapon when I used two different types.  Now, both are slashing, so I can't tell . . .</div></div><hr />

I've also noticed that I tend to proc a lot more right after casting a spell, or on the first swing.  I guess I will go do some shroom soloing and mabey cast Tangling Weeds with Call of Fire up and see how well that works out :)</div></div><hr />

I have had a few I thought were double procs, but then when you go back and check the log file, you find that it was on two sequential hits.<br />
<br />
If the proc rate is 3%, then chance of a double proc is about 0.09%, or about 1 in 1100 swings.  We should be seeing a double proc every 15 minutes or so if there were double procs.<br />
<br />
Since NO ONE see double procs every 15 mins or so, the inescapable conclusion must be: there are none!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norwolf</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two parts on this post:<br />
<br />
1) my main intent is to find if there has been some rate of Proc assigned  based on a single swing and 1 Prof effect in relation to Dex.<br />
<br />
While it seems to be common knowlage that Dex effects the rate at what you &quot;proc&quot; and there have been theories as to common hurtles in Dex to the Dro Rate [100, 150, etc.] I have not found a discussion or post on Proc rate in relation to Dex.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end I'll Prob log and find out some numbers myself, however I was just looking to see if someone had before [search turned up minimal information]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) As to the topic on the of having multiple procs... it has been my experance in using CoS in conjunction with a Proc weapon [DHoY, Lupine, Swarmcaller, Praetor's Blade of Debility ] that I have NOT noticed a negitive effect on the Proc rates and have innumerable times had multiple procs.<br />
<br />
As a side note, the reason I am doing this is because I firmly believe that our natural &quot;speed&quot;, Proc spells and weapons are all tools that are part of being a ranger and should be taken advantage of... and jolted away  :-)<br />
<br />
Edit add--- one post of late had a proc rate of ~1.17% with a 133 dex.  my question is at 150 or 170 or 200 what is the proc rate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walkerofplains</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow my post still lives :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
procced both Togor's and CallofSkyEffect on the same swing (wasn't a double attack).......<br />
<br />
Pretty sure they're on seperate tables</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too won't believe it until I see a screen shot.  One thing I have seen is a, &quot;Your spell has been interrupted&quot; or a, &quot;You have not recovered yet&quot; message immediately after a proc goes off.  This makes me think that either CoF and my weapon tried to proc together and one interrupted the other or they tried to proc back-to-back and they didn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowflower</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see far too many instances of call of sky procing before(on the same swing maybe, need to check logs) or after a weapon proc to believe they each dont get their own roll.<br />
<br />
VI has the ability to modify the proc rate on weapons individually which might make it appear the 'call of sky' type spells seem to be hogging your procs because the spell has a higher chance of going off as opposed to the weapon perhaps.<br />
<br />
I know for certain I don't see less weapon procs because of CoS since I have a good feel for my average proc rate with or without CoS using salindrite/shfd combo.<br />
<br />
Anyway i'll check logs and see if call of sky is proc'ing on the same second a mainhand proc is.</div></div><hr />
