<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Shamans,<br />
<br />
I just finished taking out Kirn with 2 very powerful groups. It was like taking candy from a baby. But now my next step is Neh'Ashiir .<br />
<br />
Is there a walk-through on getting to her and taking her out? I checked a few epic walk throughs, but did not see anything on her. I am just wondering if she is anything like Kirn where you need at least 2 groups to get to her? Or, can one group of 50 to 61 take her out after I turn in the ring?<br />
<br />
Thank you all very much<br />

I've done it with 2 groups 50-60, but I think one group 55-60 would work too. Need a rogue to unlock doors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must have overlooked a couple post here, so I did read them and yes, it seems that having 2 groups would be just fine. I appreciate your response and will work on this very soon.<br />

Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did a trip up to (and past) Neh'Ashiir with one non-uber group... 60 chanter, 60 shaman (me), 59 paladin, 61 rogue, 58 ranger... for the chanter's epic Wraith of Jaxion.  Note: no cleric, no warrior... it was very easy.  2 groups 50+ should have no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In order to get Neh'Ashirr you need to fight through the reaver house and out onto the &quot;sky ramp&quot; where there are 3 huts.  The very last hut has a single reaver, this is the one that will spawn Neh'Ashirr once killed.  If youre looking at a map perhaps they wil have the enchanter epic mob labeled at the last hut, that is the same hut with the reaver you want.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you don't have a rogue, you can get to the sky ramp using g-flux :)<br />
<br />
Mind you if you're going after Neh'Ashir this is useless advice, as her building also has a locked door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We were killing her for Mage staffs over and over, with one cleric(56), one mage(58), myself...56 shaman at the time a druid mid 50s, and a chanter or wizard for gflux.  We had no rogue, g-fluxed up and wolf formed to pull Neh's Reaver with the Mages Malosini.  Then the mage just bound on top of the hut before Neh's and would CoTH us up there for about 2 weeks until all of our mages had their staffs.<br />
<br />
One group with a good tank and cleric can easily take out Neh and the Reavers.  Mage pets do even better for some reason...</div></div><hr />
