<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been messing with my EQ settings to get optimal performace. There are a lot of settings and tricks to getting EQ to run just the way you like it.<br />
<br />
I recently found out about editing the datarate.txt file, I changed it from 5 to 8, seemed to really help a lot.<br />
<br />
I want to invite everyone to post what you've done to make EQ work great for you or any tips or tricks you know about. Post anything about settings you can change within the game, settings you can change in the eqclient.ini or any other files, or settings to your system to make EQ run better.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this thread will be a good resource.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Upgrade your PC and graphics<br />
<br />
Still jerky in a lot of Luclin (and I am on a P4 1.9ghz, 512meg ram, GForce 4 128meg, cable modem, etc).<br />
<br />
2. Turn off the new character models:<br />
A. They're resource hogs<br />
B. They're FUGLY!!! (especially my Troll.  I miss my little squatty, waddly, butt-scratcher :) ))<br />
<br />
3.  Turn off spell effects (of course as a Shammy I am always chewing on myself, and that blue cloud always around me WAS IN THE WAY!!!)<br />
<br />
BTW, I did change my datarate way back when they told us about it and I was on cable.  I liked that one :)<br />

I know you can set it from 1 to 10..but wasn't sure which way to go with it ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something that helps alot that most people dont think about is to NOT install the new textures for velious kunark and the old world.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bought 256 meg of ram (bringing it from 128 to 384) cost ~ $40<br />
Killed all spell effects<br />
Killed all sound<br />
Turned off all new models (wish that worked on familiars, or at least shrink)<br />
Turned off all of the messages I could (other's hits, my misses, etc)<br />
/serverfilter on<br />
Got used to doing &quot;/hidecorpse all&quot; upon zoning<br />
cut back on the &quot;clipping plane&quot; (how far you can see)<br />
Avoid any raids of more then 3 groups<br />
<br />
Still go LD once or twice a night, but it's better then when Luclin<br />
first came out. <br />
<br />
Using a P3 450, dial up modem. Forget the graphic card (Nvidia<br />
Riva TNT or something). Not spending a couple hundred bucks<br />
for the latest Gforce, just to play this game. <br />
<br />
Still have a problem where when I swap spells, nothing outside<br />
of the spell book is visable (can't see chat, can't see when I<br />
un-mem spells, can't see hitpoints, etc.). Only the pages in <br />
the spellbook are &quot;active&quot;. <br />
<br />
Amazing that they've &quot;improved&quot; the engine to the point where<br />
someone with an at least average computer has to dumb the<br />
game down in order to play it. <br />
<br />
/sarchism on <br />
Can't wait to see what &quot;improvements&quot; they make for Planes<br />
of Power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything you describe is the same thing for me, except I don't see you indicate that you stare at the floor a lot which is my favorite trick if you want to call it that.</div></div><hr />

Before you spent a fortune on all your new computer equipment, did you try several different ISPs? I've never gone LD while playing EQ or AO with my older equipment &amp; cable modem provider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since this is a tweaking thread maybe I can ask this here.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to get PURE mouse turning in EQ without having to hold down the right mouse button?<br />
<br />
I got ruined by Morrowind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to do this very thing on one of my machines, works wonders with the old video cards.<br />
<br />
Anyone wanting to know some windows/connection tweaks should go take a look at this site:<br />
<br />
www.speedguide.net<br />
<br />
VERY helpful stuff there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the datarate file lets you control how much info comes through.. the higher you set it, the more information you can receive (if you can handle it)<br />
i think 9.0 is the highest you can set it at..  if you are on dial up, then 5.0 is the most you can handle (5 = 56k or so... i share a dial up connection so we both have to set ours at 2.5 each so we don't go linkdead from one person hogging all the packets), setting it higher won't really do anything until you upgrade to a better connection ^_^;;<br />
<br />
another thing you can do is use the /shownames command to turn off everyone's names or just show first names.  I usually turn off all PC names and just leave NPC names on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a pretty good guide on tweaking from the monk boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Creating a file called &quot;Nosound.txt&quot; in your EQ directory is the most simple way to increase performance. This will completely disable sound for eq and boost framerate alot.<br />

Hope that helps.<br />

Would that not make it a bit of a bugger trying to move your cursor across the screen to click on something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ha, got me there, I don't click often I usually cast from hot-keys but sometimes I do. <br />
They need to do something though Morrowind is so nice using mouse turning I never knew how much I missed by not using it.<br />
<br />
My kids always laughed at me because I also used keyboard turning when playing FPS games. SPLAT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">here is good guide from monkey's board , <br />
<br />
http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=547.topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Jannia, you misquoted me. Perhaps I wasn't clear. This is the<br />
same puter that I've always been using for EQ, the only thing<br />
that I bought to deal with Laglin was more memory. <br />
<br />
I use this same ISP when I work from home (about 10 hours at<br />
a time). I may get dumped once in about 100 hours. In EQ, I<br />
stand a good chance of getting dumped (in Kunark or Velious) at <br />
least once over a 4 hour period. <br />
<br />
Yep, I do the &quot;look at the floor&quot; trick to reduce lag; it's about as <br />
much fun as staring at the spell book. One step forward, two<br />
steps back. <br />
<br />
I will say that zoning times have decreased for some zones. Why<br />
does it take longer to zone into seb, then to zone out? :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for the pointer to the monk board. I didn't know about<br />
the armor settings, or the nosound file. I'll try them.</div></div><hr />
