<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was doing some banking the other night, and came across a lot of old gear that brought a smile.  And, much to the detriment of my HPs and AC, I started equipping it.  Just because.<br />
<br />
And it felt good.<br />
<br />
I took off my elemental bracer and put on my Spirit Wracked Cord.  I spent dozens of hours in pre-change Droga changing faction.  2 of my closest friends helped me get Drusella when she spawned in HS.  I'll remember that for a long time.  The Regal Ring of Bathezid and the Spirit Wracked Cords symoblized something for me, more than getting a Chain Bracer pattern off of Vine did.<br />
<br />
I equipped my Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients in my Primary slot.  I know the stats aren't all best, and I have better, but way back when, when I had just started recruiting with the guild of which I am now an officer, it was something &quot;the core&quot; of the guild came and helped with on the final encounter.  I actually would click Carnage on people on fights in Kael, when we were doing that.<br />
<br />
We killed Inny last night, as a change of pace from elementals, and because I wanted to kill all the old world gods once, and for some reason, I had never had the chance to get up to Hate.  He dropped an Afflication Efficiency IV book, which I will proudly equip.  I haven't equipped a book in ages - and always mocked shaman who did - but now I just don't care anymore.  I like it.<br />
<br />
Any of you equip items based on sentimentality?  Rather than just min/maxing?  I've started to.........and I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't wear them, but I have never deleted a sentimental item. I still have my Spitestone shield banked!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oho!<br />
<br />
I forgot the PoMischief boots.  The old ones.  Those are going on tonight!  To hell with mana pres.  I want 10 charges of clicky Scale of Wolf!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still have my newbie quest armor banked.  I didn't have LOY until a few weeks ago, and it was pretty green chain that I loved and would wear to guild meetings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vindi bp.  I've had a chance to loot better bps, but I keep wearing my Vindi bp...  I pined for it since I was a little troll; I drool'd over it on ubers for months/years....  and it was our guild's first Vindi kill ever --- I won it and I think it would prob always be on me.  It wouldn't feel right to take it off.  Love the plate look, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh I still have a screaming mace in the bank and a set of blackened iron chain. :) But it is on mr banker toon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I keep a 10 slot bag around with my full suit of Totemic armor and my Gatorsmash Maul.  Just because.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Still have my Zek Initiate's necklace rotting in the bank.  Haul it out once every few months on a raid when there are a bunch of clerics/paladins around.<br />
<br />
Clicky Yaulp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My vindi bp just got replaced last night.  I've been wearing it for I don't know how long; 3 years or so.  I've always liked the plate bp look, so never was attracted to getting an ornate.  Other BP's like from Coirnav or chain pattern in Time, never has dropped for us.<br />
<br />
I think I still have a spritestone shield in the bank.  My coldain shawl is.  For a long time, I've had an Earring of Cleansing (really bad stats with cure poison on it) in my pack, even though I haven't used it at least a year or two.  I use to keep my Hate armor, but got rid of it for space reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From my first Rumblecrush kill, am currently still wearing the Threaded Platinum bracer - strictly for old times sake. <br />
<br />
The old Wolf Caller's boots get pulled out from time to time to get a shine and remember the good old days of shamaning, but they're only an heirloom now. Remembrance of glories past...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm still wearing Wolf Caller's Greaves and a Bracer of the Sky. But not for nostalgic reasons - I just don't have better yet. =/ <br />
<br />
And I'm still trying to get a Vindi BP and a Rumble shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am still wearing my Fungal tunic.<br />

They can take it from me when the last shaman dies. And not before then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hehe I am wearing my thurg pants also and the Bracer of the Sky. I can't seem to find much to replace them that  Ican afford yet. I don't want to spend a bunch of plat on a small upgrade and that is all that I see in the bazaar normally. So I think the first LDoN armor  Ibuy form EF will be the pants. And I will just have to hope to eventually get a ornate bracer pattern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I realize that some may be wearing what others would consider &quot;retro&quot; gear because of a lack of anything better, but what I was driving at is:  Even if you have something better, do you still equip an item (that was significantly worse stats) out of sentiment... or &quot;just because.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have most of the gear on my &quot;to do&quot; list...I found myself not very attached to it.<br />
<br />
I am dam proud of my 8th Cudgel.  I decided I'm going to keep equipping it regardless.  Was just curious if other people did the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had my barbarian shaman baz trader in full totemic for a while with a gatorsmash maul. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, we get the point. Okay...<br />
<br />
I keep my Onyx Chain Sleeves in the bank because when I got them, they were my best item ever; 6 to each resist, 4 to each stat, 40 hp/mana. Now I wear Scaled Avatar's for the focus effect.<br />
<br />
But I still go to the bank to link them to the Ranger that I outbid for them - does that count?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I refuse to give up my Skiron Cudgel of the Ancients, my 8th shawl, or spirit wracked cord.  Way too much time spent on those to give 'em up.<br />
<br />
Of course, if I found something with double the stats, I could invent a new sentimental attachment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nice thread.<br />
<br />
I have a full set of totemic banked, along with my PoM boots and an NToV shield :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I keep a mixed set of gear in the bank for those nasty CRs where the corpse doesn't pop to a convenient point. Yeah, I know hat theoretically corpses pop to some newfangled zone, but to me, CRs are part of the game...plus I don't know how to get to the CR zone anyway!<br />
<br />
Banked items include Vindi BP, and a mixture of Thurgy and Skyshrine quest armor, plus one of the crappy LoY charms. I even have my shield of falsehood LOL</div></div><hr />

Check the helm.  Yes, he actually wears it.   He refuses to upgrade until there is another helm with a graphic similar to that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I dont have a particular piece of gear that holds any sentiment, but I do pack around a small wooden box that I looted as a young one back in the day....I remember wacking my first gnoll with my newbie club and looting it...back then bags were hard to get lol. I also pack around a sea shell that an old old friend gave me, shes long since gone from the game, but she is still with me where it counts :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I still wear my Officer's Cloak of Service even though I have had the opportunity to upgrade it several times.  I worked on that quest from the time I was littered and I am still proud of it.  I still have the Sonic Wolfbane Spear as well.<br />
<br />
Still use my Ayyad's Runed Urn to carry stuff in.  That quest is a huge pain due to not getting your tools back on a failed combine(had to redo it three times to finish all the brehad figurines).  Still pretty handy for a 50% reduction container.<br />
<br />
I have my Sleek Sonic Wolf Hide Tunic in the bank too.  I sometimes wear it on hard corpse runs.  Ever tried to get some Grimling Fingerbones?  I swear this game knows what you want and gives you everything else......</div></div><hr />

This guy is my HERO!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Georgina Ofthejungle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I still wear my Dire Wolf boots with pride. It took me and 5 friends to take down the wolf. I like the clicky instant sow, I can run and click them and speed up :D <br />
<br />
That, and the fact that the boots are the best I have....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The first day Shamad decided to step out of the frigid comforts of the Halas bastion, out into the frigid hardships of the Everfrost valleys, another Barbarian, calling himself a warrior (though he could bearly eek out a victory against a small bear), said that he was working on his tailoring skill. Shamad asked what that means, and he showed him some tattered armor that he was wearing, and said if Shamad could get some pelts, he'd be glad to make some for him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, after a few hours of hunting, I had a Tattered Leather Face Mask, arms, and I think collar. Over the years, all but the mask has disapeared. I still keep the mask around, it's over 4.5 years old, and I'm willing to bet it's in the top-ten list of oldest pieces of tattered leather on Xegony. :)<br />
<br />
I just can't bring myself to delete it, it is the last piece of the first armor set I ever had in this game. /nostalgic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">A leetle Dwarven Friend of mine. Named Breckenridge wore a small brass mask from the wee ages till level 65. One day I inspected him and saw he was still wearing it... I hollered and yelled at him. Then he told me I gave that to him the first day we met. (Awww!) So I promptly gave him a new mask.  But he still links the brass mask now and again. And carries it with him.. (Grins)<br />

Dorfs are funny folks. But they damn good friends. <br />
