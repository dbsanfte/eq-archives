<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The subject pretty much explains it.  I'm just about done with QB 1 and QB 2 is next on the list.  I want fast casting Quiescence.<br />
<br />
I have a Spell Haste 4 Item, now the question is....do I go for QB 3 for a definite 3 second Qui, or stick with QB 2 + SH 4 for a slightly longer Qui?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">up to you.  SH4 is only 10% haste if I remember right.  Or is it 15%?  I dunno.  You could also get a mith marr haste focus item and be at the cap with QB2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spell Haste IV = 15 %.<br />
<br />
Haste Of Mithaniel = 20 %<br />
<br />
Since you already have a spell haste iv item, I would say go with QB2 and live with the .3 difference.  You can always get QB3 later on if you really want to.  In my experience, though, SH4 + QB2 = good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In hindsight, QB2 really is good enough as long as you have some sort of haste item.  The bonus that they give you is sooo good that it is worth keeping a haste item around, even if you no longer need it for quiescence.  I trained QB3 before I had a haste item, but now that I do have one, I will never ever be without one again.  25% haste on tnargs is just too good to ever be without.  I won't upgrade my agnarr orb until I already have a replacement beneficial haste item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm one of the qb= nearly useless people too. If you don't have some sort of either benficial or general spell haste items already you should want one. Once you get one of them qb2 + item = good enough. If you really want to max it BoR from a cleric does that. Personally I've got agnarr's earring for 18% general haste and it's not getting replaced till i've got it else where. Personally I also find that the .3 seconds or so that i'm still missing on torpor means I basically never get the refresh msg if I cast it right after a cann v but if I get BoR I have to pause or i'll get it almost ever time. 300+ aa's here and still not qb3 and no plans for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got QB3 and never regretted it. Having it means you never have to rely on a piece of gear to speed up Q. More freedom in what gear you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have Haste of Mithanial on my Cog Encrusted Epaulets, and I don't think I will ever take em off.  That extra fast Gate and faster Torpor is just too sweet.<br />
<br />
Don't have QB yet, and not on the top of my list right now.  The next AAs I get will be for Channelling I think.  I hate fizzles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got Haste of Druzzil (18% spell haste) and it comes to 4.3 seconds with QB1, im sure with QB2 it would be at 3 secs or close enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Zatriz, channeling has nothing to do with fizzles by the way. Supposedly it just gives you a better chance to get a spell off when being hit. Can't say as I noticed a huge change with that AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The question really comes down to where you have your spell haste item and how soon can you upgrade it.  I went for QB3 for the simple reason that I knew I wouldn't be getting any type of spell haste for quite some time.  If you see that you're going to upgrading the slot with spell haste and not replacing the focus effect, go for QB3.  If you're not, keep the spell haste for now and use the aa's in some other area.  But as Litchebane pointed out, not being tied to a specific piece of equipment is very nice and I personally detest switching out a piece all the time, i.e. player made focus range items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got QB3 and never regretted it. Having it means you never have to rely on a piece of gear to speed up Q. More freedom in what gear you choose.<br />
<br />
Thats where we disagree. Even with QB3 I still want a benficial haste or general haste item. Hasting gate, tnargs and cures and any other number of things is still valuable even if it's only benficial spell haste. Throw detrimental stuff like malos and turgurs on there and it's just more adding to the pile. In my mind qb3 does nothing to change my desire to have a spell haste item since it really only covers 1 spell I care about out of a dozen or more that are useful to be hasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well yes Taraddar, QB3 only covers part of our spell casting lineup. Original poster asked about Q specifically. Of course I would get a general spell haste item asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">OK then.  If you aquire a spell haste IV item, does that make the Quick Buff aa pretty useless?  I don't think they stack.<br />
<br />
Reb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">they stack up to a max of 50% so if you have qb3 a haste item doesn't add anything for buffs which is exactly my point. Your going to want a haste focus effect item that will cover torpor and q anyway so stop at level 2. 25% + 15% is 40% and pretty close and maxed with cleric buff. Get a 18% or 20% item and your even closer. If your gonna be at or near max with qb2 and some sort of focus effect item, which you want for everything else, why bother with the 9 aa's for qb 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got QB3 and never regretted it. Having it means you never have to rely on a piece of gear to speed up Q. More freedom in what gear you choose.<br />

<br />
Well yes Taraddar, QB3 only covers part of our spell casting lineup. Original poster asked about Q specifically. Of course I would get a general spell haste item asap.<br />
<br />
Well litch which is it? Does qb3 give you more freedom or do you still want a haste item asap. That general haste item will work on q just fine and put you in the close enough range. If your gonna have the haste item anyway why not let it benifit you some on q and save the 9 aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Depend of you rythm for do AA point. If you can make easily AA, QB3 is great. If you don't make lot of aa during week, QB3 isn't a priority</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It depends on where you are in your AA gathering.  Personally I think QB3 is well worth it, but I wouldn't do it in the first 100.  I got mine around the 115-125 mark, but definitely get QB2 as soon as you can put it in.  QB3 is never going to hurt, and if you find yourself at a point where you are missing a haste item (say you died and need to get back to your corpse), that 3.0 second Q vs a 4.5 second one might make a big difference.<br />
<br />
I was never able to find a good spell haste item (pre-LDoN), and none of the obtainable beneficial haste items were upgrades for me, so I went with QB3 to get as much haste as possible.  Boosts on gate and heals are nice, but you cast Q at least 20x more than those spells combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Basically my point is that AAs are cheap, just spend em and don't worry about it. You will always have the AAs, your gear could change. No need to try and trip me up about the whole issue. Hell I don't care, spend the AAs on charisma, I'm just offering advice.</div></div><hr />

Sorry about that.  I misspoke.  I meant the Spell Casting Mastery.  This is the one that says it will increase your chances of making your Specialization roll (decrease mana use) and reduce chances of fizzling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The description of what this aa does and what it actually does are compleately different. Specialization has no check. It's an always constant savings based on your skill. This is one situation where sony has no clue what they are talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have QB3 and Wicked bone atlatl for haste.  That gets Q down to 3.3 seconds.  I will bite the bullet and get QB3 when I get ahold of a nicer range slot item.</div></div><hr />
