<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all<br />
<br />
I was PLing a RL friends SK in hopes to duo with him later on. well I take him to bards and nobles. at 44 its solid 2% a kill, not bad. at 45 its 1% a kill, eh so what, they spawn fast. he dings 46. So I take him to yard trash in PoN and another RL friend tags along. Kill something 1%... ok ok we're grouped. so I disband and they go at it. omg! 2%..... now I take it one step further. I have him solo one, a massive 3% xp is awarded.<br />
<br />
now I know if something is &quot;too&quot; red. it will give crappy xp. and thats what im guessing this is about. but I have noticed this cap in other situations.<br />
<br />
for example...<br />
<br />
the same RL friend ( he cant seem to stick with one char hehe ) has a BL. at 47 we desided to PL him a bit. first off we start in DLs. steady 1% a kill. so then we say what the hell, KC. 1% still... and the mobs are much harder to kill. Then we had to chardok, yet again, the dreaded 1% a kill.<br />
<br />
so does anyone know if 1% is just the magic number that you cannot go past 45+? ( unless you go completly overboard IE pop ) if anyone has any insight that would be nice. I might just have to level him in sol b ( very easy old world mobs, and yes. 1% a kill /sigh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 49/50 i was get 2.5 ticks so about 2% per kill in nadox solo killing first three elementals which were dark blue so i'm thinking no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The XP is just that good in PoP. There's no XP cap. I get 2% of my level when I solo even or dark blue cons (I'm 38). Try hunting in some areas that have XP bonuses and you'll level quicker.<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those elementals in nadox have dungeon bonus and underwater exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think exp is capped somehow. You cant gain more than a certain % of exp on each kill.<br />
<br />
I soloed Guardians of Ro (lvl 65) in Tower of Solusek Ro and got 2,5 blues AAs, nearly as good as frogs on PoS (lv 62 63 i think)... Havent tried duo, but i know that we got quiet good exp on &quot;mini raid&quot; (3 group or so), way more than blue mobs. My guess is yes there is a cap on each mob, but maybe go ask on bard forum, since they can solo red mobs in PoF...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes there is a cap. Has been there since day one.<br />
For instance, a level 20 will get the exact same exp for killing a level 45 mob as killing a level 50 mob. The only variable you can make work to your advantage is the Zem of the place you choose to hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solusek A gives 1% a kill? I may move my friend over there... :)<br />
<br />
Hows that compare ot other pl spots, in say.. tenebrous mountains or soemthing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">6th floor in Tower of Frozen Shadows. The dogs will give 1-2% per kill throughout the 40's, and you can get to level 51 there before they start turning light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">from my experience i know there is some kind of cap on xp. i remember when i was about 35 or so, i helped a 50ish ranger with IG's in everfrost. i was thinking to myself i was going to make a killing in xp, yet an hour and a half or so later, maybe had a little less than a fourth of a level (not exactly sure but I know it was hardly anything). it's a little annoying to be honest because i tried soloing them ( ok ok i was a druid for the day running in circles while fido chewed its rear :) ), while it was REDICULOUSLY long i did kill 2 of them this way. net result - spent 30 minutes killing an ig when i could have killed a few mams for the same xp - dont make sense to me. and yes, i know i was stupid for even thinking of trying let alone actually trying, but i was bored and felt like a tough challenge :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">there is a cap.<br />
<br />
when my warrior was at 7 I buffed him to bejesus and back, stuck him on a legionaire in crush he got a blue and a half of xp, then I killed a slaver that was white, and I got a blue an a quarter of xp, then I killed another slaver that was yellow and it netted the same xp as the red leggo.<br />
<br />
from that point onward I looked only to the yellow/white mobs.<br />
<br />
I also don't think that it is a percentage of the bar, I think it is a number for each level. <br />
<br />
where you need 100xp points to get to lvl 2, the cap may be 20xp max per kill.<br />
<br />
it may be you need 100kxp points to get from 19-20 and the max you can gain for each kill is 5k.<br />
<br />
now these numbers are not real or anything, but I think that this is a good explanation of the way it is done, rather than a percentage of the bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I discovered this while PLing my sk the other day, not a very happy discovery.  L60 shaman slow makes tanking just about anything a snap, but after mins of beating down a mob 15-20 levels over the sk's level, the xp was the same as killing a yello con mob.  Ouch.<br />
<br />
So, basically your best bet is to slaughter dark blue/even con mobs as fast as you can, preferably in a zone w/ a nice xp bonus.  So no, holding LCY in KC at L35 is not going to be worth it. /sigh  OTM Kaesora, gah...<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At one time there was not a cap, or so the rumors go.  Lets say you miraculously found a way to get a lvl 1 to kill a lvl 35+ mob he would have dinged 6 or 7 instantly, instead he just gets the max amount of exp one can get off a kill.  After a point its really just the bonus's of the zone instead of the lvl of thing your fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure if its still true but the most you can get from a single kill is 9% (might be 10%).   I've PL'd character that were seriously low level and used DS pling and a half a yellow is the most I could get on any kill.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that is true on AA xp,  most I've gotten is 18% AA on a single solo kill of a yellow con in Plane of Fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I should also add that he is a troll sk and his BL is an iksar, so both would have an exp penalty. no idea if that effects the max xp you can get or just total off of one mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think one of the problems in learning the details in experience is that you need so much of it to level, but each kill gives you typically less than 1/100th of what you need.  Now this is a good thing (TM) overall, because it would be lame if you just leveled every 100 kills or so.  However, it makes doing any sort of study of exp difficult, because you can't accurately gauge changes in exp gains.  So what's the solution?  ShowEQ, or any similiar packet-watching program.  Now I don't use ShowEQ, since I don't have an extra Linux computer lying around, but from what I understand about it if you use it you can see exactly how many exp  points you get after you kill something.  If anyone out there who has this program could do some tests PLing lowbies, it'd probably be a lot easier to determine where the cap is and how it works.  Until then, or until someone comes up with an alternative method to study experience, everyone's data will be more or less anecdotal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I get 13-14% aa per kill on yellow mobs in PoFire, so the 9-10% or whatever cap doesn't apply to AA.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if anyone said that, as I got distracted by remnents of easter candy and did not read this entire thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks Gathu, I don't think I'd read that yet, and its really useful info because it means you should switch to AAXP when soloing high con mobs, if you want to be efficient.<br />
<br />
I know I will never get to the elemental planes, but nevertheless I just have to ask: when you ssay you get 13-14% AAXP per kill, is that from soloing or in group?  Either way, how long does it take you to kill one of these mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have pl'd many a character when I get sick of the same old same old. It is by far definately better to kill masses of blue mobs then take the time to kill higher cons until you get to the planes then you can't really beat the exp anywhere unless you have a pocket Ae group or something for OS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No, it's just that those particular mobs give ASSLOADS of exp per kill!  Exp is not measured by how far it makes your bar move.  It's measured by the amount assigned to a particular mob, which varies according to numerous conditions, subject to bonuses or penalties.  <br />
Let's say a lvl 47 chardok Reanimated Partisan gives 10000 exp points as its base.  A level 46 iksar shaman manages to solo this beast, and exp is awarded.  He is awarded a 10% bonus for hunting in a dangerous zone.  He is fined a 20% penalty for being a stinky leezard.  He is awarded a large bonus of 50%(unsure of this number) for killing something higher level than he is.  <br />
So:<br />
10000<br />
+5000<br />
-2000<br />
+1000<br />
--------<br />
14000 exp points, which in lvl 44 he needs 1000000 exp points to &quot;ding&quot; and therefore he recieves 1.4% exp in that little blue bar.  <br />
<br />
Now that same lizard shaman goes to PoN and fights a bird who is level 47 and gives 20000 exp points as his base.  Do the same math and you get 28000 exp points awarded, or 28000/1000000 x 100% = 2.8% exp to his little blue bar. <br />
<br />
Now don't you wish you were one of the Master Race?  We are seksie, look good in our manly kilts, and have 15% less penalty. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There used to be (and as far as I know still is) a hard cap of 1/2 yellow per kill.  Now, the last time I ever came CLOSE to this was when before kunark came out doing serious pleveling in unrest :)<br />
<br />
The game has changed a lot since then so my input is pretty useless, but technically there was one at the time.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
damn fubared sig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't know what the cap is, if it exists, but I can tell you that at level 50, you can get 5% per kill  :D  So your Shadowknight friend probably wasn't hitting it.<br />
<br />
5% was what I was getting each time a named elemental popped in Nadox (that's not including the I nearly fell off my chair the first time it happened :)<br />
<br />

Now that same lizard shaman goes to PoN and fights a bird who is level 47 and gives 20000 exp points as his base.  <br />
<br />
The base value of xp for a mob is fixed based entirely on its level.  It is then modified from there based on the Zone Modifier (all that used to be used) and more recently a &quot;challenge&quot; Modifier was added (if higher level etc).  But a level 47 mob is a level 47 mob, the base is the same xp, the difference is from the zone modifiers. PoP just has insane zone modifiers.  If you kill a level 47 mob in Zone X, and kill a different type of level 47 mob in Zone X, you will get indentical xp, some just seem to give better xp over time because of the hp's they have and other things.</div></div><hr />
