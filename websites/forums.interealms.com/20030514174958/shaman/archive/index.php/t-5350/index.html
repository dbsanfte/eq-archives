<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have made my way thru this board for the past few days, and there are lots of great suggestions. However none seem to fit exactly the situation i am in. I have a 60 monk and a 52 shaman, i have thought of quite a few places to try, but none seem to be real great. I have even tried most of the suggestions i have found here on the board. <br />
<br />
So, my question is: does anyone have any suggestions for places to hunt that might fit my situation better? There are several posts outlining places for shaman + monk duos but in those cases the shaman is always the higher level of the 2.<br />
<br />
Here are some places i havent tried but am considering:<br />
<br />
-Bear pits, Permafrost<br />
-Plane of Hate, risky, but its very easy to pull<br />
-Plane of Fear, same as above<br />
-Hole, beyond the point of no-return, not risky, but not easy to get out either<br />
<br />
I have done shrooms, and i have done the grey, and i am just looking for some alternate places, both are decent for easy exp but are boring as hell :/. <br />
<br />
Just curious if im on target, or if there are some other places that i am not thinking of that someone else might be able to throw my way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for you time and consideration!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quite a big difference in levels, and finding a place where you can BOTH get exp without it being dangerous is very difficult, especially since you are the one that is lower level.<br />
<br />
Here are some suggestions (not in order of importance or value):<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye - Toilers or Goranga Gatherers(Blue for both)<br />
--- Don't fight hunters at this level, extremely hard to slow ---<br />
<br />
Karnor's Castle - Basement (Some light blue for monk)<br />
<br />
Sebilis - Zone or Zone out (Some light blue for monk)<br />
<br />
Chardock - Castle/Zone (Some light blue for monk)<br />
<br />
Velks - Spiders (Though they are overcamped, all blue)<br />
<br />
Katta - Guards (Most light blue for monk, but fast pulls)<br />
<br />
<br />
Places you should NOT try:<br />
<br />
Sol B - Imps/Efreeti (Magic resist on these suckers is waaay too high)<br />
<br />
Sebilis - NG (Great loot but the krup wizards and necrosis beetle would own you both at your level)<br />
<br />
Akheva - Resists at 52 on the guys inside Akheva (since they are higher level) are not worth it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
NOTE: These results are BEFORE the resist changes, after the resist changes it MIGHT be easier to slow mobs that are even or higher level than you, therefore making some camps in the excluded list a possibility.  Try it out at your own risk.  Hope this is helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i just went thru that same lvl disparity myself, my monk was 60 and my shaman was 51 when i started. best places that ive found for both to get exp at a semi decent rate is howling stones any wing, chardok entrance/exit, karnors basement, and akheva. howling stones was the best of all those for me. ended up getting 63 aa pts for the monk by the time my shaman hit lvl 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, im in the exact opposite boat that you are in currently.  I have a 60 shaman and a 53(1 blue till 54) monk.  Currently I am soloing in ME in the little fort like thing.  So far its been pretty nice.  I have gotten two spells, wave of healing and a nice cleric undead dot spell in about an hour.  XP is pretty good shaman also only has 1 blue till next aa point.  I used to duo at the zone but on Q everyone is always training it, so far no trains/adds where ive been hunting up on the hill.  Fights usually last about 3-4 minutes with a little down time to cann/heal up.  Wish I could convince my brother to play my monk then I could be canning during the fight and I could continously pull. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for the reply's all! I will have to give chardok and HS a go at it. <br />
<br />
I am now 54, so that will help a little atleast heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DonateloFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You asked about the plane of hate for duoing, has anyone done this? I have a 60monk (with fair gear, 1250ac 3khp unbuffed, primal and facesmasher) and a 52 shaman (crap for gear) and was wondering if I would have any chance of duoing PoH. The armor would be a nice upgrade for my shaman, and anything I get extra I can sell for some ok PP(FV server)<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone knew about this.<br />
