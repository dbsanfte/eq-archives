<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been playing on the Drinal server for a while, oh about a year now and I keep running into the same problem over and over again.  There seems to be like maybe one or two really high end guilds there but they require you be 65, have 100 AA's and sacrifice a bus load of nuns to some dark god just to in..  These are the things I love to do most..while playing..<br />
<br />
1. Raid, Ive determined that the only way to get really great gear is to do raids..<br />
2. Did I mention raids?  he he..I want to hit up the higher end areas, and if not raiding Id like to be part of the group that can actually do it, and not just run off on a whim and get our buts handed to us.<br />
3. Increase my Shaman in game knowledge.  In my present guild its pretty hard to do since Im one of the higher shaman there, and you know how old that can get..<br />
   That pretty much sums it up.  Im looking for a guild/server where there are more then a few mid/high end guilds that dont require an arm and a leg to get in..I know my shaman isnt the casts meow so to speak, but he isnt that bad either..Let me know what ya think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are no free rides here in life. Honestly lv61 and 7 AA wont get you into any higher guild when there are lv65 with +300AA competing for same spot. If you wish to join any of the top guilds only way is to work for lv/AA. Right now shaman dont stack well on raids, most higher guilds only want 3-4 highplaytime shaman on their rooster not much need for more. <br />
<br />
I dont know your server but I would imagine there are a couple of them doing Ssra and such that mayby would be a good start. Go to your server board and read up on the guilds and what they want for people. Talk to an officer and do your homework on what the guild stands for and ask if there is any opening. Dont be a guildwhore and join another until you get the lv/AAs and then jump ship, it will only get you a bad reputation. A guild is like a family with friends (atleast for me) and not something you use to get better equipment!<br />
<br />
Good luck out there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to agree with Shakula. You have to think about the guild as a whole, could a guild of everyone being at 61 and everyone having not too many aa kill stuff in later content? Probably not.<br />
<br />
And no one wants to drag someone along who isn't contributing as much as they are, its the exact same way that you feel with your old guild. Its not a great situation either way you slice it, /shrug.</div></div><hr />

You really have 2 options here. You can move to a different guild, but that takes a fair amount of work on your part. You will need to do things with the new guild as an app, while you get to know each other. Add to that the fact, most guilds use a DKP system so you will be a while before having enough points to get gear.<br />
<br />
Your other option is to become a leader within your current guild. Plan and lead raids that will help your guild as a whole progress through the content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Really depends a bit on what time schedule you play, but you might try one of those:<br />
<br />
Divine Intervention (Ssra level)<br />
Stein (Ssra Level)<br />
Clan Skallagrim (VT)<br />
<br />
But you really need to get to lvl 65 and Canni5.<br />
Alternative is what Benadan posted and start your own guild and start raiding stuff like Kael and ToV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would toss in personal reputation. If there is a top guild you want to work yourself into as a member, get to know some of the folks. Group with them at every opportunity. Let them see how you stack up against other shaman - no in gear or aa, but in ability. This is a very long term project. Making friends will only make the guilding process easier when you are at the level (lvl and aa) the guild would consider you as a serious applicant.<br />
<br />
Grind levels and aa's. If a guild has a minimum requirement its not there because they are being arses about it. It is there because without the minimum you are not able to pull your load and contribute at the bare minimum. Bare minimum. While it seems tough to meet the guilding requirements, keep in mind those who are in the guild already are above and beyond the minimum. They took the journey already (GRIND, GRIND, GRIND) to get where they are ... no one gave them a 65 300+ aa shaman.<br />
<br />
You are asking a lot from the game/others and yourself to think that after &quot;about a year&quot; at lvl 61 with 7 aa that you are ready to jump into a top level raiding guild. Add to that your magelo gear and you really could take your time in a mid-level guild for the next year or so and meet your basic requirements:<br />
<br />
1. Get much better gear than you have.<br />
<br />
2. Learn how to play your shaman to the best of your abilities. Learn from others and learn from yourself as you try new things or do old things in new ways. Challenge yourself and your abilities until you know those limitations forwards and backwards.<br />
<br />
Both of these are possible without being in the server's top guild(s). Finding a way to make both of these happen will, along the way, get you into the server's best guild or at least a guild you are happy with as far as gameplay goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It can be more rewarding to work your way through raiding &quot;older&quot; content and help your guild breakthrough to &quot;newer&quot; content rather than just hopping into a Time/GoD guild anyway. Like previous posters said though, you have to get 65 and a decent amount of AAs if you are looking at the higher tier guilds. Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The #2 guild on my server requires 350 AA to join.  woo woo...<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are into raiding, there is nothing more satisfying that raiding with friends.  Doesn't matter if you are doing Kael Arena or Corinav.  So first find people who want to raid like you do.  Doesn't matter what they raid, as long as they do.<br />
<br />
Look at the current guild you are in.  Is it a chat room, or a raid machine? <br />
<br />
You might discover that there is a core of  people in the guild that are wanting to do the same things you do.  So start raiding.  I'd suggest getting some cleric's epic'd for starters.  Then start getting planar flagged.  Take on Grummus and Xanamech.  <br />
<br />
If your guild is just a chat room, and most people have no desire to raid, then you need to find a group who does.  Don't try to join the #1 guild...join the #10 or 12 guild.  Find a guild who wipes to Vindi and then make them better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You mgiht want to look at White Wind as well. Been a while since I looked at their requirements, but I have a few friends in there still. Lots of the guilds on Drinal are hurting since theres a big turnover at the top, forcing higher end guilds to constantly recruit from those further down the rung. At 61 with 7 aa's, you arent going to be seeing any EPlane guild. However theres a decent open raiding system around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You should get lvl 65, Cannibalization, MGB and probably Radiant Cure if you want to be a good raiding shaman. Focus on that first, and it will be much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get to level 65 and watch for open raids.  There are lots of open raids you can go on if you watch for them.  FBC does a bunch on drinal.  Most of the open raids doing PoP flags require level 65 to roll for loot though, which is why I said to get to 65 asap.</div></div><hr />
