<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok please dont flame me for asking. I was wondering if I just did PoF and got the tear. Could I turn it into lord rak and get the scale then grab the epic? As long as I max my faction? I know its the cheap way of doing the epic but I am curious about it. Any info would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes you can, make sure its max ally and not just ally. Keep turning in woe/envy/marr till it reads &quot;your faction with truespirit cannot possibly become better&quot; or something to that effect )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh thanks I think I am going to give it a shot. I was just curous has anyone done it through personal experiance???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kagbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you do the turn in to Lord Rak'Ashiir make sure there are no mobs up to wander into you and Rak mid-turn in.  You getting hit while trading with Rak botches the faction and he eats your tear.<br />
<br />
Happened to me, but Server GM did reimburse the tear after checking the logs and what not, just took a month of keeping on their case about it.<br />
<br />
So it'll work, just careful with the turn in!</div></div><hr />
