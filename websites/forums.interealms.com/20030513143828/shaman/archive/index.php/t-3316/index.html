<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the never ending quest to find a good leveling spot, I have come across this gem.  Tenebrious Mountain on the Moon.  I set up camp at the Grimling Forrest zone, and Sonic Dire Wolfes, and Darkwing bats are dark blue and very easy with pet and Jbb.  I did not have a lot of time last night, but a couple quick kills and voila, I had filled an entire blue bub (at 46).   I have been at the same spot at 36, and the same mobs (yellow and even back then) were a real challenge, and not worth the effort.  Now, at 46, I slice through them with ease and xp is very nice.  With 850+ Ac I barely loose more then a bub of HP (1474 buffed) and the only spell I cast is Togors to pull.   Mobs are PLENTIFULL, there were two other people hunting in the same area and there was absolutely no shortage of stuff to kill.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

<br />
Can you try a few sans JBB and see how it goes? I dont have one yet :(, and I'd like to know how easy the mobs are w/ out the clicking.  We have similar equip, so if its easy for you, then it should be relatively easy for me too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they have pitiful hp's overall...hit for max of 90's been here trying to get the skulls for the 25 ac shield and GROWL its annoying getting the annoying buggers to spawn<br />
<br />
One ebolt will generally get them to run with dog dog not even really a need to slow if you have good ac. course dont have a jbb so *grumbles*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I did them in my mid 30s without JBB, but even with dog dog, they were a tough fight (yellow or even con).  Now, even without JBB, dog dog and melee, with slow and one dot does them in easily (I tested it for you).<br />
<br />
Loot is not great, but the alien looking buggers can drop some gems, AND they can drop bricks of Acrylia, which always is welcome )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This place rocks!  I went there last night and got just over 2 yellow in between 4 and 5 hours or soloing.  Never had to worry about not enough to kill or pulling solo's.  I even killed the named mobs.  <br />
I'm 45th without a JBB.  Just used Dots and the pet.  Very easy indeed.  The &quot;alien&quot; looking guys do drop gems at a nice rate.  The blue ones drop less than the orange/yellow ones do.<br />
