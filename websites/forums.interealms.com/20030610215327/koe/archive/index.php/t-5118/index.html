<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll have you know I got 9 of 10 right (and the one I missed was a trick question - Tequilla is your favorite drink), but the thing would not record my score.  For some reason it had me logged in as you.  How do I log in as me (and yes, I will purposely miss the Tequilla one again - but feel like I should get partial credit for that one :)  ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, Wynnie, I did not do so well on yours, but at least I could log in as me.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">30 minutes and it's still at 99% loaded -- I refreshed a couple of times but it hasn't done anything :/  Wynnie's is stuck at 48%.  Maybe we're all trying to take them at once and it's slowing the thing down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, I'm beginning to think that the site is having a problem with all the EQ traffic coming in :P (LOA and KOE bashing into their servers is prolly killing them hehe)<br />
<br />
It's been doing the same thing here as well :\<br />
<br />
Anyway, DING 400 posts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, looks like the site is still narfed this morning, so I made my own quiz to see if it works.  Take it if you like and learn my deepest darkest secrets... ok it's not that revealing. :P<br />
