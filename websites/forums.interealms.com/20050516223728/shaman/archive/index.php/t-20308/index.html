<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice, pretty nice. I would much rather have a increase of dps somehow.. but everyone else wants a new heal so give us one!!! :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually I've given up on the DPS front, it's too unlikely that we'll be given that.  And I've become more or less accustomed to sucking on the DPS front.  I would dearly love more healing power, though, because I hate to see groupmates dying while I'm chain-casting Tnarg's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My favorite quote from that thread on the cleric forum:<br />
<br />
Comparing shaman melee -v- cleric melee is like comparing warrior healing -v- rogue healing. I can Bind Wounds for more than you, sir!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Clerics say -<br />

' almost prefer grouping without bsts now(wich is a huge turnaround)'<br />

'Give me an enchanter or BST any day of the week.'<br />

DO YA SEE THAT BRENLO???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Someone needs to reply to that thread right now and explain that for 4 years we could slow AND heal, and I see no reason not to be able to continue doing both.<br />
<br />
I don't want to register, I don't think I'd be a very good representative over there.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ciccero, you should see the gems Shadow pumps out on Xev Server rants ;)<br />
<br />
Good post Bone!  Unite to hate druids! Priceless!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am so banned...that or a hero. but Amris needed to be confronted. who gave their 7 year old board access and then took away his meds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No not a hero but your post was sad, a rant in itself, and a blackeye on the whole dicussion.   <br />
<br />
Every board has ranters ... some do it well mannered.  Others do it foaming at the mouth.  You went to the latter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Diabalein, you not only fed the troll, but also made every other cleric hungry as well. Unwise move.<br />
<br />
I'm so out of this discussion. Half the people are not up to date on other classes abilities and too many are wearing their selective reading glasses. Not like those threads are going to get anything done anyway. All they do is prove how damn territorial people get about their class and what paranoia any game changes bring about.<br />
<br />
Anyone seen the Find Nemo movie? I hear seagulls chanting.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am ashamed to admit that, but some of the posters are so ignorant, yet so stubborn and evil to some degree in their replies, that I feel the urge to physically harm them. <br />
God, I am glad this is just a game and I will never have to meet or listen to those people about things that actually matter.<br />
<br />
Amris and Axterix make me cry in real life. Somebody tell him that Boggle works like Concussion and reduces aggro whether it's resisted or not please. ****ing hate those 2 morons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">judging from his replies I seem to have given him some kind of pause, certanly better than what he had been up to previously, to be honest I really cant grasp why hes still posting there, I have never seen an MB that would allow such childish uninformed antagonistic behavior from any of its posters.<br />
<br />
then again the ones I do go to seem to have a rep as being more mature anyway so maybe its just luck. eitherway that asshat needs a spanking.</div></div><hr />
