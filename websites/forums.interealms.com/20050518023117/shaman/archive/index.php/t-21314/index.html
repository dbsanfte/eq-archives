<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Persop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day was playing, and for the first time decided to go to Hates Fury (before it was deignated a hot spot). got to admit looking at the zone entrance from Torigran was really nice. You had the pier with various undead guards/fishermen types and then the stern of the boat. Thought it really nice.<br />
<br />
Also been travelling through older zones to see what they look like with the new sunrises/sets and so far best one I found has been The Overthere. The sun rising over the hills and falling onto the Skyshrine entrance is gorgeous. <br />
<br />
What is your favourite landscape in the game?<br />
<br />
<br />
(See a positive post) :D  :D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i like the grey, no joke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always liked looking across Frontier mountains from Loio zone.<br />
<br />
Running around plane of Fear with everything dead is good too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the rear end of a female vah shir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looking down the waterfall in the Hole.<br />
<br />
Plane of Sky is pretty too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The trees by the combine spires in the Dreadlands.<br />
The waterfall in Great Divide.<br />
The bridge from Iceclad to Eastern Wastes.<br />
I agree about The Grey too.<br />
Doomfire, the Burning Lands has a fiery attraction to it also, as long as you have particle effects on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Plane of Sky hands down is the most exciting view I have seen in EQ.  The imagination of the plane itself, added with the models and sky left my jaw on the floor for five minutes the first time I went there.<br />
<br />
The trial area in PoJ is also a nice piece of eye candy IMO.<br />
<br />
But, the absolute best sight in EQ for me was going to BW to pick up my Earthcaller for my Ranger.  Back when I played him, it was still quite a sight to see a Ranger with both Epics (Hell, its still pretty rare to see a Ranger with both).  Espescially considering I wasn't in an Ubah Guild.  To this day I treasure that moment more than any other.<br />

As for landscape i like PoK a lot, looking down from the top of the library tower.<br />
<br />
Really like Kerra Island aswell  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Favorite spot in the whole game is the waterfall in Stonebrunt. If I could figure out how to captuer the loop I'd make it my desktop in a heartbeat. I havent been back to it since they added the new skies, but now I'm reminded I'm gona' have to make a special trip. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Favorite landscape would prolly be the ruins around CoM ZI in EJ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Myself, I have taken a huge liking to the grassy field in PoAir where you fight Xegony.<br />
<br />
Granted I was there once, and at night (and she wasn't in sight), but it had a really calm/serene feel to it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not necessarily the most beautiful, but the coolest dungeon in the game is Blackburrow... the background music is awesome ;-P<br />
<br />
(I also loved the first time I ran from Qeynos to Freeport, the east karana bridge coming into sight and the music starting to play.. it was a sight to behold!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I really liked the theme of VT the first couple of times there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That's the one thing that the last couple of expansions have lacked, for me:  The &quot;wow&quot; factor.  Not &quot;wow&quot; as translated into &quot;That took 0.2 seconds for me to die,&quot; but &quot;wow&quot; as in &quot;I'm at a loss for words to describe this... gimme a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curiously enough, the most recent &quot;wow&quot; was as a side product of all the zones being given the same sky.<br />
<br />
Allow me to present  Dawn in Nightmare (http://www.users.qwest.net/~taleisin/Misc/DawnInNightmare.jpg).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow for me was the first time I fought the AoW.<br />
<br />
But you have to set it up right, you have to be below the ramp to arena, and back in that little corner. The puller brings AoW around a corner, and then heads straight for your raid force.<br />
<br />
The first time AoW comes around that corner and makes a beeline for the raid, as friggin massive as he is, is an awesome sight for someone who's never experience it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'll admit, there's some kind of raw, primordial beauty about Kunark that's always fascinated me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have to agree that the initial impact of seeing those giants in the Kael Arena was pretty powerful.  I always liked that place.<br />
<br />
Skyshrine on the way to make your turn-ins for CoV armor was incredibly beautiful and awe-inspiring to me.  So huge, so many dragons, all the marble...very exotic!  Halls of Testing was similar but not so grand.<br />
<br />
Plane of Sky definitely was cool.<br />
<br />
I think I've missed a lot of the beauty of new zones because I always keep every visual effect turned off, to tell the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The most beautiful sight in EQ was when I first saw the waterfall and river coming out of Thurgadin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My favorite dungeon to look at is paw. I went past the double doors for the first time EVER (in 4 years of playing) hunting down a collector's split paw eye with my beastlord. The interior lake with it's ledges and pathways was wonderful, and I've always liked gnolls, anyway. I hope that with it being a Hot Spot, more people will get to see it. <br />
<br />
The entire continent of Kunark is exquisite. It's immersive - The ruins aren't cut-and-paste like most of the monuments in Velious, and you can tell there's a story - Who are the three brothers in Frontier Mountains? What about the giant statue in Overthere? Or the two colossi guarding the mouth of the river in Warslik's Woods (which is one of my favorite spots in Kunark, period). What the hell is that windmill for? And who here wasn't impressed by the aqueduct in Trakanon's Teeth the first time they saw it? A lost city overgrown by a hostile jungle? Another, occupied by a dragon who cheated death? It's things like this that made Kunark the best expansion.<br />
<br />
Velious was nice, but certainally lacked the feel of immersiveness Kunark had. But damn! It had some eye candy, huh? My first raid on Growth, i zoned in... And realized I didn't want to screw up my faction for this place, 'cause it is, hands-down the best-looking zone in the expansion. <br />
<br />
And then came Luclin. Sadly, most of it looked pretty darned cartoony. But there's some good spots. Sanctus Seru is gorgeous. Umbral Plains and Scarlet Desert are WONDERFUL for giving you the feeling of being in an alien landscape that could look like paradise but be hell. Seeing Norrath floating overhead is the one huge thing I regret about the sky changes they did. <br />
<br />
Planes of Power failed to really impress me. Plane of Disease was pretty damned neat, though, because you're adventuring on something's giant rotted carcass. Maybe that's where Veeshan got off to? Innovation has great &quot;post apocalyptic&quot; atmosphere. <br />
<br />
LoY is great. It pulls off the whole &quot;haunted pirate island&quot; feel wonderfully, from the smoky water and fog, to the shanty towns and spooky Luggald critters. The take on an &quot;underwater innoruuk&quot; being an amorphic squid-thing ala Cthulhu was pretty good, too.<br />
<br />
Lost Dungeons sucks. There's a few places in Miraguls dungeons that look really nice, and I DO like the &quot;sand tunnel&quot; variety of Takish Hiz, but I can't stand Rujarkan Hills or Mistmoore. And Deepest Guk, neatly enough, LOOKS like Guk. Which is both a point for and against it.<br />
<br />
And now, GoD... I like the underwater of natimbi, as well as the music. Haven't gone past there yet. Abyssal looks neat, too.<br />
<br />
But for me, well, i'm a sucker for Kunark. Every time I just want to goof around and see the world, I wind up in Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Velious tends to be my favorite expansion, but I think its due to the fact that I started playing shortly before it came out.   I was in Skyshrine checking my Yelniak faction, and wow! the zone is massive- just ask anyone who has made that trek to the top.  Even with knowing that I am not kos to the zone doesn't stop me from wanting to con everything in the zone.....just in case.  Other than that I enjoyed the Kunark expansion immensely with all of its nooks and crannies.  There are times when I just want to explore and Kunark is probably the most rewarding when it comes to &quot;finding something new.&quot;  I think back then it felt like Everquest where today it is starting to feel like &quot;Evergrind&quot;.<br />
<br />
Other neat zones:<br />
<br />
Chardok<br />
Sebilis<br />
Temple of Veeshan<br />
Emerald Jungle<br />
Plane of Fear<br />
The Deep<br />
Siren's Grotto<br />
<br />
Edit: almost forgot to mention Dragon's Necropolis<br />
many others that I can't think off right now.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I thought I'd never hear anyone say that kunark looked better than Velious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>woonie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I Have 2 favorite scenes in EQ...<br />
<br />
The Fironia Vie boat - when I first saw it I gasped because it was so pretty<br />
<br />
Nedaria's Landing - that whole zone is so beautiful and I like to go there and swim with the turtles :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Doh, they did away with the overhead Norrath on Luclin? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yep, they did. The &quot;Night&quot; zones (Katta, Tenebrous, Hollowshade) have default night sky, while Grimling and Shar Val are still pitch black. The daylight zones (Sanctus Seru, Marus Seru, Mons letalis and the Grey) don't look any different. The twilight zones (Scarlet Desert, Twilight, Maiden's Eye and Umbral Plains) have that &quot;dim&quot; sky going with lots of haze. Very annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">All in all.. my favorite scenice local in all of EQ.... PoTorment.  It's just got this ambience that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Personally... I think the luclin zones had very good looks to them. I loved the look of vex thal, and the outdoor zones have quite an atmosphere, like scarlet desert. My favorite zone overall though as far as aesthetics would be Grieg's End.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am not as well explored as alot of you, but some of my favorite places have been.<br />
Sirens Grotto, first I think the beauty of the zone really impressed me.<br />
I think Voxes lair, I have only been there once, but I thought it was the coolest thing seeing all the frozen adventures everyone joking around hey look there's splendi's(my char) grandpa!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">one of the prettiest sites:  Xeg's Rainbow..that was cool :)<br />
<br />
Fav zones: Kunark :)  Emerald Jungle rocks (kinda creepy too), Trak's Teeth is cool too.  Warslicks Woods for the whole almost tribal feel of it.  Cabilis is pretty neat too with the bridge and the view of the castle (SK/Shm guild), Veksar....hrm....what can i say?  IMO its pretty damn cool just a giant pain in the ass zone :p hehe.  Pretty much all of Kunark is my fav.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In steamfont, near the huge gears about where the minotaur hero would spawn (usually resulting in many gnome deaths) you can climb the wall to a tiny ledge high up. We used to med there between kills.... With the old sky you could look to the horizon and see the windmills. The memories....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Old Grobb, so primitive ^^.<br />
But will agree on Plane of Fear, The fire colored sky is really amazing, and entering this plane alone adds a lot to the excitment ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">not beautiful , but things that got me totally hooked<br />
<br />
As a new char &gt; leaving the swamp and into South Ro .. dunno why but felt great seeing the wide eq world &gt; then ran into orc camp and died :P<br />
<br />
being scared of the swinging axe near zone in,  in sol a . would it kill me or would it not !!!<br />
<br />
the run across the karanas &gt; KOS all the way . ( to meet a ranger buddy to show him around .. not that i knew my way around!!!!)<br />
<br />
First arrived at the outpost .. bloody sarnaks .. THE BANE , but cool graphics on them<br />
<br />
<br />
PoSky - taking the leap to freeport (not beautiful , but adrenline packed . First time not only worried by the fall , but on arrival would be KOS . had no idea where in freeport i would land :P) When landed safely in the water i decided to get drunk then do some fishing . v.memorable watching sun set whilst catching a horde of rusty weapons and sandals hehe )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Oh how about favorite sound?<br />
<br />
I haven't played with sound on in years, but I remember when I first got close to the big village full of robed guys in Maidens End and heard their creepy satanic-sounding chants!  Wow, now that was atmosphere!  I love that kinda creepy horror-show stuff, and it was really unexpected and a great, immersive touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">the otter guys in CS have the cooliest music in the game!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Man this thread brings back memories.  Eq used to be an awe inspiring game.  There used to be something that was just cool to look at in every single zone, and a lot of it made you feel small, vulnberable.   I can't count how many times I would spend 45 minuets getting somewhere just to take some screenshots.  I haven't done that in a long time.  At some point in time, EQ lost its soul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Velious was always my favourite, iceclad (the bridge.. wow), ew gd, thurg, cc, tofs.<br />
Making the run for the first time, pre spires, pre maps was amazing.<br />
Such a hostile place, with the dwarves hiding to save themselves, it had personaility. Makes me want to fix my dwarf faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Yeah the otter's with their silly fezzes and the music there was great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">threads like this should be sticked imo...stuff like this is why i keep coming back to the crucible :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Maybe I'm alone in this, but I always loved the Karanas ... as a scrappy little newb they we're just so intimidatingly expansive.  I was in awe at the bridge from NK to EK.  Took me an hour to realize there was no way I was going to be able to ghetto climb up that bridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">My personal happy place is the Tribunal room in PoJustice.  Was my desktop for well over 6 months, and I still get teary-eyed every time I go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I personally think the Queen of Thorns was pretty astounding.  Not very pretty, but nice to see a cool boat... sort of like the gnomish one from back in velious.  I was sooo psyched when I saw gnome pirates!  I really loved the bridges as well, way back when.  Watching the sunset over the ocean in OOT was nice too.<br />
<br />
Most boring visually?  Tie between 90 percent of Iceclad Ocean and the majority of the Karanas.  I could have designed those zones with autocad in about 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
I was also pretty impressed when I first noticed the huge iksar statues over the mountain in the distance in Frontier Mountains.<br />
<br />
Kunark was pretty but trees blocked half of my view half of the time, and my ram back then made the tree swaying turn my view to about nothing.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure the Bazaar and Plane of Knowledge are beautiful, I wouldn't know, all I know is they have really ugly floors :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Elharina Lokhem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I think the scene that had the most impact for me was the walkway down from High Pass Hold back int he days before Kunark, sure graphically it's no great shakes anymore, but when I first saw it was was pretty awed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">May sound odd, but the place I absolutely adore the most is PoHate.  The whole place just speaks evil.  The architect is astounding.  The details in the buildings and pillars, esp is you have environmental particals.  This zone just fascinates me.  Even down to the zone emotes.  &quot;you really hate this place&quot; etc. By far my 'coolest' looking zone.<br />
<br />
Alot of Luclin has some gorgeous scenary.  Kunark has some impressive jungles. Even places like SolA/B/C in 'old world' have very impressive design (lava rivers, wall paintings/sculptures, etc).  Velious with it's stark white frozen landscape, jagged ice flows, snow banks.<br />
<br />
PoP was fairly blah compared to the previous expansions.  GoD, well I don't go there is if I can help it, so not sure about it yet.<br />
<br />
By far though, it's Hate for my favorite.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the characters, mobs/etc have gotten more interesting as expansions move forward.  Those wield guys in GoD..kev eyeholders or something, Luggalds in Dulak, the guards in Justice, flying 'asparagus' in Air...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I really enjoy sitting in the Overthere on the ramp leading into Skyfire Mountains on a clear day. Buffing up some noobs and just enjoying the scenery.<br />

One of my favorite times/scenes though has to be the arena in Kael. I had the opportunity to play a guild Kael Raid once on a LCD projector. Giants were as tall as the room. Just struck me, &quot;this place really is Big!&quot;</div></div><hr />

   The ledge overlooking the derv camp in SRO just north of the LDON camp.  It's one of the earliest memories I have of camping a particular spot and being in a group (summer of 99 ).  You can see clear across the zone towards Oasis.<br />

  The riverbank  running down West Karana from QH to EK...nice soothing music...farmhouses, cornfields...Ma and Pa Kettle....<br />

Being able to run through the Karanas to HHP/HHK.<br />
<br />
The first trip from FP to Faydark.<br />
<br />
The canyon going up to HHP was frikken scary.  I remember staying next to the wall to make sure I didn't fall in accidentally.<br />
<br />
My first sightings of a Sand Giant, Hill Giant, and Ice Giant, knowing the would pummel my arse.  WOW!<br />
<br />
First time in Kael.<br />
<br />
First time in Sky.<br />
<br />
First time breaking Fear...sheesh!<br />
<br />
First time in WW, and levi'ing down the canyon to ToV, with all the dragons standing guard, and Sontalak in the entrance.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, I miss factioning at times.  It's not even important anymore, and the new players wouldn't have a clue about what it took to get into other cities.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the bar having beers and swapping stories with Klurg...still one of my favorite things, and do it regularly.</div></div><hr />
