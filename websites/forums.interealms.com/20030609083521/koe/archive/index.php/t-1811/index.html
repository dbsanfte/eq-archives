<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, Im putting some effort into Taul again over the next few weeks to take him into his 50's and usefullness on raids.  Im looking for some stout adventurers with hearts of stone and nerves of steel to do some seriously crazy xping.... <br />
<br />
The fighting is fast and furious, oftentimes you will be forced to do things that you think arent possible :p  You will probably die a few times in the process also.... <br />
<br />
However, yesterday, in the 6.5hrs I played all day, and two unrezzed deaths... I made 7 yellow bubbles.  I did two yellows of lvl 32, and all 5 of lvl 33... <br />
<br />
If anyones up for it, let me know ;) Im not sure where the fighting will be, or what kind of fighting... chainpulls/AEing/mob rushing... but that all depends on the group makeup ;)</div></div><hr />
