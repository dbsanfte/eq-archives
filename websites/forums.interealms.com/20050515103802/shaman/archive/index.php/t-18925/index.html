For those not in game, they are Consumption and Spirit Shield, respectively.<br />

We can only hope that they aren't done with AA's yet :)</div></div><hr />

so lets say the aa's get changed a few times, yadda yadda and they go live  ... do you think most shaman will waste 30$ on this expansion just for a new canni ? one that im guessing will suck so much ass as to only be canni 3 but cost you 15 aa's ...<br />
im sorry 30$ isn't worth watching a beastlord out do me on almost all levels ... if i wanted to see that i would be a beastlord, im  a shaman not a flea bag herder.</div></div><hr />

You know that expansions do more than give you AA, right?  We also get spells (which may or may not suck), new zones, new encounters, new everything.  And what would make you think that a new canni AA will suck?  Canni5 is the best AA we get, and if we get a new canni AA, it can only be better.<br />
<br />
As for your blurb about beastlords being better than us at everything, I am just so sick of hearing it and explaining why it isn't even close to true that I am just going to say this:  You are wrong.<br />
<br />
If the AA prices stay the same as they are it won't matter if they have an aa that give shaman BL melee capabilities whenever they want, they'll still be worthless..<br />
<br />
Think about how fast you got AA points in luclin, and then compare that to AA exp in PoP.  If the difference between GoD and PoP is as big as it was between PoP and luclin, 20aa isn't all that bad.  It isn't insignificant, but it isn't unobtainable.  I remember when I first saved for canni5.  I got those 23 AA and it seemed like it took forever.  360AA later, it doesn't seem all that bad any more :)  It's all relative.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I'll agree on that.  Spent weeks at 4c in Cazic-Thule, which was about the best exp you could find at the time.  Today, spend a few hours a day for a week in Tactics and you'd be gold.  Even better if you've got elemental access.<br />
<br />
I doubt they'll be upping the rate of AA considerably in GoD, there will be a few choice spots, but people are already getting an easy 30 minutes per in elementals, I don't think they'll go below that anywhere.  Be nice for those of us stuck outside the EP's though, pick up the pace a little if need be.</div></div><hr />
