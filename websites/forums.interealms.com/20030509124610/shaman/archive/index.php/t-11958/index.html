<br />
My understanding is that FT is capped at 15 cause no 2 FT items of the same value can stack.<br />
<br />
FT1 + FT2 + FT3 + FT4 + FT5 =  FT 15<br />
<br />
Or is the cap only 15 and can you just use any combo to reache it...<br />
<br />
(3) FT 5 for the total = FT 15</div></div><hr />

It &quot;used to&quot; be that FTitems of the same number didnt stack together, but FT wasnt max capped.  However, now FT items of the same value stack but 15 is max FT you can get with any combo of items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What about AA does that count towards the 15 limit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no mental clarity doesnt count as ft</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not only do AA not count as FT's cap, there are several other forms of mana regen that also don't count as FT: the effect on the 8th Coldain Shawl--Zephyr of Brell--is 3 points of mana regen that will stack with FT. The effect on Shawl of Awakening is supposedly 5 points of mana regen that don't count as FT. So you can actually get mana regen much higher than 15 from equipment, but only 15 of it can be Flowing Thought items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That isn't exactly true Fudapuda.  Any WORN items that add to mana regen do count towards the cap, FT or otherwise.  Only items that add a Buff that increases mana regen will not count against the 15 cap.  Example: Aten Necklace has a worn effect that is 8 mana regen and 8 hp regen.  That 8 mana regen counts towards the 15 FT cap (and the 8 hp regen counts towards the 30 hp regen cap).<br />
<br />
Items like Shadowed Storm Sphere that have a buff that increases mana regen, does not count against the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fudapuda,<br />
<br />
Jaradis is correct. That is an incorrect and old rummor from when the effect on the shawl was a combined FT and focus effect. In it's current form the shawl has the focus effect zypher of brell which is just a buff extension focus effect on it and has a regular effect of Flowing thought 3. So it doesn't even have the combined effect anymore that was suppose to make it stack altho it never did stack.<br />
<br />
The only regen you can get from items that isn't counted towards ft cap is clicked effects that actually take up a buff slot. The emp shawl and a couple Lunar wipsers items are the only ones I know of off hand that fit into this category.</div></div><hr />
