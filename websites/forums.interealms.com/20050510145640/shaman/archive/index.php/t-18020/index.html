Pet Damage Per Second; Swings Per Second; average hit amount -- buffs<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
12.7 DPS; 0.65 SPS; 36.1 ave hit -- base unbuffed<br />
22.9 DPS; 1.04 SPS; 37.9 ave hit -- SLTW<br />
33.5 DPS; 1.59 SPS; 37.4 ave hit -- SLTW + dual wield (two rusty weapons)<br />
38.0 DPS; 1.63 SPS; 40.8 ave hit -- SLTW + dual wield + Maniacal Str<br />
37.3 DPS; 1.62 SPS; 41.2 ave hit -- SLTW + dual wield + Focus of Soul<br />
42.9 DPS; 1.56 SPS; 47.4 ave hit -- SLTW + dual wield + Focus of Soul + Ferine Avatar<br />

<br />
I am assuming there is some margin of error, how much is debatable, but for my theories here I assume up to a margin of 1 DPS. <br />
<br />
a. Error exists between the DPS difference on the parses with MS, and FoS.<br />
<br />
b. The SLTW+DW+FoS is more accurate than the one with MS.<br />
<br />
c. The extra strength in focus added no DPS, therefore TrueSpirit is at max str with MS.<br />
<br />
d. The +140 ATK from FA adds 5.6 DPS, the eqivalency of a buff of 140 STR without a stat cap.<br />
<br />
e. The parse with MS+SLTW+DW is in error.<br />
<br />
f. The parse with FA's 140+ ATK at 5.6DPS will be deemed accurate at thie point in time of this theory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
<br />
True Spirit's base strength is close to 180, this I believe to be fairly accurate. When 140ATK adds 5.6 DPS and 75 STR add 3.8 DPS we have a definate discrepency. Logic only points that 75 str bring dogdog close to max STR and that the STR parse without FA is either too high, or the FA parse was low.<br />
<br />
Therefore in a perfect world assuming direct proportions with a Muzzle of Mardu and 2 mage summoned swords/fists (walnan/kedge/ixiblat) his DPS will top out at:<br />
<br />
SLTW=1.6SPS + 10% haste= 1.7SPS (perfect world remember). The numbers come out to 45.6 DPS. Using 100 seconds timeline for theory I will assume the proc rate that ruca posted at 1 proc every 45 seconds. I am going to assume 3 procs in that time, 2 for main hand and 1 for the off hand.<br />
<br />
A Grand total of 49 DPS if my logic isn't flawed in some way the second time around.<br />
<br />
He would fall the cliff golem in just over 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Assuming no buff extensions:<br />
<br />
For an initial cost of 2200 mana you get 13 minutes of play time<br />
at roughly 38K damage during that time. Roughly 17 damage per mana.<br />
<br />
Keeping Saryrn up for that long would almost cost 10k mana.<br />
<br />
Still not bad though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FA is +140atk.<br />
<br />
It would be cool to get comparable parses with the muzzle and proc weaps to see the optimal pooch dps.</div></div><hr />

Gah- was glued to the drawing board for too long i Guess. The 140ATK on FA messes up my theories on STR some. I found Lucy's info inaccurate, although I would love it was true :)<br />

You're right, folk at the magecompendium say its 10 percent. Tweaking my original post then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try this:<br />
SLTW + dual wield + Focus of Spirit<br />
SLTW + dual wield + Maniacal Strength<br />
SLTW + dual wield + Focus of Spirit + Maniacal Strength<br />
SLTW + dual wield + IOS + Maniacal Strength<br />
<br />
Primary differences are in strength, with some minor differences in dex.<br />
If there is no difference in DPS, then you may be right that max str was achieved.<br />
An additional test would be to throw in Primal Essence and redo the tests I suggested above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Long range bump.<br />
I'm discussing the effects boosts in strength will have on attack values on my guild board with a paladin, and I was looking for some of the older posts that went into detail with the pet dps parses and detailed explanations.  This was a good beginning, but I know there are some more comprehensive parses and discussions somewhere...<br />
<br />
I know I read recently here where someone posted the formula for how strength values are converted into raised attack values, but I've spent 20 minutes searching and I still can't find it.<br />
<br />
I was also going to search for Nytemare's landmark pet dps research post, but he's made over 1000, and my eyes hurt. :p <br />
Jinheim (or whoever), come to the rescue of a tired bear! :D <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually, maniacle strength won't stack with focus of soul, he wouldn't be able to try that...<br />
<br />
It'd be interesting to see what kind of difference it would make if you stacked on Str of Diaku though, since that does stack with fos and ferine..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">cast maniacle strength first, then focus and they stack ... or at least icon is staying in pet window</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Am not familiar with the original research for this, but was the pet attacking a mob of similar level?  I am guessing, but the level of the mob, not to mention the expansion (luclin = high ac), would have a large impact on those #'s.<br />
<br />
good stuff so far though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What if Strength wasn't capped for pets and ATK wouldn't do ****, so that the DPS increase came solely from the added strength from FA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">cast maniacle strength first, then focus and they stack<br />
<br />
I believe the actual effect is like casting SLTW and VoQ - while both appear to stack, the actual affects are haste from SLTW and other effects from VoQ are active, whereas the haste effect from VoQ is nullified.<br />
<br />
So, pet would have maniacle str quantity but only hp, etc. from Focus.<br />
<br />
My 'assumptions' may be skewed (not looking up the actual details atm) but the net effect is correct. Effects of the buffs when they stack take the best from the two buffs and nullify the lesser one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VQ, not VoQ.<br />
<br />
VQ = Vallons Quickening<br />
VoQ = Voice of Quellious<br />
<br />
Nitpicky I know, but still.<br />
<br />
I tried stacking MS &amp; Focus of Soul last night . . . it no longer works.  I know it used to work, but last night . . . no dice.<br />
<br />
PE + Daiku + FoS might work tho, but not with FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nice, but alos rem that that high dps isnt what you get againt elemental or higher mobs. pet misses and low hits alot there.</div></div><hr />
