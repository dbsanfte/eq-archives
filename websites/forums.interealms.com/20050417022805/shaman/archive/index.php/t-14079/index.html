City of Mist is a good spot both solo and grouped. I have mostly gone solo here, but everytime I am in zone, I have had offers for a group... exp is pretty good, and there are plenty of Mobs to choose from.<br />
<br />
The other bonus is that there are several pieces for the epic in this zone as well.</div></div><hr />
