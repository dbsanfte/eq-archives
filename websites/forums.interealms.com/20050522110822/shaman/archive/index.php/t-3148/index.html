<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have come to somewhat of a delemia with the current loot in luclin regarding items with flowing thought.<br />
<br />
It is conventional wisdom that shaman are in no need of flowing thought items.  With todays mana regeneration buff spells combined with our own cannibalize powers, FT is somewhat of a waste for us.  Not that it isnt useful, but compared to other classes such as clerics and druids that have no natural mana regeneration other than sitting, we have little need for it.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse I totaly agree with this.  It is even arguable that, even if we had no special means of mana regeneration, clerics would benefit more from flowing thought items because it is far more important for a cleric to be able to regain large ammounts of mana on a raid than for shaman to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the beginning of flowing thought, there were two issues.  To begin with, most flowing thought items had a low FT number (1 or 2).  And all items with flowing thought had reduced stat bonuses compared with other loot from similarily difficult encounters.  In other words, to get flowing thought you had to trade off stats.<br />
<br />
This was quite perfect for shaman, because we were more after gear with pure stats and were thus content to leave all the ft gear for clerics, druids, and the like.  But luclin was to change this...<br />
<br />
Today, the best gear in the game has flowing thought.  To clarify, the best shield in the game that a shaman can get is the shield off the high priest.  If this shield had absolutly no flowing thought at all, it would still be the best shield we can get.  This will remain true thought many different examples, and espically ture in vex thal.<br />
<br />
So, to get to the issue at hand.  For purposes of argument assume the only loot we are considering is luclin loot.  If you are a shaman, and are looking to upgrade your gear, your going to have to make a choice.  <br />
<br />
Take items with flowing thought over clerics and druids, or never upgrade certain slots.<br />
<br />
To get to the examples.  If you want to upgrade your chestplate in luclin, there are only two bp's that even drop that a shaman can wear.  One has FT5, and the other FT7 (burrower bp, mail of judgment).  You may want these items &gt;Even if they didnt have flowing thought&lt;.  But they do, so because they do you have to deal with the above issue.<br />
<br />
Now me personaly, I wouldnt take an item with FT over a class that needs it more than me <br />
<br />
But it is a source of frustration to know that certain slots just wont get upgraded because the best items in the game (stats wise) have large ft also.<br />
<br />
So my question is, is FT a gift for us? or a bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Frankly, you are one of a precious few who still think this way.  I have become pretty jaded with the fact that there are guilds full of people out only for themselves, never even pausing for a moment to think of who might benefit MOST from a given piece of gear.  There was a point in time when I could tell you every piece of gear all of the primary monks (my primary) in my guild was wearing, and thus I knew who needed what upgrade the most.  If something nice dropped, I immediately knew who needed it most and informed the loot council who I thought should receive it.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, over time, no one knows or cares what gear I'm wearing.  When something drops, their thoughts turn first to themselves, wondering how they can get their hands on it, regardless of whether its an end game item for another class/person and just a minor upgrade for them.   <br />
<br />
I guess the point of the above 2 paragraphs boils down to commending you on even raising this question, obviously having given it some thought, but back to your situation, and shamans in general.  I think its purely an item by item judgement call, one that requires an intimate knowledge of a whole lot more than just your classes drops, but also the gear available to others...you'd have to know how close to an end-game shield that same drop is for a cleric, or a druid, compared to you.  Sure, it may be the best shield for a shaman, but is it further away from the one you have now/could obtain than an equivalent shield for a cleric?  <br />
<br />
On to your FT issue, I agree that FT should pretty much default away from us in almost every circumstance.  However, FT really is just a stat, and while its a very important one, it shouldn't be treated quite like the holy grail that some people consider it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't really think the way you would. Merit solves the problems of that because the officers of the guild will decide on who will use the armor best and they also take into account how often you raid and such. If in the eyes of the guild the FT item would be better off in the hands of the cleric it shall go that way and you don't have to think twice about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With Blessed Armor of the Risen, clerics now get a self-only 6 mana a tic boost.<br />
<br />
Druids have had Protection of the Groves for some time, which is also a 6 point mana regen. For those rare instances when raids take place in outside zones, this also stacks with their final wolf form, which is another 2 (?) mana a tic.<br />
<br />
When it comes to FT items, I very rarely make a grab before a cleric who might need it more than I, but if there's an item with very shaman-friendly stats, I don't care if it has FT1 or FT60, I'm putting in for it.<br />
<br />
This isn't an issue of selfish or selflessness. It's simply the fact that there's lots of nice items in the game that lots of people can use, and often these 'who to give it to' questions will come up, and by counting myself out, I'm not doing anyone any real favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just go for what u think u deserve.  Its not fair to be asked to defer on every item u dream of just because u dont NEED it.  If u work hard u deserve to be rewarded.  This is one advantage of the points system, u know where u stand.  If ure 50 points above the next wis caster then u dam well deserved any item u want to take.  Personally I only go for the best FT items, if its mediocre Im not interested.  Also 100 hp to a cleric or druid isnt all that useful either, but it certainly is for a shaman.  So those 100 100 ft items kinda rock heh, just use ure own judgement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our guild gives prefernce on FT items to clerics currently but I still don't have a problem with it. That doesn't mean a shaman has no chance of getting a FT item just that a cleric is more likely to get it. I have no problem with that. Sure the shield of the sshra might be the best shield around but the sheild of holy vigor isn't far behind and that has haste. As far as the burrower tunic goes I wouldn't wear that one over a vindi bp anyway so it doesn't bother me at all.<br />
<br />
Altho I will say that by the time your hitting the VT loot like the mail of judgment FT shouldn't really matter anymore. You have access to soo many large FT items that everyone, shaman included should be nearing the ft15 cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have no problem going after FT items myself ... our guild uses a point-based system where people bid on items, so I'm confident that the person who most would benefit from a piece of gear will bid the most points on it. If that ends up being me, great. If not, then it was better for someone else.<br />
<br />
That said, I dont' want FT just for the sake of FT.  I'm more interested in other stuff, FT is the icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thrallsaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">::With Blessed Armor of the Risen, clerics now get a self-only 6 mana a tic boost. <br />

<br />
Have you ever actually played a cleric or druid with those spells? They dont come anywhere near comparing to cann 5. They really dont come very close to cann 4. Cann 5 is ~330 mana/minute, including the mana to torpor back the hp lost. BAotR is ... 60?<br />
No real comparison.<br />
<br />
I'm an officer in Vae, and also a shaman, and I agree with Rag that it's really frustrating to pass up loot after loot because of FT, but in our particular guild, SHM dont generally get FT items, because clerics, druids, wizards, etc etc do need them more. We're on of the few casting classes that manage zoo and emp debuffs, etc etc and never even need to look around for another mod rod. We're one of the few casting classes that are back in business in less then a minute after a res. The sad reality is, in a guild where loot is awarded to the person who can make the most use of it, Shamans wont get FT items until everyone else has em, and we're nowhere near that.<br />
<br />
It is frustrating, and I really wish that, with the 100'ish items in VT, a few more that are shm-useable hadnt been given the FT effect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why yes, I have. <br />
<br />
I didn't say that they made up for the loss. I was simply pointing out a correction to the statement that druids and clerics had no natural increased mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
The idea that a shaman should count himself out of a good item of loot that he or she would be able to use due to FT is simply silly. That means that any shaman with GoDS should have not taken them, since shamans don't get as much out of haste as other classes might. Or a shaman with a Dain belt shouldn't have, since the minor regen isn't as important for a shaman as the ATK might have been for a rogue. <br />
<br />
There is too much nice stuff that a good number of people can use in the game to put any great amount of stress on whether or not someone else might get more use out of a passive effect on an item. Especially one as subtle as FT. Frankly, the idea of passing on the Shield of Ssra is just foolish in my mind. Would a cleric get more use out of the FT than me? Sure,  but I'll get more use out of the 100 HP than him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are in a larger guild that raids a lot and depends on its clerics, then I would agree that they should be outfitted with FT items first.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you are in a smaller guild that does not raid a lot and usually gets things done with small groups (such as the one I am in), then there's no problem with rolling along with clerics for the FT items.<br />
<br />
There are many times when I am the cleric of a group.  And any form of mana regen would help my groupmates and I tremendously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh guessing no one will know what zoo means, sorta obscure use of it we have.<br />
<br />
i agree, i wish certain items didn't have FT so that id feel less guilty getting them. cann5 works out to FT28 i heard once, sounds about right. for a class with 30+ mana/tick regen to take a mana regen increasing item over a class that has ~9, is a bad allocation of resources, flat out. then you take into consideration that cleric mana is essential to high end encounters and it makes it even more silly for a shaman or necros to take huge FT items when a main cleric still has low FT.<br />
<br />
my stance on it has been, low priority on FT, but not zero priority. there are other factors involved in who 'should' get loot besides who will the item benifit the most, and on who the item will benifit the guild the most.<br />
<br />
other factors like on who will the item actually see the most /played time on, and who hasn't gotten something nice in awhile, and how much they contribute, can outweigh the FT priority.  <br />
<br />
that, and just waiting a little for the non mana regen classes to get some good FT, which ive been doing.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes- let's introduce the human equation into this. Lord knows officers of guilds are always 100% accurate with whom they deign to let loot those precious pixels.<br />

DKP is about being fair. If you can only make 1/10th the raids I can - do you deserve equitable loot?<br />

I use to think this way, but after I got a couple ft items the difference is so great that I would never give up ft and I want more.  Also, I do NOT have Cana5 yet. I just got mc3 after 6+ months of luclin so I am not counting on 5more points anytime soon.<br />
<br />
The main reason I disagree is that the only time mana regen really matters is actually DURRING a fight.  FT is great, but slow and only minor (unless near cap) with c3 and bard song going.  With FT5 it takes 10min to get an extra CH, and alot of fights are over by then.  Mod rods are far more important to clerics during a fight than any ft.<br />
<br />
Durring a fight I can constantly canabalize so I wont use mod rods, but I wont pass on ft items just because it has ft on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am not personally at this level, or my guid raiding luclin ubers.  I would probably take the piece if it was an upgrade for me, even if I didn't need FT because, well, it is an upgrade and the FT still helps me some.  Same way as druids don't use the ac as much, but say the item has 50ac, they would still want it even if they can't put the ac to it's full use.  This is just my opinion though, if I ever got to the raiding level for this.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want to just be ignored because an item has a certain stat that helps me and druids and clerics, but is not as good for me.  If anything I would wait till all of the clerics and druids had one to win one.<br />
<br />
I would leave it up to my guild's loot council if it came down to that, and most would probably include a Shaman into consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">well, as a druid, i find tbhis a really interesting discussion.<br />
<br />
my 2 cents really, are that nice stats are nice stats, and ft6 is only one of the stats on a shield like that. the 100 hp/mana to me is another huge one that a lot of classes can use. i know hp is more important to the can5 shaman, but a extra bit of hp has never hurt anyone, the same way extra mana regen won't hurt a shaman.<br />
<br />
bwahahaha<br />
<br />
<br />
anyways, i believe in DKP. fook who can use this best, whoever has put in the time to help your guild more deserves a nice item like this, whether is has 100 hp/mana, ft6, or +50% nuke damage increase.<br />
<br />
still nice to see it discussed among shaman, and courtesy given by some. it hurts me when i hear druids getting left out of item rolls, simply because they aren't clerics. that imo, is the biggest **** in the world :D</div></div><hr />

Not to be rude but if you think that a couple of FT items make a big difference you should get off your ass and get cann v. There really is no compairison for mana regen ability.<br />

<br />
actually it's only 8 minutes to regen enough mana for a ch with FT 5. 5 mana regen a tick x 10 ticks a minute = 50 mana a minute. 8 minutes x 50 mana = 400 mana for for a CH. This of corse ignoring mana saved by normal specializations and spell casting mastery if they happen to have it. Mod rods are definitely useful to a cleric and have it's place but FT is still a very useful thing for a cleric to have.<br />
<br />
Durring a fight I can constantly canabalize so I wont use mod rods, but I wont pass on ft items just because it has ft on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically to get the top item per slot as a priest, you are going to have to take FT items. I have FT 22, and I sure as hell didnt take any loot for the FT effect.  I will tell ya tho, before the cap was fixed I rarely ever had to use can 4 or can 5 on raids. <br />
<br />
From my way of thinking the number of FT items isnt balanced with the current cap of 15. Not to mention that when/if focus effects are added to the higher end gear, alot of the top priest gear will have to either be changed from FT to the focus effect, or passed over. I don't see VI putting FT AND focus effects on the same item, which will greatly reduce the number of items they can put focus on from the very start. If you take the judgment line of items in VT as an example, 3 of the 7 items dont have an effect at all, rune, bracer and mask. Torch,BP,legs have a combined FT of 17(over the cap with 3 items) and the shield has a casting level boost effect. So right from the start you have under half of the final priest line of armor that could even &quot;maybe&quot; have a focus effect. Now take a quick look at some of the other top loot per slot for priests. Emp boots(FT), Emp torque(hp effect), Emp shawl(mana regen effect), Aten quest neck(multi regen effect which counts against FT cap). <br />
<br />
I guess the real question is how willing people would be to accept FT being taken off an item in favor for focus. Not to mention how willing VI would be in making such a drastic change to items people have obtained. Will be interesting to see when the time comes.</div></div><hr />

Excuse me? who the f@#$ do you think you are to say something like that?  I have a life, work and a new baby.  Plus I am in a uber raiding guild, and most of my time online is spent raiding and not soloing shrooms in FG like some snot-nosed 16 year old high-school loser.<br />

<br />
being upset about your mana regen as a shaman without getting cannibalize 5 first is the comment of someone who just wants to complain, and not do something about it. you want mana regen, you earn it, either by getting raid loot or axp grinds.<br />
<br />
jen, i think VI will likely take their sweet time in addressing the FT balance, since relatively few casters are in your predicament. i do think they should have slapped some of the better focus effects on high end luclin loot.<br />
<br />
btw im assuming someone in AL has a brilliance of ro item. is it bugged ors it actually work? if it does thats one insane shaman item for debuffing.</div></div><hr />

*** is wrong with you people.</div></div><hr />

Not to be rude but if you think that a couple of FT items make a big difference you should get off your ass and get cann v. There really is no compairison for mana regen ability. <br />
<br />
Excuse me? who the f@#$ do you think you are to say something like that?  I have a life, work and a new baby.  Plus I am in a uber raiding guild, and most of my time online is spent raiding and not soloing shrooms in FG like some snot-nosed 16 year old high-school loser.<br />
<br />
And yes FT6 that I have now plus MC3 = Innate Clarity. I think that makes damn huge difference and I dont see how anyone could disagree. <br />
<br />
If you have time to get ft 3 from items you had time to get Cann V. It's a matter of priorities. I have had Cann V for quite a while I'll admit that but then again I recognized how useful it was and worked hard to get it. Same thing for MGB the next skill I got. I skipped some raids where I wasn't needed because thier where other shaman at the raid. I spent all my free time doing exp. Log in, raid hasn't started yet. Straight to exp. Raid over but got an hour or 2 before bed, get exp.<br />
<br />
Since finishing off MGB and Cann V 2 months ago I have managed to get a whole 3 AA points because I've been busy doing other things. If you decide you want something there's always ways to get there.<br />
<br />
If you have other shaman around and it isn't critical that your around I'd skip some raids and get exp. Cann v is huge for a shaman and makes them even more valuable for thier guild.<br />
<br />
And since you brought it up I'm 25. Work a 40+ hour a week job and have a life too and am in one of the major raiding guilds on my server too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm told that brilliance of ro only effects fizzles, and not resist rates. If it did effect resist rates, the effect itself could never be set at +20 levels like it is now. Imagine how overpowered that would be, casting spells at level 80.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">As Ragnarokk said, the price of FT items is too high in Luclin. Shaman's get the least return from FT items since we have the cannibalization line of spells, but it's also worth mentioning that never in my EQ career have I turned down breeze /  clarity / KEI. Extra mana regen is nice, but not really essential for shamans. When items with a fair bit of FT on them drop, I tend to stay out to allow our clerics / wizards / mages get them who would undoubtedly be better off with them. But for small items with FT 1 or 2, I'll go in on if the other statistics are worth it. I don't really judge an item on how high the FT on it is, but whether the HP / AC / stats make a nice upgrade to my current slot. I have FT 5 at the moment without actively pursuing it (Earring of the Solstice - FT 1, Eye of Cazic Thule - FT 1, Cogboggle's Clockwork Contraption - FT 1, Talisman of the Burrower - right click FT 2), in addition to MC 3 for a total of 8 mana regen.</div></div><hr />
