<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got done reading Gloriana's excellent report of the EQ Summit.  When I go to the following section:<br />
<br />
I did my best to convince Ryan that stat buffs were marginally effective at best, but he wasn't convinced.<br />
<br />
So, let's convince him.<br />
<br />
Four years ago I was a level 20-odd shaman when I stumbled across someone's study on STR, DEX, and AGI and what minuscule effect they actually had.  It was heartbreaking.  I suddenly went from skilled practitioner to snake oil peddler -- casting my placebo buffs to elicit 'oohs' and 'aahs' from the less informed.<br />
<br />
And I boggled.  Oh how I boggled at Verant.  Potions that raised two stats while lowering another.  A six minute buff that cost an emerald and could only be maintained on two players.  The bizzaro, self-only Rage line that used to empty your mana bar.  Focus having a shorter duration than Virtue and KEI.  Do they honestly think stat buffs are that obscenely powerful?  Or am I just misinformed?  Ryan has to know more than we do.  Are we just missing something?<br />
<br />
<br />
Proposal<br />
<br />
Let's work out a simple, controlled template for meaningful parsing and, using the same kind of pooled resources that helped us created the One Voice thread, test the living hell out of stats.  Drag out your alts of all levels and beat them senseless against all kinds of mobs.  Log it all and we'll show Ryan the results.<br />
<br />
I would like to discuss how to conduct those meaningful tests and flesh out the testing template.  Those of you with a background in statistics would be of great help.  Before we test though, we need to know what we're testing for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1: Identify our Expectations<br />
<br />
There are seven player stats; strength, stamina, agility, dexterity, wisdom, intelligence, and charisma.  We'll focus (groan!) on our forte --  melee stats.  STR/STA/AGI/DEX.  Yeah, yeah, shush about CHA and slows. <br />
<br />
From the EQ Manual:<br />
<br />
<br />
Strength: Physical strength; affects how much you can carry, how much melee damage you deliver to a target, and how fast you learn some skills.<br />
<br />
Stamina: Health and constitution; affects your maximum number of hit points at each level. <br />
<br />
Agility: Physical agility; affects your probability of being hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some skills.<br />
<br />
Dexterity: Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver with a bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks, how fast you learn certain skills, and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark. Also affects some skills and Bard songs. <br />
<br />
<br />
My understanding of these stats are as follows.  Some of this is likely folklore so please correct me where I err.  Please have a source to support your observations.<br />
<br />
Strength merely raises the maximum hit value.  It does not add damage to every hit, only those that land within the increased range of the new maximum.  Strength does not increase your chances of hitting your target.  Your attack value goes up simply because attack is a representation of two internal values; you potential to hit and your potential to do damage.<br />
<br />
Stamina adds hitpoints based on level and class.  I took a break and honestly don't know how the new endurance bar works.  The old system was STA under 100 would cause fatigue if your stamina bar emptied during combat.  Also affects how long you can remain underwater.<br />
<br />
Agility increases your armor class (evasive only?).  May affect your chance to perform a defense action?  Also affects the rate at which you learn defense skills.<br />
<br />
Dexterity increases your chance to proc and perform special attacks.  Also affects the rate at which you learn offense skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Official Comments on Stat Buffs (not a lot)<br />
	<br />
ABASHI ON STAT INFORMATION, MARCH 1, 2000:<br />
<br />
Source: alt.games.everquest.<br />
<br />
People are trying to do statistical sampling to determine the value of stats, and there have been somewhat varied results because of all the variables in the game. Since stats are a programmatic effect, someone at Verant knows exactly the effect of each stat (there should be no contradicting statements). What harm is there in releasing that information?<br />
<br />
The harm is that any official information is taken as gospel, and anything that differs from new perception is considered &quot;useless&quot;.  I made a comment about dex once.  Within minutes, shamans were screaming that they were &quot;useless&quot;.  Did anything concrete change? No. Only perception did.<br />
<br />
That's why we are going to let you form your own perception.  You decide which items are &quot;good&quot; and which are &quot;useless&quot;.<br />

SHAMAN CLASS DISCUSSION, JANUARY 27, 2001:<br />
<br />
Source: EverQuest General Forums.<br />
<br />
Avatar – Does not stack with Focus of Spirit and Wolf Form. Even if you want to make some of the components (str for example) not stack please make the overall buff and non-redundant parts of these stack. This is not the main problem however, which is that for 325 mana, a 1 minute duration and a 3 minute recast, with quite questionable benefits (for example this is not anywhere near what 70% haste spells do), shamans do not use this spell at all.<br />
<br />
Again, it seems like a great spell to me. Perhaps others can wade in here and explain to me why this isn't a good spell. Keep in mind that stacking is a very complicated issue.<br />
<br />
So we got hit by a couple nerfs aimed at others, and the &quot;king of buffs&quot; title was both misleading and largely useless, but all in all, it was a good class. What happened with Kunark? Well, look at the spell list as a whole:<br />
<br />
1. We got a TON of buffs. All 5 stats get a bigger version AND all 5 get group versions. About a third of the RoK spell list is buffs.<br />
<br />
I gather you disagree with the continuance of buffs as the main focus of shaman. I think I understand this, and I'll bring it to the team. Don't, however, expect a revamp of all the spells post 50. It's not very likely that we'll be suddenly changing all buffs to DD spells or something wild like that. As you stated, up to 50 shamans are pretty darn great. I'm of the opinion that buffs are part of that greatness. But I think I see what you're getting at.<br />
<br />
The one that takes up over a third of our spell list: buffs.  It's really puzzling. One gets the feeling that the live team doesn't really quite grasp the role of the shaman in high level play, and although they think they're giving us key improvements in our major areas, we see them as near-worthless toss-ins that add to the pile of low-value spells that take the place that more interesting or useful spells could go. What's more, impinging on our REAL defining abilities by other classes is okay because they're not viewed by the design team as being shaman core abilities.<br />
<br />
It seems that it's worthwhile to have a talk about stat buffs in house. But, well, I'm not convinced that they rate as… how did you put it… near-worthless. As for giving out core abilities to other classes, well, I don't like that either. It's always a fine line, though, between making classes playable and keeping things distinct for them as well. This is something that I also want to bring up to the team.<br />

Step2: The Parsing Process<br />
<br />
To be covered in a new thread once we have a consensus of what these four stats should do.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, this is a project about number -- not wishes, whining, or dev bashing.  If you need to tell me I'm wasting my time or it's all been done before, please feel free to PM me.  If you want to discuss class balance or OOW spells please use another thread.  If you are a math geek, EQ nerd, or even just bored enough then hey post here!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a very ambitious project for sure. I'm picturing a detailed test proceedure with all levels of gear/classes/levels/buffs. I would say that I'm not the one to design such a test but I do have a 2-box setup with access to a 65 shaman, 65 shadowknight and 63 chanter on 3 separate accounts. I would be happy to spend some time doing some logs if I was given a clear test proceedure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It seems simple enough, all you need is a Shaman and a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Have Warrior remove all items that carry the stat being tested, so as to drop him down as low as possible in that stat.  Go fight something with a LOT of hit points, and something you can fight a bunch of.  You need about half an hour worth of parse-able data.  Buff Warrior with buffs that increase the stat in question, but DO NOT have Warrior re-equip stat gear.  IoS+whatever stat buff should add 100+ to any stat you want to mess with, except Agility.  Use PE for that.  Do the same mobs again, over 30 minutes.  Compare.<br />
<br />
*shrug*  Got a Warrior on S Ro?  I'll cover the Shaman part there if so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am more than willing to help parse what ever is necessary.  I have access to a 65 sham, 65 war, 65 cler, 65 zerker, and lots of alts (I might be able to get more chars if needed).  Just tell me what you want parsed where, and i will do my best to set it up on one of my spare boxes.  <br />
<br />
I'm not going to start going logs untill we get the test beds set up, so everything can be standardized.  If you want help setting this I can do that also.  Also, what's a good mob to beat on for this purposes?  And we should hopefully try some decent mobs to see the effect of an increase in enemy level.<br />
<br />
Once we get numbers, I will see what I can make of them, I know I took that darn class in statistics for a reason in college.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are not going to convince Sony of anything because they have the algorithims and you don't. I'm sure they know exactly what stat buffs do and how much they do, they dont need parses.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that stat buffs are particularly useful (except STA of course, once the overbuff in OoW goes live), but there is nothing to say that all spells have to be useful. Most classes have plenty of spells that they rarely use, it just so happens that these are ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are not going to convince Sony of anything because they have the algorithims and you don't. I'm sure they know exactly what stat buffs do and how much they do, they dont need parses.<br />

<br />
<br />
Along with our dots (short fights, long duration dots), nukes (too slow cast time, too low damage), slow (mitigation and resists), you name it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If they knew, then perhaps the Dev in charge of spells should stop saying that they are powerful and important.<br />
<br />
The point is, that on numerous occasions, Devs have told us how important and powerful our stat buffs are.  As recently as last weekend this was the SOE party line.<br />
<br />
Therefore, in order to demostrate that the SOE party line is incorrect, something must be undertaken by community members.<br />
<br />
Hence, this idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The dev's are saying how much of a difference our stat buffs make.  But they won't say much of a difference that is.  So we need to find out how much of a difference this is, so we can show them that it is truely insignificant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are trying to parse the effectivness of the stats buff I would assume you would start with a  low level player, maybe lvl 1.  This way all the players could have the same starting stats, all skills the same and they would also gain the most benifit from any increase.  If you would be using a 65 war he should be neked, but then you will run into the possible problems of different players having different skill levels and/or aa ablities.  In my mind you really need to at least start with lvl 1 players to develop a control group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They didnt say it was powerful or important, they said it makes a difference. If you think that difference is not worth it, then dont use the spells.<br />
<br />
And in any case, there is at least one situation where it is worthwhile to have stat buffs on, even if you are maxed  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Strength: Improves melee damage dealt. Exactly how we do not need to know to parse it.<br />
<br />
Stamina adds hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Agility prevents melee damage. Exactly how we do not need to know to parse it.<br />
<br />
Dexterity increases your chance to proc.<br />
<br />
We should try to get a parse at 50, 100, 200 and 300 in each stat. We should also try to do each of these parses against a blue con, an even con and a yellow/red con.<br />
<br />
Stamina is trivial. The rest adds up to 4(dex) + 3*4(agi) + 3*4 (Str) = 28 parses.<br />

Variables to be eliminated:<br />
Player level<br />
Player AA<br />

<br />
When actual members of this community tell you to take your garbage to PMs or another thread, you should take your garbage to PMs or another thread.  I think your &quot;shamans do huge DPS because my shaman bot gets summoned when he uses poison DoT spells&quot; point would be welcome on any number of current threads.<br />
<br />
You would also be surprised to hear that the Sacred Algorithm can be wrong.  Remember when they stridently insisted that all classes had equal chances for Kunark spell drops because the algorithm said so?  No, of course you don't.  Anyway, after intense pressure, Scott Hartsman caved in to the wizards' demands and actually tested the spell drops.  Lo and behold, it turned out that wizards and shamans were hosed on drops, despite what the Sacred Algorithm indicated, and the problem was partially fixed.<br />
<br />
You have also apparantly failed to read Glorianna's report on the Summit, because she clearly indicated that EQ's &quot;spell guy&quot; is under the impression that stat buffs have a significant impact.  This reduces your second paragraph to the status of off-topic drivel.   Obviously, this Rytan guy has no idea at all how the attribute system works, since his statements to Glorianna  contradict not only 5 years of parsing here and elsewhere, but Brad McQuaid's statement to the effect that EQ has a poor stat system where many stats have very little impact on gameplay in an attempt to, among other things, prevent twinking. ( http://beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=496&amp;start=70 ).   I think Barm's suggestion that we give Ryan some hard data so he can educate himself has merit.<br />
<br />
My aplogies to Barm for muddying his thread by responding to your troll.  I look forward to seeing your good work here, Barm.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking about creating a crashtest dummy using a human warrior.  Level him to 10 with only regen, heals, and one stat buffed.  Log the whole thing, delete and recreate him with indentical stats, then  level again with a different buff.  Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />

The relevant quote was &quot;I did point out the stat returns are increasingly minimal after a certain level, but Ryan insisted that it would help.&quot;. Note, he said it &quot;would help&quot;, he didnt say &quot;significant impact&quot;. Those are your words, not Gloris.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, they are a portion of our class, not a particularly useful one but so what? I expect that is why most of them are tacked onto our hp buff. Pretty useless at high level but concievable useful to lower level people or in specialized situations. They are just tools that can or cant be used depending on the circumstances.<br />
<br />
One way they would become usefull though would be if we suddenly encountered mobs casting neg 300 to stat debuffs. You sure as hell would want them then :p<br />

<br />
Not entirely true there. I don't bother buffing myself with STR/AGI. I use STA though.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying stat buffs are useless, but they aren't as helpful as you may think. I put them on to get the AE into the last buff slot, then click off the junk to make room for other more useful buffs/effects.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm....you never been encumbered Uggok? STA does nothing for you? Ok, maybe your stats are maxed, but not everyones are.<br />

Agi gives what? maybe 10AC? Poorly equiped tanks see 10AC as a decent upgrade, yet when it is cast on them its junk?<br />

It would also be interesting to see the result in proc rate on an offhand weapon - one of the &quot;is it an urban legend, or is it game mechanics&quot; thoughts I've seen in a few places is that dex does NOT affect proc rate on offhand weapons, but I've never seen data to prove it one way or the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, proc rates, allthough constant for most weapons irrespective of delay time, scale with haste. I think, (not sure though), that the proportion for left and right hands is in proportion, so the total for procs dual wielding is the same as a two hander. So for your average weapon set up you would be doing about 2 procs/minute, fully hasted. Augmented procs go at a rate of about 2/minute as well, according to parsing done over at TSW. In addition, AA skills allow you to double your weapons innate proc rate, for a total of 6 procs/minute. For a weapon like bloodfrenzy, which has a 55% proc mod, it would be about 7/min in dual wielding configuration. The cleric hammers have a 530% proc mod on them, in other words they would proc 6.3 times a minute unhasted and 12.6 times a minute fully hasted. Not sure if they get the 1 hander ratio applied or not though. Anyhow, that is why clerics who use those summoned weapons want DEX. In the hands of a melee with maxed weapon affinity that thing would be a freaking machine gun :D<br />
<br />
Edit: if you want some more info on parses, you can see some results here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5656. Those are for high end weapons though, I'm not sure what the proc mod on them is. They were doing around 9 procs/min in DW configuration.</div></div><hr />

WIS:  75<br />
INT:  75<br />

The first parse would be levelling him to 10 with no buffs other than heals.  I *should* be able to level him naked except for a fast, low damage weapon (more is wasted because of the damage cap before level 10 - which is 14 I think).  I'm thinking a nathsar greatsword.  Dang it has +10 STR on it, no good... still looking.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Proc rate scales DOWN with haste, see the link that I posted b4.  They have and average proc rate per unit time, not by number of attacks.  When u are slowed your proc rate actually goes UP since u get less attacks per unit time.  Its all in that post I linked b4.<br />
<br />
But ya I forgot about the AA abiltiy to increase proc rate will go back and fix that.<br />
<br />
Ok looking at the post they can get like 11 procs per min.  So using that lets say again u do 250 dmg per proc.  Thats 2750 dmg per min and 70 dex has only about a 3.5 % increase in proc rate so u get: 2750 x 3.5% dmg per min = 96.25 DPM = 1.6 DPS again still not worth a buff slot.</div></div><hr />

Murtak, I did not mean to imply that low level was the only testing I was going to conduct.  It's the first.<br />

I have a level 59 SK on another account.  I've contacted a level 61 warrior who's agreed to help and another friend of mine has a 10K HP level 65 warrior with about 300 odd AA's.<br />

and Tugela, haste lowers procc rate it doesnt raise it. procc rate has nothing to do with how many times you swing a weapon and everything to do with now long auto attack has been on.</div></div><hr />

he was 12.23 dps without any buffs.<br />

with harness, bih li, agility and our crap ac buff guard, hes at 14.17<br />
<br />
with 20% haste (our best lowest haste) hes at 16.51-15.96 (can't tell reliably i went berserk twice out of 48 samples, because a mob got me from behind and stunned me alot (light crawlers) .)<br />
<br />
with group prinmal essence (it does hit low lvl chars) hes 16.88 to 17.20<br />
<br />
this is with max skills for my level. and dark blue mobs (tribal hunter) in dsp.<br />
and some wolves and what not i could get.<br />
<br />
i dodged a total of 13 hits, while they missed me 35 times total and i parried 9, riposted 2.<br />
<br />
i proced a total of 15 times over the course of this. for total damage of 600 (some got resisted)<br />
i proced my offhand 6 times (lack of will)<br />

so far im very close to lvl 39, lol im about 25% from it.<br />

I selected the velium short blade because it's fairly fast, has no melee stats, and procs above the level I'll be testing.  That gives me a message for each proc but prevents it from affecting his dps.<br />
<br />
For buffs, I'm using Talisman of Altuna (+250 HP's), Spirit of Wolf, and Chloroplast (+10 HP's a tick).  I probably could use Alacrity but my concern is it wearing off and skewing the data.  <br />

His career path is levels 2-4 in North Qeynos, 5-6 in Qeynos Hills, run back to trainer, then 7-10 in Blackburrow.<br />

<br />
I could probably borrow a friends 65 SK and buff bot to do some parses; would need to know exactly how you want it done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I do agree with needing a different levels being tested, but to strip gear fighting a blue con I don't feel is necessary since we are interested in changes. I emailed Brenlo about this issue yesterday here is the email.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brenlo,<br />
I have been giving this some thought, and it seems that a lot of the issues are point of view issues. There are calls for Ryan to take a shaman into the content being complained about on the boards. Doing that would make him no different than an Ebayed character in the content since he would lack the experience gained from learning the class while leveling, this is not intended as a slam just stating a fact. I am sure he does not have the time to do that and get his job done, which leaves him making decisions with only the behind the scenes point of view. Meanwhile people on the boards don't take into account the full scope of Ryan's duties, preventing the consideration he needs to do his job. <br />
 <br />
The solution to this is finding a way to bring the points of view together in a cooperative mode instead of an adversarial one. With this in mind, I am proposing that we define a protocol for testing and documenting the real issues that need to be addressed, and seperate out those thing that people would like to have from the real problems. What the community needs to know is what information is relevant to the issues we are raising from Ryan's point of view, parses of mob DPS with and without slow, healing ability in a fight, etc. Both sides can sit there all day long and play statistical games, and get no where without the common ground. I don't know what tools you have available in house so I will use add ons to discuss the functionality needed.<br />
Everyone submitting data needs to provide a valid Magelo profile number. This allows the data to be sorted by level, gear, etc. <br />
Parses of log files done with one standard tool for the summations being turned in as well as the complete log of the test. This should allow any invalid data, doctored log files, to be detected and removed from consideration. <br />
Specific scenarios to be tested sewers, EP, tier X, ldon both risk levels, etc. <br />
Detailed documentation of the scenario as tested, group members, classes, levels, Magelo numbers if available, etc.<br />
There are 2 key things that I want from balancing:<br />
<br />
Increasing the desirability of the Shaman class, and reducing the amount of time spent LFG. Actively trying to put together groups does not always work. <br />
The ability to significantly contribute to the group I am a part of. As has been pointed out already 2 other classes bring slow to a group, and bring additional significant contribution to the group. What the other contribution is does not matter that much as long as it makes a noticable impact, see point 1. (Stat buffs are not a noticable impact).<br />
If this system works for shaman, it could be expanded to the other classes providing a community based method of ensuring things do not get out of balance, and removing the validity of the agruements presented by those who wish to whine. While it would be nice to be able to silence those who's only goal is to create uproar, I do not see that as an achievable goal. <br />
<br />
I feel that if SoE commits to a program of this type, the serious members of the community will actively support and contribute to it. Additionally it would help repair the relations with the community and hopefully begin reversing the hard feelings that exist.<br />
<br />
A magelo profile gives us a base with the toon being tested. From there we use the various stat buffs we have gained to incrimentally increase from the base. Our interest in this project is the difference the buffs make after all. <br />
<br />
Each data set should be done against a single mob type, and include a say/gsay line with the toons current stats, and a con of the mob before begining the fight. This provides a data header to ensure that all log sections being parsed in a particular run are the same. <br />
<br />
My thought is we should start with Warriors, as they are supposed to be the main tank class so would logically see the largest benifit from the buffs. Once a sufficent data pool is collected, we change classes to Pally or SK and repeat with each. Once all three classes have been analyzed we can compare the results of stat buffs on &quot;tank classes&quot; as a group. <br />
<br />
Beyond this we may want to do specific testing on DPS classes. Examples being Dex on Rangers and Rogues, STR on Zerkers and Rogues. I think Rogue testing might be a significant source of information as far as the effects of Back Stabbs go. Another insteresting test would be the effects of Dex on casters with the DD crit AAs to see what if any effect it has on the chances to crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I've done some analysis of parses made by others in this thread here: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21892<br />
<br />
Hope it helps a bit.<br />
<br />
With regard to your proposed parsing, I think its worth restricting it to &quot;stable&quot; characters in static situations. By that I mean any comparisons should be made with, ideally, only one variable.<br />
<br />
For example, if testing strength, then the buffee's other stats and skills must remain unchanged, you should be fighting the same level and type of mob, same buffs etc. This way you can see any changes in damage and know its due to differences in strength (and the associated attack that comes with it).<br />
<br />
I'd also surmise that buffs DO have a decent effect at lower levels. Agility is proven to give a big bump in avoidance at 75, a slow increase to ~200, and a big tailing off over 250/280.<br />
<br />
Strength has been shown to show no change in max hits from 280-305, but a steady increase below that.<br />
<br />
Any parses should examine a wide range of variation in the one thing they are testing. All else should remain equal.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it!</div></div><hr />
