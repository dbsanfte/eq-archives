<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few guides say that if you keep a little chicken alive on island 5 that the guardian will respawn like the Lord does.<br />
<br />
Well we tried it this last weekend and it doesnt work...heh POed a few warriors in the process too.<br />
<br />
Lord will not respawn with a little chicken either :(<br />
<br />
Those unfamaliar with PoA probably wont understand any of this babble but those Vets out there will understand :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deadman1204</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i dont remember how atm (not thinking straight, too much physics and crap in my head) but i know u can multi spawn the birdy for the blade, ive done it b4, jsut cant remember how atm :(<br />
<br />
<br />
heh, guess some of it could be my attention spawn went to 0 that night cause i'd won the fine velvet cloak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kysran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clear the isle *but* leave The Spiroc Guardian  and The Spiroc Lord up.<br />
<br />
Keel the Lord, but leave the Guardian be. <br />
Lord will repop again and again.<br />
<br />
But you need to make sure Sirran despawns before touching anything on the isle. That little hairy footed bastage hits hard! :)<br />
<br />
If you get both the Lord and the Guardain on a Lord pull /camp<br />
<br />
Oh and Btw, the Lord DT's every 30 secs if I remember right.<br />
<br />
Have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Treece Oakheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From personal and recent experience.<br />
<br />
You clear the whole island of aviaks except for the Lord and Guardian.<br />
<br />
The Guardian is the key here.  Keep him alive as people have already stated.<br />
<br />
Our guild completed the cycle a couple of times on the weekend obtaining Wingblades for the Warriors in our guild.<br />
<br />
*Tip for Rangers - When fighting the Lord stop firing arrows when he is close to dying.<br />
<br />
I had the misfortune of letting loose an arrow, only to have the Lord die, Sirran spawn, my arrow plug Sirran in the ass.<br />
<br />
Sirran didnt like this and decided to introduce me to respect.<br />
<br />
He hits hard the little bugger and my Loading.... Please wait! has yet again improved (200)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, I know how to clear the island and farm the Lord by keeping the Guardian up.<br />
<br />
There are a few guides that state you can farm the guardian like you can the lord but it didnt work for us.....that's what this post was about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cosmodeous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wish there was a trick like this to respawn the Keeper of Souls....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is. Use search...</div></div><hr />
