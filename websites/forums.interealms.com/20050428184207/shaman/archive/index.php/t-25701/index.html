<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khasril Khaiine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found a good spot to exp yesterday, zoned in from Echo Caverns, hunted at zoneline, mobs were L51 in lvl but were easy to kill once slowed. First 2 pulls would be single but next one is a double, did one solo when i was in a grp and it was easy, dunno what exp is like solo yet, gonna check it out when i get hime from work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Went to the Deep, having never been there before, with me (56 shaman) and the missus (56 chantress).  Mobs don't hit hard at all ~135-140 seemed to be about the max.  We just stayed at the zoneline as we didn't have much time to venture out much - next time we're planning on doing a &quot;crawl&quot;....perhaps even stumble on a named iffen we're lucky.  I love the guys (outcasts I think) that yell<br />
&quot;Nac llits uoy elihw tuo teg&quot;<br />

Respawn time seemed rather quick. zone wsa completely empty...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I duoed a lot here.  My favorite camp was the Deranged Underbulk camp.  Go to the first T and make a right.  Follow the tunnel around the bend and at the 2nd T make a left.  The DU spawns at the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Once you get it down there are lots of spawns and they aren't that hard so XP is pretty constant.  Not that far of a run from PoK either.  Drops are pretty bad, though.  There are 3 named that can spawn near this camp:  Deranged Underbulk, a named mushroom who's name I forgot, and Oldencamp the Lost.  Oldencamp drops 500pp so is a good kill.<br />
<br />
Until you can handle 3-4 at a time don't go south from the first T.  From my experience there are a few spots down that tunnel where you will get multiples.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the tip Tsuyoi,  me and the missus have spent the last few nights there and its a great spot.  We can kill the deranged, his two &quot;guards&quot;, the mushrooms trio and two wanderer's before the cycle renews.  Decent loot too...levitation spell from the beetle has been the only drop so far but it still sells quickly at 1k on TT server and we've picked up 3 cloaks off the named shroom.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine we'll spend at least a few more nights here before we need to find a new spot...(feel free to suggest other areas in the zone that a 56 shammy and 56 chantress could duo)<br />

Tronc and Twinkles give The Deep a &quot;Two Thumbs Up!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are several other places I camped there back in the day.  No names for them so I'll just post by camp #:<br />
<br />
Camp 1:  At the first T make a left.  Be prepared to fight 3-4 mobs at a time on the way down.  At the 2nd T make a left.  There will be an aclove there with a quest mob (unsolved quest).  There is 1 wanderer that can come down this way, otherwise a safe place to setup camp.  If you are fast enough the group of mushrooms that are to the right at the 2nd T has a named that drops a shammy no-drop neck if I remember right.<br />
<br />
Camp 2:  At the first T make a left.  Be prepared to fight 3-4 mobs at a time on the way down.  At the 2nd T make a right.  Go to the next junction, and make a left.  Go to the end of the corridor.  A named spawns there.  Don't remember the named or what he drops, but I did camp there a bit so loots were probably OK.<br />
<br />
Camp 3:  At the first T make a right.  Follow the corridor around to the 2nd T (near the DU camp).  Make a right.  At the next T make a left.  Follow the left wall until you end up in a dead end, I believe you will pass 1 tunnel that branches to your right and 1 that goes to the invis bridge.  There is a named in this corner and this area drops the shard for VT access very often.  The named drops a BL spell that sold pretty well at 10k a year ago.<br />
<br />
Camp 4:  If you are finding the areas before the bridge to be easy to handle you can cross the invis bridge and fight on the other side.  Mobs there are higher level and have better loots.  I don't have locations for any of the named, but what I did was after I crossed the bridge I made a right and headed to the end of the chasm.  There I pulled the shrooms in the 1st tunnel.  They often dropped gems and rarely a fluid that sold for 4k easy.  Fluid was used for Seru bane weapons I believe.<br />
<br />
At your level you should also consider Nurga, Droga, the Hole (have to gate out of the castle BTW), Chardok (if you are OK ruining this faction), Howling Stones (horrid for CRs), PoMischief (farm spell components from castle wall and castle), etc.  Probably your best bet for cash is to go to PoM and farm the components for Remove Geater Curse.  This spell will still get you 40-60kpp easy.<br />
