<br />
I've replaced the old style UI icons with new UI style icons. You'll noticed the new ones have a blue or red border around them like they would appear in the spell book. Also, you'll see that the old style icons are still used in the spell history in some places. This should only show up on the 'gemicon' field, which is used only for old UI. The 'spellicon' field determines what graphic is used for gem and book icons in new UI. <br />
<br />
From the Lucy forum/news (added on the 15th) ... anyone that likes Lucy can now post questions as well.<br />

Edit - I missed a bunch of changes - look at general section - sorry</div></div><hr />
