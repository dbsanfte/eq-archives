<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So ive taken a leave from the game for about 3 weeks now. I come back last night and find myself in the grey doing golems around temple for named spawns. In between im pulling snakes, well during the middle of fighting 2 snakes and 1 golem ... i hit the wrong hotkey again.... Cann 5 ... another dead Prophet, another day. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank god for clerics who will travel. Think this brings my cann 5 death toll to 4 now. God i love it.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehehe. I'm nowhere near that experiance yet, but its a funny story, and better yet, it's nice to see someone laughing about it. (though I doubt you were laughing at the time!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't have canni V, but if I ever do grind the AA's to get it, I would think the best thing to do would be to put the hotkey on your number 2 bank/set of hotkeys instead of the first one...   so you'd have tohit shift + 2 and then a hotkey to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">about a week or two before they took the crack stone off the drop tables my friend got one for all the plat she had in her bank basically. she was so excited she had to try it out, she didn't pay attention to her health and fell down on the ground :) she had to res herself a few humiliating minutes later with a bunch of lvl 15s hovering about her corpse wondering how a lvl 50 in full planar could have died in crushbone!<br />
<br />
I think that your experience is not so bad compaired :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, i still have to do that.<br />
<br />
Closest i got was canning down during a fight a bit and then hitting canni V without topping health before - voila a bear with low health aggro against a very angry PoV mob. Luckily the heal hit me with 100 hp left or so  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My first canni 5 death had been in Droga of all places.  I just pulled a massive train on myself to DS farm them, and then I slipped up and hit the canni 5 key.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I pop into PoK and head out to get my gear back, but first I decide to buff.    After a fair amount of Canni work to get buffs up on me and a passing request for them, canni 5 pops again.   I look at hp real quick, misread a 1650 and 1950 and pop canni 5.... dead a second time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  So I call in a cleric to rez me in PoK (mebarrassed at this point).   Get the rez, decide &quot;oh, cleric just rezzed me, he'll heal me too, better canni 5&quot;   Which is a nice reaction... WHEN YOU HAVE GEAR!   Anyhow, 3rd loading please wait for me...<br />
<br />
<br />
   So, after doing all this I decide I REALLY need sleep and log out.   Next day I am in Plane of Storms with the same cleric working on medals.   Druid decides to find out if they can charm the bears (without asking) and sure enough he can't.    He then ROOTS the bear, which procedes to nuke the crap out of him, as well as aggro the entire continent on the druid, everyone who buffed or healed the druid, and everyone the druid buffed or healed (ie - all 3 groups).   So we die.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Rezzes come in, the cleric gives me greif about how I better not die right away this time, cause I was getting the last rez and everyone would see it.   So what do I do?  I go in, loot body, notice halfway through that my hp from gear and rez is at exactly 1923...   I stand up from looting body, jam canni5, it says &quot;Caanus has been slain by Caanus&quot;  &quot;You are Bleeding to Death&quot;  &quot;You have regained Consciousness&quot;   And I go back to looting my corpse.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
  End result, I found shammie AE taunt (Canni 5 with 1975 hp) and shammie FD (canni 5 with 1923 hp)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty much what I did.  I put can5 on the number 9 slot of number two hotkey bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've always found the best insurance against cann v deaths is more hps =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haha, I've had one 'indirect' death from canniV.<br />
Right after I got it, I wanted to freak out cleric a few times (which I did to the groups delight).  ''OMG! get it off of me!&quot; (hit canni5, cleric freaks out).  Anyway, we were in PoV and fighting a crawler, the crawler was at 2% and fleeing snared.  So I decided to hit canni5 (I was already relatively low on hps) and I went down to about 10% hps.  Well.....with low hp aggro I guess the mob feels its more important to killl me rather then continue fleeing, which is exactly what he did.  Took the cleric a few minutes to res me cuz she was laughing too hard :P<br />
Not sure how logical the coding is on it, but it was pretty funny anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cann5 is fun :)  Only time i have actualy killed myself with it was on purpose, but thats another story... i have come veryclose multiple times.  the real killer is when you lose buffs and forget about it.<br />
<br />
The otherday i shoulda died but i was lucky.  got a rez as we where killing some mob in VT (i was only shaman) chanter slows it i get rezed to reslow.  I zone in i mem slow, i cann4 a few times i slow the mob.  I get all my buffs and stuff.  then i hit cann5 to get some mana back, takes me down to 1 bub of mana... cause i hadnt looted my corpse yet.  i was just lucky enough that i had virtue to put keep me alive.  i quickly looted my corpse laughing very hard.<br />
<br />
But then again i am known for finding the silliest ways to die, running through DSP going to VT, running through Scarlet desert otw to ssra.  in the grey as i go afk zoning in (forgeting about EB).<br />
<br />
Its fun... and my guild trusts me to slow everythign etc... shows what htey know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've only died once from Cann5, was deep in the gob cave in PON, was a small group of 3 (early POP, wasnt even 65 yet) owning up a full room, I was the haster, buffer, healer, and CC haha with no KEI \ Tranq was having trouble keeping up with mana even with cann5 and horse so I was having to hit cann5 as soon as it poped to keep up.  Cann5 pops, I hit it, and at 1 second left a goblin hits me 3x full max dmg...Cann5 lands and I explode.  My small superexp group was a bit mad  :( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">certain shaman on TT had a canni 5 death after a rez. wasnt thinking and mashed his canni hot key LOADING PLEASE WAIT.... if ya wanna know who i will have to get his ok (slander reasons and all) lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've died from Can 5 several times.  Most recently was after a guild wipe out in Ssraa.  Since we were going to summon corpses, I had parked myself at TG zone and was sowing/leving/invising/Ebing guildmembers as they ran through (since some naked folks lack the sta to run without SoW across TG without EB).  So, I was buffing and SoWing like crazy, doing a little bit of can 4.  Mana was low, hitpoints were at 50% and I hit can 5 totally by habit.  Let's just say that even with ND 3, I don't have the naked hitpoints to pull off a can 5.<br />
<br />
Guild laughed at me.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/snicker @ Gloriana<br />
<br />
O wait, I've done that too!<br />
heh.<br />
once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most fun I have had with can5 was a while back. My gear set up at the time gave me 1925hp's with no buffs. Res in, get a heal then can down to 1hp and freak everyone out becuse they thought I canned myself to death. Man if only I had the FD ring :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is getting old......<br />
<br />
<br />
I wanna hear from someone who's had Can V for more than 2 weeks and HASN'T killed themselves!  :)<br />
<br />
(now that's gonna be a little rare)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Fine still never killed myself with cann v yet =)</div></div><hr />
