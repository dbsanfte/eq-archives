<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why not change Nature's Infusion and Tnarg's Mending to heal 2750 like Supernal Light? The mana requirements could be boosted to 900 for Nature's Infusion and 1200 for Tnarg's Mending. At over level 60, and especially in Gates of Discord, it seems as if Tnarg's is underpowered. On the other hand, the mana costs for Tnarg's and Nature's Infusion have to be high enough to ensure that Clerics cannot be sidestepped as primary healer for challenging content. This seems like an easy, balanced change. There would be a downside to shaman, in that we might waste more mana on overheals (healing a 1000 deficit with a 2750 heal). This would allow shaman to heal a round of damage on a cleric, and keep the cleric alive in Gates of Discord.</div></div><hr />

That ratio is horrible.  A majority of shamans would only be able to cast it 3 or 4 times.  Tnarg's is 1300hp for 450 mana.  Word of Redemption is a group CH (10000 to each member) for only 1100 mana.  No single target heal should even get anywhere close to 1000m.<br />
<br />
Druids already have something close to SL.  It's called Sylvan Infusion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883&amp;source=Live).<br />

Good clerics can handle unwanted aggro just fine.  It's called Divine Aura/Barrier.  In a single group setting in GoD, your cleric should almost never get aggro anyway.  If your cleric keeps dying in GoD before the rest of the group, ask them how much they paid on playerauctions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree that I'd like to see the Hps per second improved on shaman and druid heals since that effectively caps what encounters you can heal for. The efficiency on your heals how ever is horrible. Our new heal is currently ~3hps per mana which would put this heal at about 900 mana. Even that is pretty damm heafty. Personally I think clerics have gotten enough other things that shaman and druids can be alot closer on the direct heals or even match them with out taking away clerics spot as prefered healer. Divine arbitration, Divine intervention, Bulwark of vie, Celestial regen, group heals, divine aura&amp; barrier, Blessing of reverance are just a few of the things they bring outside of thier direct heals.</div></div><hr />
