<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jaundice Bone armour has never been Iksar usable, something to do with the plate restriction for Iksars. Iksar Warriors cannot use cobalt either and Iksar SK's can't use Blood Ember. This has been the case since Kunark launch.<br />
<br />
Sorry Iksar Shamen can't use JBone bracer and it's unlikely they ever will be able to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iksar have an inate AC bonus. The consequence of that is that you cannot use some of the armor the other classes can use. You end up with the same AC though.<br />
<br />
Once you start getting into the higher levels, and getting Velious quest armor, for the most part, that difference is forgotten, and the Iksar end up with slightly higher AC as a result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, this issue has been beaten to death, but...<br />
<br />
I really don't understand iksars not being able to wear JB armor. Ok, so iksars can't wear plate...but shaman are a chain class. Regardless of the graphic on JB armor, it's not actually plate.<br />
<br />
(I'm a barb by the way, so this isn't something that affects me... I just don't understand it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it looks like plate, and smells like plate....isn't it plate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, if it looks like plate and smells like plate, you've forgotten to serve yourself. Put food on plate, then smell. Much better.<br />
