<br />
That's true to a certain point-- you do need a decent amount of hitpoints when you get Cannibalization.  Roughly 3000+ buffed hitpoints should be near minimum for that by the time you reach 60+.<br />
<br />
When you first get Canni 1 you'll want to start moving your gear from wisdom to hitpoints because you want to learn how to accelerate your mana and not just have a stagnant mana pool.  You'll also want hitpoints because your slows will cause agro and you need to be able to take hits.</div></div><hr />

This has been discussed many times. It wouldn't work because of XYZ. Other people have suggested ABC, but that doesn't work because of LMNOP. Anyway, there have been about a million topics on this - you should use the search function to see if your idea has already been suggested. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Honestly hotelseven, think about your play style right now.  Do you solo a lot or do you spend most of your time in groups?  How large are those groups?  Do you get hit a lot or pretty much never?<br />
<br />
In my career I'd soloed probably 80% of the time.  Also, I'm not even 50 yet.  So, I've focused almost entirely on AC, ok WIS, and ok HP.  I also invested in some expensive items to support my play style.<br />
<br />
This will change as I level.  I will group more as time goes on and I will adjust my gear to compensate.  I view gear choices as a very fluid thing, always changing as you go through the seasons of your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK, I know I'm gonna get alot of flak for this, but....  I would go with AC first IF you were like me, thought of yourself as a tank that can cast cool stuff. (then HP, then WIS last)  Cann I is a real pain in the butt to use, but when you start getting the better cann's, then switch over to the HP's.  Untill then, bind in POK, and get a KEI whenever possible.  BTW, dying after having just shelled out for a new KEI really sucks, so be prepared. (hehehe) BTW, you'll stop thinking of yourself as a Tank first, once you get into your 30's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In tier 1 and below (i.e. levels 1 to 62) you are okay at tanking.<br />
<br />
At tier 1 and below, 60+, you are an extremely good tank (except in some cases).<br />
<br />
At tier 2 and above, you are a pansy.  You can take a few hits, but not that many.  You need a lot hitpoints to be sturdy enough to survive and keep up with mana.<br />
<br />
HP &gt; all --- AC is nice and all, but HP takes priority (unless you're sacrificing 35 ac on a shield to get 10 more hp or something).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My shaman is my very first toon.  I have been palying for approx 6-8 months.  she is currently lvl 51 ans heres what I found.<br />
<br />
I first concentrated on mostly getting my wisdom over 200 ~201 to 205 is where i was at.  And in so doing i got my AC to 710 (ish) and my HPs to 1500 (ish) unbuffed.  This worked ownderfully for me. Until i hit lvl 50.  Once I hit that lvl I found myself dying alot (not enough hps and/or ac due to over canni tryin' to keep peeps alive and or aggro from slows) As well as going OOM. this frustrated me no end! What to do what to change. . . I am slowly converting my gear towards AC and HPS. . and ironically in so doing my wisdom has risen to 217.  I don't buy gear without +HPS. +AC and +Mana. . I don't consider it an upgrade for me at this time.. . But! Basically I'm saying focusing on Wisom will inevitably raise the rest up if your carefull not to buy exclusivly wisdom gear.  You really don't need to change up to hps IMO until ~lvl 48-50 when HPS and making your canni as effective as possible to keep the mana -a-flowin' becomes so very very important to a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm yeah I group alot. . not a big soloing shammy. . soloed maybe 4 lvls. . . DEF is 200 Offense is 198. . . melee is horrid eheh. . more solo work is a great plan.  Since rumor has it every 1 pt DEF you get gives you 2.5more AC.. . . just food for thought. . eheheh sorry I like to ramble :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">at the lower levels little matters imo. Twinking a charecter out will always do a favor.  on the other hand your power, especially at the lower lvl doesnt come from your gear but from your spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chevalier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just got my Shammy to 39, and I have followed the HP/AC&gt;Wis route based on what I had read here. I have about 1370 hp, 800+ AC, 172 wis all self buffed. I've soloed pretty exclusively until now, and will unless I feel like grouping. Getting hit for less, having a larger dynamic mana pool, and not to mention just extra hit points means more to me than the extra bit of mana that more wis would provide. Just throw a slow and a dot on a mob and tank it down. Faster kills, and with the higher AC and HP, no real downtime to speak of. Unless all you do when solo is blast, blast, blast, blast, blast, the HP and AC will serve you much better imho. And if that's all you do, play a wizzie or Druid :) . It's still all situational(as is everything), but overall I think HP/AC is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At your level, conentrate on hps.  When you're around level 45 or so, your AC should be above 800 unbuffed.  800 is the first AC point for priests where you will see a huge difference in damage taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, this is just from personal experience so take it as such.<br />
<br />
I personally have went the AC/Wis/hp route in that order.  At my current level i have about 1k ac buffed, with about 180 or so wis, and 1600 hps.  Today i grouped with two tanks in the hole, and they were astonished that I could have 3 elementals + rock golem aggroing me, and yet still live until i was able to slow them all.  Personaly I like the feeling I can stand up to a mob and take a few hits when slow is resisted, and when a tank can take back agro.  <br />
<br />
However, thats with non PoP mobs.  In PoP, yard trash hits for 300+, and while high ac does help, I am more and more often wishing I had some hps.  Once I hit 55 I plan to convert some of my ac and wis gear to hps and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At 60, I used to solo in Skyfire (old bind point near &quot;cleric hill&quot;) while waiting on especially long CRs.<br />
<br />
Quit worrying about your gear and start refining mana-efficient and safe ways of soloing. Dont worry about gear at all if you are a group buffwhore, you can do that naked and drunk. <br />
<br />
Gear dependance? Take any other class naked. <br />
<br />
 Give a rogue a rusty dagger, and he can perform if he watches his aggro. Give a necro a bonechip, watch him go to town. The mage can do well, if he hoardes mana and has the right mobs. Beastlords or ok...the list gets thin and stays thin. <br />
<br />
Give a naked shammy his spellbook, a pet and while he may have a bit of downtime (I think I remember what that used to be like), he will outperform any other class in the game. Issue closed. <br />
<br />
These &quot;I need gear advice&quot; threads make me laugh harder and harder every day. Then I reliaze that EQ society has pounded it into everyone's heads that we need l33t sh33t to be any good. Wait till you hit 58, 59, 60+...you will see that, much like Mom telling you that you will go blind if you do THAT too much, it was all lies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Naked shaman = okay.<br />
He can malosini, turgur, med/canni every pull.<br />
<br />
Shaman with at least 3000 hp buffed = extremely powerful.<br />
He can malosini, turgur, med/canni, and still have lots of mana to waste on nukes or heal or buff do whatever the heck else he wants and never usually has to hold up the group.<br />
<br />
Sure, you can do the bare minimum as a shaman and be considered really good.  But if you're at 2000 hp or so naked, you can never canni5 and expect to live in the middle of a battle.<br />
<br />
Note that I only say 3000 hp..  getting 1000 extra hp does not require uber gear at all and isn't too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As you are leveling up you want to have both decent HP and decent WIS.  Many people on this board will tell you that wis is worthless, but they are wrong.  When the crap hits the fan, you are going to want to have a reasonable mana pool.  Cannibalizing takes time.  If you don't have time to canni and you go oom, you are going to wish you had a bigger mana pool.  Do not neglect one for the other or you will gimp yourself in certain situations.  Strike a balance, and you will do just fine.<br />
<br />
This is a long way in your future, but once you have canni5, wis and mana can take a backseat to HP and FT.  Your ultimate goal should be to have enough HP to canni whenever you need to (2500 unbuffed is fine, 3500 is more than enough), and have as much FT as you possibly can, to reduce the amount of time you have to spend casting canni4 (FT15 is the cap, but MC3 and other effects, like lunar whispers, still count).<br />
<br />
As for AC...  I stopped caring about it a long time ago.  I don't even consider it when picking my gear.  I used to be an AC freak, with about 1150 AC and 130 wis.  I have since adjusted myself for a bigger mana pool and more HP, and have no regrets.  I've never seen anything to convince me that AC really make a difference for us at high levels.  It is nice to have and all, but not worth sacrificing in other areas.  Also, I can't testify to its usefullness at lower levels.  It has just been too damn long, and I never really took notice of my AC and its effects as I was leveling up.  Some have said that AC is more important for a low-level shamans, but I don't really buy it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i collect ac first before the other stats, however i would suggest that pre canni 3  hp are less important than wis or ac.<br />
Maybe i am geting used to crack vendors???<br />
<br />
Its rare i start a exp session without c3 these days; so that somewhat diastorts the picture really.<br />
<br />
in reality canni 1 and 2 are pretty nafff  I never used canni till 54 but then i am a certified lazy bugga. So dont listen to me  LOL<br />
<br />
personally id still aim to break 900 ac unbuffed before u hit 51.  Certainly its my playing style to melee alot, but i convinced it helps limit the damage u take while soloing till pet get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In the endgame, you'll be going for HP before anything else.  However, Endgear has good Wis and AC on it too...  My progression was WIS&gt;AC&gt;HP then AC&gt;HP&gt;WIS and now I'm HP&gt;AC&gt;WIS.  This is a natural progression and I think you'll be doing yourself harm if you go directly to HP gear.  It's hard to change HP's into mana early on (and got lots of KEI available), midway I had aggro management issues and finally, HP's = mana.....</div></div><hr />

I was wearing mostly banded armor and using a bloodforge hammer at your level.  Seriously.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have to say that I agree that its situationally dependant, but you cannot go wrong with HP.  My personal preference is HP&gt;WIS&gt;AC, but again, thats me<br />
<br />
1) Soloing: In the face style, or Root and Rot, yeah you are gonna need HP&gt;AC&gt;Wis, most likely in that order, but all fairly close in priority. Go for the rounded approach. Gotta live through the hits, try to mitigate some DMG through AC, and then have enough mana to root, debuff, dot ect.<br />
<br />
2) Group style: HP&gt;Wis&gt;AC. In a group, you are buffing, hasting, and slowing like mad, so you have to have the big manna pool. Remember, HP (with canni) and WIS both create your manna pool. AC is less of a concern, since ideally, the MT is going to be sucking the aggro. And if hes not, hes not doing his job. (or you are sitting too fast after debuffing)<br />
<br />
3) Raid style: HP&gt;Wis&gt;AC (but adjusted situationally Ex. AOE mobs, or Trials would require a different mix) A raid is basically an expanded group. Yes you will get summoned, yes you will get wailed on by _ubermob_01_  but unless you are talking about slapping on a signifiant amount of armor beyond your buffs (im talking 100 AC or more) you are much better with the HP and giving that SK,Paladin, or warrior, a couple seconds to get the attention of the mob and staying alive. My primary is a paladin and I see a difference in the amount I get hit when I add an extra 100 AC (through sword and shield combo) but odds are you wont be able to do that kind of thing by swapping out one or 2 pieces of gear. You need a HUGE manna pool on a raid, especially if you are only shammy, and thats why you need lots of HP and lots of Wis.. AC wont make that much of a difference if your defensive skills are maxxed.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story, always try to get all 3, HP&gt;WIS&gt;AC in MOST instances, and get that defensive skill maxxed and keep it maxxed. It has a bigger impact on your AC than your gear will. (for evidence check magelo profile and leave your defense skill blank.. then check AC after adding the skill and see the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think a lot of the advice you are getting is very bad for a lower level shaman.<br />
<br />
It is reasonbly good advice for a high level shaman but all the HP &amp; WIS advice is just not so great for your level.<br />
<br />
This has been said more then once, but the subject is not realy that hard.<br />
<br />
You have too resourses to use as you play your shaman.<br />
<br />
HP and Mana.<br />
<br />
How efficent a shaman you are depends only on what uses ore replenishes these resourses.<br />
<br />
HP gets used up when you Cannibalize or you get Hit by mele or spells.  It gets replenished by a number of things like sit / stand regen rate, regen items and spells and healing spells.<br />
<br />
Mana gets used up as you cast spells and replenished by Canibalize,  Flowing thaught items, mana regen spells like KEI.<br />
<br />
How big your HP or MANA pool is has ZERO impact on how efficent a shaman you are.  The SIZE of your HP and MANA pool does have a big impact on your safty margin.  At the higher levels, some special consideratoins come into play primarily because of the AA skill Can V and the Torpor spell and also because the mobs start to hit so hard that you must have a fairly large HP pool for a usable safty margin.  At lower levels these factors are not present.<br />
<br />
AC is very nice all the way into your 50s because it mitigates damage ( HP resource ).<br />
<br />
Also very nice items are things like the Cerimonial Iksar Chestplate that directly impove your efficency by giving you an aditional 5hp a tick.  Some focus items are also nice by reducing the cost to cast spells or improving spell performance.<br />
<br />
Another big factor for the efficient shaman is sustainable damage output.  When you get to lvl 34 and start having a pet this can help you quite a lot because it improves your damage output.  Also, having a nice weapon like a good ratio 2hb and a haste item can also improve your efficency.<br />
<br />
How you play your character can also change how you balance ac / hp / wis on your gear.  In general, the more you solo tank the more value you will get from ac and a good mele setup but even in group a resonable amount of ac will help you in a lot of situations where you want to maintain more agro on all the mobs the the cloth casters like enchanters and wizards.<br />
<br />
At your level I would try and get my WIS all the way up to about 130 or 140 and then go heavy AC with any HP on the items consider a big +.  When I soloed I would swing a big hammer and equip a hast item like schw.  In group, mele == almost zero so the hammer and the hast item go in the bag in favor of a stat spear and a shield and such.<br />
<br />
Untill you reach your low 50s...  AC &gt; HP &gt; WIS.<br />
<br />
As you get close to 60 then HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS....  I put wis on the buttom because it will start to go up without giving it any thaught at all as so much of our equipment will have wis on it.<br />
<br />
The best items you can have are those that directly improve you mana or hp recovery rate or those focus items that improve you spells, or give you free extra damage (JBB, nice weapon, haste items).<br />
<br />
I truly hope this helps you understand a little better how a shaman works.  Once you get it figured out you will not need much help at all figuring out which item(s) to equip or why you are doing it.  One of the reasons a shaman is so much fun to play is because our gear can and does make a differance and provides ous with a lot of things to consider.  In contrast my necro can play naked at a about 75% effectivness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Xev has a good point, about the 3khp self-buffed limit. <br />
<br />
But my naked comparison thing was really just an example of extremes, to make people realize that we are probably the least gear-dependant class of the game. That being true, we should worry the least about it, and instead of splitting hairs a mile wide, just a few guidelines do nicely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Here's my take on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wis is super important.<br />
AC is super important.<br />
HP is super important.<br />
<br />
--------------The Rathjar Shammy------------------------<br />
<br />
In the begining.<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
First step in making a great shammy is choosing a race. Each race has its own advantages and disadvatages, but in the end game it really doesnt' matter much. I would choose a race based on your personality, not on which race will make a better shaman. Because of this belief I am not going to go into detail on what races get what ablitys. We all know evil races have bad faction, barbies are blind, and cats are perty =p. The most important part about making your new shaman is a high starting wis and good stamina / agility.<br />
<br />
Now you go out and get levels. I can post a hunting guild later. For now, lets assume you just got 24 and you now have cano 1. From this point on, IMHO the way to play a shaman now changes. This is the section I would like to cover. Welcome to the wonderful world of armor and equipment.<br />
<br />
------------Armor and Equipment guide for shaman-----------<br />
<br />
Before we can go into armor and equipment I would like to say that this will not make you a good shaman. A good shaman is a good shaman even if he is nakid. I have soloed IG's in everfrost nakid at 49 while waiting for a rez on a dragon raid. Gear does not make the shaman, it only makes us better.<br />
<br />
Part 1: The many types of shaman<br />
<br />
Shaman can be divided into 2 main classes. Wisdom Shaman, and HP shaman. Both have strong points and weak points. Knowing what balance you need to fit your play style is what you have to decide for your self. I will only show you the way.<br />
<br />
Part 2: The truth about wisdom<br />
<br />
We all know that wisdom increases the amount of mana a shaman has. Well, I'm here to tell you that is technically not true. Wisdom increases the maximum amount of mana you could have. We can prove this by taking off all your wis gear, medding till FoM and then putting on your wis gear. Your mana will drop. This is because you have increased the max amount of mana you can have, but not your current mana. I know you are asking why this matters, but just bear with me, this is important later.<br />
<br />
Part 3: The truth about Canno<br />
<br />
One of ths shaman's great powers is the ablity to trade HP for mana. Canno 4 and Canno 5 (aa skill) are roughly .567 mana per 1 HP. our a 2 to 1 ratio HP to mana. This means at level 58, full buffed I can get about 1650 mana if I canno from full life down to almost dead. I can then C heal myself for 400 mana to almost full life and have made 1250 mana. Wash rinse and repeat. At level 60 with Torpor i can do this for the cost of only 180 mana thus making almost 1800 mana and still being full of life. Now we all know this, but using it is a differnt story. Most of us are afraid to canno down and keep pulling. This is our single most limited and greatest power. Many shaman wear more HP gear to boost the amount of mana they can canno.<br />
<br />
Part 4: Putting it all together<br />
<br />
So we now know why shaman need HP's and why shaman wear wisdom gear. So lets put it all together.<br />
<br />
Step 1) How much wis do I really need?<br />
Most people will tell you the most wis on an item the better it really is. This is simply not true. The truth is you only need as much wisdom as you can spend. If you are constantly OOM and holding your group back while you canno and med, you dont have enough wis (or you cast way too much durring combat) If you are always fom or almost fom after each pull, even multiples you have too much wis. The truth is extra wisdom does nothing for you if you are not FoM. As a shaman if you are FoM either your group is slow, or you are doing something wrong. Try adjusting your wis by swaping out some items for HP or AC and see how it works, if your still not hitting OOM then its a good change. If you are going OOM a lot more, then put some more wis gear on.<br />
<br />
Step 2) Ok so what am I supose to replace this gear with?<br />
<br />
Well, for one, you can't go wrong with more HP's. HP gear will allow you to canno more, thus making you have more mana, and as a side effect, requiring less wisdom. This is not to say ditch all your wis gear. Use common sense. Would I trade a no ac 10 wis ring for a 6ac 65hp ring? Hell yes i would. Would i trade a 36ac 15wis bp for a 37ac 50hp bp? No way in hell. Maybe if it was 250hp. The trick is slowly changing the ratio of Wis to HP and Sta (it gives HP too you know) Until you are running at about 70m full time. I always tell my groups i'm 50m when i'm 25m and that i'm fom at 50 mana. Basically for me, its true. And I never go OOM. AS long as you have HP's you can't go oom, its not possible. So trade out those earings and rings, and slowly move to more HP's and watch your mana pool actually grow.<br />
<br />
Step 3) I have all this HP's now, but when I slow and a mob beats me to a pulp I don't have any HP's to canno and i'm not seeing how this helps me.<br />
<br />
This is where it all comes together. The most important stat a shaman can have is HP's its true, but the second most important stat a shaman can have is AC. AC allows us to preserve our wonderful HP's so we can do more damge to ourselves. Everytime a mob hits you its like he is sucking your mana away. Now it is not possible as a shaman not to get hit, having a very high AC will help you avoid getting hit. The shaman AC seems to cap out around 1300ac, so thats your target. Right now at level 58 I have around 927ac unbuffed. Fully buffed i break 1k ac easy. This allows me to do massive crowd control. Unmezable mobs are a shamans best friend. Simply slow and dot till you have agro, run out and root park. If it resists root, you can just tank it. You have about the same AC as a hybrid and almost as many HP's. Now its hard to get tanks to let you do this (the have tank envy) but once you can convince them its ok and to just kill 1 mob at a time, they tend to start to love you. If the cleric complains that you are making his job hard because he has to heal you and not a tank, tell him to get bent and you will heal yourself. I have tanked 2 slowed tin men while my group killed 3 spiders, I didn't need more then 1 heal. This should really be one of our jobs. We can take a beating, we can reduce the damage out put of the mob by 75%, at that point, they really can't hurt you. If a mob doesn't hit for more then 500 damage, dont ever be afraid to tank it.<br />
<br />
-------------Final thoughts---------------------------<br />
<br />
I hope that if you try my tatic of High ac and HP's and a lower wisdom you will find yourself having more mana and doing a much better job as a shaman. Even if you find yourself OOM a lot with your current wis, I would suggest giving this a try. A lot of times shaman are oom simply because they refuse to canno. A tipical shaman needs to cast about 2000 mana a fight min. So you should never stop cannoing. If you are not FoM you should be cannoing or waiting for the recast of canno. Watch your actual total hp not a percent. I use an actual number on my UI so i can see how close I am, I will canno down to the point where the next canno will kill me. I do this even durring combat. Once you train your cleric not to worry about you things tend to go more smoothly and eventually the cleric finds himself FoM with nothing to do but tank and nuke.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps future shaman.</div></div><hr />

There are many occasions where resists&gt;all and that 50 points of extra hp/wis/AC will mean little because your 50MR at level 65 was not enough to stand up to Big Boss Bob's nuke of death.  Granted, you can avoid fighting casters and run from raiding, but where is the fun in that??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hehe, i wrote that a while ago. Just hoping it still hold true today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Radag's advice is the best on this thread.  Regen, flowing thought, focus items, mana free damage items, and other utility items are the most important thing to get.  They make you more efficient.  Everything else just ups your safety margins.  <br />
<br />
Only after you've obtained all possible items of this nature should you focus on the question of hp versus wis versus ac.<br />
<br />
Once you've got all your efficiency items covered, I'd go for things in the following order:<br />
<br />
* enough AGI to get it to 75+ unbuffed (huge ac benefit)<br />
* enough AC to get you to the sweet spot versus mobs you're fighting.  I think the rule of thumb I heard was 20*level being a good ac target.<br />
* hit points<br />
* wisdom or mana items<br />
<br />
But like Rathjar said, use your head and strike a balance.  I think if you look at a bunch of magelos you'll see that sort of balance.  For example, I'm wearing an obulus death shroud, but I have an imbued granite spaulder bagged.  This is because  mana pres is much more important to my efficiency than is the extra AC/resists from the IGS.  And I've got a amulet of insight, which is total crap for stats, but is worth it for extended enhancement.  Fungi tunic gives me about flowing thought 9 when using canni4, so it's worth it despite the crappy AC and negative stats.  And I am wearing matchless dragon boots instead of some of the more conventional shaman boots (barbed dragon) which have more HP on them.  That's because I think it's crucial to have my unbuffed AGI above 75 and the Lodi shield &amp; fungi have neg AGI on them.  I am getting to the point where I'm going to need to work on improving my HP though.  (17 AA to go for canni5.)</div></div><hr />

I must just totaly disagree with this.<br />
<br />
It is my job to be higher on the agro list then the chanter or the cleric or the druid or any of the people runing around in a dress.  It is my job to take a pounding so that the chanter lives or the cleric can heal or I can move a mob out of the way for a timly root park.  As a shaman, agro control means that I get agro on everthing I can that does not have a plate tank standing in front of it.<br />
<br />
The only reason that ac is of less value now then in the past is that the mobs in PoP have such high attack ratings that we can no longer acheive the AC numbers needed to mitigate damage.  On such mobs HP &gt; AC  just like for some caster mobs resists gear &gt; all.  Regardless, the goal of a good shaman should not be to avoid agro so that you can drop you AC gear.  A good shaman thrives on agro and takes pride that the chanter never gets touched. As a shaman,  I find nothing so shamfull as having my chanter or cleric die before I do.  I feel nothing but shame if the chanter takes a dirt nap and I am still standing at the end of a fight.<br />
<br />
I am aware that this is just a game, but I must say I just hate the little pansy shaman that run around like druids scared to get agro.  I am as hard as nails,  dam hard to kill,  and would much rather eat dirt then wait around for others to get rezed.<br />

When I play the cleric doesn't out aggro me and if I'm root parking, I'm not grouping with this chanter any more.. If the druid I'm assuming is getting aggro because of overnuking or snaring too early.. then I teach them what to do.. (after they get rezzed).. <br />
<br />
I'm still in the process of learning the game (I've been playing 5 months now).. the group I xp with most of the time know that they run/evac when I die not when the cleric or crowd control dies because I can get us through the mess.. <br />

Raw mana is nice, but not nice enough to choose over ac/hp.  The size of your mana pool matters far, far less than does the size of your hp pool.<br />
<br />
2)  I'd balance ac and hp improvements til you get around 1k-1100 ac*, then focus on hp upgrades and ac should take care of itself.  Also, and this is key, max your defense skill.  It's free ac, and it's a lot easier to max this every level as you go up than it is to make up an 80 point shortfall when you're 52.<br />

One thing you can't argue is C5. 2K HPs for 1200 mana. I'm hardly ever at full health in exp groups, making 3K hps darn near mandatory when you get to level 61 and get c5.

He asked about AC/HP/Wis in the MID-TWENTIES!  And then people go on about 1k ac, 3k hp, Canni V, blah blah blah. None of which has anything to do with his question. <br />
<br />
Below L 50, go for AC as your #1 stat. HP, wis, and mana all matter, but not as much as AC. If you get hit less, and take less damage, you'll have more HP to convert to mana, and less healing downtime. You don't have any big heals of canni skills that require a large HP pool to be efficient. So a large HP pool does nothing for you that it doesn't also do for any other class (keep you alive longer). <br />
<br />
AC is #1. After that, balance HP and mana pool so that you have &quot;enough&quot; of both. Obviously, there are no exactly numbers on what's enough, it'll depend on your playstyle. Wisdom is a weak stat in the 20's, because the amount of mana you get per point of wisdom is affected by level. I think it's 12 mana/wis at L 60, 10 mana/wis at L 50, and 5 mana/wis at L 25 (assuming all wis values under 200).  That's using old data, so might be off in some manner now, but it's approximately accurate at least. <br />
<br />
If you're a twink with money (as I'd guess from 190something wisdom at L 20something), then the best thing is a regen bp - either fungi, or iksar ceremonial. The regeneration will do you far more good than more base HP.</div></div><hr />

Hail,  I agree somewhat with your first paragraph, but disagree wholeheartedly with your AC&gt;all statement below level 50.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste II  (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28238)  waist item EASILY obtained w/ a friend who can forage for you (or yourself if you are a lizard).<br />
Mana Preservation II (or III), Burning Affliction III, Affliction Efficiency II, and several other focus effects will have a HUGE effect on your abilities as a shaman at lower levels.  Honestly I think some of these focus items will do MUCH more good for a low level shaman than more AC.<br />
<br />
Extended Range III can let you cast earlier and farther, letting you debuff and/or slow (or root) on the pull.  Huge benefit.  Spell Haste!!!  I would give up 200hp &amp; 50AC to have Spell Haste IV right now.  <br />
<br />
I personally would rate getting critical focus effects (Making spells 10-20% better in one aspect or another) first and then going HP/AC/Wisdom below 50.  Post 50, I would make it HP/Focus/AC/resists (until unbuffed &gt;100)/wisdom.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">OK, I&quot;ll agree with you there. Focus effects can be very useful, because they increase your efficiency. I'd rate some of the focus effects higher than AC. I just hadn't considered them (and neither had anyone else in this thread yet, I don't think). <br />
<br />
There were basically no focus effects for lower level characters when I've played most of my shamans (I've had, oh, six or so or various levels, back to beta 3), so I didn't think about them.  Some of them (most? all?) are certainly worth more than a few AC or HP on an item.</div></div><hr />

I got mine at level 40 and it made soloing fun again.  It was a bit of a challenge before that.. lots of downtime.  They're down to about 40kpp now.<br />
<br />
If you can get a JBB, that's free damage for pretty much your whole career.  They're actually selling in the bazaar for 25kpp.  My eyes bugged out heh.<br />
<br />
Now.. for when you get to be an old goat like most of the rest of us:<br />
<br />
I'm level 65 and reasonably well geared now.  Cann 5 takes me down to 71% health from full.  I have enough hps.  That gives me 1200 mana.  That's about one bubble.<br />
<br />
At this point, when I cann 5, I'm down 1924 hps, but with the focus effects and aas I have, I can heal myself with Q for just about 1924 hps.  I didn't plan that, but I was wise in what I picked.<br />
<br />
That makes hps and mana almost equally important.<br />
<br />
Except.<br />
<br />
You have to work at it to convert the hps to mana and that takes time that you could be doing other things.  Raw mana can be used right from the carton.  You don't have to cook it like you do hps.  Also, Cann5 has a 3 min repop, as frustrating as that is.  That leaves you with Cann4, which is a lot of casting for not much mana.<br />
<br />
Wis only matters until you max it for level.  If you have greater bear form, you can be 10 under max for level and still be maxed.  That is your base mana pool.  The very second you get access to the Planar Power and Innate Enlightenment AAs, do them.  These enlarge your potential mana pool by increasing your wis cap.  Your wis gear will catch up with the cap, no worries.<br />
<br />
AC doesn't matter nearly as much in PoP as it did before.  I die at about the same rate as the shaman with 250AC more than me.  When mobs flurry at you for 3000, 1100AC or 1400AC will not save you.  I'm told that Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes help a lot.  I'm working on that, and I hope I heard right.<br />
<br />
On the whole, the PoP loot balances out hp and mana (not always, but usually).  That pretty much ensures that your hps will be similar to your mana anyway (give or take a thousand).<br />

under level 50 there's a ton of ways you can go, as the stats only have minimal effect. I had fun with it and focused on gear in this order STR&gt;Focus Effects&gt;AC&gt;HPs&gt;wis. I wanted to be ok at melee while It was still a viable option.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Musicandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Up until you are able to acquire the Cannibalization Advanced Ability (Cann5), I would have to say that you should be building your shaman WIS&gt;HP&gt;AC.  Most pre-PoP mobs do not hit for the kind of damage you will encounter in the Planes, and your mana supply will most likely be the determining factor in whether you are able to sucessfully solo a mob.  I am also basing this on the fact that pre-PoP mobs seem to less resistable to the shaman's root spell, and most of our dots in general.  It is more than likely you will be able to root a mob long enough to get your heal spell off if you take any significant damage.<br />
<br />
When you get Cann5, you are ready to Solo in PoP and at least stand a chance (in my book).  Your odds of survival significantly increase if you have the spell Torpor, and even more if you have Malo.  So after you acheive Cann5, you are going to want to be able to cast it without 1) killing yourself (most shammies have done this once.......once) 2) lowering your hp to the point where you draw low life aggro (certain death) and 3) Be able to cast it after dying immediately after casting torpor on yourself, and not draw low life aggro.  #3 is important in raiding situations where a quick recovery is essential to completing an event or to beat out the respawn.  So, after you acheive Cann5 (a great thing) your shaman building priorities need to change from WIS&gt;HP&gt;AC to HP&gt;AC&gt;WIS.  Yes, it takes a lot of AA's to get Cann5, but it seperates you from those that dont have it.  I would rather have a lvl 60 with cann5 in my group than a lvl 65 with none.  PoP mobs just dont give you the luxery of sitting back and regening mana as a shaman.  From now on, medding won't be in your vocabulary, or the stupid canni-dance we were all forced to use (which really worked well I must admit).  As you progress through PoP your gear will most likely improve, and you will have access to the higher priced items to augment that.  Personally, I recommend getting lvl 60 first, then going all AA until Cann5 is acquired (especially if you have torpor).  After getting Cann5, XP straight to 65.  This will greatly increase your HP and AC (somewhat), and will start you on the path to getting more and more HP.  With a KEI and Cann5 and torpor, you can solo just about any tier 3 PoP mob and below no problems, and be able to move on to the next mob with a mostly full mana and HP bar.  Remember HP IS MANA....and Medding is out.<br />
<br />
As you progress through PoP, by the time you reach Tier 4 zones you will probably have 4500-6000 HP Fully Buffed, and be able to take a few hits, but not much more.  At this, &quot;the beginning of the endgame,&quot; your priorities are going to change again.  Instead of HP&gt;AC&gt;WIS, you are going to want to follow this:<br />
<br />
1) HP - Get you Natural Durability and Planar Power AA's maxed, and get your STA to 305<br />
2) Max out any AA's dealing with Combat Avoidance, like Combat Agility<br />
3) WIS - Get Innate Enlightenment AA maxed, and get your WIS to 355 a larger mana pool will sometimes save your butt<br />
4) AC - Unless you have a TON of AC, comparable to a Warriors (nearly impossible at the same progression level), forget about AC.  Your gear that you acquired earlier to get all that HP almost always has decent AC as well, which will be good enough to take couple of hits, but not much more.  From here on out, your AC rating is only a buffer between whether 3 hits kill you, or 5.  With combat avoidance you need to make the most of that gap.  5 more seconds DOES matter.<br />
<br />
The mobs in PoP hit HARD.  As you get closer to Time, the mobs hitting you are just insanely powerful, most requiring several groups, or one really well armed group just to clear normal stuff.  The combat avoidance line of AA's are your best way to survive in raids.  You arent soloing in Tier 4+ unless you are uber-shammy-extraordinarie with a full set of time gear and 700AA's.  And even then, you are still going to die when one of these beasts hits you more than 1-2 times.  Your combat avoidance will help you greatly, but it does not make you an unhittable ninja.  These mobs will mess you up, and good.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps in future expansions Shamans will get a major natural AC boost, or maybe even be able to use some plate.  If the developers are going to make turgurs insects so powerful to a mobs hate list, something has to give.  Not every tank you group with is going to have a BoC or BoW or BF to get instant aggro.  Taunt is useful for saving your butt after the mob has already pounded you once or twice, and thats about all you are going to be able to take without avoidance AA's.  Would the game be put out of balance if a Shaman's defense was in line with a warriors?  At the high end of the game, I think not.<br />
<br />
Most of this is only my opinion, and critisicm is welcomed.  Maybe it will make you or me a better shaman, which is what we all strive for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Vortecks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">To me WIS is king.  Has been since i made this toon a 1.5 years ago.   I twinked him out with a 240wis all the way through his 30's and then capped his wis..<br />
<br />
I have never ever worrried about AC.  AC will happen by itself, no need to worry about it.<br />
<br />
Once i hit my 60's my focus shifted to gaining some HP's.. Now I did not say swap hps for wis... i said gain HPS..<br />
<br />
Lets face it if you are gonna get beat down .. you are gonna get beat down and the mob doens't care if you have 4k hps or 6k hps, once you hit that low hp agro, might as well chalk it up.. unless your healer has an inc cheal.  This really doesn't matter in the higher tiers, you get agro you are gonna take a beating.<br />
<br />
What would you rather have, a mana pool of 2500 or 4000?  <br />
<br />
Me, i'd rather have all the mana i can get, so i can cast and cast!!<br />
<br />
I'd rather have my canni5 refill only 1 blue bubble then 1/2 my whole mana bar.<br />
<br />
With LDon now upon us, it is soo easy to add wis/sta/hps to preexisting items.  <br />
<br />
As was stated before i wouldn't worry about augmenting your currrent equipment, since you will be lossing it more sooner then later.  I would save your ldon points for equipment upgrades instead of augs<br />
<br />
As Musicandor posted get your STA and WIS maxed, both are equally important.  Although this is a long ways down the road for you but  just keep it in mind.<br />
<br />
When it is all said and done the only person that plays your shaman is YOU.  It is all in how you want to play!!<br />
<br />
For me I love having a high wis, only 320 base atm but working on it..  At the same time I have to be able to take a beating and have 3K hps unbuffed atm also..  So for me it is right downt the middle, high hps and high wis make ME a happy shaman!!<br />
