<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is the deal. Im curently level 45 Barb Shaman and have very little experience PK'ing or defending against getting PK'ed. It hasn't happened very much in my levels(current record 1-6), but moving to better experience lands I've found its going to happen more than before. My resists are all around 100 with my buffs. Hit points are around 1600, AC 765, ATK about 780 buffed. Spells I keep loaded are for experience against mobs mostly. No gate or dispel magic memmed. What are some tactics, spells to have loaded, etc... that you use? I know each situation will be different from the next, but it just seems I'm always not quite ready. Suggestions? Not looking to get flamed here just looking for some helpful advise. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Root, blind, scourge, cancel magic, gate, whatever your weaken spell is, and your mal* spell. Include a heal spell in there, too. If you're confident, switch gate for VoS.<br />
<br />
When you buff, put your stat buffs on first, followed by your AC buff, then your HP buff, resists, and finally SoW and regen. Kep DogDog up at all times. <br />
<br />
Against a melee, malaise, blind, root, send in pet, and plop on DoTs. Re-cast as needed. If you have a JBB, click that sunnabitch until you need to recast.  Basic strategy is root-rot. Your weaken spell just might encumber them, which is great.<br />
<br />
Against a caster... Send pet in, blind, DoT, root, run in for melee. The more things banging on these guys the better. You want to send the pet in first so that they're likely to be targeting him if they start to cast hotkeyed spells.<br />
<br />
Be sure to use cancel magic liberally on both. Nothing worse than someone with a pesky SoW.<br />
<br />
Against a bard, attempt a root first. Selos is the most annoying thing in the world. Then Malaise. Might want to stick with just root-rotting them, due to their ability to poof pets.<br />
<br />
Against dumb melees, you can pet-kite them, as well. Done this a few times. They try to gank you. Pet jumps in, you cancel magic - you'd be surprised how many people leave SoW as their first buff. You then kite them. If they attack your pet, great. Proceed as listed above. If they chase you, then slap on a DoT or two and let them chase you while Poochie bies their butts. If they hit you hard enough to make you worry even with regen up, either root them, or blind and change directions, back off and heal.<br />
<br />
Against ganking casters, your best bet is passive defense. If they hit you, they'll hit fairly hard. If you resist, though, carry on as outlined above, with heals tossed in.<br />
<br />
Items that cause stun (totem of rolfron zek, spear of mortification, howling harpoon) are great, as are crystalized pumices. If you're good at alchemy, make some of those instant 300HP potions (stinging wort?) with balm leaves and ice giant toes. Arm your pet, even if it's just with a pair of rusty daggers, he'll dual + double, plus an occasional kick or bash. If you can, get your hands on a Black Alloy Medallion and maybe some gimp extended affliction 2 item. If you're good at 2hb, a Drakkel Icegrinder can do wonders in melee.<br />
<br />
Would help a little more if you listed your server :) I'm guessing that because you have better gear than I did at 45 on a blue server, our on TZ / VZ, or maybe Sullon. Basic tactics are the same, but the gear I listed might be iffy on Rallos, if you're squeamish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PvP is mostly about gear and levels, but here are a few thoughts<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
Unfortunately, the spells you need for PvP are different from PvE - this isnt a problem when you are on a blue server, because you know when you are going to duel, but on a red server, you have to balance efficient PvE exping spells with some PvP spells just in case you get jumped.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS have blind memmed - (i use flash of light) - it has been the deciding factor in so many of my PvP encounters.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS have gate memmed - at your level, many of the people who attack you are going to own your ass, no matter what you do - gating is not cowardly if you cannot possibly win.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS keep cancel magic memmed - the reason will become apparent in the tactics section<br />
Levitate is a good buff against melee classes in hilly steep zones - if they dont have it, you can run them around and let them take damage from falls<br />
<br />
Spells that cast fast are good<br />
Blasts are more effective in PvP - good PvPers will have cure poison / disease potions ore items (earrings of purity / clensing)<br />
<br />
Gear<br />
Resists are crucial in PvP against casters. It is generally not practical to wear all you resist gear, but keep it all in the same bag, so you can do quick gear swaps on the run<br />
<br />
Against casters, a good big hard hitting 2hb weapon is useful - they will generally channel thru hits for less than 50, but something like a granite face grinder will hit them for over 100, and will prolly interrupt<br />
<br />
against melee classes, you will need more AC and dont worry about resists<br />
<br />
Potions<br />
Stinging Wort potions are the absolute business in PvP<br />
They are made with Ice Giant toes from everfrst, and balm leaves sold by gypsies (33 plat). They are hard to make (156 trivial?), but they are instant cast 300hp heal / buff. A stack of these is SO useful for PvP - i worked on my alchemy purely to make these potions<br />
<br />
Always carry cure poison and cure disease potions - they are so useful, but you cannot afford to allocate spell slots<br />
<br />
Tactics<br />
As a general rule, whoever starts the PvP - whoever lands the first spell / hit, has a big advantage<br />
<br />
Never stay still for longer than it takes to cast a spell - keep moving. When you run, strafe.<br />
Teach yourself to circle strafe - most people cannot do this<br />
<br />
Use Flash of Light all the time - if it doesnt stick at least 1 in 4 times, then chances are your magic type spells are gonna resist too, so stick with poison and disease.<br />
<br />
Against casters, use Blast of Poison DD spell - they have crappy hitpoints, and 3 of these DD blasts will prolly kill them. I killed a caster today using only flash of light and blast of poison - and he attacked me first<br />
<br />
Remeber that Dogdog will point towards your opponent even if dogdog is snared or rooted<br />
<br />
Always have a junk buff in your first spell slot - cancel it and leave the spot free. If possible leave 2 slots free. That way, if you get hit with nasty spells like snare, or root, or winged death, etc, you can use your cancel magic to get rid of them without cancelling your own buffs - spells like snare will kill you if you dont get rid of them fast<br />
<br />
Practice - PvP with your friends, for fun - the more you PvP, the better you will become<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, thats enough for starters - good luck. Well, one final thought - its only a game - keep that in mind, and don't get upset if you get ripped a new one - it doesnt really matter does it?</div></div><hr />
