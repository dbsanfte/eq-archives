<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have people noticed additional dot agro when we have burning affliction focus?  <br />
<br />
Last night my guild went to go kill Seru.  He has many many HPs, I prefer to use dots on him instead of DDs.   Gwain (my guildmate) was handling the slowing and GRC on my group and so that left me free to dot at will.<br />
<br />
I was in full DPS mode, I had no other responsibilities to heal or cure or debuff, a rare thing for this shaman.  My first spell set was Pox, Ultor, Blood, Bane of Nife.  With this set I was doing about ~120dps or so, before BA.  If I had a round where all 4 dots got the full 20% boost it would be about ~150dps.  I figured I would run this set and then as the MT gained more agro I would start chain casting velium strike until I went oom!  :p I sustained these spells for about 3 minutes until I got summoned.  Then I had to tank for about a minute before the dots wore and the MT got agro back.<br />
<br />
I waited a couple minutes before resuming dots with just Pox, Ultor and Blood... and throwing on a velium strike from time to time.   Gwain then started throwing on his dots.  At one point he had our 3 top dots from each of the poison and disease lines.  He was slowing, healing and curing.  AND I WAS SUMMONED AGAIN, with just 3 dots on, to his 6.   I wasn't sitting or low health.<br />
<br />
I ended up being summoned twice more during the fight.  Gwain was logically generating more agro than me, as he was keeping up basically the same dots as me, but usually a couple more!   Gwain agro'd Seru before me!  He was healing me when I got summoned (thx!) and he was healing and curing our group.  The only difference I could figure was that I have burning affliction and he doesn't.  Even our necro who always get summoned didn't get summoned.  :(<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed this kind of big agro difference?<br />
<br />
For reference, our MT uses a Bloodied Berserkers Blade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=30530), with an Anger 3 proc (not using a bane weapon).  He used incite regularly and did his agro disc.   He has 500MR and resists the stuns consistantly.  He is a good tank, I group with him regularly and he knows how to keep agro.<br />
<br />
So I was going to post a log, but I discovered that when I reinstalled EQ I had forgotten to turn logging on.  Whoops.<br />
<br />
<br />
DOT agro makes Henora cry.  The small boost from Burning Afflicition shouldnt be giving me that much extra damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit: OH, maybe I should mention why this surprises me... this is surprising to me because I had read something on the wizard boards about DD focuses/crits not counting for additional agro. ]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You had alot more damage done to Seru prior to your guildmate starting doing his dots, but there's no way of telling where you were on the aggro table when you stopped doing dots and restarted. It would be a tough thing to try and figure out if BA is causing more aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm wonder how many ticks it would take to get aggro over dogdog in a situation where you start dotting after dogdog has chewed through 15% of a mobs health using Bane with BA4, and then using Bane+Scourge with no BA4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey now, correct me if I'm wrong here but, shouldn't Ultor overwrite Pox and Blood of Saryrn overwrite Bane of Nife, as these are the next spells in those lines?<br />
Which might explain why you were getting additional aggro, if you're guildmate was casting the same dots (minus the ones that would be overwritten) he wouldn't be generating the same aggro, since you are tossing out all those dots (you still get some aggro from landing your older dots before the new ones hits).<br />
So you were getting aggro from 4 dots+ all the DD's, whereas he probably was getting it from 2 dots + slow.<br />
And BA4 should get your slightly more aggro, as you are doing more dmg in the long run also.<br />
<br />
And well if I'm wrong about the dot overwrites then ignore all that. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have noticed that I can't stack as many dots on as once if I've got a BA item.  I think it's simply that if you do a lot of damage in a short amount time over and over you are essentially chain nuking and generate more aggro  On boss mobs I'll often try to stack Bane/Anametha/BoS/BoN which generates somewhere over 1K/tick without BA.  With BA it's considerably more (20%) and I will just about ALWAYS get summoned until 1 or 2 of them wear off or I get crunched for being stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just chain tears and torrent on that fatty.  With the ridiculous aggro on dots it isn't worth throwing anything with poison counters in a fight where positioning is important imo.  I find poison DoT equally outrageous with and without BA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey now, correct me if I'm wrong here but, shouldn't Ultor overwrite Pox and Blood of Saryrn overwrite Bane of Nife, as these are the next spells in those lines?<br />
<br />
All shaman dots stack with each other, if you had the slots you could stack every dot we get on the same mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">shouldn't Ultor overwrite Pox and Blood of Saryrn overwrite Bane of Nife, as these are the next spells in those lines? <br />
<br />
All of our dots stack. To test it, turn on DoT damage and start casting all of your dots in the same line on a mob. He will take damage from all of them. I often stack Pox and Ulthor as well as Bane of Nife and Blood of Saryn on a mob when i solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">correct me if I'm wrong here but, shouldn't Ultor overwrite Pox and Blood of Saryrn overwrite Bane of Nife<br />
Consider yourself corrected. :p  All of our dots stack.  Well, I think maybe the ancient ones don't stack with their normal version, but I'm not even sure on that, as I don't have any of the ancients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I started dotting at about 90% (seru's life).  The only time I stopped was when I had to cannidance after spamming tnarg's on Henora.   :p   I could sit any time I wanted to as well.  I only had one person to cure, and they also required very little healing.  Grummus is once every 3 mins(which certainly isn't agro free, and malicious decay as well).  I had two spell sets saved with the 3 poison dots and the 3 disease dots to facilitate faster swapping.<br />
<br />
I think we need some BA4 agro tests!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I think maybe the ancient ones don't stack with their normal version, but I'm not even sure on that,<br />
<br />
They stack as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm pretty sure that this is not due to BA4.  Remember that if your tank is not using a bane weapon versus seru, he isn't doing any melee damage.  That makes his aggro dependent entirely on procs and thus streaky and unreliable.  More likely than not, you got summoned during a bad streak.<br />
<br />
Also, if you started dotting right away and the other shaman didn't start dotting until even a minute later, that's a HUGE difference in aggro, and you said it was several minutes.  Aggro doesn't go away if you stop dotting for a while.  The warrior's taunt can put him at the top of the list, but without actual melee damage, he just isn't generating enough aggro to stay on top of a dotting shaman.<br />
<br />
(Numbers made  up).  After the warrior has been meleeing for a while, he's at say... 5000 aggro.  Then you start throwing on dots.  The warrior is generating 2000 aggro per minute, but your dots are generating 4000 per minute.  In two and a half minutes, you're going to get summoned when you pass him at 10000.  You stop dotting and as your dots wear off, you stop generating aggro and he can taunt to get back on top at lets say 15000 aggro.  Then, the other shaman starts dotting.  He's been doing a little bit of healing and slowing, but those activities are pretty inconsequential compared to poison dots.  He starts dotting and is putting out a whopping 6000 aggro per minute, but he was at ~2000 aggro to start with.  Thus, he isn't going to be getting summoned unless the fight goes on for a lot longer.  However, you are still near the top of the aggro list, and you started dotting again.  It doesn't take long before you once again pass the warrior and get summoned.<br />
<br />
The moral?  Use a knight to tank Seru and camp out every 5 minutes to clear aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With BA it's considerably more (20%) <br />
<br />
It's 1 - 20% more, full 20% on a tick is rare for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm pretty sure that this is not due to BA4.

<br />
<br />
That is incorrect. The damage you do with a non-bane weapon is exactly the same as if it was a bane weapon. The &quot;phantom&quot; damage generates &quot;real&quot; hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jinheim - yeah, I am willing to accept that as the most likely case.  Sadly I have used this same spell set on one other Seru kill.  It was before I had burning affliction and before our warrior had the ability to use incite (using same weapon though).  I didn't have any problems, but did start slightly later.<br />
<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting proceedure for me = worked fine before, what has changed?  The answer was BA affliction aug, so I wanted to see if other people had had any trouble with it generating more agro than could be expected.  That way I could blame it!  I need things to blame.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Who uses dots... ):<br />
<br />
I nuke because with cold focus it's fun to try and get stupid numbers like 666 and 2k crits...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I found out the hard way...before I had  BA4...just chaining Blood on Seru will get yer butt summoned. Suprised the heck out of our main tank at the time, and cracked the other shaman right up. This was quite some time ago, and our tank DID have a Bane weapon. According to my sweetie, the look on my face when I got summoned was priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Seru:<br />
<br />
Use MD/Grummus<br />
Use Ultor/Pox <br />
Chain Veilum strike <br />
<br />
You will never be summoned.  You use the poison dot line and your going to have problems w/summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">To answer the question:<br />
<br />
YES!  I without a doubt have higher agro with burning affliction... so noticeable in fact that it totally through off my reflexive timing for reapplying dots (had to insert unnatural pauses between a fade and a new cast)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Isnt burning affliction limited to Pre 60 spells?  kinda useless isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Burning Affliction 3 would be. Luckily, there are Burning Affliction 4 augments in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have the Saryrn BA4 earring and can't claim to have noticed that it has had any significant bearing on my agro.</div></div><hr />
