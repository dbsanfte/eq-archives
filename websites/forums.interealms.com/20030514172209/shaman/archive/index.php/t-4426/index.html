<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hiladin22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, i know and read thousands of posts and guides saying to only use the 49 fire pet for the final lord rak fight..recently i been hearing mages say '' bla, bla, bla, weve done it many times w/ the 55-56 decoy fire pet, they have more hps and a bigger dmg shield''..also im having trouble finding mages w/ the 49 fire pet spell (seems alot skip that spell because its researched) so Question is: can the higher lvl melee fire pets (55-56?) do the job? and if not... why? Id really like to know why people choose the 49 fire pet over the higher lvl melee fire pet... any info on this would be greatly appreciated..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a chanter can tank vindi NP given proper healing chain.:)<br />
<br />
if you got enough healers to keep the pet alive....rak will prolly die faster then the 49 pet could kill em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a couple possible reasons for this.<br />
<br />
The 49 fire pet is actually pretty easy to get.  It is focusable by both the fire staff from Hate and the torch focus item, making it relatively impressive.  It also has a very nice damage shield and hits in the 50's for damage<br />
<br />
The 52/58 fire pets are wizards, and although the 58 pet got a recent upgrade to it's melee damage, it's damage shield (O'Kiels) is still weak compared to the 49 pet.<br />
<br />
The Decoy pet mentioned (56th) is basically a high hp, high damage shield pet, but it's melee damge is in the 40's.  This pet also has a taunt proc/cast that it uses to help hold agro more than other pets.<br />
<br />
The usual choice for Rak is the 49 pet, partially because people don't perceive much use for the 56 decoy pet and may not have it.<br />
<br />
The recent changes to pet resists have messed with the fire pets quite a bit and people are experiencing problems with their immunity to fire damage which all 4 of these had previously.  Some people are saying the resists are fine, others are having their pets killed by the second AE.  Just something to be aware of for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hiladin22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys for your info... I joined a reaver group last night in hopes of getting a shot at rak...he was up and just inside the door to the left..me and a shammy bud got 3 mages to tag along to help us w/ this battle, and i handed out two 49 fire pet spells i had bought earlier to the 2 that didnt have that pet..needless to say 3 of the fire pets seemed like overkill...I didnt even get hit w/ the AE (dont know how i avoided that).. 1 pet seemed to take dmg from the AE while the other 2 didnt..anyways rak went down quick...then we went back in, destroyed the reavers and pulled raks reaver out to spawn him again for my buds turn at his scale... evrything worked out great..got two shaman's their epic along w/ a bunch of other drops on the one raid..thanks everyone for the info..this is one happy shaman:)</div></div><hr />
