<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bluemega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking for all suggestions and or helpful tips if anyone could plz help. Im finding myself almost arguing over which race to make for my new shammy =x Iksar, or Troll? Troll has more sta, and more wis IF you dump those begining points in at the begining. Iksar has nice wis but if you want the hp's you gotta dump the points into sta =(<br />
<br />
Im leaning more twards the troll side. But im asking,<br />
Is there a difference in the races leveling speed?<br />
What differences are there?<br />
<br />
I want to be able to pretty much solo speedily up the levels and stilll be strong. Thank you !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you want a powergaming choice with fun RP potential and a real endgame trait that matters, pick Ogre.<br />
<br />
Regen dont matter in the end. Helps along the way.. but worth the hefty xp penalty?? nah.<br />
<br />
Really play whatever race you think is the coolest, and of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Trollie - we are cute, especially shrunk, and as an Inny worshipper, the snare necklace is handy, plus a very fun quest (well I was amused running around the Commons with hairy feet).<br />
<br />
 We don't, however, have a home, the frog's snuck in overnight and refuse to leave. I wouldn't overly worry about sta too much, we can buff that anyway. The regen is very handy, especially early on in life (pre-stoicism I'd say), later I think the penalty to xp makes it debatable as I level considerably slower than friends on exactly the same mobs. <br />
<br />
I wasn't aware that Ikkies couldn't wear jbb's that's a pretty significant disadvantage if you aspire to own one. But...ultimately I'd say go with what suits you, you have to stare at your avatar for a long old time so you may as well like the look =)<br />
<br />
I'm a troll, and love it, and to give you a different perspective, my snare necklace has saved me n pals at least as many times as not being able to be stunned from the front would have, but that is a very nice innate ability for ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">See the other thread for the answer.   And I'll answer the same thing, once the thread pops up AGAIN by the end of the week......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ogres can't be frontal stunned, thats all that matters. Barbieshammy begins to cast CH.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How do you feel about being asked &quot;shrink your fat ass&quot; every time you're in an indoor group (and often when you're in an outdoor one.  If that bothers you, after you've heard it for a year, don't pick the large races.  If you don't like being knocked because you're a generic shaman (i.e. Barbie) don't be a Barbarian.  Cute, Don't be a kitty.  10,000 frog leg joke, don't be a Froglok.  Each race has their RP downsides, as well as their strengths.<br />
<br />
We are visual creatures, so you don't want to take a race that you don't want to look at for the next 2 years.  <br />
<br />
Analogy:  Do you want a $150K job?  How do you know?  Do you know what it'll require of you?  It sounds great, but the pain and level of responsibility may make that $150K not worth it.</div></div><hr />

/flame retardent shield on<br />
(chosen for fun after having both an iksar and troll shammies to 34 and 44)<br />
Between Troll and Iksar, I would go with Troll of Innuruuk for the snare necklace alone. (JBB use is a bonus though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dear Kermeet and every other tard with clown frog names:<br />
<br />
You are not original. You are not funny, amusing or even cute. You are annoying and should be neutered for the sake of Norraths well-being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pick what you like the look of most.<br />
<br />
Trolls always have made me smile, I wanted a troll for the looks, and chose shaman because a troll casting spells was hilarious. 65 levels and a buch of aaxp later I'm very happy with my choice ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A Vah Shir shaman is the only way to go.  And I’m not just being catty.  ;) <br />
<br />
All puns aside, I chose to be a kitty shaman because I like their looks and I don’t like dealing with all the negative faction issues the “evil” races have.  But if I had to choose between a troll or a lizard I’d pick the troll.  I played a troll warrior to 20th level when I first started EQ, and that seemed really high back then.  He was a lot of fun to role-play but I found I didn’t like being blocked from my favorite cities and I didn’t like my total lack of spells.  But the troll race itself is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kajer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Personally i play an Iksar Shaman. Just dinged 58 last night and I have 0 AA so far. Its been a fun race to play as well as challenging.<br />
<br />
Basically pick one race and see how you like it. Weigh the advantages with the disadvantages and then decide for sure which one you are going to play. Iksars cant wear plate and are kos almost everywhere...but we are so perrrrty. And the tail....gotta love the tail.<br />
<br />
Be sure to let us know which race you decide on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
REJECTED!<br />
<br />
A Troll or Ogur with a name that's a variant of Crush or Smash doesn't have room to talk.  That kind of a name was knee-jerk for those races post-beta, just like Kermit variations are for Frogloks now.  <br />
<br />
And before you try to turn this around, I wrote FJ's story before I ever rolled him.  His name perfectly fits his gods, his past and his outlook on life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Troll- Regen and snare neck, JBB, vision<br />
Barbarian- Good race, JBB, Tough face paint<br />
Orge- no stun, JBB, vision<br />
Cat- Good race, some nice newb quests, vision <br />
Frog-swiming, good race, vision<br />
Lizard- regen, better ac, swiming'<br />
<br />
here are some differences.  I would go with ogre I think if I were to reroll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Cat or Frog is how I would reroll, if I were to be SILLY enough to reroll after 56 levels of shaman.<br />
<br />
I love being an Ogre: I like the size, I like nto being stunned from the front, I love being fairly unique in a work FULL of barbarian shaman....BUT<br />
<br />
I HATE the EXP penalty.<br />
<br />
It just plain SUCKS.<br />
<br />
Cats and Frogs have one (very large) advantage over the rest of the shaman races: they don't have an experience penalty.<br />
<br />
Regen isn't worth a 20% EXP penalty.  Barbarian stats (especially combined with their lack of night-vision!) are not worth a 5% EXP penalty.  Frontal stun immunity (as useful as it is) is NOT worth a 10% EXP penalty...even when you kick in a little Obre STA for the deal.<br />
<br />
Its just not worth it!<br />
<br />
Now if I were going to create a WARRIOR or and SK - THEN I would think the Ogre racial benefits would be worth it.  But for a shaman?  Nope.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you have to ask which race is better than you are not worthy of joining the Empire ! <br />
<br />
Fear the Iksar !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">At the risk of invoking the wrath of FJ:<br />
<br />
In a fantasy world of Ogres, Trolls, Gnomes and dragons, I would seriously expect a bunch of muscle-headed ogres have the name of crush, smash, bonk, or whatever. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I seriously doubt the names of Jim Henson's creations would have been commonly seen in this same fantasy world. <br />
<br />
This ALSO applies to all tards with names like Meowmyx, Feelyne, Litterbox, Garfeeld, Heethcliff, etc for cats. <br />
<br />
Now...that monk on RN named Hooflung Poo and made it to 60 before being caught...that was good.</div></div><hr />
