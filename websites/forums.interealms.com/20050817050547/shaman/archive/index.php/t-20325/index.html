<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading through all these mud flinging posts from both shaman and clerics and there sione thing the clerics mentioned that I think we should concentrate on and it would be totally new to the game instead of boosting old stuff causeing a domino effect.<br />
<br />
DeMitigation<br />
<br />
Give us a line of demitigation spells and mix mitigation spells.<br />
<br />
I know some rightnow are saying f7(*&amp; I do not want to spend more time debuffing before I slow.<br />
<br />
That is why I would like to see demitigation spells that are a mix resist debuffer as well as reversing the effects of mitigation.  If that has some people going &quot;But that will make my Malos spells useless well then have demitigation built into our slows.<br />
<br />
This will not only help us but it will leave the ench, bst, necro and any other classes with slow back further behind us where they belong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Either that or a skill that will give me a chance to land an &quot;exceptional slow&quot;.  75-90% slow or something.  Or just get rid of mitigation for the shaman slow all together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't see any point of it.  Dev's put in mitigation for whatever reason to make encounters more difficult.  It would defeat the whole purpose why they put it in.  Like Denero said, they could just rid mitigation all together, but they won't.<br />
<br />
What we could have perhaps, is a spell that mitigates a mob's damage to a small degree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like the disempower/cripple line Ramhorn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd have to agree anything that effects or avoids mitigation is probably never going to happen. Mitgation was added to the game specifically because they wanted it there. It is hopefully used specifically because they want it in that situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like this idea but I think that mitigation should stay in the game, if you take it out now all the balancing for PoP is out the window.<br />
<br />
However,  you CAN make it so that shaman slow is mitigated less than other classes who infringe on our abilities.   Say for shaman mostly slowed means 70% while for ench it would be 60% and for bst 54% or something like that.   Instead of us being effected equally bring us back into power by putting us on a different mitigation scale akin to warrior dmg mitigation vs other tanks.<br />
<br />
I mean compared to an enchanter who's shining ability is charm and our best ability, slow, they are far more even to us who can only charm a level 30 animal as opposed to say a level 60 animal.   See the difference?   We are not even close to infringing on thier abilities as they are to ours so lets widen the gap to where it should have been all along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Like the disempower/cripple line Ramhorn?<br />
<br />
No, but nice try.  Talking about a direct mitigation to damage like 10-15% or so.  Applying cripple to mobs these days is like throwing boulders made of paper at a semi-truck.  It hasn't been updated in about 4 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">true, but we don't need a NEW line. Just add the direct damage mitigation to the cipple line and then throw in a few post 60 spells of that line with varying componets like resist modifiers against mitigation percentage just like with our disease based Slows. Oh and throw in a AoE version too. <br />
<br />
Personally to see the effect we saw in damage mitigation with non-mitigated slows I think the direct damage mitigation should be closer to 25-30%.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the Shaman becomming a utility class with some hybrid equalivent healing like we have now. At least a gauranateed un mitigated reduction in MOB damage output would make us desireable in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like that idea, Denero.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a passive AA ability that would give us the ability to land an exceptional slow ... when it worked, the ability would increase the slow by up to 15%. This would make Turgur's a 90% slow on exceptional, and Grummus a 55% slow on exceptional. As far as points, etc. ... make it akin to the ability for exceptional heal. I would gladly accept a three-tier AA ... 3/6/9 points for this. Thoughts?<br />
<br />
I do believe slow mitigation is here to stay (a pox on the dev who invented it, lol). Mitigating an exceptional slow ... well, I'm no mathematician. I'm a Barbarian. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, if they upgraded our current line with something of that sort, it would revive alot of things.  I'm sure shamans on PvP servers would be more feared from melee'rs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You cannot get rid of (or even lessen) slow mitigation without completely trivializing a ton of raid encounters. Any such ability we get would have to not work on any raid MOBs (generally all 68+ MOBs).<br />
<br />
I am not sure if it easier to implement a new ability or just get rid of every other experience MOB mitigating slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slow mitigation was borked when they implemented it. What it really should do is work off the ammount of damage prevented and take off from there. Turgur's makes a mob deal 25% of its normal damage. If something is &quot;Partially&quot; Slowable it should deal 50% of its normal damage. if it's &quot;Slightly&quot; Slowable it should deal 75%. Sadly this isn't the case.<br />
<br />
Hell Apply it to beastlords, bards, and enchanters too. with Sha's a mob does 35% of its normal damage. it should do like 60% if Partially and 85% if Slightly. That would keep that sacred 10% difference intact.<br />
<br />
Make POP mold droppers and progression mobs immune to this, or retune them around it (not hard).<br />
<br />
Make everything in tipt &quot;Mostly&quot; Slowable, perhaps make the bosses &quot;Partially&quot;. Seriously, these fights are stupid short, Slow should have a noticible impact considering the percentage of the fight the monsters are actually slowed.<br />
<br />
Make Kod`Taz trials named at least slowable to some degree. Perhaps disease only? The point is we should be able to bring more to this fight than a paladin without melee damage.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah. Make plane of Time gods &quot;Slightly&quot; slowable and make them hit 10% faster unslowed =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe make it so mitigation removes a set numerical value off of slow?  Make it remove say 20,40, and 60 right off the top.  <br />
A mob that mitigates to slightly would be 15% slowed by shaman, 10% by enchanter, 5% by beastlord and unslowable by bards or weapon procs.<br />
Partially would be 35% from shaman, mostly would be 55% from shaman, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am sorry to say that it is highly unlikely to ever see mitigation removed in any form from mobs that currently have it by AA or a new spell.<br />
 I just see speculation on new AA or new spell lines like this as looking through the Toy section of the Christmas catalog when we were all 8 years old....its fun and pretty to imagine what your gonna unwrap and you get all excited by it, but in the end all you get is a few pairs of socks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Reducing slow percentages by a fixed percentage instead of a multiplier should have been the way to implement it. I remember some people trying to get it changed to that at the start of PoP but everyone was too happy with it being changed from a cap to a multiplier to protest much. It does not make too much of a difference anyways. Those couple percent between 65 and 80 % are the most important ones. Take them away and the rest does not matter much<br />
<br />
What would be great is if there was MOBs that could be slowed more then normal - an extra 10% would do much more for us then beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">An &quot;exceptional slow&quot; would unbalance the game in raid situations, as shamans would simply spam slow until they either drew aggro or landed a crit.<br />
<br />
The only way a slow crit would work is if a mitigating mob mitigated the crit by the same proportion it mitigates regular slow...which effectively defeats the purpose for which I see it described in this post.<br />
<br />
If you want to make the shaman slow the best once again, introduce melee mitigation into an upgrade version of Turgur's Insects..let's call it Turgur's II.  Throw in an innate +10% mitigation to melee damage, and also fix it so that mobs that are immune to slow can still be affected by the mitigation factor.  That gives shamans a viable weapon against mobs immune to slow, where no other class does.<br />
<br />
10% is, in my opinion, a very well rounded figure.  It won't trivialize old world content, for 10% off what has become a love tap is still a love tap, but a 10% reduction in damage from mobs that hit for 1200 is significant.<br />
<br />
However, if our ability to slow is enhanced, it is only fair that our upgrades to healing be either removed or reduced, in the interests of class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Binter:<br />
Due to the nature of slow even a 15% reduction in our slowing percentage (25% of &quot;mostly successful&quot; slow - 10%) reduces slowing effectiveness by 44%.<br />
<br />
The current 25% reduction reduces slow effectiveness by 57%.<br />
<br />
Once you take away 10% from our slow the next percent matter less and less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Either that or a skill that will give me a chance to land an &quot;exceptional slow&quot;.  75-90% slow or something.<br />
<br />
That would rock.  Give me a chance to critical slow, so to speak.  Oversome the effects of the mitigation in some cases and really slow the heck out of something at other times.  Make it an aa thing, make it only a certain percentage of time, whatever they feel they have to do to balance the game, but please give us an upgrade to slow in some form, for crying out loud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">man you really want to mem a god damn demitigation slow spell? instead of that they might as well reduce % mitigated on mobs across the board (if they wanted to do something stupid like that)..<br />
<br />
I would personally HATE casting that stupid spell..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">personally i always like the idea of a slow that stack with other classes slow. so say balance of nihil 60% slow will only slow %60 if only slower.<br />
if have a bard/enc/beast they can cast thier slow this will slow the mob a further percentage, that being about 30% of that slow. making the bard slow add 15%, total 75%, beast 19%, 79.% total and enc 21%, total 81% , mitagation still effective on that total. corse might be too hard to implement so just a slow which allows and extra (if 60% shaman slow) 15%-20%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Interesting idea - slow mitigation debuff.  <br />
<br />
If it were to happen though I think the spell should go to a class that can't slow.  More working together needed that way.  Now sure if it should be other priests or if it should be int casters -  maybe mages? - but giving non slowers a tool to be used to improve slowers seems to help balance issues maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The only upgrade I want to see for slow is one that combines the malo-slow process into a single spell - thus freeing up a spell gem for something else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Banukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Instead of a debuff make it an AA.<br />
<br />
Make it shaman only and cost 20 - 30 aa and have it reduce mitigation by one level. So say the mob mitigates &quot;partial&quot; it will instead mitigate &quot;mostly&quot; and so on. Call it Slow Mastery or something.</div></div><hr />
