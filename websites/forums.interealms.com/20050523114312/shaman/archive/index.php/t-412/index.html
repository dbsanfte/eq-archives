<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorgurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw a couple of days ago, someone posted they have 1400 AC.  Now, I'm sure that there are quite a few shammies out there with good AC, so I'm curious about some things.<br />
<br />
First, me.. full buffs, aego, shissar, + VoB/Agi, I'm at 1201 AC.  I've been told by some that studies were done on non-melee classes and that shamans AC tops out at 1000 AC, all else over is at 1/10 value (ie. 1200 ac is actually 1020AC in true value).  I have heard from others that this is not true at all.  Both people who've told me this are melees.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know from a personal standpoint that I get my arse whooped much more in resist gear (mid 900-ish AC) in ToV than in regular gear, leading me to, on regular raids, just wear my regular gear and toss a torpor on myself when we get a wurm.  I notice a difference because I'm the one getting hit.  I can see it... I dont need someone telling me they've &quot;run the numbers&quot; and it doesnt add up.<br />
<br />
So, I was wondering what the guys who have even higher AC have experienced.  In my opinion, AC is king.  It's HP-loss Avoidance, allowing me to canni that health, and it allows me to live thru a bit of a beating to land a slow (like the slow that was landed on the Flurry drake in NToV, after I got 2 resists and aggro).  That saves those melees who do the real tanking from dying.  <br />
<br />
And oh, .. did you have a tough time (you mega high AC shammies) convincing your guild to allow you in on the good AC stuff that might also be used by melees (ie. all/all items)?  Usually is the case now presented to shamans that I know is this:  &quot;It's gonna benefit a melee more than you, so you gotta wait till we equip our melees first, then you can have a crack at it cause we dont care anymore about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Ideas?  Ramblings?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm definitely a believer in the soft cap...<br />
<br />
I'm not positive of the numbers, but it's something like (Quoted from Furor, I believe):<br />
<br />
1200 for warriors, 1320 for warriors with AA whatever (stability?)<br />
<br />
1100 for priests, 1000 for casters.<br />
<br />
That's Velious..I'm thinking the caps are even lower for Old World / Kunark.<br />
<br />
I'm at 1200ish unbuffed.  I know I don't &quot;feel&quot; like I'm getting hit less when AC buffed, not that I've ever parsed it.<br />
<br />
If you take note of some Magelo profiles around of &quot;in the know&quot; warriors, you'll see much of them have switched out higher AC stuff for more HP.  Some people who were in full Warlords / other who had 1500ish AC are going down to 1300-1400 and opting for pieces with more HP.<br />
<br />
Just from a game standpoint, I think the softcap makes sense anyway.  Imagine if 1500 ac was actually effective in say, Sebilis, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was really gung ho AC for awhile, CC gauntlets, spider belt, etc. but my latest obsession is hitpoint gear (CC gloves for coldain, spider belt for bone clasped girdle, maybe IGS for strength of the elements).<br />
<br />
Which brings up an interesting subject.  My guild is ready to start tackling NTOV and I know that the Shield of Wurms is a random drop, I can't decide if I would want to switch out my OoIV for a Shield of Wurms.  <br />
<br />
Lose: 50 hitpoints<br />
<br />
Gain: <br />
7 to all resists (very nice)<br />
5 AC (iffy)<br />
10 wis (don't need it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Traktur Traylur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At least to me, on the upper end encounters, 1400 seems to be a 'soft cap'. ...meaning I get hit for full under 1400 and for less (sometimes much less) when over 1400 (1491 is my current ac max buffed).<br />
<br />
Every shaman has different ideas about what is important ..for me it's AC&gt;HP&gt;Resists&gt;Mana. I think that would be  a majority opinion but I could also see the point that HPs are &gt; all.<br />
<br />
My guild, Fury's Edge, went over to DKP in December. Prior to that we were dictator. One shaman basically got all the drops...unfortunately that shaman /wigged out and is no longer a member...nor even on our server. Right after Points went into effect, my gear began a steady climb and is starting to shape up.<br />
<br />
What we do on tough ToV/Ssra mobs is this...<br />
<br />
Step 1: Let the iksar die.<br />
<br />
Step 2: /ran for the real shaman to slow<br />
<br />
Step 3: Torpor self (if you lose random) <br />
<br />
Step 4: continue laughing at Iksar for redinging to 59.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Wait for enchanter to slow mob.<br />
<br />
Step 6: Laugh while enchanter dies.<br />
<br />
Step 7: Slow mob.<br />
<br />
Step 8: Collect loot.<br />
<br />
Rinse. Repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was at almost 1500 AC full raid buffed for a bit but I've dropped off some.  The &quot;cap&quot; is definately higher than 1000 AC.  1250-1300 is about where I start seeing very little change in damage on high end mobs as my AC goes higher.   I've recently started dropping AC gear for HP gear.   My goal is 2600 HP unbuffed with 1250 AC unbuffed (I'm currently at 1920 HP and 1316 AC).  Dropping 66 AC to gain 680 HP is a good deal to me since that 66 AC doesn't really help me much at all against Avatar of War, Flurry Drakes, etc  either the clerics will keep me alive, melees will get it off me, or I'll die nearly instantly.... that 66 AC isn't going to help much, if at all.  From my logs it really doesn't matter if I get those last 2 buffs (Shissar and Voice) to add 60ish AC, I seem to take the same damage either way.   Now in Sebilis the frogs just hit like girl scouts when I'm at 1400+ AC but thats not what is important in the high end game.<br />
<br />
And oh, .. did you have a tough time (you mega high AC shammies) convincing your guild to allow you in on the good AC stuff that might also be used by melees (ie. all/all items)? Usually is the case now presented to shamans that I know is this: &quot;It's gonna benefit a melee more than you, so you gotta wait till we equip our melees first, then you can have a crack at it cause we dont care anymore about it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Most of the high end shaman AC gear is going to be from NToV or other ubers.  And for the most part if you go for the higher AC stuff without going for high HP gear you can get quite alot without competition from the melee.<br />
<br />
Amulet of the Storm, Iron Scroll of War, Vambraces of Discontent, Shamanistic Boots (good luck getting these now), Onyx Chain Legs, Mithril Helm, Mithril Gaunts, Vindi BP, Mask of Terror...   melees don't go for those items for the most part, they got better stuff to go for.  You really are only competing with other priests and casters at worst, and sometimes just clerics for the chain class stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Step 1 Very Important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorgurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the input, y'all.  Jaradis, those items you mentioned, I'm hoping, will be more recognized as &quot;shaman&quot; items among my peers.  Kinda like back when people started seeing Fungi tunics and pretty much everyone wanted one, then later, people realized that Monks and Shamans should have priority.  It's just a level of understanding between classes that has to come around, I figure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

does your guild kill Yelinak?<br />
<br />
if so you might try to get his shield<br />
<br />
I wear it over my NTOV shield for the better resists and I get around 40 more hp than the NTOV shield too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the rumblecrush shield is awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dont know about the higher end Ac but my gear has Finally  reached the point where I can reach 1100 ac even in normal exp groups (I group with other lvl 60's a mostly).  I took a big leap because I got most of my Kael armor in pretty short period of time and I can at least say that the jump from 950ac to 1100ac in places like Seb is just mad. I can tank few unslowed mobs until I get them all sorted, lined up and slowed, and then Torpor myself.<br />
  I actually have started feeling angry  to rangers, rogues and other tank classes who immediately stop fighting the mob they are on and rush for help when they see I'm handling few adds because they think I'm in deep trouble. Now that I finally can tank some, I want to be able to show it off hehe.<br />
 1100ac at least for my playstyle seems to be very much enough. Now if I only could keep that Ac and still get those hitpoints I need soooo much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">From what I understand, the beleivers in the AC softcap (of which I am one) state that ALL classes have an AC softcap of 1250ish (against level 60+ mobs anyway).<br />
<br />
Only Melee can increase this softcap with the AA ability, Combat Stability.  Getting all three levels of Combat Stability increases the cap to somewhere between 1300-1350.<br />
<br />
IMO, having an AC like Jaradis or  Traktur is mostly pointless.  If you can hit 1250AC with Raid buffs, then by all means, gear up to your next favorite stat.<br />
<br />
Like Gloriana, I'm going for Hit Points, now that I can make my AC goal.<br />
<br />
p.s. Gloriana, faced with that decision, I kept my OoIV =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have many melee friends that would disagree with that soft cap being for them as well.  Even before the AA abilities warriors in my guild were saying that having 1500+ AC was much better than 1300 AC.  Many are at 1600+ AC now.<br />
<br />
As for shaman, I agree for us, 1250-1300 is about where the soft cap is.  Thus why I'm dropping AC to gain HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is why VI doesn't want to give us hard data.  I'm sure these threads of debate make for interesting reading for those that really KNOW ;)<br />
<br />
I don't play a tank class, so I don't even have anecdotal personal data for a warrior, but I know the tanks in my guild are leaning more and more towards HP as well.  <br />
<br />
Furor called the 25ac boots from Lord Seru &quot;Godly&quot; -- why, when there are boots with upwards of 40ac on them pretty easily available to a guild as motivated and talented as FoH?  Because they have 75 raw hit points (not to mention 30 stamina).  <br />
<br />
Do I think that Furor is right about everything?  Hardly.  But when all of FoH melee are dumping AC gear for HP gear, especially when my guilds tanks are doing the same thing, I think that says *something* about the end game and the importance of AC. /shrug<br />
<br />
Regardless, until Verant turns around and says &quot;listen, here is how it works...&quot;, which just isn't gonna happen, its all just speculation.  I'm not going to say you are wrong, because heck, you may well be right. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At the moment I'm pretty much all out HPs, my ac is respectable at 1038 unbuffed, but my hps are comparatively high compared to many shamans far more uber than myself (2009 unbuffed) and I'm pretty happy with it, self buffed I can tip the 1100 ac / 2500hp mark and yes being over that line does seem to help, but I wouldnt give up my hps for anything =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gloriana, have you taken a look at the Whitestone Shield from Aaryonar?<br />
<br />
AC39, +15 AGI, +100 HP.<br />
<br />
Assumably adds more AC over Wurms because of the AGI (if yours is not capped with DN/Cat), and +70 HP more. Of course, this is assuming that you have no real care for resists/mana at this point. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">bah **** about us ubar lizards! =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally I beleive in the softcap on ac but I don't think alot of people who propose it fully understand what they are seeing. Basically what I see is that there is a large gap in the abilities of mobs. You average sebilis frog is a lower lvl than you and with a much lower attack such that around 1200 1300 or what ever number you want to pick  as your cap is the point where it's so much above them that it doesn't make a large difference in thier ability to hit you when you increase your ac because they are only hitting the minimum anyway. On the other end of things you've got the Uber raid mobs with 1700attack and lvl 70+ it seems and your just so far below them that they will always hit no matter what. If you could get up to 2000ac or something rediculous like that you would begen to see large pay offs on ac but that type of ac is soo hard to get that its more worth while to just go for mass hps.<br />
<br />
Personally I've got 1119ac unbuffed and 2479 hps unbuffed and i'm trying to raise my hps more than I'm trying to raise my ac.<br />
<br />
Gloriana,<br />
I personally was never very big on the shield of wurms because of the low hps, no sta on it. Since we've only seen 2 of them drop in NToV so far it hasn't been hard for me to pass on them and I still don't have a shield of the wurms. Personally i was able to pick up a shield of holy vigor which is a great shield IMO. Another nice option is rumbles shield, just really pretty rare it seems.</div></div><hr />
