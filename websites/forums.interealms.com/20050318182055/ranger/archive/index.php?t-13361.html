<br />
Slot 1- DS component, therefore doesnt stack with the Warders + Forest Stalkers top buff (warders protection / protection of the wild).<br />
<br />
This bard song has to be one of the most powerful songs, and there is no reason a ranger shouldnt be able to get this effect on them also. I can't believe after all the time they've spent 'working' on the buff system it is still so flawed.<br />
<br />
Please make a fix for this which works Verant, and any other similar issues with classes long term buffs.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

They arent subject to these rules for just that reason.  They will stack fine, warders will have to be on before the song is on you, but the effects will add just fine.<br />

Dont trust lucy when it comes to the stacking of bard songs.  Lucy just compares numbers, and bards have thier own set of rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I have grouped with a bard, hence why I posted. <br />
<br />
Rest of my group was saying 'woo, 450MR'.. Mine was sat at 200MR, so i moved nearer to bard to check.. i asked if he was still singing it, he was and it wasnt stacking with anything.. only buff difference was Warders .. Lucy shows the stacking issue..<br />
<br />
Therefore they DONT stack in game, I wouldnt base a post around just lucys stacking data.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps one day Verant will realiaze their spell engine still has major issues. You also think they would run the numbers on every spell and catch the stacking stuff before we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It used to be that anything a bard would cast would stack regardless. They recently removed that ability and now bard songs are subject to normal stacking rules.<br />
<br />
This is the same reason why bards can't triple tash with J-stick and Orb of Tishan, and same reason why bard's can't stack another 10 points of DS on top of mage/druid DS with their Singing Steel Bracer. It was all nerfed.</div></div><hr />
