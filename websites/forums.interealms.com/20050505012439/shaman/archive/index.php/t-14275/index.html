Last night, I saw &quot;Shazzog is using OldYeller_01 as a Living Shield&quot; while fighting a MOb.<br />
<br />
Is this new with the patch?<br />
<br />
Level 44 pet, btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm, I'll have to start paying close attention (and making sure logs are on)<br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain I wasn't under 50% health...could well be wrong, though.<br />
<br />
It just seems unlikely, since I was with another shammy and we were both healing each other fairly frequently.<br />
<br />
Either way, I was quite stoked to see it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, this is not a brand new ability for dogdog from the 11June03 patch.  It has been in game for a few months now.<br />
<br />
In my experience, you don't have to be at &lt;50% health.  Generally speaking, dogdog positioning is the key to having this occur.  You have to be close alongside dogdog and have solid aggro.  The shield seems to take effect after a particularly heavy round of melee taken by dogdog's owner (us).  So if a mob CAN double attack/kick/bash, and gets all 4 to hit, that seems to trigger dogdog shielding more than a single hit and a few whiffs by the mob.  Please note, this is anecdotal evidence only, and I haven't taken any logs or done any analysis for this.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Interestingly enough I also had puppy gun dogs (spirit call) try to shield me on occasion as well as normal dogdog. <br />
<br />
I never really paid attention to when it happened, only that it usually involved a mob trying to rip my head off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you dont have to be under 50 pct but general u are when he shields but frekkels is right it happens when you are close to the mob and your health drops rapidly</div></div><hr />
