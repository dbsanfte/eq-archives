<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This coming saturday we need 3 good groups to hit CoM to complete Blumgan's Spear of Fate (Shaman Epic).  Following that, we are planning to hit Burning Woods to kill Ixblat Fer for Boro (a step in the cleric epic).  The Ixblat Fer step will probably require some additional people beyond the initial 3 groups.  Hope to see you there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've always wanted to see CoM anyway - never been there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I may be able to make this. It will depend on how my connection looks that day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">same answer as Lady V.<br />
<br />
It seems as soon as the 2 of us log in, we hog all of Adelphia's regional bandwidth and crash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One quick addendum,  in particular we will need at least one rogue with pick locks 201+ in order to be able to do the raid (only way to get into the castle and beyond).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blumgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fire pets would help greatly and yes you can bring your master too :D<br />
<br />
Thanks epic committee for posting this raid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well Lotsa is 47 and halfway through, if I could get a little help, I could easily get to 50+ for 201 lockpick.<br />
<br />
If not, Kilap can come as I actually don't work this weekend, yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>erolz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">assuming i can wake up by then, i should be able to make it. :)  after last night in Kael and who know what happens tonight...i may sleep in till 5pm  heh..<br />
<br />
After that, if anyones interested in a lil exp in BW or something, I would be up for that also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a class until noon on Saturdays  :(   but I can try to come....  <br />
<br />
Where and what time are we meeting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll be there for ya Blum. :) Now if we just happen to get a torch from Neh&quot;Ashiir that would be a bonus too. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I may have some work commitments but I'm hoping to be free</div></div><hr />

I really want to be there for both of you, but it will be impossible for me to attend at noon CST. I'm still working nights, and if I get up that early, I'll be the walking dead at work that night. I'll get up and help as I can before I have to log. Good luck, both.  I'll be there in spirit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gah ! I would love to come but it is my daughters 4 yr birthday party and there is nothing that would make me miss that she is adorable and mine after all !!<br />
<br />
I should be on later though and if all the raiding is done maybe we can do some serious exping in HS or Seb.</div></div><hr />
