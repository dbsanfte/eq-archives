<br />
From the thread started in the druids grove by Absor<br />
We are also looking at some changes to help to make clerics be a little more well-rounded, along with addressing some concerns put forth by druids and shamans.<br />
<br />
I wonder which &quot;concerns&quot; of ours they are going to look into?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iksars and Vah'Shir will now get unique bear form graphics, no doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe they will make rabid bear look like a werebear too! (Bears in GD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They realise that Alchemy is broken and double the cost of  the components for SoW/ITU/Ant/DS potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think VI will tread carefully when they look at the priest class(es).  They sure don't want one class to cross over into another's &quot;territory.&quot; Ex: Clerics with SOW, slow or snare, Druids with anything approaching CH or slow, Shamans with group port.<br />
<br />
Having said THAT I do think they can fix the little pis.sy things that have been broken for awhile:<br />
<br />
1) Alchemy. Prices of components and more importantly =&gt; SELL BACK PRICES. (C'mon guys, no one is getting rich off of this and why does a 10 shot potion sell back for less per potion than a single?)<br />
<br />
2) Shaman nukes / DOTS post Kunark. Envenomed Bolt should NOT be a 56+ Shaman primary spell dot. Which leads to point 3..<br />
<br />
3) Spell DROPS. Yes the population is gaining in levels, yes the game is older - but why in HALAS are Shaman Kunark spell drops so fubared?<br />
<br />
I mean when people are offering 150k for Torpor or Malo and there are NO takers that should be a clue.<br />
<br />
Two fixes:<br />
<br />
1) Put Malo on Juggs. Remove the current Malx that is a VENDOR spell you lazy programming FAWKS.<br />
<br />
2) A quest ala Can II. Ok...a WORKING quest ala CAN II. Ok...a WORKING...REASONABLE MOB SPAWN ala CAN II.<br />
<br />
Black Reaver essence + Jugg Sinew + Chardoki Herbalist nut sack.<br />
<br />
The above is REASONABLE.<br />
<br />
This is NOT:<br />
<br />
VS eye + Sev toe + Trak tooth + Talendor Wing + Drusilla bra and panties.<br />
<br />
Those three fixes would put to rest some long standing Shaman concerns. Yes you would admit to being 'wrong' so what.  <br />

<br />
As it is now, there is nothing I want to spend the 100's of hours trying to get.  I know alot of people say Canni5 is the way to go, but I only have 1950ish HPs buffed, so it is useless to me, and even if I got up to 2100ish HPs I still wouldn't feel safe using it during combat (and when I solo, the combat is constant, there is no downtime).<br />
<br />
I would like Mass Group Buff eventually (for the 1 or 2 raids I go on a week), but 9aa points (ie nearly 100 hours) is just too steep for me to work hard at it. I mean, I can cast MGB Khuras Focusing and hit all 5 groups, or i can cast it 4 times.  Not exactly alot of mana-savings there.<br />
<br />
Spell casting reinforcement (and mastery) would be cool except that I am at Full mana 90% of the time during a raid, and I am constantly rebuffing groups due to deaths, so the buffs very rarely go to duration and even when they do I have mana to redo.  If this worked with torpor (as it used to) I would be all for it, but i have been assured it no longer does.<br />
<br />
quick buff.... how usefull is this? only thing i can see as a benefit is reduced cast time on torpor.<br />
<br />
Alchemy mastery, Pet discipline aren't even worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear:  When i saw this I immediatly wanted it...  I am a melee shaman.  I know my damage output is pathetic, but it's how I am.  this looked like it would fix my problem, make me usefull in melee... then i found out it lasts only like 5 min. what a waste.  So i'm gonna spend 50 hours to buy this skill so that i  can melee for 5 min once every 2 hours? If this worked until zone it would probably be too good, but that's what i wish it was, then I would want to buy it again.<br />
<br />
It seems that we got screwed, and I hope someone besides me speaks up so that maybe verant does something.  We weren't alone in the screwing either, mages and clerics got screwed too.  I'm going to have to say thats ok though, since 80% of the game seems to revolve around having 5 clerics together doing a CH cycle, and Mages already have the highest sustained DPS.  Every other class got some nifty feature (dire charm, Life/mana burn).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quick Buff affects a lot more than you think.  It'll not just work on torpor  and stat buffs, but also spells like invis, shrink, etc.   <br />
<br />
Before you ask yourself, &quot;So what?&quot; let me explain further.  I don't have an enhancment haste item (1 piece away from Emp ring), but do have Djarn's Ring (Spell Haste effect) for 15% on level 44 spells and under which does affect root, shrink, invis, etc.   With QB1 (currently working on QB2) and Djarn's, I cast invis in 3.8 seconds.  To me, that's a huge bonus.   5 seconds to cast invis normally,  is long, especially if treading through dangerous territory.  Any help casting it faster, is a bonus.  QB3, however, is useless if you have a casting enhancement item, since there's a 50% cap.  On the bright side, that'll be 9 points you won't have to worry to cough up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not entirely true, because your enhancement haste 3 item DOES NOT effect Torpor, due to the duration of the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and add to it teleport, ressurect, CH and other nifty spells. Oh snare and stun too. I want to be the only healer on the raid and still heal the MT vs the AoW. /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
I want a heal that is like the druid level 60 heal. I have no problem in druids getting a better one.<br />
<br />
I want Healing Adept AA skill to be useful.<br />
I want Critical Healing AA skill to be useful.<br />

<br />
... rezzing, of course! :D <br />
<br />
Seriously though, except for the droods (as opposed to druids) I don't think anyone is asking for heals close to that of a cleric. I do think there's something very wrong when I can't think of many situations where my 60 shaman (w/o torpor) would make a better healer than my 40 cleric. It's sad when I chain heal and can't keep a cleric or enchanter alive against some unslowed mob hitting for around 200 a pop. I'll never get a chance to try this but I'd love to see how my lvl 40 cleric with KEI, Focus and Aego would do in HoT keeping a group alive. Even assuming full damage from AoE every time I'm in range, I still bet it would be easier than with Thurdar. CH, Sup. Heal and a group heal &gt; Chloroblast and faster mana regen. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the best answer is, personally, I'd like to see druids get a 60th lvl direct heal with a 3:1 ration (1200pts/400mana?), clerics get one a bit better than that, and shaman get a heal over time with a 4.5:1 ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wouldn't mind having the Shaman AA Healing Enhancement effect actually work on Torpor. (+HP/Tick based on skill.) It should work with regeneration too... perhaps +1 HP/Tick per skill level.<br />
<br />
Else, I can't think of a single reason for a Torpor-Equipped Shaman to want to bother with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't think heailng gift 3 is useless for shamans. It's very nice on mobs that you can't rely solely on CH (like Vyemm) to keep the tanks up. It also helps a ton on Avatar of War and Tunare (assuming a few shamans/druids are casting chloro with healing gift). <br />
<br />
Most druids I've talked to don't use the 880 heal on raids, because it sucks down mana too fast, and it's slower cast. So druids are using chloroblast just like us on raids.<br />
<br />
If the healing change goes live (removing 10% penalty) I'll be crit healing for 850ish, instead of the current 770. I could also later put points into adept and crit heal for over 900.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The above is REASONABLE.<br />
<br />
Cann II is a level 39 spell. Even that isnt reasonable because no 39th level shaman will be fighting juggs, or black reavers, or deep Chardok mobs.<br />
<br />
I think they thought they made the quest level-appropriate because they put the items on mobs in Kaesora, Trak's Teeth, etc...but even a level 50 shaman would need help to do the quest as it is now (or was, when I did it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm.  the discrepency there is that engineers and computers calculate gigabytes using binary, but marketing folks use decimal...<br />
<br />
that being the case, chloroblast should be healing about 400.  (385*1.024*1.024)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The AA healing skills need tweaking.<br />
<br />
Healing Adept does 2%, 5%, and 10% more healing from levels 1 (2 points), 2 (4 points), 3 (6 points). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, for shamans (and probably druids although they have nature's touch) this skill is only a marginal improvement.<br />
<br />
10% of chloroblast (our only direct healing spell) will be 470 (after penalty is removed). A boost of ~42 hps. Not much considering it costs 12 AA points to achieve.<br />
<br />
This skill should be 5%, 15%, 25%. (Would make the druids happier too). Even then, it makes chloroblast a heal of only 535.<br />
<br />
Healing Gift also needs work. A 10% chance to crit doesn't really cut the mustard for another 12 AA points. Would be better to make it a 10% chance for the spell to be an instant cast or something. Or boost the percentages as above to 5%, 15%, 25%, as above.<br />
<br />
Should be a specialized skill for shamans and druids to cast a &quot;manaburn&quot; heal. All your mana for 2x or 2.5x the amount of hps. Eg: Tank's going to die, hit manaburn, full mana bar heals 5k HPs or something. Refreshed every hour or so. Kind of like a once-an-hour ch for the non-clerics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lay of Hands doesn't use any mana, and completely heals the target. What Darjeeling is suggesting is a heal that can be used once and hour that will heal for twice the amount of mana you have. So if your're at 40% mana it's not going to be as effective as being at full mana. Plus you'll be OOM so you'll be twiddling your thumbs for a while until you get some back. <br />
<br />
The only change I'd like is a doable quest for our rare spells (Malo &amp; Torpor) Some thing that a person can work at over a peopid of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">For a soloing shaman I think rabid bear is good.. so here's my 2cp on revaming the shaman class:<br />
<br />
1) Make Alchemy as useful as Jewcraft - it costs as much to master. I was rather annoyed when it was missed from the new quests that require all the tradeskills.. I don't have skills in other tradeskills as I have spent my plat and time in Alchemy, it being special to the shaman class and all.<br />
1a) Remove thurg gate potion - people can use stones or shammie gate potions..<br />
1b) Make C2 potions and make them sellable.<br />
1c) Make the stats potion sellable.<br />
1d) Too late now, but have different spheres of alchemy where only one can be mastered. Make some potions require more than one sphere to encourage alchemy trade.<br />
2) Do something with the bane/pox drops - like a quest. Put e-bolt on another bracer - druids have dots on most pieces of armour.<br />
3) Change SS/kael BPs to cast brute (druids get PotG..)<br />
4) Create a group HoS for level 53/54..<br />

<br />
Act of Valor kills the paladin, and heals the target equal to however many hit points the paladin had when it was activated.<br />
<br />
Lay on Hands heals 2550ish hp normally at 60, and if the paladin gets the Improved LoH AA skill that changes to 11000 or so.</div></div><hr />

 1) Make Alchemy as useful as Jewcraft - it costs as much to master. <br />
<br />
Got 250 JC on my Enchanter for 1300 pp or so.  Anyone care to hazard how far they'd get in alchemy for 1300pp?<br />
<br />
1a) Remove thurg gate potion - people can use stones or shammie gate potions.<br />
<br />
erm no. Thurg gate potions are used in a quest. What you probably mean to say is re-write the quest so a sub-component of said quest doesn't interfere with your market.<br />
<br />
I would counter and say - make gate potions cost much less to make and sell back for more.<br />
<br />
 1b) Make C2 potions and make them sellable. <br />
<br />
Oh they'd be sellable if they didn't cost so much to make. (Notice an Alchemy theme here?)<br />
<br />
 1c) Make the stats potion sellable. <br />
<br />
Would require a re-code of the game. Stats mean very little. From 100 to 255 STR is about what?...+7% damage? <br />
<br />
1d) Too late now, but have different spheres of alchemy where only one can be mastered. Make some potions require more than one sphere to encourage alchemy trade. <br />
<br />
You have obviously put more thought into this than the coding monkeys. In the military we'd call you a 'deep thinker' (And no - I'm not being malicious)<br />
<br />
 2) Do something with the bane/pox drops - like a quest. Put e-bolt on another bracer - druids have dots on most pieces of armour. <br />
<br />
Ok  - 1) Fawk Druids. 2) The first half of your suggestion is again - deep thinking. What would be nice is the suitcases - er Iksar could benefit depending on the type of armor.<br />
<br />
Some very good ideas. Boils down to a couple of themes:<br />
<br />
1) Alchemy is Fubared. Cost vs Reward.<br />
2) Spell drops are Fubared. Time vs Reward</div></div><hr />

1a) Remove thurg gate potion - people can use stones or shammie gate potions..<br />
- Yes that will address the many issues with shamans like DoT resists, stackability on raids, weak pet, useless stat buffs, better DD ...<br />
<br />
1c) Make the stats potion sellable.<br />
- Yes the already useless AGI buff comes in the form of a bottle now. Yay! Where do I sign up? Damn I need a CHA potion!<br />
<br />
1d) Too late now, but have different spheres of alchemy where only one can be mastered. Make some potions require more than one sphere to encourage alchemy trade.<br />
- How about ugh ... making potions actually useful other than DS potions. You gonna have improved AGI potions now! Twice as useless as the original!<br />
<br />
2) Do something with the bane/pox drops - like a quest. Put e-bolt on another bracer - druids have dots on most pieces of armour.<br />
- Bane/Pox as a quest? How about really fixing our goddamn spell drops? And just what we need, more mana free damage. But hey, putting EBolt on a bracer will sure fix the resist rates on our DoTs.<br />
<br />
3) Change SS/kael BPs to cast brute (druids get PotG..)<br />
- No they don't, druid SS/KD BP cast Regrowth of the Grove.<br />
<br />
Lay off the druid has this, druid has that and for that we should get this and we should get that class envy stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>TetrianBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I agree, fawk druids, however, that dot on our armor is called drones of doom, and its hardly comparable with ebolt - actually the shaman equal would be Venom of the snake, and thats even being generous about it  - just consider yourself lucky you got a Jbb instead.<br />
<br />
As for spell quests on the dots, merchant would be more in line imo - most of the main DDs we get is off merchants, same should go for the of the shaman dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">That's true, drones only does about 300 dmg total over a minute or so.  Not really that significant and most 60 druids don't bother sticking it on in a group.  Waste of time spent clicking.  <br />
<br />
Ebolt on a bracer sounds nice and fine to me, but it'll be on something in Vex Thal if it does happen, which is a zone only a few will ever see due to excessive time sinks and uberness levels needed to get there.  Basically if you could get the item, you'll be so burnt out by the time you actually DO that you will probably ebay the next week.  <br />
<br />
Gathu . . . thanks for clearing that up.  I guess LoH is a level dependent heal like the SK Harmtouch is a level dependent nuke.  I knew it was something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Did someone just seriously compare drones and Ebolt!?  Whoa..Never thought I'd see the day!<br />
<br />
Really, try to sway *away* from Druid comparisons.  It's hard not to, because like Shaman they're a 'lesser-priest class', and the only other one in game.  However, Druid's made a lot of comparisons to Shaman, and look what it got them:  PoTC, and a personalized quest.  While I wanna see Sunmoon the NPC as much as the rest of you, it's a little less than 'caster balancing'.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't play a high enough Shaman, nor have I played long enough to have a great understanding of the class.  But I agree with most here.  Fix alchemy, bear form, and drop that damn nuke component for DoT's.  I'd also like to see a Cold based DoT for Shaman.  It'd be something new, and it seems like something that would fit right in with Shaman spells.  Maybe a bump in nuking power, too.</div></div><hr />

dont the iksars already have their own bear form, like black instead of white or brown bear and no Bubba Gump lower lip? :)</div></div><hr />

Why they dont make all the bears have cute lips instead of skoal bandit lips, is a mystery.</div></div><hr />

Haha that is great!  Now I can change my mood from &quot;angry&quot; bear to &quot;cute&quot; bear at will :)<br />
<br />
By now most my friends know to stay away from the lower lip, it has a mean temper and mystical powers.</div></div><hr />
