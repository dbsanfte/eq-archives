<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I got a bit of a computer problem that I am looking for some advise to fix :confused: . The problem is, I got a new computer system. It is an AMD 1400, with 512 meg memory, SB Live, and Geforce 2 MX200 64 meg video.<br />
<br />
My problem, that I need some help on is, between the motherboard bois and Windows ME, all my cards got dumped to IRQ 5. Video, sound, USB control (Built into motherboard), and ethernet (Also built into motherboard)  are all IRQ 5.<br />
<br />
You see the problem, EQ won't run :(. I tried moving the sound card to all the other slots, no help.<br />
<br />
Anyone got some advice as to how I can change the IRQs? According to EQ tech help, if I move either video or sound, I should be ok, but preferably, both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like they are not PnP devices. Or motherboard/OS does not detect them as being such, well anyway....<br />
<br />
Go into your device manager and just manually assign the irqs.<br />
<br />
Right click my computer.. properties.. device manager. Might want to see what is assigned to each irq first before you start assigning them. But from there it is pretty self explanatory on changing them.<br />
<br />
1 thing I would recomend is dumping ME, that OS sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lathyrnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure about your other problems, but if you play EQ I would get rid of that MX200 ASAP.  Why?  Cause it is a total piece of crap.  Pretty much, it is the Chevy Metro of GeForce2 cards.  In other words, it's a stripped down, cheapo version of a GeForce 2.  In fact, it's a stripped down version of another stripped down card, the MX400.  What I am trying to say is, that card sucks and it needs replacing.  Here are some options:<br />
1) Geforce 2 Ti (maybe $100)<br />
2) Radeon 7500 (again, maybe $100)<br />
3) Geforce 3 Ti200 (maybe $150)<br />
4) Geforce 3 Ti500 (around $250)<br />
5) Radeon 8500 (around $160 or so)<br />
6) Geforce 4 Ti4400 (around $300)<br />
7) Geforce 4 Ti4600 (around $400)<br />
<br />
Now, although it is much less expensive than the Geforce 3 Ti500, the Radeon 500 is about neck and neck in performance with it, and used to cost the same until the Geforce 4 cards came out just a month ago or so.  It is what I am currently saving up for to replace my MX400</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to your BIOS (when you boot your PC)<br />
Look for a setting like: &quot;Plug and Play OS&quot;, set it to No, or OFF.<br />
<br />
And use another OS that the POS Window$ ME.</div></div><hr />
