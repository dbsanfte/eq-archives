<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rishathra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’m returning to EQ after being gone for a year. Being in Europe at the moment and being on for only a few hours at a time, I’ve been soloing my troll shammy, who was fresh into 49 when I came back. Did DSP to get through 50. Did HHK nobles for half a level, but wasn’t fun – too much downtime, and frustrating killing 2 greens for every blue mob. Did Stormwatcher in Dulak’s Harbor for first half of 51, pretty pleased, but there was some camp competition there<br />
<br />
Decided to look at old-world and decided on Lower Guk – an old favorite from soloing both my cleric and my SK through the early 50s years ago. <br />
<br />
Camp is basically anything north of the “Safe Hall” (pos830, neg730). You’ll get some light blues at 51, but most of the stuff north and east is dark blue, the darker the further away you get. At 51 I cleared everything up to the Ghoul Lord. Taking the Reanimated hand was cake; Archmagi was a bit more exciting (lost pet due to poor timing), but if you take Archmagi with close to FM you should be OK. Didn’t get Frenzy, but expect he wouldn’t be too hard. Did try Ghoul Lord, but couldn’t pull without getting all three – would suggest you skip him. (I killed him, but had to gate.)<br />
<br />
Exp was good. In Dulak’s I’d get about five blue an hour; here I was getting about 7 blue an hour. Mobs hit fast, but not especially hard – once slowed they are cake, and Fluffy can absorb the damage from 2 mobs easily after slowing. When you get three mobs or more (which will happen) it gets trickier, but still not hard, you just have to pay more attention. Being oldworld, the mobs don’t have a lot of HP – slow, envenomed bolt, a click of the JBB, and between that and fluffy they’d be just about dead.<br />
<br />
You will need decent AC. Having 2-3 mobs on you, especially just north of the safe hall, is pretty common; don’t panic, just channel through the beating. If you need to, root and back off to slow, and then you’ll be OK. I did this with AC894, self-buffed with HOS; Virtue can help if you are a bit short in the AC/HP department.<br />
<br />
Some sort of regen is good here – you are constantly going to need to top off from mobs, not to mention Canni. I had a fungi. An ikky regen BP would probably be OK, but Chloroplast alone won’t be enough.<br />
<br />
KEI and canni-dance should be sufficient – generally you’ll be using just two spells per mob in, and many times one (just slow) on the light blues or singles;  I did have a manastone that I borrowed from my smith, and while I used it, I didn’t use it very much – usually just when I saw I was close to 100% health. So didn't save too much time from using an insta-clicky rather than casting a spell.<br />
<br />
To get to the hunting area, make a batch of potions of unlife awareness (trivial 42). Whack the live frogs at entrance, swig, and head off. Will probably need to fight the vampire bats and swig another potion there. You can easily fight your way in, but why waste the time?<br />
<br />
Loot is not too good – I got about 250 plat worth in two hours, compared with about 1500pp worth in Dulak’s Harbor for three hours (plus no chance for a nifty charm like in Dulak’s). But if you don’t care about loot, exp is good.<br />
<br />
The layout also is tricky. I lived here for about  6-8 levels on two other characters, so I’m comfortable  with running all over the place. If you’ve never been there before, it may be worth trying Zoneexplorer.<br />
<br />
The one real  fly in the ointment is the “A Corrupted Gnome” for the Illusion Guktan spell. His spawn point is the pit at pos1074, neg750, near the safe area outside the Archmagi. Extremely magic resistant. When I saw nothing was landing and that I couldn’t heal Fluffy long enough to take him I gated out and brought in my 65 SK to clear him. So I’d suggest parking a higher-level toon near the pit, and if the placeholder spawns (a frog), just leave him be; if the gnome pops, use your toon to whack him and get back to killing. If you don’t have good balance on the pit trap, it  will cut your hunting grounds in half if you don’t deal with the gnome. (If he is up I will try him later with a debuff and see if that helps enough to solo him.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, that’s my experience trying LGUK. It’s worth revisiting if all you want is exp and you aren’t concerned about loot.<br />
