<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
So I zone into Dulak Harbor. (about 6 corpses right at zoneline WOW!)<br />
Send off an LFG message, and wait a min.  Soon I get a tell asking if I wanted to group with 2 Rangers that were about my level.  I thought to myself; sure, 2 melee's plus my doggie and my casting will be a great thing!  Holycow, was I wrong.  Do we normally have better ac than rangers?  I swear that I could have been a tougher MT than they were!  Please dont get me wrong,  I'm not an EQ snob (heck, I'm only level 46, and still learning the game!!), but I was under the impression that ALL melee types were better tanks than us.  Am I wrong?  Did I just get into a poorly equipped group?  I didn't mind grouping with them, and they were nice peeps to group with, but I was unprepared for thier class shortcommings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Branoic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">note first that im pre 60.. so things might change...<br />
<br />
Rangers as a group suck... sorry but thats just how it is atleast on my server. It seems that post monk nerf all monks made rangers and still play like monks.. they do not controll agro blah blah blah...<br />
<br />
with soso ranger gear my pet(49th dog) can out agro and absorb damage better than a 49 ranger. though im working to resolve this rangers gear issues since is a rl friend..<br />
<br />
However that said a ranger can be an aswome MT. one of my favorite grouping partners is a 59 ranger that has spent the money/time to properly equip herself with some of the best purchasable gear and some nice quested/nodrop stuff.<br />
<br />
Basicly if you duo/group with a ranger.. expect them to be equvilant to your pet untill you get to know them.. even the good 59 ranger still only has about 2.5k hp and 1kish ac unbuffed but can output an asome amount of damage..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rangers without decent gear can really suck.  Rangers with decent gear really rock.  <br />
<br />
I've grouped with rangers when I was younger who believe that WIS was their primary stat and dressed accordingly.  It was funny to see a ranger wearing dr00d gear.  I mean, they get chain but she was wearing a goddam FOREMAN's TUNIC and plat armbands for the love of Pete!  LOL I couldn't help laughing.  There i was in my &quot;uber&quot; Totemic and was about twice the tank she was.  I think the group forbid her to draw aggro after the first couple times she almost died.  <br />
<br />
Long story short . . it really does depend on the ranger.  They can really rock or really really suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK thanks guys.<br />
Again please, I hope no one thinks that I was being rude to the class, it seems like a kinda neat class.  I just thought that they could absorb a little more damage than they did.  Maybe thier gear just needed a few tweeks.  As I stated before, they were cool peeps to group with (attitude wise), and thats the most important thing to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Couple things to remember.<br />
<br />
1) Rangers are a chain class also. They aren't a plate class so don't have access to much different gear that different from what we do.<br />
<br />
2) Thier defense still should be capped at the same point ours is at that lvl so that doesn't give them any better ac.<br />
<br />
3) rangers have tanken up a roll as more of a support damage deal roll in groups and make gear choices based on that. IE more str/dex gear less ac gear.<br />
<br />
So they may not have more ac than you do depending on thier gear lvl and choices. They do how ever have high dodge cap, parry and reposte skills that we don't have have at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a ranger and a shaman I can say that all rangers don't suck.  With a shaman slower in a group I can tank as a 59 ranger just fine in most places in tier 1 PoP.  Sure we don't have very good hps, but all that means is you have to adjust your healing routine.  I can get aggro when needed that no shaman can pull from me.  That means the shaman can slow the MoB on inc, and not worry about getting beat down on a resist.<br />
<br />
Rangers can also shed agrro if they don't want it.  With a tank in the group the ranger becomes a very efficient damage dealer.  Doing better damage than a similarly lvled warrior and increasing from there. <br />
<br />
When things goes wrong we are better to have around than a monk or rogue.  We can root MoBs away from combat, or taunt MoBs off the cleric/enc/shaman.  All rogues can do is evade/hide and monks can fd.<br />
<br />
That said, there are bad members of every class.  You might have run into a couple of knucklehead rangers. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rgol The Greatspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since the nerf of the monk I switched to dueing with rangers. I think they make the best due partners because they get the druid line spells that we lack, like skin's and snare. They can take a hit after I slow with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm better off tanking than the ranger.  With torpor (or stoicism, what have you), I can cheap heal myself, and lay on enough dots to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
It's barely possible to keep a well-equipped ranger partner alive in tier1 pop.  I wouldn't even consider trying in tier2.  Maybe after I get Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The quality of a ranger, or any other class for that mater, depends on both the skill of the player and the gear they have managed to acquire.  The friend I group with duel boxes a ranger and a cleric.  The two make a great team.  Add my haste and slows into the mix and we do really well.  The ranger is an awesome player.  He’s a skilled puller, he’s great at rooting any adds and is completely dependable when it comes to pulling mobs off casters.  He’s also managed to acquire incredible gear to back him up.  Yes, a warrior could take a lot more damage than a ranger, but he or she couldn’t do the dozen or so other valuable services that a ranger can perform.  For example, the ranger always snares the mobs.  Because of this I never have to worry about being attacked for slowing it.  In fact, I can usually slow the mob and drop a couple of DOTs on it and still be able to sit down.  Sometimes this will cause the mob to slowly walk my way, but if I stand back up it returns to hitting on the ranger.  A few seconds later I can sit without any worries. <br />
<br />
I’m having a great time with our little group and I’ve never leveled faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rangers can easily duo non-stop in the tier three planes with a shammie with enough AA and malo\Torpor\Q.  Throw in PoFire also, and I am still working on the other elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think it's usually the other players, not the rangers, who suck in situations like this.<br />
<br />
Rangers do not tank like warriors.  Big deal, isn't that well known?<br />
<br />
So, you have to adjust your approach a bit in those situations.  Yet time and again people don't do that, and still express wonderment that rangers &quot;suck&quot;.  They don't suck at all, and gear alone does not make or break a ranger.  <br />
<br />
Duoing with rangers owns.  They are a great class for shaman to partner with at those levels.  You need to figure out how to make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey guys,<br />
Thanks for &quot;kicking&quot; the misconceptons of what a ranger was, outta my head.  In my lack of experiance with them, I had a bad game plan.  From now on I'll look at them as more than a tank, a play accordingly. I really appreciate the constuctive help. Good Journies to you all!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rangers are my favorite Exp group tank, they can hold agro ver well, allowing for missed slows and heavy dot loading without losing agro.<br />
<br />
A ranger who wants to tank must by necessity be very ac and hp gear oriented.  Even then they will never be the best choice for high end raid mobs, they just dont have the hitpoints and mitigation of the plate classes.<br />
<br />
Awhile back Rangers were given animal only fear at lvl 22.  This has contributed to a generation of shaman that don't take many hits after lvl 22, as they are fear kiting animals til the mid 50's or even higher.  These folk should not try and tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your average pickup ranger is some jackass with a chain shirt, mediocre weapons, and a bucket on his head. He stands behind the mob, hits attack, jolt and nuke. Occasionally he remembers to snare. He is basically as usefull as having a second average warrior in the group, until he gets aggro, in which case you wish you had taken the second warrior. The class doesnt cater to random schmucks. It IS possible to have a ranger be a very useful addition to the group. Its just you notice a mediocre ranger more than a mediocre mage.<br />
<br />
Unless I know the ranger, I rarely take one. I rarely take a second tank. I would prefer a mage, bl, rogue etc. My experiences with joe average have taught me to expect the unimpressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">rangers aren't tanks, they are damage dealers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rangers.  I *love* rangers.<br />
<br />
There are two ways that you can duo with a ranger.  In the first situation, he takes all agro and you apply damage.  This works well enough, but you need to have a ranger with superb gear to do this in Tier2 planes.<br />
<br />
The second approach, the one I prefer, is to have the SHAMAN take all damage and hold agro with poison based DoTs.  Then the ranger stands back and hammers the target with arrows.  This works alot better because a) the negative effects of Torpor are meaningless to me, since I am a caster and used to it to boot and b) the ranger can do ridiculous amounts of damage, non-stop, forever.<br />
<br />
It isn't really a question of who can tank better, its a question of what resources do you have available to you and how quickly the experience will roll in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rangers are as good as the player itself is. A ranger with good gear and a lot of AAs is one powerful thing.  However, there are rangers out there who are very poor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sure a monk can break a spawn, but a ranger can gain agro quick, as well as a shadow night. those two classes, if I am grouped with, I generally don't worry at all about gaining hate, if the player knows what he/she is doing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Glad to see so many defending rangers.  You've pointed out the features of the Ranger I like the most.  Being able to keep aggro quickly and consistently means I can slow and dot immediately when pulling.  Rangers tank slowed mobs very well in my opinion, and high damage output means the mob dies fast.  Snare is also incredibly useful.  Almost all of their buffs stack; my shaman adds over 600 hp to my ranger with Talisman of Kragg and Stamina buffs, and my ranger can give me an additional 250 hp with 2/tick regen, helping with cann.<br />
<br />
I can't think of an overall better melee partner for a shaman, but I bet in special situations there would be more effective choices.  Lower hp and no stuns means casters can be a problem, but resist buffs usually help with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where to begin with this lol... First off this is imposable. Why becuse it is game code that a mob will always hit a PC over a npc and yes pets are npc's. Provideing the PC is standing with in the mob's mele range, has actully done damage, and the mob is not rooted. Root can be over come by the PC moveing a bit closer to the mob.<br />
<br />
Has for the pet out tanking. The ranger would have to have totaly sorry gear. Has in a full set of banded at lv50. And / or was PLed in such a fasion that his defencive skill's where ungodly low. PLing is the only way I could see this happening.<br />
<br />
Rangers are not tanks, at higher lvs with good gear and a skilled player they can do ok. But for the most part thire HP's/ AC is very simular to our own. A skilled ranger is very good DPS. And can take or not take aggro has needed. If the ranger can not controll his aggro one way or another then he sucks and simply dosent know how to play the class. With the exseption of snar resists causeing extra aggro and certin mobs that just seem to hate rangers.<br />
<br />
The first char I played was a ranger. When RoK first released the ranger class was BADDLY broken and VI at the time showed no intentions of fixing them. In fact they strongly denighed that anything was wrong with them. By lv55 I became very flustrated with the ranger class and I had started to play my lil lizared shammy more and more. I enjoyed my shammy and that enjoyment grew. Next thing I know Snugg is 50 then 55 then 60 ect and I had changed my main to him. Sony has made meny improvements to the ranger class. And in about 100 more AA's on Snugg I will start to play my ranger agine. They are a powerfull class in thire own rights but it depends on one thing. The person behind the keyboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Rangers sure can be a great class to have with you, although its true they aren't plate tanks.  As with any class that takes skill to play, there are a large number of people who don't have the skill but play anyway.<br />
<br />
Just a note on dogdog vs. a player tanking:  I'd always rather have a player tank over my dog, but one thing I have noticed is that Fido, especially TS, regens at an insane rate.  If you get too used to this, it may seem as though the player needs heals more - he does.  If you end a fight with TS at 50% you know he'll be at 100% by the time you get back with the next pull, but players will need those heals hehe)  Players do, however, have more hp's than dog, more ac, more dps, etc.  Even a ranger in a foreman's tunic. (Land I nearly spit soda on my monitor reading that LOL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Shandrillar, what others have expressed in the thread is very accurate.  It takes a skilled player to play a ranger to the fullest.  This is the same with most any class.  This involves knowing what armor to wear, what accessories to get, what weapons to use, what spells to use, etc.<br />
<br />
Looking at your level you're only level 46 and are possibly encountering genuine inexperienced rangers or rangers that are twinks that have been powerleveling by fearkiting.  They gain very little skills this way and really have little experience in grouping.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a common misconception that has trickled down from 'uber guilders' saying that rangers are only DPS and that's it.  That's totally false and thinking of a ranger that way isn't doing them justice.<br />
<br />
A well played ranger can tank, do damage, heal, crowd control, etc.<br />
<br />
I oughta know.  My main is a level 65 ranger that has tanked from level 1 to level 65.  Up until Planes of Power I had collected equipment that usually let me have more hps than most warriors.  Now that warriors and knights have Planar Durability there's a bit of an unfair advantage hp-wise.  I still tank mobs in Tier 3 planes without any problems because I've tailored my AAs for Tanking and DPS both.<br />
<br />
Typically when a well played, well equipped ranger has problems tanking the blame is not on them.. it's on the healer/slower.  Knowing when to heal is key for any healing class.  Most healers fail at being a good healer because they only know how to heal warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It could very well have been me.  As I stated earlier,  this was my first time grouping with only Rangers.  As for my sucking (Rokkeb), I'll certainly admitt that I'm still learning the ropes.  Shandrilar is my main, and I'm seeing many of these mobs for the first time.  I get alot of advise from these boards (for that I am eternally gratefull), but I think that I am a fairly decent player for my experiance level and time put in game.  I didn't mean to accuse Rangers of &quot;sucking&quot;, and I don't think I ever said they did.  I was just trying to find out what to expect from them.  The fault was mine, and I appologise if I offended anyone here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SKs are massively better pullers now than monks.  Rangers used to be premier pullers outdoor, but the harmony nerf killed that.  <br />
<br />
Rangers come in two flavours:  Rangers, and second rate warriors with some druid spells.  The latter type is easily identifyable by the fact that they have zero aggro control, scream &quot;weapon shield!&quot; every 72 minutes, and generally have no idea what they are doing.  The former type is a death dealing, aggro control, crowd control machine, and a true joy to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I agree, almost always the player, not the class.  I group with paladins, shadow knights and rangers as MT from my guild in XP groups and every one of them does a fantastic job.  I can slow a mob on the INC message and never ever get agro.  As soon as Im in a pickup group with any of the same 3 classes, I will have agro on almost every pull unless I wait to land slow, its rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually, we have a new Harmony of Nature spell that I think works better than the old Harmony. I can pull PoS giants all day as singles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting.  I knew about the new Harmony of Nature spell, but my admitedly limited experience with it leaves me thinking that &quot;Harmony&quot; was better.  Apart from a few mobs that were &quot;Harmony immune&quot;, Harmony was very much superior.  Unresistable, AE, 2 minute duration.  What's the resist rate on HoN like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Resist on the new Harmony (Hamony of Nature) is very low.  Much less than 1% from my estimation.  I've only had two resists with it ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I play 61 ranger/61 Shaman on the same account.  Both are well equipped.  My ranger is the class I've always loved, but lately I haven't played him much, because he can shout lfg for hours while my shaman gets groups in 2.3 minutes.<br />
<br />
What I've found is that rangers should not tank any slowed or unslowed mobs that hit for 350+.  They have weak dodge, parry, riposte, and most importanly hit points.  This is Verant's plan, they don't want non-plate classes to tank, so forget about rangers when it comes to tanking, if you have a ranger as MT in a group, then your cleric will get pissed off and your group will be inefficient.  <br />
<br />
What rangers can do:<br />
<br />
1. Track (yipee, this is over-rated trust me)<br />
2. Pull singles outdoors faster than monks (harmony nerf hurt this a bit)<br />
3. Deal about 80% of monk damage, maybe 85% using nukes mixed in.<br />
4. Best attack buffs in game (this is important in exp groups)<br />
5. Deal massive archery damage on an hourly basis with 45 aa points.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say the ranger class is probably the most fun to play but terribly weak in terms of group desireability.  This is probably the way Verant wants it.  Things will get much worse when Verant implements the archery agro nerf, you might see rangers quitting in droves that day.<br />
<br />
As for me, I'll probably push my shaman to 65 now, simply because he is terribly valuable and will get me access to places my ranger is unwanted.  Sad to say, but true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well it been said before  but depends on the Ranger.<br />
<br />
I myself love ranger groups.  In fact I do great with nothing but all rangers in places like HoH, BoT.<br />
<br />
Rangers pull(single pull since they are outdoor zones), snare then I root, slow (saftey factor), Dot with level 64, 65 dots (no root breaking woot!) and massive Arrow fire.   I do quite well in this type of group.  Hardly if ever need to heal.  Mobs are snared and slowed if root breaks, just have to have mana to keep up with the rangers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still any Ranger can do this without AM just have to work a bit harder at it.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen! My 62 ranger tried tanking Nadox yesterday and that didnt last long (he is only partially slowable and quads for 414 max hehe). But it looked like he did about as well as our 62 beastlord who also died. Next try we had our 60 warrior tank and that went much much better.<br />
<br />
I duo the ranger and and shaman so the way I play my ranger is a bit unusual I guess. I dont think he has fired an arrow the last couple of levels. He tanks all the mobs &quot;in teh face&quot;. After I have learned to use his discipline Weaponshield he hasnt died duoing. Rangers ability to gain aggro fast is really useful when playing like I do.<br />
<br />
Oh, he also doesnt have a single AA point yet and with the upcoming nerf of ranger archery I am quite pleased that he never started getting those AA points. When I start getting AAs with my ranger it will be things like CS, CA and ND first.<br />
<br />
Rangers are very flexible - you just have to decide how you want to play them and stick to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Molen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hello there all.  This is my first post here as I just found this web sight.  I just recently created a Shaman and as of now he is lvl 21.  My main, however, Is a level 60 Ranger so I must give a little insight here.<br />
<br />
    Ranger is a popular class but is a somewhat more diffcult melee class to play properly imho.  Thus what you have is several Rangers skiping around thinking that they are tanks (and thus act like warriors with nifty little spells to impress thier friends) or that they are NOT tanks (thus have no clue how to tank when they have too).... but in fact a little of both is true for the Ranger.<br />
<br />
     The fact is that I have tanked in PoN, PoD, PoI, and even PoV with little problem and with the main healer a Shaman.  In fact my good Shaman friend (Winsome Lvl 63 Shaman) prefers that I tank over a warrior (only privately because the warrior will always tank over a ranger in high lvl groups) because I can hold aggro from the mob no matter what spells she cast.<br />
<br />
     My gear is mostly AC / HP orientated.  I have some gear i carry for resist and dex, when archery comes into play.<br />
<br />
   To a Ranger, a good Shaman is his friend.  I always inform any Shamans that group with me... and I happen to be the Main tank (which is as little as possible) to to start casting thier spells on the mob as soon as he/she can with slow being first of course.  The reason I can do this is because i know how to properly keep insane aggro so the shaman never gets hit.  <br />
<br />
     Find a good Ranger to group with and report back sir!<br />

he had epic offhand and tox axe mainhand... and was doing just fine, even on the archaics (non slowable)  I don't know why you say ranger's can't tank in exp groups, I've had them tank in all teir 1 planes and had no problems, but I've also had warriors tanks, who sucked... now I don't expect a ranger to tank boss mobs, and they may not be able to tank 2nd teir plus exp mobs ( i dunno yet, not flagged) but in all teir 1 pop and under they do fine.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes, his weapons were so bad, they got us killed, thats why we were able to move deeper into PoI to get away from the rest of the groups at zone in, and stay there for a couple hours.<br />

I wish that was true, but I have 61 ranger, 61 shaman, 57 mage (Oh by the way I have one account).  My ranger would be 65, but he can't get groups, so I play my shaman now.  <br />
<br />

<br />
A wizard can tank a mob if he has good enough healing.  Is that group going to be efficient?  No.  Can a ranger tank as efficiently as any plate class?  No.  So what point are you trying to make exactly!  The fact is that rangers SUCK at tanking.  If you haven't learned that by now then you're either a damn fool or just a board troll.<br />
<br />
The fact that you can tank mobs in Tier3 means diddly.  Many of the giants in BoT are easier than the one in PoS.  In fact, next time you're in PoS do a ooc &quot;65 Ranger lfg (have enough ac to be main tank)&quot;.  Then take a screenshot of the responses, come back and post them here so I can get a good laugh at how they ridicule you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Under certain conditions, a ranger can MT for a group.  Finding those times is extremely rare, so for the most part a ranger is there to do extra dmg and not get hit, while providing utility.<br />
<br />
No one will ever pick a ranger to MT over a plate class of course.  So yes, you will be LFG alot considering the current high lvl group dynamics of MT, cleric, slower, dmg, dmg, dmg.  There might be 3 slots left for dmg, but there are a ton of classes looking to fill those spots, and most do it better than a ranger.<br />

That said there are some rangers out there that have good gear(spent time getting drops/quests/bought) that can make great tanks, better even because they can hold agro, reguardless of what i cast or when. <br />

Yes most rangers suck... they are the reason that rangers have a bad name...<br />

some rangers(though uncomon) are awsome tanks(ok not as much hp by a long shot but with slow you even it out)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Dizell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Here's the deal, when I tank with my group of friends with Kinladar, I can keep all the aggro to my little lonesome.

No other members get hit in the group, so no mana is needed to heal them, unless an add comes along, then either I root park, or one of the others do, and we kill them both. <br />
<br />
I do have a warrior friend that when he's online, he gets the tanking position no doubt. I won;t argue one bit that he takes a hit alot better. But to say a Ranger is a complete mana drain on a cleric, here's what alot of my groups have been of late.<br />

61 Chanter or 57 Necro (yeah ghetto mez from necros is nice)<br />

<br />
Not exactly typical. Granted I don;t do Tier 2 stuff yet, but if you get into the Plane of justice and hit the caves, there are 300 hitting mobs there, and I tank them with this group. <br />
<br />
Want to hear my weapon setup?<br />
<br />
Club of the Ice Ocean and Swiftwind<br />
<br />
I tried a 2hand slasher, and I had problems keeping aggro. With the proc from the club (149 DD Cold Proc), and Call of Sky (65 Fire based DD proc Stun) I keep all the aggro to myself, and do a decent amount of DPS yet.<br />
<br />
I have a shammie, as you can see, and he's fun too, and alot more welcome in groups with slows etc... But I would advise people who play, that even if you don't get the &quot;perfect&quot; group, so what? What's more fun, getting some exp with a non-standard group, or sitting lfg forever? <br />

Can a shaman tank almost as well assuming similar equipment and equal AA? Yup.<br />

Does it make more sense to have ranger tank and do less DPS via melee, or just have the shaman tank and let the ranger use archery? It varies from case to case.</div></div><hr />

I 2box a clr for one reason. I want to and frankly thats the only one I need. Being able to 2box in no way effects the mobs I have soloed. And I am sure my list FAR out streaches your's. The only times I 2box is when I am grouped with friends or at raids. And befor you run your lip first you try playing the only Shm at a 30 person raid AND a clr in CH rotaion.

 Yes all over 3 accounts. Your comment about the reposits is the one thing that shows you are of a low playing skill. The riposit damage is minimal. While I do agree Rangers are not full Tanks but they can and do, do well for themselves. It depends upon one thing the person sitting at the keyboard. Now if you are unable to tank with your ranger what dose that tell us about you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL right, whatever you say.  Do you know how much PoP mobs riposte compared to old world mobs?  Before you open you mouth about things you know nothing about why you don't you head over to the Rangers Glade and ask them, because that's where I learned about it.  What are you gonna say next, that all rangers that post on the Glade are of &quot;low playing skill&quot;?  Why don't you go tell them that after they just parsed all night!<br />
 <br />
I don't want to start a multi-boxing war, but I've found that multi-boxers are some of the most selfish, inexperienced players out there, because 90% of them just parked their ass in some corner in Velks or Fungus Grove and safely ground out AA points.  That doesn't take much skill does it!<br />
<br />
  Now if you are unable to tank with your ranger what dose that tell us about you?<br />
<br />
It tells me that you're an idiot, because my ac is 1150+ self-buffed and I have good gear, and I STILL get my ass handed to me by PoP mobs.</div></div><hr />

its not the fact that repostes are bad and do cause you more damage, its the fact that you were calling him a poor player because he wasnt using a 2hs. and dont know thier class because they were using 1hs instead of 2hs? cmon, grow up.<br />

Good to see I am not the only one in the 2Her camp.  From my experience, my ranger does better with 2Hers than with 1Hers (and yes I have pretty decent 1Hers on him).<br />

Anyway, I agree that a well-played ranger can substitute tank in a pinch.  Will they be as efficient as a plate class?  No.  But can they get the job done?  Yes, and that's all that matters to me personally.</div></div><hr />

As to the subject of 2handers vs duel weld, it is common knowledge that DW is broken.  Switching from a Tox Axe/ LSoEE combo w/ 36% haste to a Windblade resulted in 2 things.  My DPS went up by 10-15% and the damage taken while tanking went down over 50%.  You take a lot less reposte damage using a 44 delay weapon then you do duel welding a 17 and 27 dlay weapon.</div></div><hr />
