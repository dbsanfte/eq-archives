<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just recently bought a horse, so I'm not meleeing much, if at all.  Considering selling the REIF for something with better stats on it for my primary. More likely I would get something like a Spine Chill Spear (just in case I would ever need to melee) and put the cash towards getting a JBB.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be great. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I should probably add that I'm level 45 with max offense/defense/piercing, so skill ups don't enter into the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say sell the REIF when you get the rest of the JBB money, if the REIF would put you over the top and youd still have enough for a spine chill i'd say do it.  JBB is much better DPS than any meleeing for a shaman anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get something with good stats, like a thunder runed war spear instead of some druman spear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman dps has very little to do with melee unless you are gifted with some .5 ratio that has a monster proc.  Sell that REIF!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Idunno, I wouldn't go so far as to call our melee totally irrelevant.<br />
<br />
If you have a cheap haste item (FBSS, Silver Chitin Handwraps, Sash of the Dragonborn) and keep haste spell on yourself, REIF damage can rival JBB damage, but it has the advantage of no cast time and less downtime from stuns.  If you're tanking for the pet you might as well go that route.<br />
<br />
That said, JBB is much more important than REIF.  You can always pick up another REIF when you get the cash.  If you get a line on a JBB, you need to be in a position to grab it.</div></div><hr />
