<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a problem giving a response for you here.<br />
<br />
The idea of instanced dungeons is great.  Their implementation as a compulsory PoJ time trial (unless you want to be left out of an integral part of the rewards system) is appalling.<br />
<br />
So I chose 'not too good' as a compromise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The term dungeon crawl, as it's been referred to, is a bit of misnomer.  Every one so far was a frenzied rampage... even when we finished with 30 minutes left.   I'd like it to be a bit more leisurely myself.    People are so uptight they complain if ya take a bio even...  Granted, a few adventures we finished with under a minute left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love the basic concept of private dungeons, the<br />
timer thing is ok since they've added the extended<br />
30 minutes for half credit, but I hate the &quot;favor&quot;<br />
points. You should be able to spend them at ANY<br />
Wayfarer Brotherhood camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK  I think it will be great.  At the moment, I don't know many people on this server (character created to play with my boyfriend - my main is on 7th Hammer, but I retired her) who are my level.  I've met some great people, friends of my boyfriend, but they are 65 and I can't play with them in LDoN (even though I can play with them just fine in places like Droga and Sol C).  I tried one pick up group on Tuesday.  After that I decided I would just level up to 58 so I can play with the people I do know.  I'm old and cranky and don't feel like teaching people how to play dungeon EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auraura_H</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I pre ordered LDoN and I honestly can't tell you what I think of it because my main group has had so much trouble JUST trying to get an adventure.<br />
<br />
Also, we had trouble getting some players into the dungeons to participate. They couldn't open the door to get in... Very strange.<br />
<br />
I don't mind being in a frenzied battle. After being in Sol A and the basement of Split Paw, I feel I can handle that.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I will get to participate with and actually finish an adventure with a good group soon so I can benefit more from the expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think SoE was deceptive in claiming this expansion brings back the &quot;Dungeon Crawl&quot; experience, as I've read again and again it's more of a dungeon siege(sp?) heh.  It's got some good ideas though and this will do a lot for the smaller guilds and more dungeon xp for folks is always a good thing.<br />
<br />
My only main gripe is a superficial one but hey, /roar! still no new bear form /grumble.  It's awsome that the skellies got a revision that makes them look bad ass but thats 2nd revision for that and zip for us blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's great when you got a good group of people who know what they're doing. I love dungeon crawling and the time limit actually adds in a lot of fun, unless you get some clueless peeps, then it can become a headache.<br />
<br />
As I wrote in another post, I had a friend who ran ahead of me when I was pulling and she pulled 4 mobs on us causing us to end the adventure early. We probably should have went back in but we were all pretty bummed out and knew by the time we got all back up and going and buffed up we'd only have 30 mins or so to continue on. We figured the corpses would pop as soon, or within 15 mins, of manually leaving the adventure. Turns out we waited over an hour. That I believe needs to be seriously changed.<br />
<br />
The 7 level rule is a bit of a downside too. I have a lot of friends in their low and mid 50's that I can't group with. <br />
<br />
But having the Dungeon all to ourselves with possibilities of great loot and adventure points to save up for good loot and spells and with augmentations I definately think this is an amazing expansion. <br />
<br />
I'm just hoping the corpse thing gets changed and I know my lower level friends will eventually catch up so soon enough I will be playing in an LDoN dungeon with them. And over time my friends who aren't used to dungeon crawling will learn how to play in them. (Such as not passing the puller!) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">90% of people have a good opinion of it! Looks like Soe got it right this time, with this expansion so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I voted not very good.  Even though this expansion is loads better than every expansion since Kunark.<br />
<br />
a.  LDoN is not a dungeon crawl.  If SoE wants to know what a dungeon crawl is, load up a pack of level 58 characters and crawl to traks lair in sebilis.  Edit: Without retardify and retardaggro!<br />
<br />
b.  LDoN still has the retarded aggro radius problem.  When there are a room full of mobs, I fully expect the whole damned room to come when I aggro one of them.  Put some skill back in the fooking game please.  Give the FD classes something to do.<br />
<br />
c.  Pacify still works on most mobs.  That is just plain wrong, the encounters should not be tuned to use pacify because it gimps the content big time (And they are absolutely tuned to use pacify right now).  A buddy and I tore through an adventure night before last, both of us running three characters, pacified about 50% of the mobs and just moved through to the guy at the end, then scouted around to find the other nameds and pacified over to gank them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I voted not so good I'm so entirely disgusted by the time limit.  Part of a dungeon crawl is the strategy involved and the danger of a bad outcome.  The time limit and ease of most mobs makes most dungeons a rush for the finish line with little danger assuming you have some sort of CC in the group.  Gotta say I'm mostly disappointed so far, I play this game to relax, and the time limit just tends to make me feel like I'm back at work rushing to meet a deadline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Voted 'not too good' myself.  I enjoy the dungeon crawl theme, since when I started the game, crawls on my server are few and far between.  So the new idea is something I enjoy quite a bit, but thats the extent of it.<br />
<br />
I've only managed to hit up 5 adventures so far, 4 of which were busts because of the lack of CC, or the insane piles of mobs being brought to camp.  I would expect 4 tanks could handle 4-5 mobs coming into camp?  Guess not.<br />
<br />
The drops I have seen personally are sub-par.  I see an occasional vendor trash item..maybe worth 10plat.  See a couple augment gems if I'm lucky, and 1 drop with stats that a toon would actually use..assuming they were a bst/mnk/dru (those swords and daggers in Takish are laughable).<br />
<br />
I expected a bit more from this expansion.  Thus far I think the best part of it is seeing the wayfarer camps with toons parked in small groups around fires..that just looks so cool.  the rest is...well..it's there.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Auraura_H</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I thought adventures were tailored to your experience level. If they are, then I would think higher levels would have to deal with large mobs, resisters and a wider aggro range. How peculiar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't like LDON.<br />
It gets very repetitive and boring after a few runs..it's fun at first..but..in the end it's the same old thing.<br />
For me, it's even more boring then normal exp grinding and requires more constant attention.<br />
Normal difficulty is so easy it's just a boring 50 minutes of subpar exp.<br />
Hard difficulty requires a cookie-cutter group and luck getting a mission that you can finish in time, plus no one wants to do it...<br />
It's a huge time sink. To get the good augments, spells, you have to do each dungeon dozens of times.<br />
Having to have all your points in one area to get the good items sucked. If they were all general points it would be a lot better.<br />
Instanced dungeons are good and bad...it's battle.net, a group of people, and not as much interaction as i like...<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove the time limit, make the dungeons more branched out instead of practically a 1 way path with a few dead ends, adjust the difficulty on more then a level average, and somehow make it less repetitive and I think it would be a lot more fun..<br />
<br />
That said, I did have fun the first day of it, but it's the same old stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like the idea of personal dungeons but hate the implementation. <br />
<br />
I was hoping for some personal dungeons that brought back the old fear of being in guk alone late at night working your way to the King. Not some frantic race where you can't even take a phone call or go grab a coke without some EQ addict getting all pissy because those 45 seconds might ruin his day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They really need a pause command that freezes the dungeon so people can take a break if the group agrees to it.  It's probably too hard to program though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did not buy it.  Don't plan to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Another thing to add:<br />
<br />
EQ used to be an RPG.  Now LDoN seems be to changing it into some bizarre PvE version of Quake (perhaps we should add the number of mobs 'fragged' to the leaderboard).  Right now a lot of people are happy with this because of the novelty.  I don't think it has any long-term value: Quake/Unreal etc. does it far better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Its a lot more like Diablo.  Enter a dungeon, click on stuff and kill it, no respawns, random &quot;boss&quot; mobs around, armor augments.<br />
<br />
They might as well go ahead and add Stones of Jordan to the loot table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What do you think of Ldon so far?<br />
<br />
Good points:<br />
<br />
Many of the dungeons are very enjoyable.<br />
A little late for me maybe, but ever noticed how you stop watching the XP bar in Ldon? =)<br />
Many of the mob models are very impressive indeed.<br />
Some of the dungeons are fantastic too, guk is really absorbing, and doing Mira/Spiders den for the first time ranks as one of the most memorable EQ dungeon runs I've ever done.<br />
The merchant rewards are fantastic, I'm retired from hardcore raiding and having full Luclin endgame gear but with weak arms/bracers is annoying, finally I can do something about it =)<br />
Once you get beyond the overcomplicated nature of augments, they are fantastic, the weapon procs are brilliant (I urge anyone to go stick the 100 pointer Miragul 75 cold dd on there main weapon) and finally giving non mid/high end warriors access to UNRESISTABLE enraging blow style pure hate procs is possibly one of the best moves SoE has ever made on the class.<br />
<br />
The bad:<br />
<br />
A couple of dungeons are glaringly bad, the Dreary Grotto should have never made it past beta.<br />
Augments are overcomplicated, but admittedly it needs to be to allow good augments without throwing the balance off completey in certain cases.<br />
The regional points system sucks, its nothing more than a timesink enforcement and doesnt really allow people to focus more on the dungeon they enjoy, and if people all have different item region wishlists in your regular group, your in for a long haul.  However this will blow over in a month or so imho once people eventually get that tally built up.<br />
Zero new AA is a bit of a wasted opportunity imho, just makes me glad that I'm enjoying myself enough to not be bothered, still hastened rabidity came in useful in todays arena clearing so /shrug.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe however is that for me and my regular group, Normal is far too easy, but hard is basically unwinnable, we have robust enough to not really be in danger of wiping, but we lack the dps to get the job done consistently.  Imho there should be 3 tiers of difficulty with medium mobs having pretty much the same damage output as hard mode, but with less hps.  Hard's point reward should be upped a bit to make it more worthwhile, medium should be about where hard is now points wise, lootwise I'd say normal level loot with occasional hard level drops would be fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yesterday me and a group of friends did 2 hard quests (one in MM, one in Everfrost).  I died twice.  I haven't died on an exp run in ages.  As said before, this is the best expansion since Kunark by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
I'm a little surprised by the negative response especially those who think it is boring and repetitive.  Heck, load up the group with 6 shaman, or have a monk tank, etc.  the variations are endless - have a little imagination!!  Or try hard and see how you feel about it being too easy.<br />
<br />
And lots of stuff dropping, lots of stuff to purchase with your points. Fun fun fun.<br />
