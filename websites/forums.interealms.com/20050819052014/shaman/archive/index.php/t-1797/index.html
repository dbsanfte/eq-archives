<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slackjawd_Yokel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all! once again I require the help of my fellow shaman, if I may?<br />
<br />
I was wondering... do I reeeeeealy have to buy/upgrade a new computer to play everquest now? or do I only have to if I plan to use Luclin? I played EQ fine w/ kunark and velious out, but my comp crashed and i had to quit. (this was 4 months before Luclin came out), but its back to normal now. I know i couldnt run Luclin, but if i had all the Luclin stuff turned off, and all the other non-needed stuff off.. would i be able to resume play in just antonica/kunark/velious? or even just kunark? if so.. i could just level up in those 2 until i can afford a new comp. wich by the time i got my new shaman to vellious/luclin levels id have the funds anyway. I just want to start my shaman up and if needed solo till lvl 50 lol. I just miss it, im going through withdrawls and i miss everyone so much /bonk. I dont have specific details on my comp make-up.. except to say it ran EQ fine till it crashed due to a virus.<br />
<br />
If you guys think i could resume play on an old comp like i did for nearly 3 years... im headed off to buy another account.<br />
<br />
thx alot in advance (crosses fingers)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slackjawd_Yokel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah i used to be a C&amp;C freak till EQ came to my attention.<br />
<br />
Btw.. i couldnt find a new copy of ANY EQ in town today, so i killed every game on my system, freed up 1.5 gig on drive :C and downloaded my old EQ. after it installed, and i did 1 patch download... it says to reset EQ, so i click ok and then double click the EQ icon again. it tells me &quot;A required .DLL file, D3D8.DLL wasnt found&quot;. *** is that? ive reset my comp and it still does it.<br />
<br />
this sucks, i realy wanted to get it all downloaded.<br />
<br />
if ya know what the prob is i could use some advice on how to fix it :)<br />
<br />
thx alot guys,<br />

my 2ndary is a p2 350 w/ 128 ram and a voodoo3.  It runs well enough (albeit slow zoning) to port me around on a druid, or if really needed, 2-box a melee character.  It can be done with a lower end machine, but if you can, upgrade your ram as much as possible. (at least 512, if not 1024)</div></div><hr />
