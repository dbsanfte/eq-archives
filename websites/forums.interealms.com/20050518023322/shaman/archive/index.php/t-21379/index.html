Gates of Discord content retuned!<br />
<br />
<br />
Gates of Discord<br />
-------------------<br />
- Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed and beyond.<br />
- Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges.<br />
- NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously had difficulty with.<br />
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone.<br />
- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<br />
- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs.<br />
- Spell drops have been increased.<br />
- Increased the rate of cash drops.<br />
- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate.  Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for this.<br />
- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards!<br />
<br />

Well, at least there was something usefull in this patch.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see what the changes do to GoD content.  I think the important thing is going to be get into it and try to squeeze the spells out of it now, as SoE tends to overdue things and scale them back within a few days/weeks.<br />
<br />
Anyone else gonna give GoD one more try because of this?  I might.  I spent weeks farming that damn fly and had only zerk tomes, bst spells and knight spells drop and then the names were nerfed.  That pretty much ended the GoD exp for me.  We'll see....</div></div><hr />

No it doesn't.  What they may have done for knights is exactly what every knight is violently opposed to.  At least the shadow knights.<br />

Not sure I follow this. They effectively lowered the &quot;amount of max hits&quot;, is all. They didnt bump up the power of knights any. They nerfed the mobs, for EVERYONE, not just knights, which, I think, is in line with the &quot;curent state of the game&quot;. When we are all 70, they will probably &quot;ninja-unnerf&quot; them back up, though. Watch and see.</div></div><hr />

Well, if they nerfed the mobs for everyone it's not the &quot;gimp the mobs if there's no warrior&quot; I thought it was.  Which the SK boards were opposed to (people like the content being hard), but not as violently as what was proposed.<br />

Honestly, here is my theory.<br />
<br />
I think MOST of upper Gates was tuned for level 70, since I think this was ORIGINALLY planned as part of the OoW expansion. However, since we are looking at 2 months til anyone can be that level, and since a TON of people are leaving the game at the &quot;highest levels&quot;, I think they decided to re-tune the expansion to levl 65  . . .<br />
<br />
. . . for now.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I wont be a bit suprised to see a ninja un-nerf, un announced, re-tuning it back to 70 once OoW is released (well, in one of the inevitable patches).</div></div><hr />

I would be surprised.  They seldom make things harder as the game goes on. It's usually the opposite.  They make things easier to allow more casual players to get access to the &quot;higher end&quot; content.  Xegony and Coirnav are only two examples of them making things more difficult in terms of raid content.  Xegony was easy before her encounter was changed.  Coirnav on anything more than a 15 minute timer is easy as well.  Time guilds still blow his spawn if they don't move quickly enough on the encounter.<br />
<br />
Sony has never cared about mudflation of previous expansions.  They didn't go back and make King Tormax harder or make any of the First Brood dragons more difficult.  Who cares if you can one group or even duo some of them.  It's no longer important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, if they did adjust Ferubi and other starting God zones to be more appropriate for the levels they're intended for, that's also good for the casual players. <br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see just how much difference there is for tipt xp... the other day we couldn't get a cleric interested in going to save our lives but it does look like a pretty decent xp zone if the Zem allows for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ferubi XP was pretty nice before. Equal to Tier 3 XP only the mobs went down much faster. If you were able to keep yourselves alive XP would fly.<br />

<br />
What they supposedly did was reduce the probability of max hits, essentially it was a nerf of the utility of defensive in these encounters (defensive doesnt do much for you if a mob is hitting for min most of the time). It should allow knights to tank these mobs better, allthough warriors would still be more effective in general, and of course warriors could allways just switch to using evasive. The encounters could potentially have been made easier for warriors that way as well, but we'll have to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're utility of usefulness is also based on how others see you.  As long as a majority of people are unaware, missinformed, or have totaly idiotic ideas about how your class works, you still won't find you're 'usefulness' except in certain tight groups.  (see sarcastic response above)  As long as people out there view us as 'lesser' tanks that NEED gimped content, we won't be useful to the masses.  We don't want to tank raid names.  Repeat, raid bosses warriors can have. We want to share 6 person trial/xp groups and help OT/crowd control yard trash.<br />
<br />
Take the shaman, most out there see you as useful, wanted, and the 'ideal' class.  How many times have you heard how overpowered shaman are? Yet, all you have to do is read these boards/talk to a shaman to see how many issues, you too, have with class balance.</div></div><hr />

Well, this fixes problem A, that being you need a warrior to win certain trials. It does not fix problem B - warriors are still ten times better in these trials then knights.<br />
<br />
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone.<br />
One less timesink. Rallos be praised.<br />
<br />
- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<br />
I will have to see for myself what exactly that part means.<br />
<br />
- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs.<br />
Three thumbs up for that one. I would still prefer a some sort of safe, bindable area in or past Qinimi but this is a good change.<br />
<br />
- Spell drops have been increased.<br />
Here is hoping for the best . . <br />
<br />
On the convinience / bug fix side this is a great patch. On the class balance side it pretty much stinks. Unless they reduced MOB damage by at least half it will not change the way the fight is done at all. Sure, you may get away with a knight where you required a warrior before but the warrior is still much much better.<br />
<br />
If that is the kind of content rebalancing we can expect I shudder to think what will happen when they get around to us. The end result will probably be that a group with a shaman, a druid and a knight can barely win a trial while a group with a warrior, a cleric and an enchanter can be threeboxed by a one-eyed crippled monkey on drugs and do about as well.<br />
<br />
I am sorely disappointed about that part of the patch.</div></div><hr />

If it's a perception issue, then SoE should not be making additional code changes to balance the classes.  This sounnds similar to complaints by druids because they are perceived as not being useful even though they bring tons of utility to the table.  That may be a huge issue for individual players, but it's not something SoE should start making code changes to address.</div></div><hr />

The perception is that defensive is needed for all content (it's not).  How can Sony change that perception?<br />

I guess it depends on which player crowd you're dealing with.  I don't think the pre-elemental crowd has that perception - at least not the people I've grouped with or the people I talk to in/out of game.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, SoE probably shouldn't have included the bit about knights in their patch notes...that probably added to the perception problem.<br />
<br />
Or, was it a reality that changes were needed to allow knights to effectively tank certain single group max mobs in GoD?  If that was the case, then SoE probably did the right thing by pointing out that knights should now be a viable alternative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was a problem pre-PoP, the pendulum swung the other way overthe course of PoP, and now it's moving back the other way.  Reality tends to lead perception by a few months.  Warriors first noted the aggro problems that led to the PoP problems in late velious, but it was bearable until PoP when a slow that was less than immediate resulted in dead tank.  This lead to a certain tolerance (preference perhaps) of fewer HP in exchange for better aggro.  But it wasn't like PoP came out and everyone changed their mind on day 2 of realease.<br />
<br />
I'd say give it a few months and if Sony keeps misstepping, the perception will change.<br />

The reality is that defensive was required and only warriors have it.  From what I've heard the change didn't fix the problem - a trial still requires a warrior with defensive for the named.</div></div><hr />

Hmm...from some posts I've read on other boards it sounds like a well geared knight can now tank the named - I hear it's a close fight and they sometimes lose, but it's doable.  Guess we'll have to wait and see on this one.  (I'm not there yet, and even if I was, I don't play a knight, so I can't say for certain either way)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll just point out that even if it's *possible* doesn't mean a thing (rangers are actually good enough tanks for trials because of weaponshield, but you don't see them taking warrior's spots in groups).  If the perception is you need a warrior, then reality doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...I read a bunch of posts on that link and it seems like they were upset because the way SoE handled the situation was to make the mobs easier so a knight could tank them - which, of course, makes them much easier for a warrior to tank when using Defensive.  <br />
<br />
Lynxal said he tanked a boss mob successfully.  Kelv said he had no problems up to the boss mob, then they switched to the warrior because of Defensive.  <br />
<br />
Still, it sounds to me like the knights were useful in both cases.  (although Kelv did mention a well geared knight getting their butt handed to em on the first boss mob)<br />
<br />
So, I'm not sure why this would reinforce a perception that a warrior is required.  Sure, a specific melee based boss mob is easier with a warrior - but if it wasn't, why would anyone ever take a warrior?  (we have no other utility to bring to the group aside from pure tanking)  Either way, I think we all need more concrete results to know if the changes were sufficient/correct.<br />
<br />
By the way, I have posted on the SoE knight boards in favor of considering a short term knight damage avoidance similar to WS.  (in case you were thinking I was one of the warriors that was completely against helping knights  ;) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the trials were raid, sure.  But the trials are single group affairs.<br />
<br />
Warrior, cleric, 2nd healer, slower, DPS, DPS.  If knights can't tank bosses they can either make 2nd healers (paladins) or DPS.  And given SK DPS versus monk/rogue/ranger(/mage/wizard), they're going to be really deadweight. Since you *have* to bring a warrior anyway, why bother bringing a 2nd tank when you really need more DPS to succeed?<br />
<br />
we have no other utility to bring to the group aside from pure tanking<br />
<br />
Ok, tell me what a knight brings to the group if they are a second rate tank.  Don't even try to say &quot;omg you have a spell book.&quot;  Take a look at the trial group make up.  Check around to see if I'm accurately representing the makeup (I neglect pulling and CC).  And tell me precisely what utility a knight brings to a group that can't be covered better by another class.  Until I hear someone do that (and I first asked this question on the SW board 6 months ago - still unanswered), I don't buy this arguement. Knights tank.  That's all they do.  They need to do it as well as warriors to be viable on raids and groups (for non-trivial content).<br />
<br />
Let me throw out some examples to illustrate:<br />
FD pulling? monks do it better ( especially with new pac disc) and have more DPS<br />
corpse summoning? Necros do that the same and bring more DPS.<br />
Zev's bite? try wind of Marr and take the rest of what a bard can do with it.<br />
Tanking? Warriors do that better and have defensive and their auto-riposte disc.<br />
<br />
Heck, I couldn't get anyone to come up with a setup where a knight couldn't be replaced by a warrior and have the group be improved overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, answer me this question - if knights tank as well as a warrior, why would you ever bring a warrior?<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know about you, but I rarely have the luxury of being able to pick and choose which classes I group with.  So, it's about pros and cons.  If I want a dps class I really want either a wiz or a rogue.  But, if I can't get those, I'll go for mage, ranger, monk, etc.  That's the same situation with knights and warriors.<br />
<br />
Yes, warriors are the better tanks.  But, they have changed the GoD content so knights can also MA there now - or so it appears.  This should make knights an acceptable alternative to warriors in the trials.  If it doesn't, they need to make additional changes...but I'd like to see if the current changes were sufficient.</div></div><hr />

Same reason as you'd bring a knight - you need a tank.<br />

In that case, why do warriors need to have the advantage in *every* aspect of tanking? If they are nominally interchangable, they should have roughly the same ability across the board.</div></div><hr />

I realize you don't want to bring the spellbook into the discussion, but it is there and it does add a lot of value in most situations.  That is my response on the utility question.  (if you want me to go into specifics about your spellbook...well, sorry,  I'm not going to get into that one...go search on the Alla site  :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
As to the SW response (from your prior post), there are plenty of discussions on that site about this subject.  If your specific post didn't get a response it's probably because people like me are tired of hearing knights saying their spell book doesn't matter.  That's a load of crap.<br />
<br />
If all you want to do is tank, play a warrior.  If you want to tank and bring utility to the group (and some soloing ability), play a knight.  But don't expect to tank as well as a warrior in terms of pure damage receiving capabilities if you decide to play a knight.<br />
<br />
Also, I never said knights and warriors werre &quot;nominally interchangeable&quot; when it comes to tanking specific GoD content.  I said they were an acceptable alternative - there is a big difference.  Going back to my example, a wizard or rogue is a very superior dps option than say, a monk - but if I can't find a wiz or rogue, a monk will suffice.  <br />
<br />
Also, outside GoD trials, there are plenty of cases where knights can be a better option than a warrior.  Basically, if you are pulling singles on an open area (think PoP tier 1 to 3), knights are a great option because you don't have to worry about losing agro.  No, I'm not saying that to whine about knights...I'm just pointing out that knights are a valid tank choice and have areas of the game in which they outshine warriors.  (as should be the case - each class should have areas where they do well)</div></div><hr />

Yes, they have some issues with GoD, but a lot of these guys actually want to be warriors with spellbooks.  <br />
<br />
The exaggeration and whining on the Knight boards makes the Crucible a beacon of wisdom and reason in comparision.  <br />
<br />
Under Kiztent's view, why on earth would anyone be a warrior?  Knight utility does matter, and it matters a lot.  Dismissing the spellbook is totally bogus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">He does have a point though. The spellbook does not matter if the Knight cannot tank. You get a Knight to tank and to heal / pull / ATK buff / HP buff. Take away tanking and you are left with a wannabe druid or wannabe monk.<br />
<br />
Tanking, unlike DPS or healing, does not stack. Either you can tank content or you cannot. If you can there are degrees to how well you do it but if you cannot you (if you are a tank class) are pretty much dead weight.<br />
<br />
That is not fair to anyone it happens to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's an absurd position, yet it is essentially what Kiztent and others assert.  <br />
<br />
If it is not worthless, how is that value of that ability to be offset?  Similarly, if you aren't actually tanking at a particular moment, is the ability to tank worthless?  <br />
<br />
Knights have some issues, like I said, but they got seriously spoiled during PoP when they were superior tanks to warriors and now they are acting like spoiled babies as a result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In that case, why do warriors need to have the advantage in *every* aspect of tanking? If they are nominally interchangable, they should have roughly the same ability across the board.<br />
<br />
Warriors have, and should have the advantage in every aspect of tanking for precisely the same reason that clerics have the advantage in every aspect of healing.  They're specialists.  They do one thing very well.<br />
<br />
A warrior should always have an easier time tanking something that a knight can tank.  Yes, that means that by lowering the difficulty of GoD content so it can be knight tanked, it can now be tanked by a warrior at a lower point in progression.<br />
<br />
If knights would like to tank as well as warriors, then I would quite bluntly like to heal as well as a cleric, and we can just let players of those classes retire and reroll as a more fun class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
close fight ?<br />
<br />
shadow knights can't tank anything named in GoD, paladins can, but only certain named, why you ask ? STUN ! it mitigates damage.<br />
even then, a resisted stun, or a stun immune mob (like most of the nameds)<br />
will chew your palading into a fine paste, then start on you.<br />
knights can tank elementals, if they have NICE elemental gear, otherwise, go find a warrior, even one with 2k less hitpoints and 300 less ac tanks better than a knight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">On knight Vrs warrior tanking.<br />
<br />
Knights should be able to tank anything a warrior can. Useing thier spells to make up the differeance in the combats.<br />
<br />
If a warror can last for a minute Vrs the monster. than a Knight should be able to as well. With spells as a factor.<br />
<br />
What is wrong is that the warrior is the best at tanking by a very large margin when defensive is up. And Knights do not ahve a spell based ability to match defensive. And they should.<br />
<br />
The spellbook based abilities should be a perk. not a boat anchor. And Don't forget about the Discs for Meele now. a Spell by any other name is still a spell folks. <br />
<br />
Anyways. I think and have always thought that balance would mean. you need a healer.. Get a cleric Get a druid get a shaman. Three ways to get the job done. You need a tank get a Warrior get a Knight. Same thing. Every good group should have at least one of the three archtypes. Tank, healer, Damage. And any of them should be interchangable with certain perks for combonations. Like a paladin and Shaman should be just as damn effective as a Cleric and warrior.<br />
<br />
And to counter the argument of why play a warrior I would simply fire back... cause you like to play one. Not because there should be a distinct advantage to your class that people flock to in a min max way. <br />

If you know in advance you will not be needing to cast it, yes it actually is worthless. Tell me, when you do a LDoN normal - do you look for someone who can rez? When you help a friend 10 levels lower then you and with no AAs with a quest - do you bring along a cleric for rezzing? Of course you don't - you will not need the rez after all.</div></div><hr />

Wrong.<br />
<br />
No need to have Warriors in the game if they aren't needed for certain encounters.  Thats like saying that BL, ENC, and Bards should all get 75% slows.  Do you expect Druids to have the same heal spells as Clerics?<br />
<br />

<br />
Pretty simple reason, actually. Knights do less damage than warriors. Slap a two-hander on a warrior, they'll do more damage than a knight with hte same weapon, thanks to having a higher damage table. Give a warrior a one-hander... and he'll pick up a second one and do WAY WAY more damage than a knight with a two-hander, or, heaven forbid, a one-hander and shield.<br />
<br />
Knights have superior aggro. How does that count for a damned thing when they can't tank the aggro they get? <br />
<br />
That's like &quot;Shaman have Turgers, they shouldn't heal better than superior, because who would ever want a cleric?!&quot;</div></div><hr />

How does knights making up for the difference in tanking ability with spells make them more desirable then warriors? That still leaves them with a finite mana bar, and less damage done. From my experiences warriors, at the high end anyways, do not have aggro problems anymore so that point is moot.<br />
<br />
Now, when knights start to match both warrior damage and tanking ability and still have mana and time left over for other things, then you have a problem. This is basically what happened in PoP (and Luclin).<br />
<br />
Going to the other extreme and making Knights unable to tank single group content is just as bad though - a Knight that is not tanking is a waste of a group slot.<br />
<br />
Now, the balance between these two is obviously hard to find. You first have to make sure that the Knight's self healing capabilities do not exceed the gap in tanking ability. This it itself hard, given varied content. Then you have to value the utility of the buffs and group taps and the like. I would probably try to compare these to the superior warrior damage rather then to tanking. Then you get to value  heals, a pet, damage spells, feign death, harmshield, divine aura, snare, stun, root, defensive, /shield and fortitude against each other.<br />
<br />
I do not think you can balance this for every or even for one encounter. What could be done though is add content which favors each class. The current Ikkinz setup favors warriors. A setting with stunnable MOBs and AEs favors paladins. A setting with high regeneration MOBs favors shadowknights. Having each setting, preferably in each expedition, means you only have to roughly balance the classes for each situation. As long as every tank will still do for the non-favored settings and does not do too well in his favored setting most people will be happy.<br />
<br />
Noone cares if they are 20% better then the warrior in the AE setting but 30% worse in the ikkinz setting. People do care when they are 10% worse then some other class in every setting of an entire expansion.</div></div><hr />

I could live with this. A reduced version of Defensive for Knights that they could save up for the Named Boss. It shouldnt be as good as the warrior version though. <br />
<br />
The problem here is the same problem we are seeing with our own class. Its VERY difficult to balance content vs groups based on whats out there. If a Paladin with a Shaman healer can get by on something, its COMPLETLY trivial for a Warrior with a Cleric healer. The answer lies somewhere in the middle, and the result is that the &quot;lesser&quot; classes, be they tanks or healers, end up on the outside looking in.</div></div><hr />

But if shaman could actually heal closer to clerics (after figuring in slow) and knights could tank as well as warriors then any content where a shaman + knight can get by would not be trivial for a warrior + cleric.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if content was changed to favor clerics and warriors less and knights and shaman more you could similarly balance it to be challenging but doable for either combination.<br />
<br />
Of course if content stays unchanged in nature and classes do not change either then you are correct. Which is why so many knights (and shaman and probably other classes too) are complaining.</div></div><hr />

Blargx - I'm not sure who you were directing this comment at, but, for the record, I have posted on the SoE and TSW boards in favor of either adjusting GoD content or boosting the &quot;burst tanking&quot; abilities of knights via something like weapon shield.  What I get irrate about with the current &quot;knight balance&quot; discussion is when people use BS arguments such as the spell books don't matter (that would be equivalent to warriors saying disciplines don't matter IMO) or warriors mitigate damage 35% better than knights even without discs.  <br />
<br />
There's a big difference between arguing against class changes for the sake of preventing classes from getting something and arguing against (or, more accurately - pointing out) false information.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to clarify my position on this one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">But if knights cannot tank adequately their entire spellbook is indeed of no consequence. Just as warriors were useless when they could not taunt, despite still dealing decent damage.<br />
<br />
After all the usual question is not if someone can do something useful - a level 1 druid can cast minor healing, which is better then nothing. When filling a group you are asking if x class can contribute adequately. Knights who cannot tank do not, spellbook or no spellbook.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should get some form fighting invul disc, such as fortitude or something like WS. I wouldn't give them a riposte disc though, that is the domain of pure melees. A mini version of defensive would be ok as well, as long as it operated off the same timer as defensive and was 50-75% the effectiveness of defensive.<br />
<br />
In return knights should give up their current invul discs, and the hate generated by their spells should be capped at the top of the hate list + 1, essentially turning it into a castable taunt. In addition, any spells they cast on a red con which are resisted should not generate hate (since warrior taunts allmost allways fail against red con boss mobs). That would force them to deal with the same issues warriors have to deal with.<br />
<br />
Giving knights effective tanking tools equivalent to warriors without dealing with the absurd agro potential of their spells will just result in warriors becoming highly undesirable again, as it was from the release of PoP all the way until GoD was released (when it was the warriors turn in the sun again).</div></div><hr />

One of the reasons why warriors defend vigorously against the idea of giving kights these defensive abilities is because they know perfectly well that once kights become survivable in these fights their superior agro capabilities will mean that they become the preferred classes again. In the interests of balance if knights are brought closer to warriors in some ways then knights have to be brought closer to warriors in other ways. <br />
<br />
And no, warriors don't need to stop swinging to taunt but what does that have to do with it? The purpose of swinging while tanking is to hold agro, and if you can do that without swinging, so much the better. If I could hold agro holding a pair of shields while tanking nameds, you can be dammed sure I would be doing that.<br />

You are not a warrior Murtak. Taunt is actually pretty unreliable at the best of times. It is not uncommon to fail 6 or 7 times in a row, even on blue cons, and a failed taunt generates no hate, unlike the tools available to knights. As a caster who played during the PoP era, you should be perfectly well aware of that fact. Against red-con raid mobs it basically doesnt work at all. The only tools a warrior has is their skill on the opening engagement, AEtaunt (when it is up) and incite. If you lose agro on a raid target pretty much the only way to regain it is if the person who took it from you dies or has some means of lowering their position on the hate list. Incite is useless for grabbing agro, its primary purpose is to create a small platform on a successful taunt or on the pull.<br />
<br />
If you doubt me why do you think that rod off the king in the warrens, or those snare glands from FG, were regarded as so usefull?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">You know what I mean. No need to quibble over semantics.<br />
Warrior invulnerability does not render them unable to attack or cast spells, nor does it put them on the bottom of the hate list. That is hardly semantics.<br />
<br />
Oh, it would just apply to hydrids Murtak, you get to keep all your hate  :D <br />

But warriors already got huge upgrades in their taunting and moderate upgrades to their tanking. Knights did not. Then GoD trials indirectly nerfed knights because of the onedimensional MOB design. Now knights want some of that lost ground back - and you insist they pay some price warriors did not have to pay for their recent upgrades.<br />

Knights who taunt do less damage then warriors. Knights also tank worse then warriors. In some cases that means a knight has to self heal (or lifetap) constantly to barely stay in range of being healable. When knights do this they taunt worse then warriors. By a large margin.<br />

Incite is useless for grabbing aggro? That is news to me. I certainly noticed a huge increase in my ability to slow early when warriors got incite.<br />
<br />
If you doubt me why do you think that rod off the king in the warrens, or those snare glands from FG, were regarded as so usefull?<br />
According to that argument the cleric rez must be useless because the rez stick of Vox is so powerful. And shaman-cast regeneration must suck because shaman liked to use fungi tunics.<br />
<br />
Snare glands are great because they are ranged aggro. Snare glands are great because they add aggro on top of what the tank is already capable of producing. Neither of that requires warrior taunting to be useless for glands to be highly prized.<br />
<br />
Besides that was before incite.</div></div><hr />

You need to re-read what I originally said Murtak. What I wanted was for DA/HS to be replaced with something like fortitude or WS (but not the riposte discs). And yes, you are quibbling about semantics. What else would you call taking me to task for saying &quot;disc&quot; when I obviously meant the two knight invul spells?<br />

Now knights want some of that lost ground back - and you insist they pay some price warriors did not have to pay for their recent upgrades.<br />
<br />
Warriors got zero upgrades in taunting. The only change was that the results of a taunt are now reported, so they can see how much it really sucks. What they got were tools to allow them to hold agro slightly better in the opening engagement. They also got augs for hate generation in LDoN, and weapon affinity in GoD, but so did knights. The augs available for knights do not generate quite as much agro, but they are still significant in that regard.<br />
<br />
On the tanking side of things, warriors got a mitigation upgrade, which allows them to tank trash somewhat better. However, it was offset by a nerf to defensive, so that warriors tank nameds exactly the same as they did prior to the melee rebalancing.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that knights lost little ground after the melee rebalancing, the only difference was that warriors at the lower end became viable again (previously they had not been). It had relatively little effect on high end warriors. Right up until the release of GoD knights, or more specifically paladins, were the tank of choice when doing content that didnt require defensive. The same is true for much of GoD, the primary difference being that GoD has more content that requires defensive than previous expansions. Since much of that content is required for progression, the notion that knights are &quot;broken&quot; has emerged.<br />

Knights who taunt do less damage then warriors. Knights also tank worse then warriors. In some cases that means a knight has to self heal (or lifetap) constantly to barely stay in range of being healable. When knights do this they taunt worse then warriors. By a large margin.<br />
<br />
It is only necessary to taunt when they lose agro, not while they have it, so the impact is less than what you would have us believe. If a warrior loses agro in the scenario you have described (a fight like that implies a high end mob) they have no tools to regain agro other than AEtaunt. While a knight who has to heal or tap while tanking is generating less hate than if they were meleeing, a defensive warrior also generates less hate since their melee is mitigated.<br />
<br />
<br />
And aggro procs.<br />
<br />
As you well know, procs are an unreliable means of gaining agro, particularly early in the fight. You also seem to be forgeting that other melee have procs too, which, while not generating as much hate as anger/EB, do generate significant hate as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incite is useless for grabbing aggro? That is news to me. I certainly noticed a huge increase in my ability to slow early when warriors got incite.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is useless for grabbing agro. It wont pull a mob off you after you slow it for example. What incite does is effectively give the warrior the equivalent of an extra landed blow or two of hate, which allows them to build hate a little sooner than they otherwise would have. It is most usefull when using slower weapons, less so with faster ones. It probably reduces the time you have to wait before slowing by 1-2 seconds. You are the expert with math, you tell me, is 1-2 seconds a big deal in the grand scheme of things?<br />
<br />
<br />
According to that argument the cleric rez must be useless because the rez stick of Vox is so powerful. And shaman-cast regeneration must suck because shaman liked to use fungi tunics.<br />
<br />
Snare glands are great because they are ranged aggro. Snare glands are great because they add aggro on top of what the tank is already capable of producing. Neither of that requires warrior taunting to be useless for glands to be highly prized.<br />
<br />
Besides that was before incite.<br />
<br />
Those items were used to lock early agro or regain agro in large target fights. Essentially they were used in the same way that knights use spells in those sorts of fights. And the reason they were so useful is exactly because warriors could not depend on taunt in those fights. They were not used on trash mobs because of the cost associated with them. They are not used much these days since the bug that allowed them to be recharged has been fixed. Incite is in no way a comparable replacement, since it has a 30 second recast time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you have to remember is all 3 tanking classes are different.  Warriors offer tanking - nothing else, just tanking.  Knights offer tanking and non-tanking utility.  All of the class abilities as well as game content need to be considered when discussing class balance.<br />
<br />
Making knights tank as well as warriors would be the same as, say, giving druids a 75% slow and 60% haste.  Sure, both shaman and druids are healers, but if shaman didn't also offer the utility of slows and haste, why would anyone take a shaman over a druid?  (and no, I'm not proposing SoE give druids slow/haste  :p ...I'm just using this as an example of problems that arise when only considering select abilities of classes when discussing class balance)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">You need to re-read what I originally said Murtak. What I wanted was for DA/HS to be replaced with something like fortitude or WS (but not the riposte discs). And yes, you are quibbling about semantics. What else would you call taking me to task for saying &quot;disc&quot; when I obviously meant the two knight invul spells?<br />
Well, I would (and did) ask what disciplines you meant - seeing as DA and Harmshield act completely different from the invulnerability disciplines. What you asked for is like asking for cleric group heals to be replaced with HoT spells - they are used for completely different purposes, just as invulnerability disciplines and DA type spells work differently.<br />
<br />
Now, if you are saying that no class should have both an invulnerability discipline and a DA type spell you might want to tell us your reasoning behind it. As is it came across as &quot;if knights want a lesser version of my ability they should give up something&quot;. And that made no sense to me, seeing how knights already gave up their role as a tank for single group content in large parts of GoD.<br />
<br />
Warriors got zero upgrades in taunting. The only change was that the results of a taunt are now reported, so they can see how much it really sucks.<br />
Are you really telling me incite does nothing?<br />
<br />
What they got were tools to allow them to hold agro slightly better in the opening engagement. They also got augs for hate generation in LDoN, and weapon affinity in GoD, but so did knights. The augs available for knights do not generate quite as much agro, but they are still significant in that regard.<br />
So, according to your own words, warriors did in fact get a larger increase in taunting then knights. Both in absolute numbers (higher hate per proc) and in percentage of taunt increase. Oh, and of course incite on top of that.<br />
<br />
That does not even touch the issue of the decreased knight taunt due to the need to heal themselves.<br />
<br />
On the tanking side of things, warriors got a mitigation upgrade, which allows them to tank trash somewhat better. However, it was offset by a nerf to defensive, so that warriors tank nameds exactly the same as they did prior to the melee rebalancing.<br />
And at the same time GoD single group content was largely tuned to be hard with a warrior tanking and a cleric and secondary healer healing. Making warriors tank better overall, the same as before during defensive and then requiring either defensive or an additional cleric on the boss fights does not exactly make life better for knights.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that knights lost little ground after the melee rebalancing, the only difference was that warriors at the lower end became viable again (previously they had not been). It had relatively little effect on high end warriors. Right up until the release of GoD knights, or more specifically paladins, were the tank of choice when doing content that didnt require defensive. The same is true for much of GoD, the primary difference being that GoD has more content that requires defensive than previous expansions. Since much of that content is required for progression, the notion that knights are &quot;broken&quot; has emerged.<br />
And why would that be incorrect? Knights who cannot tank single group content are indeed broken. I see no reason to group a knight if I already require a warrior anyways.<br />
<br />
It is only necessary to taunt when they lose agro, not while they have it, so the impact is less than what you would have us believe.<br />
Uh . . every halfway decent tank I know would rather not loose aggro at all. In fact to me that is where I draw the line between good and barely workable taunting abilities. If the boss occassionally switches from the tank you have a problem. I have seen that happen with paladins who had to heal themselves instead of taunt just so they could barely stay alive. I have not seen that happen with warriors.<br />
<br />
If a warrior loses agro in the scenario you have described (a fight like that implies a high end mob) they have no tools to regain agro other than AEtaunt.<br />
But warriors put out more aggro in that scenario and they generate more DPS and they require less heals and even if that fails they have an instant click to get that aggro back and on top of that they can use invulnerability disciplines for an initial aggro buffer. Knights do not even play in the same league as that.<br />
<br />
While a knight who has to heal or tap while tanking is generating less hate than if they were meleeing, a defensive warrior also generates less hate since their melee is mitigated.<br />
And of course requires much less healing, thus needs less taunt in the first place.<br />
<br />
As you well know, procs are an unreliable means of gaining agro, particularly early in the fight. You also seem to be forgeting that other melee have procs too, which, while not generating as much hate as anger/EB, do generate significant hate as well.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is useless for grabbing agro. It wont pull a mob off you after you slow it for example. What incite does is effectively give the warrior the equivalent of an extra landed blow or two of hate, which allows them to build hate a little sooner than they otherwise would have. It is most usefull when using slower weapons, less so with faster ones.<br />
So you are telling me that a little more aggro here and there is useless? That incite is useless because it will not pull aggro against a slow by itself?<br />
<br />
It probably reduces the time you have to wait before slowing by 1-2 seconds. You are the expert with math, you tell me, is 1-2 seconds a big deal in the grand scheme of things?<br />
YES. Are you telling me you never wished for an extra second or two to do some damage, taunt another time, land that last heal, get that mez in? If I could have an AA that gave me an extra two seconds worth of time every 30 minutes or so you would see me and just about everyone I know standing in line to buy as many of it as we could.<br />
<br />
Those items were used to lock early agro or regain agro in large target fights. Essentially they were used in the same way that knights use spells in those sorts of fights.<br />
Except of course them being superior in every regard to the knight spell lineup. What does this have to do with knight balancing by the way?<br />
<br />
And the reason they were so useful is exactly because warriors could not depend on taunt in those fights. They were not used on trash mobs because of the cost associated with them. They are not used much these days since the bug that allowed them to be recharged has been fixed. Incite is in no way a comparable replacement, since it has a 30 second recast time.<br />
Oh, you expect to get instant failless aggro from incite? Well, I guess that explains why you repeatedly claim it is a useless skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me state it again:<br />
Knights (just as some other classes) got deprieved of their role in GoD. Knights want that role back. They should not loose something to gain back the ability to act as a tank for single group content.<br />
<br />
Knight balance in previous expansions has nothing to do with what they should or should not be able to do in further expansions. No class should be left out of the fun just because they might have been overpowered at some previous point of the game.<br />
<br />
Wether that balance should be done via content, via class abilities or a mix of both is debatable. But knights should not be left standing there scratching their heads, wondering why warriors having problems in PoP means that now knights should loose their group spot.<br />
<br />
EQ is supposed to be fun, not a game of &quot;who gets kicked in the nuts this expansion&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Do warriors need to stop swinging to taunt?<br />
<br />
You may be unaware of this, but way back when they rebalanced 2 handers, one of the handy things they did was make it so that the attack cycle no longer gets reset by spell casting.<br />
<br />
In other words, if your next swing would come in the middle of a spell cast (and would previously be lost), it now simply happens as soon as the spell cast is over.  <br />
<br />
Hybrids also get innate spell haste on detrimental spells.  <br />
<br />
End result, casting during combat really isn't that much of an impact on dps for knights anymore.<br />
<br />
Now, for rangers I understand it can be a problem because they tend to dual wield fast 1 handers, so they can miss two rounds of melee during a spell cast and only get one back at the end of the cast.  They have the very valid complaint that their fast nukes should be changed to mimic SK-style .5 second cast time spears.<br />
<br />
The real issue that hurts knight 2 hander dps compared to a warrior is the lack of innate triple attack - they have slightly lower skill caps, but those are made up for by superior knight-only 2hs weapons.  If you're on a crusade to up knight dps, that would be the windmill to tilt at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">What you have to remember is all 3 tanking classes are different.  Warriors offer tanking - nothing else, just tanking.  Knights offer tanking and non-tanking utility.  All of the class abilities as well as game content need to be considered when discussing class balance.<br />
This is where you get to see an inherent problem in encounter design. Consider basically the entire GoD single group content. It is an exercise in pulling singles or reducing the encounters to single MOB fights, as the damage is often too much to handle for a single group if you do not fight singles.<br />
<br />
If you have a single MOB fight you want the following: Someone to take the damage. As few classes as possible to heal the damage. As many damage as you can cram into the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
What does this mean for knight abilities? Well, large parts of it are pretty much useless. For simplicities sake, lets say warriors tank 100(insert measuring unit here), paladins tank 80. Warriors do 100 damage, paladins do 80 damage  or heal 80 damage. Looks balanced, right? Tank a little worse, do less damage, can heal decently.<br />
<br />
It is not though. The paladin can decide to be a crappy tank or a crappy damage dealer or a crappy healer. Unless at least two of those roles are actually needed at some point that is a useless ability. If you took two specialist classes you would end up with more tanking, more damage and more healing instead. This often boils down to replacing the paladin with a warrior and thus being able to replace a healer with a damage class.<br />
<br />
If you let paladins tank as well as warriors they are too powerful, since they can do everything a warrior can and do something else besides, no matter how useful it might be.<br />
<br />
Solution? Either warriors need secondary abilities too or encounters need to change to offer knights a chance to use all of their abilities in a single encounter.<br />
<br />
Since neither is happening groups are best off min-maxing to the above formula, which will always have a best and a worst class to group.<br />
<br />
Edit: You could also have the secondary knight abilities be &quot;free&quot; that is to say, always on group effects or zero cast time AAs. The recast timer idea does not work since giving them upgrqades to this abilities lets them instead double up on them.<br />
<br />
In fact this would probably be easiest to balance. You could even have the abilities scale by zone. East commons, paladins increase group regeneration by 2 per tick. Ikkinz, paladins increase group regeneration by 200 per tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hybrids also get innate spell haste on detrimental spells.  <br />
Which makes them stop less to cast spells, but still makes them swing less. Spells can also be interrupted, changing targets for heals also tends to make you loose swings. More importantly time spent casting heals/taps is time spent not taunting and vice versa. Hybrids must decide what to do - warriors do not suffer from this problem.<br />
<br />
End result, casting during combat really isn't that much of an impact on dps for knights anymore.<br />
Not if you only need to cast a stun every now and then. It is a problem when you want to chain heal, chain stun, chase the MOB and change targets. You go from casting between swings to swinging between casts, and sometimes not even that.<br />

Superior knight only 2handers? Such as? Oh, warriors also have a higher damage table. And why would I be on a crusade to up knight DPS? I want them to be able to tank single group content. DPS is not a concern other then generating hate.</div></div><hr />

Warriors, SKs, and paladins are all on the same damage table:<br />

<br />
is the latest note about damage tables I could find.  It's possible they've changed things since this was put out, if you can provide a link I will happily adjust my world view.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Paladins of Norrath hasn't gotten around to doing any parsing since elementals, so the top end weapon they list is the SEWS, which is, yes, warrior and ranger usable too.  I'll concede there since I frankly don't have numbers to back up what is basically an emotional reaction to what seems like a heck of a lot of knight 2 handers dropping compared to other class weapons.  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Whoa, I thought the fairly large lead of warriors in weapon damage was the result of their damage table. Looks like it is just triple attack and superior weapon skills then.</div></div><hr />

And of course you also missed out on the fact that defensive warrior dps is 55% lower than normal  :p <br />
<br />
Not to mention that heals and taps generate agro as well.<br />
<br />
Btw, switching to yourself and back to the target takes a fraction of a second with the tab key (as anyone who has used a dain hammer to rebuff on the fly would be well aware).<br />
<br />
The real issue with the knight debate of course is that the named fights in question are set up as one group raid events, and have all the baggage associated with raids, contary to what people would like to believe. You fight these mobs as though they were raid targets, and of course you need the classes which are generally required on raids. The fact that the encounters are for single groups is irrelevant. The fact that paladins can tank in normal single group situations has no bearing here at all. In these events, they have the same role as what they have in raids: offtanks and emergency backups.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that is wise for the events associated with these mobs to be as monochromatic as they are, but it is the way it is. Trying to reform entire groups of classes based on what is literally a dozen mobs is foolish in my opinion. There have allways been mobs that knights couldn't tank in challenging content, and these are just more of the same.</div></div><hr />

*sigh* the lower DPS of a defensive warrior is utterly irrelevant. If you need an extra healer to make up for the lack of defensive as you do in a lot of the single group expeditions of GoD then that means you can group an extra DPS class when going with the warrior. Thus warrior DPS is the damage he puts out himself plus the DPS whoever you got instead of a healer, say a rogue or wizard.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that heals and taps generate agro as well.<br />
But far less then the spells knights use for taunting - which was my point.<br />
<br />
Btw, switching to yourself and back to the target takes a fraction of a second with the tab key (as anyone who has used a dain hammer to rebuff on the fly would be well aware).<br />
This is what actually happens if you have the option of waiting for your swing to complete. You swing. You target yourself. You begin casting your spell. Your attack cycles but is held. You finish casting the spell with yourself targeted. You waste an attack round. You retarget the MOB. You swing again.<br />
<br />
Where do you not loose damage by casting? Unless you can fit each of your spells into your weapon delay and on top of that actually wait casting until after a swing you will loose damage. And that still does not adress the lower taunt of these spells.<br />
<br />

Except of course, that - since these encounters are not actually raids - the offtank role is useless. You might group them for emergency backup - where they do worse then another warrior. And yes, encounter design is the biggest issue with knight balance. That does not mean you can just dismiss knight concerns as irrelevant. If the next expansion has sizeable parts of it's content doing zero damage, thus completely getting rid of the need for tanking and healing will you still say it has &quot;no bearing at all&quot; on class balance? If you need to win a trial where you need to have 4 FD classes in the group or 5 classes being able to heal, will you say that is just fine?<br />

In what single group content could knights not perform decently prior to GoD?<br />
<br />
Requiring any single class in single group content is silly. The reliance on cleric healing was bad enough, we do not need to rely on warrior tanking on top of it. I can already imagine the next expansion where you will require a warrior, two clerics, an enchanter and a rogue for each group. Do you want this to happen?</div></div><hr />

Actually, you only need to target yourself to start casting the spell, you can tab target back to the NPC as soon as the spellcast begins and the spell will land on you with the NPC targetted for your next swing.<br />

You can't click on an NPC to target it during a spellcast, unless you're a bard, but tab works.  I'm not sure if the new cycle NPC key works, haven't tried it.</div></div><hr />

You cant target NPCs by clicking, or other group members, but you CAN cycle through by tabbing while a spell is being cast. My Canni 5 macro has a &quot;/tar blazz, /cast 6 (quies)&quot; portion on it, and I use TAB to get back to the NPC while Quies is being cast on myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Took the time pacing to think of a reply for this and here i go :).<br />
<br />
Hello my name is Dhantes, my name is Turindor, my name is Caddyshack. I am shadowknight, I am cleric, I am beastlord. Just wanted to get my introduction out of the way :). These class balance topics have always been a big concern of mine especially the tanking ones.<br />
<br />
As my beastlord i posted a topic on the bst board asking about how bst felt about the knight situation. One of the things i asked was how would the BL's and Chanters feel if the slowing balance was disturbed by shamans being given a powerful slow disc useable every 10 mins that effectively slowed the mob 95% (supposed to be ridiculous number or use a number you think is the equivelent of a defensive disc in terms of slow). Would anyone then want a bst or chanter as a slower for a trial like encounter with a high dps name?<br />
<br />
As for DA/HS as invuln spells they both have a very big penalty of not allowing you to tank and as such are rarely mem'd and used. I've heard of sk's using HS in combination with pulling but sadly i never saw the use for this technique myself. Anyways as such most knights myself included would glady give up DA/HS for a WS type disc but it isn't neccesarily what we want. We dont want to do away with tanking, we want to tank we want to be healed and have to have a healer keep us up. Even if a WS is more powerful we would rather tank then be invuln. As such most knights that i've heard from want a around 25% mitigation disc of the same type as defensive. You do understand what i mean about not wanting a WS skill as a tank class, if not i will try to explain better? <br />
<br />
Pre defensive a war mitigates what 8% better and evades 8% better, not 100% sure on the parses on TSW but if you could fill in the blank. That isn't too much but combined with the fact that war's have a considerable hp difference when comparable geared (in a dkp guild same raid attendence the war's typical had 8k when i had 6k and isn't uncommon) this is fine and this is what we give up for our utility but it effectively means that a war can tank in a hard ldon much earlier then an sk can. The problem comes post defensive where that 8% skyrockets as has been said we are not given anything to compensate for that difference.<br />
<br />
Something i else thought was one of the responses is that clerics heal better then druids thats why warriors tank better then knights. Well if say a mini boss needs 2 clerics to keep up with heals you could effectively replace those 2 clerics with say 6 druids and they would do a fine job (pulling numbers out of my ass) but put 6 knights infront of a mini that can slaughter them and you gonna get 6 dead knights one after another where one war will do a better job then all 6.<br />
<br />
Next topic agro, you bring up agro well knights still supposedly do have superior agro for the first 10 seconds but supposedly what i have read is incite is enough agro to cover 1 slow resist. After the first 10 seconds of agro war's hate proccing ability in the high end game is supposed to be superior agro over time. Im not highend so i dont 100% know but this is what has been repeatedly said on teh sk boards and one of the reason we are upset. But the problem with agro goes once you have agro as either class it just becomes a matter of holding it over the wizards etc doing the high dps, agro after that point doesn't matter and is trivial, so as long as warriors have enough agro to do the content they are fine and this shouldn't effect their job as tanks.<br />
<br />
As has been said before warriors have many tools that make them unique and reasons to have them on raids in groups. Raids = Furious to defensive if war goes down AoE taunt to furious to defensive... nothing a knight can do is similiar to that. And even in lower end guilds you dont see Knights tanking if an equivelent level/gear warrior is around, and doesn't always even have to be near equivelent that is how powerful defensive is right now. Groups Furious to defensive giving slower time to slow mobs pre actual tanking.<br />
<br />
Anyways thats all i have in me right now have alot of other ideas but stopped pacing about 30 mins ago and have lost that energy hehe :). Anyways im not trying to be insulting in any of this umm i do apologize if i said anything wrong in regards to shamans, enchanters and beastlords slowing ability with regards to your guys problems atm. Anyways thanks for listening.</div></div><hr />

Nice post Dhantes.  <br />
<br />
The more I think about this whole knight/warrior thing, the more I'm coming to the conclusion that it's really a content issue.  <br />
<br />
SoE released an expansion where single groups were required for advancement and they made the boss mobs the single groups had to beat play to the strengths of warriors and against the weaknesses of knights.  Or, stated a little differently, the trial bosses are mainly fast melee dps mobs.  They could have (or could still?) add variety to these mobs to make some of them play to the strengths of knights so what you could wind up with is warriors are preferred in some trials and knights are preferred in others.  I know it's only a Luclin mob, but think about IV - lots of hp, rampage, annoying procs (blind and pushback), but doesn't hit hard - this is a perfect mob for a knight over a warrior because you need someone that can hold agro even if they aren't attacking due to pushback/blind combo.  The trials could also have boss mobs like this.<br />
<br />
The other content issue is, GoD trials are accessible by everyone (maybe 60+ is required), but the content is geared towards the post-time crowd.  The net affect of this is there are a lot of people that can get into the trials but do not have sufficient gear to survive them.  The reason I say this is I've read a number of knights posting that they can now do the trials - but these are the 10k+ hp, 2k+ ac knights.<br />
<br />
As to the stats - I believe the total damage reduction (mitigation and avoidance) difference between knights and warriors is a little under 5% on average (it varies based on the DB/DI of the mob.)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and Incite definitely will not hold agro if slow is resisted.  In fact, it won't pull agro away in most cases unless the warrior is meleeing the mob.  Also, if I don't get a proc (CHSD and CHoS are my wpns), the first slow will often pull agro away from me - even though I pulled the mob and used Incite.  Don't get me wrong - I love incite and I'm happy with my agro abilities...it's just that incite isn't as much agro as it sometimes appears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Incite does 400 hate on casting, with a 700 hate dot over the course of a minute. Most high level tanks will put more hate with 2 strikes of a 2 hander, so there is no way that it is going to overcome hate from a slow. The only times incite grabs agro is when it is cast on an incoming mob to take agro off the puller. Beyond that I can probably count the number of times it has acted as a taunt on one hand and have fingers to spare.<br />
<br />
Incite has its applications, but they are very situational. For example, a warrior probably does it on an incoming mob, after they have landed a successfull taunt or to make up agro when tanking a mob that can't be damaged too much (off tanking in the RC encounter for example). I also use it before breaking mez in challenging content when taunt fails (as it frequently does) and we need to move quickly, so that my dps grabs agro a little sooner. Beyond that I tend to be conservative with its use since it does consume END, and in a fast killing situation you risk compromising your discs.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, content is the main issue here. I can not even say if either knights or warriors would be unbalanced in different content - the current content is so onesided and so skewed towards warriors it is hard to tell.<br />
<br />
Implementing knight friendly MOBs, though fair, does not solve the problem. If you need a knight in trial A and a warrior in trial B you have pissed off warriors in A and pissed off knights in B. Noone should need to feel that way. The variety should be within the trials themselves. That way no class would clearly be better in a trial and you might actually benefit from having both a knight and warrior in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I was under the impression that slow generated a certain amount of Hate/agro.  Same with most other non-DPS spells.  IF that is true, then the agro that a tank is required to offset is static from lower content to higher content for these initial castings.  However, the agro generating abilities of a warrior go up as they do.  Better weapons, hate augs and such.  Wouldn't that mean that as warriors go up in power, they have an easier time holding agro?  <br />
<br />
If you are saying that knight agro is all from spells with set Hate, then the gap becomes smaller and smaller as you get closer to the high end???<br />
<br />
I'm just curious since I don't play a tank so much.  Anyone comment on this or am I crazy?</div></div><hr />

I'm not in the high end, but from my position on the progression ladder, yes, that's basically true.  Keep in mind that knights also get better weapons - but if they are casting the weapons aren't helping with agro.  The difference is really in the startup phase of a fight.  Once my warrior has a chance to build agro everything is fine...it just takes me awhile to get there.  (and I hear time warriors can get good agro pretty quickly)</div></div><hr />

So if that is true....warriors can keep agro about as good, have far more HP's and take far less damage....  doesn't seem so equal.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Knights get a &quot;free&quot; bost whenever a new set of spells is released. Warrior taunt scales with gear while knight taunt does not nearly scale as much.<br />
<br />
Neither of the above is desirable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">When holding agro you generally face two types of problems. Early in the fight you might lose agro to debuffers (pretty common), or to healers in the case of high dps mobs. It is possible to lock agro in these early stages with furious, but that has a refresh time of around 40 minutes or so, meaning that it has very limited application. On normal pre-GoD mobs, losing agro under these circumstances wasn't that big a deal, but with GoD of course it could result in losing your cleric or slower and as such can be a serious issue.<br />
<br />
The other type of agro loss warriors might experience generally comes later in the fight when high dps melees eventually overtake the MT on the hate list. This can be controlled if they have some means of avoiding agro (jolt/escape/fd or whatever) and turn attack off. These sorts of things reduce the groups overall melee dps though. This type of problem generally happens with trash rather than nameds, since melees usually engage trash immediately, rather than allowing the MT to build an agro platform. It's less of an issue on nameds, but it can be if melee join the fight too soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In theory, that's true.  For both classes the 'best' aggro spell is from original EQ, so there have been no spell related aggro upgrades (and a significant round of aggro decrease about when they put disease counters on slow for SKs) since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I should have said that differently - I meant that neither the large upgrade all casters get to their primary abilities with new spell sets nor the better scaling abilities of the pure melee classes are desirable. Taunt is just a subset of that.</div></div><hr />
