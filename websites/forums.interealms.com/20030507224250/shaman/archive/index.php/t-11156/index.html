<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of people will gate when aggro'd by this guy, but IMO, I found it best to just take him out and save having to gate everytime he paths thru. This is how I handle this guy.  Keep in mind – my gear is not uber whatsoever. I do have my epic, but I lack Torpor, Pox, Avatar, VoB. My buffed AC is just over 900 and hit-points just over 2200. However, I do make sure I get KEI in the bazaar before hunting in the PoG. <br />
1st cast is Annul Magic to drop his damage shields. The next thing I cast is Malo and sick my pet (True Spirit d/w Gnoll Hides or Velium weapons). Soon as pet is on the treant I cast turgurs. Now the trick I found is to not to dot with anything other than epic dot and keep him rooted until close to the end. Let the pet do most of the work keeping it healed. When the Treant is at half health, I reapply Turgurs. When the treant reaches 1.5 bubs of health I reapply epic, then stick BoK, EB, and Plague. Now this is the tricky part - after I have stuck these spells - I do the mad sit and spell swap changing out Plague and EB for Spear of Torment and Torrent of Poison. The Treant is gonna gate when low so I am ready to gate if he gets it off. As soon as I think he is close to gating - I cast Torrent of Poison and when spells refresh I immediately cast SoT. After this, it is a bit of luck, but I start chain casting SoT (fast refresh and fast casting time) until he gives up trying to gate and starts his death walk.  The Treant has never dropped anything for me, but it is worth getting him out of the way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Worth a try next time this happens :)<br />
<br />
Btw, has anyone put the AAs into Virulent Paralysis and tried it out on him? I'm wondering if the knockback effect of VP is enough to interrupt the treant from gating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, I might try that as I run (err he runs into me) into that Tranquil Treant quite often. Gnoll Hide Lariats should help as well for pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Galamor for the very specific and helpful info.  PoG is a wonderful spot for shammy soloing at our level. <br />
<br />
I like to have Alpha pooch dual wield the mage summoned Walnan blades or Fists of Ixiblat--they proc a lot with Mortal Deftness+HoS on the pooch.<br />
<br />
One question--what is the strategy behind going so heavy on the dots at the last minute, particularly including plague?  Your post seems to imply that Torrent and spamming SoT is interrupting the gate attempt or killing him quickly during the &quot;trying to gate&quot; window.  It just seems like there wouldnt be enough mana to do all of that plus all the dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Think why he said to use epic and redo slow through most of the fight while healing pet. Buy yourself time to cann your mana back to unload on the end.<br />
 <br />
 But thisleads me to  question Does this work well with just the 61 pet or does the 55 pet work? Seems the 55 pet would suck some more mana with the healing causing to have less mana to unload at the end. It doable with either?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The reason I load up on the dot's at the end is to provide more damage per tick when I start to chain cast SoT. With Epic, BoK, Plague, and EB all stacked - you adding quite a bit of sustained damage. The key is to get the Treant past the point where he is going to gate and starts his death walk. It is also important in case he gets gate off - the Treant will spend most of its mana trying to cast dots on your pet during the fight and will eventually be oom and stop casting till he is ready to gate. If he gets gate off, there is a chance he will die from the dots, but more importantly, it will buy you time to gate out or if you are brave, mem up summon companion and let the Treant summon you. I have never fought him with the 55 pet, but I don't think it would be any different. Its a slow fight and so far root seems to hold like super glue on it compared to the other mobs so you can med through most the fight keeping the pet healed. BTW - I was wrong about the loot - killed him the other day and he dropped Wizard Legs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm might try that.. i have Virulent Paralasis but was always a little shakey vs the Treants. usually just gate.<br />
<br />
 i also have spirit call so the added 3 pets can add 3 more bash's and pets do amazing push. add VP to that and maybe i can interupt.<br />
<br />
i almost always tank all the mobs i fight myself and go DoT heavy/JBB then canni after the fight. being an ogre and unstunable from front helps JBB.<br />
<br />
2 things ive heard about Treants (might be rumors):<br />
1) they are immune to stuns (spells and bash) although the &quot;pushing&quot; can interupt thier spells.<br />
2) if itsa long fight u mighta run them outa mana. they will still try to gate , even OOM but will be interupted every time  beacause no mana. you might run them outa mana and then they cannot gate.<br />
<br />
ill try one next time one agros, but i have them too often get gate off before my small groups can kill them, let alone when solo.<br />
<br />
and yes... ive seen them drop an enchanter robe before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tribunal_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another thing you could try is staying under 2 bubbles of health, I don't know if it works against the TT but it does work against most mobs.  Hope this helps, GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">tried soloing a TT. my pet had 2 rusty weapons. i did dog dog him low and then at 40% layered him with PoX, plague, epic, bane, and Ebolt. i hit spirit call and began Torrent of Poison and 61 poison nuking.<br />
dogs interupted first 2 gates.<br />
he got a 3rd gate off. i had tried to use virulent paralysis. i think the knock back worked against me. it knocked the tree out from under my rain spells and the dogs had to move again to engage it. if i had let the rain spell hit and  just nuked i might have had him dead. or maybe it was the dogs. <br />
<br />
i stopped 2 outa 3 gates so if i had a little more firepower i woulda killed it. time to invest in AA spell crits and gethigh enough to mem  Tears of Saryn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The idea of below 2 bubs of HP is a good idea, and i know from experience this works EVERYWHERE to stop mobs gating. Akheva/Seb/ME the gating mobs just dont gate cos they think 'Brill, gonna get to kill a cocky shaman today!'<br />
<br />
However, its risky. 2 bubs of HP is ~1600 when im fully buffed at 60 (yay ding 60 btw). That sounds like alot, but if the treant dots/nukes you, and you suddenly get a wolf/horse beating on you, you can pretty much kiss your ass goodbye. IF you keep it in an outside view (F9 x3) you can make sure there is nothing around, or if there is, you can move away, which would make it a good method. But unless i was sure i think id be riding the line slightly too close for comfort. Good thought, probably works if you are capable :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">next time im in PoG gonna try that. if it dont work im gonna let the dogs beat him see if they can keep him from getting gate off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">vp will surely interupt as it knocks him clean out of melee range, however it will only do it once, and with 2min refresh imo its not something worth relying on, and it can be resisted from time to time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">like i said.... he channeled through my VP.<br />
but pet and spirit call1 interupted him 2x alone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Etric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I solo these guys whenever I see them.  Previous poster was right about Spirit Call, just SC when he gets to 10% or so and he won't get a gate off... hasn't gotten one off on me yet.<br />
