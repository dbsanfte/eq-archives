<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm I always thought there was some recipies that you can just buy all the ingrideints to raise your skill.  My initial impression is that for the items above, it does not drop too often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bobcats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are correct Nolani -- you can do some of the recipes from stuff that is bought...but this does get rather expensive, and after buying my resist gear set for ToV, I am close to being broke.<br />
<br />
This is by no means a cry for people to go out and farm these reagents for me, just a heads up so people dont destroy these items...I will be farming a lot of the stuff myself , tonight i was in Droga getting Mt Death mineral salts (but of course i got careless and died -- true to form)  I just figured that I'd do this to help out the people that need poison made for the ring quests, and for poisons that lower resists, etc...I feel that of late my contribution to the guild has been lacking and this is the best way i can come up with to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bobs, <br />
I collected a ton of these when I was farming in Nurga. The goblins drop them a lot, and there is at least one camp spot I know of that is relatively safe and easy. I believe the Nurga goblins are also slightly lower level than the Droga ones.  Nurga, like Droga, is a &quot;one pass&quot; dungeon, where they expect you to walk in, drop down the waterfall, and then fight your way thru. If, however, you are a small race (I think you would be small enough, but not sure) or if you shrink yourself (and I'll be glad to provide you with the potions if you'd like), you can swim up the waterfall that goes up to where you would normally exit.  This path is much easier and simpler if you need a quick escape.  <br />
<br />
Two things, mobs are usually paired up, so be careful on pulls, but I had no problem getting singles at 54.  There are some casters; plaguebringers, firedowsers, rockchanters (what I was hunting). Also, if you go deep in, be aware that the Sleeping Ogre spawns sometimes. He ran me out once, because I knew what he was and not to mess with him. He's part of the monk epic, so don't mess with him. If he spawns, run or hide. <br />
<br />
I think in a very few hours you could get a stack of salts here.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrm... I don't know exactly how low your funds is  but the bought poisons run about 12pp per try I think, with decent charisma. I found that when I had normal gear, which puts me at 152 dex, I learned faster then when I put on a few int pieces. I'm not sure which the skill is based on but from my own evidence it pointed towards dex. I know in a few trips to seb (If they EVER fix my connection, or I get DSL) I'll have the cash and will continue going to 250 poison making in FV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whats your poison making at atm Bobs?...<br />
<br />
I farmed Nurga for Death Mountain Mineral Salts this weekend (thanks VB).  They arent an exceedingly rare drop I got 12 or so in a few hours.<br />
<br />
The Tares Lichen are extremely common in Perma and I'd be glad to help you farm Lichen til the cows come home...You can kill almost constantly if you camp Arche and Preacher and will have a couple stacks in an hour or 2...<br />
<br />
I am more than willing to help you working the skill up as many of us will/do need the fabled Mind Melt (not triv at 250) for the 9th Coldain Ring Quest...I think I have found a maker for mine...but I certainly wont be the last to need this...Gimme a shout when ya need a hand bro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aiyrra Verin'sarol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*Smiles at the Keepers*<br />
I am also in the midst of working on my skills in poison making, some of you have asked about me being a grandmaster (250) skill... this is a very expensive and time consuming endeavor.  I am currently at (149) skill and gathering succulent saps like they were water.  Many of the poisons of  Type II and above require two merchant bought supplies and one harvested item.  Which is why Bobcat made that list.  Bobcat I'd like to get together with you sometimes and discuss poison making, same with you Psyloche... It's much more amusing to run around killing every cactus that is moving with a friend than to do it alone.  If you are not a rogue and want to help us with our ingedient gathering there is a great alphabetical list of poison drops and what type they are for at <br />

If any of you have a good recipe book for type IV's and V's I would appreciate a link.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If anyone needs the mind melt potions before any of the posted here get to 250, I do know atleast 2 Rogues that I could ask for them. So let me know if you need'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bobcats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With a little work and some money, i have been able to move my poison making up to (176) thus far.<br />
<br />
One poison that i found that is a good training one is Visionistic Pain (I think that's what it's called)  Made using 2 White Hellbore (found on Gnolls in Lake rathe, VERY easy to farm) Sealed Vial and Larent Suspension</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aiyrra Verin'sarol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So I found a great recipe which I'm currently making... it'll get ya to 214 skill and you don't have to farm a thing <br />
*rolls her eyes and drools because she's going insane from farming*<br />
The next best thing from not having to farm is it's very cheap to make... approximately 8pp<br />
<br />
System Shock IV effect-HP from 5 to 241 pushes target back and does stun???<br />
<br />
Recipe is:<br />
Iron sulphide*+(2)Quicksilver**+Sealed vial+Lars suspension<br />
<br />
Iron sulphide*=Brimstone (bought from Ennixy Frennor at Steamfont zone p1380 n380)+(2)small ore (which is sold in the middle windmill near there)<br />
<br />
Quicksilver**=Gnomish spirits (bought from A clockwork barkeep in A'kanon..just down the hall from the bank there)+Cinnabar (bought from Myre just outside of Kaladim's bank)<br />
<br />
Hmm a question... Do we ever get multiple dose bottles?<br />
