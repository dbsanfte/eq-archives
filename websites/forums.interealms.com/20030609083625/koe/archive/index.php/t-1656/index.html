<br />
I would like to extend my warmest thanks to Jlove and Ash for helping me complete a part of my epic quest. I am now ready to move onto the second part of that quest and kill Ixiblat Fer. However, with Small Chaotic Gods of Wars limited size I cannot do this alone. <br />
<br />
In a conversation with Knarlz I have learned that you will soon have two clerics including Knarlz that will be ready for the same part of the quest. From my understanding it is something that can be done a number of times in a row and was hoping that I maybe included when this event takes place. <br />
<br />
As you many of you know SCGoW and KoE have always had a good relationship. I hope we can continue this tradition with strengthen the bonds between our two guilds. <br />

I was chatting with Stonepounder about this and mentioned how KoE does Epic encounters involving 3 or more groups. <br />
<br />
A bit more detail Stone is that in order not to spend all of everyones time on Epic Fever, we have an epic commitie. When a member is at a stage that requires a large guild assist they e-mail the epic councle. They will post the time requesting that the guild assist on the venture.<br />
<br />
I think we have 1 other at this stage (not positive though ) and I am close. You were one of the lucky ones who got Lord Gimp in Sol A to pop in 30 min. I have about 20 hours there so far, and pick away at it when I can assist members 20-30s at the camp.<br />
<br />
So at least fo me, it may still be a bit till ready, then our commitie sets a date. So it may be a bit ( at least for my part )<br />
<br />
We havent done this part for awhile but in the past this mob could be re-spawned by keeping the trigger npc out of the way by having someone not in the battle tie her down with hails.<br />
<br />
This allows several people to get this part while the forces are assembled. When I am at the point where I send in my status , I will also request that when we set a date you are notified.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
