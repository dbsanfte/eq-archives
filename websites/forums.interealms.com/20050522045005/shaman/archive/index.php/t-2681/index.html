<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made a barb shaman, I went out in the hunting ground and I saw young players like myself.  Only difference was they had some really nice armor.  So at level 5, I worked up the courage and sent one of the barbs a tell asking him where he got his cool looking armor. He told me to go check the armor shop. I went there and was alittle surprised, the cheapest items there where way out of my price range, I had a few gold pieces, and they where dealing in platinums :eek: <br />
<br />
So I figured I was doing somthing wrong for sure, I went and created a new cat shaman.  He is up to lvl 3, I have already noticed I am not making lots of money.  So I guess my question is am I missing somthing?  Do I have to do a money dance before killing monsters or somthing ;)  <br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your help guys and gals<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, I think that other player might have been teasing you a bit.  I don't know of anyone that buys any armor from vendors, except for leather and cloth armor at very low levels.<br />
<br />
The reason that other player has really nice looking gear at low levels is because that play most likely has a higher level character that acquired the gear they are wearing.  This is termed &quot;twinking&quot;.  For example, I have a level 60 shaman that has acquired much of the gear that my level 50+ paladin and monk wear.  Much of the gear my monk is wearing is the same stuff I put on him when he was only level 15 or so.<br />
<br />
Since you don't have a high level character to acquire the gear you want, the best you can do is hunt what you can for money, save up, and buy the stuff that you can.  East Commons or North Freeport or Greater Faydark are the most common &quot;auction zones&quot; in EQ where lots of players gather knowing that other people are also gathering there for the sole purpose of tryinig to buy or sell stuff.  You might also want to try joining the auction chat channel to look for gear you can afford.<br />
<br />
All of us had to level up our first characters without any additional twinking.  You actually have it much easier, as many higher level pieces of gear are much more available and thus cheaper to acquire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That other player was &quot;jerking&quot; your chain......you'll find that there are alot of players wearing items, gear, weapons that are WAY beyond their levels. They either have a higher level character to give them stuff or have higher level friends. Since it sounds to me like you don't have a higher level character, you're gonna have to do things the &quot;old fashion&quot; way. Money will come with levels, you'll notice that you'll begin to make more as you advance. Nothing wrong with being a non-twink, it makes you appreciate your character and everything they have acquired that much more. As I am untwinked as well. I have a higher level SK but I wanted to gain items and gear on my own without twinking. You should have a much easier time than some of us did starting out, gear is becoming much cheaper and easier to acquire now-a-days. So, my advice to you is to tough it out and continue to level and develop your character and the wealth will come in time. I know I look back at the early years of my Shammy and think how completely broke I was. I gain more now from a single kill then I did in a few early levels of his life. I throw away stuff that I would have jumped at the chance to get in my early stages. So, just hang in there, keep leveling and the money will come easier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Welcome to the ranks of the Barbarian Shaman.  I really enjoy playing mine.  This is the first character I made, so I also had to start from scratch.  A little quick insight, put a couple of points in tayloring and start by gathering spiderling silks.  Make bandages.  If you can find a nice, higher lever character to give you spider silks from the tundra.  When you can make silk swatches, make raw silk armor.  It costs about 6-8 silver for the pattern and you can sell it back to Cindl for 3-6 gold.  Not a lot, but you can make some cash.  Good Luck and welcome..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Vah Shir newbie areas aren't known for their cash drops. But, that's okay, they are known for their quests :) You can find them by hailing various NPC's or do the quick route, a spoiler site. http://everquest.allakhazam.com is one of the most commonly used for that sort of information (there are also quests in Halas to help get you started out if you go back to your Barb Shaman).<br />
<br />
Being a first time player and a caster is hard on the pocket book. Spells and items add up quickly so you have to pick and choose what spells to buy, what items are really important but you'll get through it. The money and items will come eventually. In the mean time, wear what you can quest for or scrounge up proudly, you've earned it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember when I was a young barbarian shaman running around Everfrost and seeing all the &quot;uber&quot; barbarians in patchwork armor.  I bought my initial armor from the vendors, too.<br />
<br />
Make sure you loot everything that you kill and sell it to vendors. Everfrost is one of the best newbie areas for raising cash as there are tons of mobs dropping all sorts of loot. It takes awhile to raise cash, but in time you will get there.  I still remember when I made my first platinum piece after scrounging silver and copper like crazy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agreed, the newbies from Everfrost are the richest newbies around.<br />
<br />
HQ bear pelts 30pp, spiderling silk 20pp, bone chips 5pp, spider silk 20pp.<br />
They are all there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Loot everything you see and sell it to vendors...those crappy copper pieces will add up. Another good investment as a Barb Shaman is a sewing kit. Kill spiders and get silks and start to make swatches, you can sell those to the vendor or begin to make raw silk armor and sell those in the Halas tunnel. I made quite a bit a plat doing that and bought a shield a minor poker, and began to save for leather armor pieces. A tailor hired me to get some hides and he'd make some armor for me since he was practicing his tailoring skill anyway. I had a full suit and I got it for free just by hunting things I was getting exp for anyway. <br />
So a sewing kit is a great low level investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree on the sewing kit as well<br />
<br />
Make sure it is a large kit - I still carry mine at 37 and I'm not much of a tailor. It has 8 slots and can hold giant items, great for those pesky (yet oh-so profitable) mammoth tusks!!</div></div><hr />
