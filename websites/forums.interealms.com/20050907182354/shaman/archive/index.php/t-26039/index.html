<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I'm kinda embarrassed to say this.  But I SUCK at soloing. :(<br />
<br />
I just started playing EQ last year.  I played primarily with my husband and his RL friends.  I never HAD to solo.  I honestly never even tried to solo until I was in my mid 50's.<br />
<br />
So, now I'm 70.  And I want to solo stuff.  Maybe it's because I just wanna be able to say I can.  I have no problems finding groups, as I tend to group primarily with guildies.  But sometimes I just wanna solo.  <br />
<br />
I have no problem soloing single mobs.  Singles are a breeze for me.  My problem comes when I get more than one.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.<br />
<br />
This morning for instance, I was on and thought I'd go try to solo in Tirranun's Delve in DoN.  Dark blue mobs at 70.  Hit for less than 300.  I had about 7.1k hps with Conviction and BSS and self buffs.  No C though.    So I had a few singles to pull.  Did those fine.  I pulled them one by one and tanked as my dog chewed on em.  I used SoL and they went down fast.  So, then I have to pull 2 if I don't want any down time.  One is a caster, so I go after him first.  Root the other one off.  Other mob keeps breaking root.  So I stick my dog on him.  I just couldn't keep up with the heals and the dps.  Dog dies and I run away, mem gate and get the heck out of there.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me, I just never learned to juggle mobs.  But what do I do now?  That I'm level 70 and if I screw up I am pretty much destined to die. Maybe I should have just waited on the respawn on the single mobs.  <br />
<br />
I'm embarrassed to admit this.  I just don't know what to do about it.  I'd rather swallow my pride and get some advice so I can become a better player.<br />
<br />
Please don't make fun of me!   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, you never learn anything new if you never try.<br />
<br />
typically I try to stick to single pulls, for a while I was soloing in NC, killing murks lazily with rootrot technique. but it gets boring, so I get up, pull up dog, haste him and myself, go toe-to-toe with them. fun!<br />
<br />
but occasionally I'd get an add from respawn, or bad pathing.<br />
<br />
Malos everything. you should be able to take a round or two if you get slow off. off root the add, and back off. may want to root your current mob as well. back off, and recoup a little for the situation.<br />
<br />
make sure root is secure (i.e. refresh it often) and kill the mob with the lowest % of HP first, while switching back to add to be sure root is holding and slow isn't wearing off (if it has been a while). at this point it may be easier to med a little and rootrot both. just kill one first, then the other. handling adds is all about crowd control and knowing your limits.<br />
<br />
I can handle 2 mobs at a time on me in melee range. 3 in a ranged fight.<br />
<br />
more than that, and I'm not going to survive, there is no shame in gating. its annoying if you're bound far away. but its better to have to run a little ways than have to spend 200 plat to summon your corpse and find a cleric for a rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Couple of things (must haves My opinion)<br />
<br />
1. get yourself Ornate legs. Clicky root. Then hotkey them (lifesaver)<br />
2. Get VP3 Use MD befor as the debuff. Take notes on which mobs VP lasts for full duration. there are some mobs like in Pofire &amp; the murks in NC that you can keep rooted indefinately &amp; the knockback pushes them out of melee range<br />
<br />
Some tips tricks that I use<br />
<br />
1. I never root rot with a pet up unless i am using him to pet pull or i know i will get adds. He can be a great speed bump. send him in on two mobs &amp; root one. Root the other &amp; debuff both. malos &amp; slow. your pet is probably dead but he served his purpose.<br />
<br />
2. Use not DD dots ( they break root)<br />
<br />
3. map toggle between tagets on your keyboard so you can easily togle between both of your  mobs. also map Cycle though nearest NPC`s on you keyboard so if you get more than 2 mobs you cna cycle through them &amp; root them all then Gate or dot them<br />
<br />
4. use your clicky root often. the cast time is 3 seconds (i think) Gem refresh is not much shorter than that. so while you are waiting for gem refresh reapply root<br />
<br />
5 if you have one of the mobs VP`d kill the other mob first. 2 reasons for this. 1. when vp wears off &amp; charges you you can knock it back out of camp &amp; 2. it usually lasts longer.<br />
<br />
6. Keep your distance. once the mobs are rooted stand at max casting range. gives you more time if root breaks.<br />
<br />
7. when/if root breaks. dont panic. If the mob is slowed you should have no problem re-rooting while the mob beats on you. if you are on your mount this is when you should demount. once rooted run out of melee range &amp; then resummon your mount if you want. <br />
<br />
8. set up a /dismount hotkey for easy dismounting<br />
<br />
When i first started root rotting i never used a mount bcuz it takes a while to get going &amp; the mob might get another round in on you. now i always use it cause if things get hairy i can run real fast on it. <br />
<br />
As you become more comfortable with root rotting you can unmem your slow &amp; your blast heal. REMEMBER ROOT ROOT ROOT...manaless clicky roots are awesome.<br />
<br />
Pull with MD &amp; cast VP( no refresh) if you are at max casting range the mob should never hit you b4 VP lands<br />
<br />
hope this helps. let me know if you have any other questions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you love soloing finish VP3.  It's the easiest crowd control around, and the knockback usually get them out of mellee range.<br />
I also usually root of the caster (unless it's a healer) and take on the mellee mob fist.  Few caster mobs have a lot of dps compared to mellee, and if root breaks they don't come running right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't have vp3, nor do I have clicky root, but I can easily solo two 500 hitting summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
here's what I do.<br />
<br />
Spell Lineup:<br />
<br />
1.  Nihili (or Turgurs if you don't have it).<br />
2.  Malos<br />
3.  Malicious Decay<br />
4.  3 minute root (don't use 1min root)<br />
5.  Yoppa Heal (fast heal)<br />
6.  Spiritual Serenity (hot)<br />
7.  Pained Memory (canni)<br />
8.  Panther<br />
9.  Some dot depending on mob resists. (usually Yoppa)<br />
<br />
So, you see two mobs standing near each other:<br />
<br />
Mob A and Mob B.<br />
<br />
(start at max spell distance from mobs)<br />
<br />
1.  Cast a hot on yourself, cast a hot on your dog. Cast panther on yourself, cast panther on your dog.<br />
2.  Target the mob you want to root.<br />
3.  Cast malicious decay on the mob you want to root (second mob aggro's and is inc now)<br />
4.  Quickly switch targets and sick your hotted dog on the second inc mob.<br />
5.  Switch back to the mob you want to root and hit VP root.<br />
<br />
If all goes well at this point, one mob is rooted and your dog has the attention of the mob you'll be killing shortly.<br />
<br />
6.  Nihili or malos then turgurs the mob your dog is proc'ing like mad on.<br />
7.  Target the rooted mob and malos then slow then 3 minute root him. (or if VP3 don't bother rerooting now, just malos and slow).<br />
8.  Rehot your dog if necessary.  Dot the mob, and either melee or heal dog, depending on how hard your dog is being hit.  Remember, you take dmg far better than your dog does, and with panther on, you'll probably want to melee anyways.<br />
9.  Remember to reroot the second mob periodically, and keep a hot on yourself and hit canni the second it comes up.  <br />
10.  Finish first mob and kill the second.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, pulling two hard hitting mobs is all about the initial pull and controlling the second mob.  Putting a heal over time on yourself and your full buffed dog before the pull buys you valuable time to lock down the add and get things debuffed.  <br />
<br />
A basic rule of thumb for solo'ing consistently is this:  If my heal over time cannot keep up with the mobs slowed dps, I will not bother trying to solo them unless I really need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Everyone here has made really excellent points but I just wanted to add a couple comments since I solo most of the time and did so almost exclusively from lvls 30-65...<br />
<br />
Everything they have said about VP is so true, you will love it once you get used to using it.  It is truly a soloer's dream.  Being able to quickly knock an add away from you without waiting for gem refresh is awesome, esp if you are tanking one and root breaks, you can just slam it back out of the way before it ever gets into your melee range most times.<br />
<br />
When you are pondering your next solo session, you are basically forced into a primary decision that guides your strategies:  are you going to tank the mob or rootrot it?  <br />
<br />
Each has its value and place.  Tanking is fun and effective, more so now than ever due to leopard/panther.  But with solid rootrot techniques, you can take on some real baddies, safely, as well.<br />
<br />
If you decide to use a tank strategy then use your pet and I would recommend getting fluffy set up with conv.  He will be able help you on adds a heck of a lot more.   If you are rotting, don't bother with the pet unless he's needed for pulling.<br />
<br />
Pulling with debuffs such as malos or MD (depending on if VP is ready at the moment when you pull) will help a lot because you know that you will be able to quickly get at least 1 mob parked rapidly and then move on to slowing and dealing with any adds.  <br />
<br />
Spells and efficiency:  either style can be very demanding on your mana, because a) tanking you have less time/ability to cann while getting beat on (depending on the difficulty of the mob) or b) while rootrotting you are stacking up those dots alot (hint: don't forget to use our slow arse disease dots for high-hp mobs, they are very mana efficient). It is alot easier to sit on your mount and cann safely while rotting, but for high hp-mobs it can simply take longer to kill them.  You kind of have to experiment to see what works best for you.  I like being able to kill at a medium to high pace steadily with no pauses between pulls.  This means that most times I rot them and go to pull the next just before the previous one dies. <br />
<br />
Really, truly, believe me when I say that the torture involved in getting Bane is worth it.  I see on your magelo that you have Sisslak but with Bane you will be able to kill so much more quickly and efficiently.  Strongly recommend getting it!!!  If you don't use tribute, another thing that can help soloing a LOT become more efficient with your relative mana/hp pool is to tribute affliction efficiency V and an extra 4FT to max your worn cap.  If you have those running just while soloing, it's easy to maintain that amount of tribute and it makes a huge difference until you get focii to replace.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to use spellsets to quickly swap dots and debuffs in and out and remember to always try to use HoTs instead of blast heals whenever you can squeak by.  <br />
<br />
Our mana/hp pools are similar and I can easily solo (more efficient to rot) 2 of the WoS murks at a time with no downtime and no risk involved.  They are a bit more challenging and fun than many others in the area because they run darn close to bard speed.  They are a good place to practice your newly polished soloing skills :)  <br />
<br />
For kicks and fun, go claim Drunt's camp in NC and solo it for a couple hours.  Safe, single pulls and you should be able to solo Drunt with a little practice.  Solo at 68, I make 7-8% AA per elite dragorn, except for on the PH/named (less here).<br />
<br />
Shoot me a tell if you have any questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Learn pet pulling.  <br />
<br />
1: Summon highest level green /con dog (Spirit of the Howler), buff him with hp &amp; ac &amp; avoidance &amp; sow (or gopher if you're inside), and a cleric buff if you can get it.  Hotkey /pet back off if you don't have /pet hold.  <br />
<br />
2: Stay way back, and send him in, watching HoTT on the mob you sent on.  As soon as doggie pops up on HoTT, back him off all the way to you.  Mob will come alone :)<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
SoW is neccessary, because if doggie dies, mob agro will xfer to you, and the mobs you're trying to split from will assist and charge.  This scenario, the pet dying, is why the technique is more popular with sk/necro. they can do it while feigned, so if pet dies mob just loses agro period.<br />
<br />
The plan is somewhat touchy on casters, since they'll sometimes stop to cast and dog will run out of chase range.  In the example you gave, you'd pet pull the melee mob, then after killing that go charge the caster on his spawn.<br />
<br />
This is definately not freshman level shaman-ing.  Probably 300-level if you manage to pet pull and still get the mob debuffed when he arrives where you want to kill him.  There is a somewhat steep learning curve, even with it all spelled out for you, but it's a really valuable technique when you get it down.</div></div><hr />

This takes way too long, due to the annoying-as-hell recast timer on all our pet spells. just root one, hit it with malos, and you're good to go. if it breaks root, VP it back out of range and overwrite it with magic root again. malos is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Suspend Minion if you care about melee dps from the 67 pet.  Note that pet level doesn't affect Leopard dps at all, as far as I can see.  Juggling mobs carries risk, so if you can single-pull, you don't have to deal with that risk all through the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Man I hate casting and recasting green pets, its just a PITA.  If it's feasible to just kill 2 without the split, I'll always go for that.  Splitting is a valuable skill to learn but certainly not something I'd break out on regular solo sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All the above are great suggestions and should probably be stickied.  I can't really add to it but will comment the Tirrunun mobs (both Delve and Lair) are extremely difficult to keep root on.  Not sure I ever got a root to last for more than about 1 sec.  I tried both VP3 and regular root. <br />
<br />
It basically was a matter of whether I could slow any adds fast enough and keep myself healed enough to stabilize the situation.<br />
<br />
I don't think your problem is so much technique as which mobs you're trying to do.  Green pet pulls are probably your best bet where you can't root reliably.  Once the spawn is broken and you can pull solos you can go back to real pet for extra damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why would you have to recast pets?  If they die it's a Bad Thing (tm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They always die eventually :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have no problem soloing single mobs.  Singles are a breeze for me.  My problem comes when I get more than one.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.Several additional things will make it easier.  <br />
<br />
1.  Ancestral aid; epic 1.5; pet affinity.  This combination gives you two clicky HoT that land on both you and dogdog.  Except with extremely hard-hitting mobs, this will give you one minute where you can tank 2 mobs while dogdog tanks a third one.  That's enough time to get the matter under control again.<br />
<br />
2.  Virulent Paralysis 3. As others have said, this is very powerful. Used with Malicious Decay it will park many mobs with very nearly 100% reliability.<br />
<br />
3.  Swarm pets.  At the highest level these will tank many trash mobs for the full minute they are alive, and do some decent damage while they are at it.<br />
<br />
4.  Developing a rhythm.  The twentieth time you break a particular spawn is a lot different from the first time you do it.  You really do learn a fairly intricate pattern of keystrokes, targetting Mob A, casting, targetting Mob B, targetting yourself, targetting your pet.<br />
<br />
You don't have all those aa yet, but once you have them, the job becomes considerably easier.<br />
<br />
Breaking a three spawn then looks like this.<br />
<br />
Move invis into the place you want to fight from.  <br />
<br />
Target one mob, a melee mob by preference.  Cast VP (or if you have learned that it is needed, MD and then VP Mob A.  Mob A is punted away, two mobs are beating on you; pet is attacking one of those mobs, Mob B.<br />
<br />
Target the other mob, Mob C, and slow it.  You can now ignore Mob C for a bit; you just have to watch your own health.<br />
<br />
Target dogdog if his health is 40 pct or lower and heal him, then slow Mob B; if his health is high enough, slow Mob B and then cast HoT on dogdog.<br />
<br />
Cast SoL on dogdog.<br />
<br />
Target dogdog's mob (Mob B), call swarm pets.<br />
<br />
Target one swarm pet and cast SoL.<br />
<br />
Cast HoT on yourself.<br />
<br />
Mob B should be dead pretty quick, and all the pets will switch to Mob C, which has been beating on you for the last 40 or 50 seconds.  Cast Bane on Mob C.  This Mob will probably outlive your swarm pets, but not by much.<br />
<br />
Now its down to you and dogdog versus Mob A, and VP is about to break.  Refresh VP it if you need a moment to catch your breath.  Otherwise slow it, cast SoL on dogdog, cast Bane, and watch the mob die.<br />
<br />
I do this all the time.  Sometimes it has more of a pinch:  that's when you use Ancestral Aid or Epic clicky.<br />
<br />
Good luck. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: fixed the formatting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you get stuck on splitting a caster and non-caster pair, it can help to root off the melee first because casters will typically start with a spell or take a break from beating on you to cast as well.  This leaves a bit more time for you to react to both mobs.  <br />
<br />
Make sure you are getting a resistance debuff in on whatever you are rooting, because it tends to increase the chance that your root will hold for the duration.<br />
<br />
Using a HoT on pull is key as well, and keep in mind that you can stack the epic 1.5, AA HoT, and TorporX for some serious beat resistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow, pet affinity comes into it's own... brilliant - I totally didn't think of that at all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lauron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">nice post, thanks for the info, I too mainly group but have started solo'ing a bit.  Would be great for this to be stuck at the top, or nominated for medicine cabinet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One of the big problems we have soloing is lack of snare.  Some mobs run very fast and can be a big PITA.  Also our new procing spell will break root.  So what you do is try and have two mobs with you if you can.  If you do, one at low health will not run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Great tips here.  I'd just like to stress some of the more important strategies.<br />
<br />
1)  Keep an HoT on yourself while tanking... don't spam quick heals on yourself as that will drain your mana quickly.  As stated earlier, if the slowed Mob you're tanking is damaging you much faster than your Heal Over Time is healing you, pick another mob to fight.<br />
<br />
2) As in pulling for a group, getting control of the initial situation is key to not wiping.  Controlling adds is half the battle.<br />
-----a) Root, VP, pet off-tank, puppy pack...<br />
-----b) Use greenie pet pulling when you need to single pull one mob from a cluster of 3 or more... otherwise just stick to splitting on incoming with root/VP/puppy<br />
<br />
3) Spellsets.  Make sure you have a dedicated spellset or two to soloing.  Personally, I always have GATE up and Spell Haste tribute on when I solo.  I have the Everfrost Spiritstone to get back home, so I always bind myself at or across the nearest zone-in.  Important to have that self-evac already memmed and ready to cast when things go south (low on mana and health) and you KNOW you aren't going to survive.  (Far gone are the days soloing HG in RM and using Cheetah to run away.....lol)<br />
<br />
4) Other tools -- mount (a must-have), defensive AA's (like LR5, ID5, delay death), and SLAM to interrupt casters/healers/gaters.  Also, if you have tons of tribute points, you may wanna try the Second Chance tribute....gives you a chance to instantly be rezzed upon death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Second Chance is terrible.  Plain awful.  It's like 0.5% chance of working, and doesn't heal enough.  If you have 7kish hp or more, Second Chance's heal won't get you out of low-hp agro.  It's basically a tribute copy of the cleric aa, which has all the same problems.  Make no mistake, this ain't no Divine Intervention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Minor side note, if you don't feel like yanking 2 mobs, and don't wish to green con pet pull (i never did manage to make that work, dum dum dog always croaked before he'd come back), You can simply use VP3 to pull.<br />
<br />
I don't mean use it to root one and kill the other, but VP has a spiffy property, providedit doesn't resist, otherwise yer gettin 2. heck do this wrong and you will still have 2 on aggro.  But say you have 2 goblins standing near each other and a medium assist range.  stand out of their aggro range, target one, face AWAY from them (since vp shoots mobs in direction you are facing) and VP one of the goblins to you.<br />
<br />
What happens is this:<br />
Goblin get's VP'd lands between you and his buddy, is rooted and THEN becomes aggro, but he's now aggro outside of his buddy's assist range. Spiffy. You just got a single from a double pull.<br />
<br />
This can backfire, and mob is still in assist range of others and his pals come after ya, in which case get slowin an rootin :)  Or, VP is resisted and his buddies still chase ya down like a dog.  Last option, you just VP'd your mob into a freakin wall and can't target him.  That's always fun too.  only problem with vp pulling, is you are somewhat shootin blind. I'd shot mobs into walls when I swore it was a clear shot heh :D<br />
<br />
Just a stupid shaman trick to tinker with, I use it alot soloing.  First learned it in hard ldons when ldon was new, and some monks I grouped with couldn't split a room, I'd go VP split it for them.  Pissed monks I hung with :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've been informed that the VP trick was an illusion, a myth.  Basically, it would only split mobs that were already really split, but let you feel really tricksy about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have read something along those lines here as well - that the agro was checked BEFORE the mob was moved with VP.

Swarm pets were mentioned...but I like them because they help interuppt casters with the amount of push they give.  If I have a caster who is constantly healing him self, others or nuking the hell outta me...sick pets on him while doing what ever and ususaly they'll take care of that pesky casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Aye, Advanced Spirit Call  &gt; Spell:Complete Healing.  It's nearly impossible to kill those Gating cleric drakes in Lavaspinner without them.  When the wanderers spawn as a cleric, their bind point goes all erratic, so you can't just kill them &quot;on their spawn&quot;, they still Gate-heal themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I still use SC instead of ASC for interrupts, because there are more dogs, and they (reportedly) each push more (but do less DPS) than the ASC dogs.<br />
<br />
No?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've yet to see a mob channel CHeal through the 3 good dogs that do more damage.  So that's what I use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">heh my tatic for mobs that i know cheal is to drop 1 dot on them and keep them rooted and let them cast judgement on me till they are OOM and then they die real quick and judgement rarely hits at all and almost never for full (with mr around 230). yea it takes longer but I use this time to regain mana.<br />
<br />
on the VP trick well sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt kinda like ocasionally you can get buy a mob w/out aggro if you pass his aggro range before it checks aggro.<br />
<br />
Also remember Spritual Channelling I have had this help me finish mobs that I ran OOM on  and just needed just a bit more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Agassa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Great thread so far, lots of knowledge and tips.<br />
<br />
If you're having problems with multiple pulls in DoN zones, i'd say practice your crowd control on something easier. I learned to handle multiple mobs in Charasis, where mobs are easy but come in herds. Just go to a place with lots of adds and practice things like pet pulling, offrooting-oh, and get VP III while you're at it. It rocks socks.<br />
<br />
Suggestions: Charasis-should be easy for you, and you'll have lots of double, triple, quad pulls.<br />
<br />
Luclin zones: I don't know why, but these tend to have a high add-potential with low mob power. Go tear through Akheva, the UP caves or try to hold a camp at the wall near the house in the water- mix of cleric/shadowknight/pure meele mobs, lotsa runners, roamers and trapspawns.<br />
<br />
Try soloing an Ldon (get 2 peple 10 lvls below you to grp with you, start adventure, have them disband) it doesn't matter if you win, it's practice- although you might want to keep the 2 people and do Ruj Ldons for <br />
Bane (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=27111&amp;highlight=Bane)<br />
<br />
Just try something, listen to your fellow shamans and get VP III.<br />
Good luck on your quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Good tips, but going back to the start, Denora's hp is kinda low. 7.1k. I'm betting more than half of you see this hp unbuffed or you have even higher than that unbuffed. Personally, I still dont do well with adds and I'm at 9k hp. I dont like them so I'd rather take the time to pet pull and single a mob than have to deal with adds. Lots of the solo spots that I use, I've gotten the pulls down by trial and error. Made a post on the Spirit Realm about where I like to solo. Check it out. Most of them are VP3 req places though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I've had mixed results with VP-splitting.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Another thing to have is a well stocked potion belt.<br />
<br />
Insta-cast HoT and Heal are priceless for those situations where you've got 2 mobs on you and you -know- you're never going to get off a self-heal without an interruption.  Just remember, they're both on the same timer, so you can only use one of either every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Casting Channelling is priceless too.   Still getting off a spell when stunned can save the day.<br />
<br />
Damage Avoidance is worth looking into.  They've fixed the &quot;Damage Shield&quot; bug it seems, so you wount still do DS damage when DA kicks in, but that always was a bug and just nice to have.<br />
<br />
Invest in finding a good self-clicky Damage Shield!!!  If you start picking up DoN armor you'll find that a LOT of it has +DamageShield modifiers.  I can self clicky up to about a 18 damage shield now if I wear the right gear.<br />
<br />
And on that matter, learn what mobs summon when damaged.  And avoid them.  They're not worth the trouble mostly.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking for a decent Snare object.  I hate the proc snares and the Concoctions are just painful to use (30 second snare, wth!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Where to practice your Root-Rotting....<br />
<br />
I'd recommend pre-60 going to Plane of Valor and doing the golumns in the upper field.   It's easy to get to with invis.  They can mostly be solo pulled.  And if you keep Lev up and SoW boots you can always run for the zone out off the cliff.   Just call the train if there's somebody doing steps.  (almost never these days)<br />
<br />
Once you have that down, move on to same in Plane of Valor.  A bit rougher mobs, better exp.  Pull them to the rezz area to the left of zone in.  Just watch out for the druids and necros PL'ing there by snare-kiting.<br />
<br />
Last in PoP era, head to tables in PoFire.  You can MD and VP3 the fire giants at the tables til your blue in the face at about 65.  Great exp, if you can get flagged to get in.<br />
<br />
Next up is every shaman's favorate solo spot....  &quot;The secret bixie castle&quot;... oh wait... nevermind.<br />
<br />
Then move on to Wall of Slaughter and start in on the Murkglider caves near zone in.  Almost everything is solo-pullable and again, use MD + VP3 till you're sick and tired of it.  Be sure to have worked out your skills first.  Mess up here and you will die quick and painfully.  Nice bonus is that there's a 1 in about a thousand chance of a mini-named that pops in the cave that can drop nice augments.<br />
<br />
Finally, there's several zones in DoN that are just lovely for Root-Rotting.  <br />
I personally liked Ascent, the lack of see-invis a lot of the way was nice.  <br />
I've been told &quot;The Nest&quot; is good, about comprable with PoFire Tables.  <br />
Temple is trival, but watch out for the gaters and healers.<br />
I've spend a bit of time in the other zones trying it out, but not enough to really have a feel for them.<br />
<br />
Anybody have recommendations for more good places in GoD, OoW, and DoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I don't solo much, but 3box DoN missions quite often these days.  You get lots of practice with pulling doing this.  Pet pulling is the bomb.  However, the pet pulling works better with a BL pet or other that gets that 4hit rune.  Can pull the named out of his room single every time with the BL pet it seems.  I use the 56 pet.  58 one is too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Soloing is an art. The more you do it, the better you get.<br />
<br />
There have been a lot of good points made in this thread but one of the more important points was only touched on.<br />
<br />
Know your enemy.<br />
<br />
I cannot emphasize how important knownledge is. Learn which of your spells will land consistantly on which mobs. Resists are the bane of any solo artist.<br />
<br />
Some mobs are vulnerable to Magic, some to Posion and some are vulnerable to both. Learn which DoT's work best on which MoBs. VP will hold it's full duration on some mobs but not on others. Learn which mobs you need to fully debuff and those that you don't. If you do this in every place you solo it will save you much time/grief/mana and make soloing that much faster and effcient.<br />
<br />
There has been alot of talk in this thread about Pet Pulling, Melee Soloing and Pet Tanking tactics.  All of these have thier place. However the reality is that these are only viable up to a point.<br />
<br />
For the higher end stuff such as mobs in the Nest, MPG and Riftseekers root rooting becomes your only real option. This also applies to whatever is a &quot;hard&quot; zone for you and your gear level. There is only so much and shaman can handle depending on thier gear/skill level. There comes a point where MoBs just hit too hard and to fast that melee soloing and pet tanking is either death for you or uses so much mana that it's not a viable option.<br />
<br />
IMOHO If you want to really excell at soloing I'd learn how to Root Rot in your sleep. A really good Root Rotter doesn't even let mobs touch them. You can solo much harder mobs with this method than any of the others.<br />
<br />
The other most important skill I'd suggest learning is root splitting. It's much eaiser to kill 3 properly split mobs at once rather than trying to gain control over the same 3 mobs after pulling with malos, malicious decay or a pet.<br />
<br />
Soloing is all about 2 things:<br />
<br />
What's the biggest mob I can solo? and Where can I solo the best or most efficently?<br />
<br />
If you can answer these two questions then you are off to a good start on learning what to do next.<br />
<br />
And Finally don't be afriad to push the envelope!<br />
<br />
Myself I solo in MPG and The Nest (Non instanced) I didn't really think it was possible to solo in either zone until I went and tried it myself. I took the time in each zone to learn which mobs need to be split, which mobs are vulnerable to which spells, which mobs summon and where I can safely kill solo in those zones.<br />
<br />
Now about 4 months later I have a spot and cycle I do in each zone where I can hunt and collect decent plat as well as gain an AA every 25 - 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Take the time to learn about the mobs and the zones where you want to hunt and you will do well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">To go along with Tyck's suggestion of an DS item you should be able to solo up to the 8th or 9th coldain ring pretty easy (did 8th at 65 and 9th solo at 70) and that will give you a 10 pt clicky DS also if you can get a few groups to finish the ring war, should be 2 or 3 groupable by now, you can get the 10th ring AND a recharagable 1 shot DA (if you keep your dain faction up).<br />
<br />
as far as the pet pull thing goes I use suspended minion maxed out and have a fully buffed top of the line dog and then suspend him then I keep  the lower level memed and just cast it pull and dismissafter the pull if i want to use the good dog.<br />
<br />
also snare spheres are VERY useful I know they only last 30 seconds or so but sometimes that is all you need</div></div><hr />
