<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Byakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there fellow shamans :D<br />
<br />
I recently got 10k from one of my friends so Im thinking of twinking my newly made kitty shaman any suggestion on gear.  I don't know much about prices on my server (the tribunal) so any info u have would be great. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would mark ikky BP up there on the list you're making</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">10k..../drool<br />
<br />
In order of importance here's what I'd get<br />
<br />
1) Iksar Regen BP (5k)<br />
2) 2 x 65 AC/HP rings (1k)<br />
3) Rygorr Legs (500pp)<br />
4) Decent Weapon..eg Beetle Stinger, Drakkel Icegrinder, Frost Giant Femur (2500pp for 2 weaps to keep both skills high)<br />
5) leaves 1k for misc armour pieces</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ikky BP 5k or lower<br />
reif 4k or lower<br />
5ac 55hp ring 400pp a pair or lower<br />
try to get a spell haste of some sort</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Save it all for alchemy.<br />
:)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Get the Iksar regen BP.  currently running 6k on my server, so you need to shop around.<br />
<br />
Then get 4 AC/ 45Hp rings for a couple hundred pp or the 5 ac 55hps.  more bang for your buck at your level.<br />
Then buy some Jaundiced bone armor at 500pp a piece - high AC pieces that will last you until you hit the low 50s.<br />
<br />
Of course, realize that when you twink a char like this you are missing out on one of the coolest parts of the game, IMHO...  upgrading your gear.  (I love holding one item on the mouse cursor and clicking them in and out with the old gear, and watching all my stats jump up and down.)  You will be set for the first 40 levels or so, and probably won't be able to afford to buy/camp anything that will improve your setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;What to buy with 45k&quot; (weeeee!) (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2881) <br />
<br />
(here's a snippet I typed in the 10k thread)<br />
<br />
If you're starting out fresh with 10k, you basically want to decide on one or two nice items and filling out the rest of your spots with something serviceable. First you need to decide on your big items... and while AC, HP, and WIS are all nice, they're not your most important stat. <br />
<br />
Your most important stats are Regeneration and Mana-free damage. Think about it, the more mana you have, the more time it takes you to med it back... you are looking for a way to get your mana back faster- and that's what regen is all about. <br />
<br />
Here are my recommendations: <br />
<br />
1. Get an iksar regen BP. 5 hp/tick = 3000 hp/hour = 1500 mana/hour (if you're a cannibalizing fiend.) <br />
<br />
2. If you spend plan on spending a lot of time outdoors, get a horse. Get the cheapest horse, and turn the models OFF. Turning the models off allows you to cast SoW on yourself without it being overwritten by the horse speed effect (and you don't have to look at a horse-head all the time.) While on a horse, if you are standing still and not auto-attacking, you are medding. Even while standing. Even while casting. The ability to med while standing/casting is huge. <br />
<br />
3. When you hit level 35 (and if you can find a reasonably priced one) get a fungi staff. They definitely have limitations (they snare you, the effect needs to be reapplied every 5 minutes, and it doesn't stack with regen spells) - but it's mana-free Regrowth... 9000 hp/hour = 4500 mana/hour. Stacks with the iksar regen BP or fungi tunic, too. <br />
<br />
4. Your longer-term items are (of course) the JBB and fungi tunic. <br />
<br />
For now, you'll probably just want the iksar BP. For the rest of spots, here's what I recommend: <br />
<br />
Get the cheap Jaundiced Bone pieces where available (helm, gloves, arms, boots- each a few hundred pp and great AC.) <br />
<br />
Get some 6 AC/65 HP rings- a steal for the money. <br />
<br />
Get a Black Alloy Medallion - stats are pretty good, it's cheap (couple hundred PP) and it will make every spell you cast under level 45 cost 10% less mana. That's a good thing. <br />
<br />
Get an Arctic Wyvern Mask - nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask for a few hundred pp. <br />
<br />
Get a Clay Guardian Shield (Ac 25, +50 HP) - a few hundred pp, and it will last you a long time. <br />
<br />
For remaining spots, grab totemic or ry'gorr. <br />
<br />
Since you'll be tanking your way through the first few levels, a nice weapon will help you out. You'll want to keep both piercing and your blunt skills trained, and make sure to keep your defense skill maxed as you level. As a piercer, the slime covered harpoon is nice (10 dmg, 25 dly, +5 wis, +10 mana) - fast and it can go in your range spot when you're not using it. For a blunt weapon, grab a smoldering brand (9 dmg, 22 dly, procs a minor fire DD at level 1- great twink weapon.) Both should set you back just a few hundred pp. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and good hunting!</div></div><hr />
