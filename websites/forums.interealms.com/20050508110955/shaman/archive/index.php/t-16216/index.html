<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I don't have a log of the chat but I'll start a thread with some important info at least.<br />
<br />
I asked about the poor availability of Remove Greater Curse and stated that it'd be needed lots more due to the AEs and new spells from LDoN.  Of course Absor ignored the question and posted all the dumb necro questions about skeleton illusions /boggle.<br />
<br />
But after the session I asked publicly and Rich Waters (/cheer) answered my question:<br />
 <br />
(rwaters) Chromite: We'll be putting Remove Greater Curse, along with two lower level curse removal spells, on the adventure merchants so you can buy them after adventuring.<br />
<br />
So make sure you don't buy Remove Greater Curse from someone trying to rip you a new one in the bazaar.  Wait for LDoN and do some adventuring to get your spell :)</div></div><hr />

all spells purchased using ldon adventure points (which are gained from successfully completing adventures), from adventure merchants.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cause then there would be no point in buying the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dont worry Gert. Adventure points are easily obtainable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Putting RGC on a vendor is a slap in the face to everyone that has ever had to fight and struggle to get a copy from Ssra. This is nothing more than dumbing down the game.<br />
<br />
So much for making people work for something. After all, you wouldnt want to make people feel that they had accomplished anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The spell really needed to be more common. I am a bit disappointed that they are using it as a means to sell the expansion, but you honestly can't say that it wasn't far too rare for the number of mobs that use curses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was the first person in my guild to get RGC.  I was very proud to have it, and still am.  Even after countless rhag kills, we still only have a few copies in the guild.  Having RGC is something that sets me apart from all the other shamans in my guild, so I kind of liked it.  On raids where we need RGC, I have always had a very important job.  Casting cures may be boring to some people, but when it is a vital role that only I or a select few people can do, I enjoy it.  That being said, I am kind of disappointed to see it become an easy to obtain vendor spell.  Everyone will have it now.  I am no longer special :(<br />
<br />
I guess I see why it is necessary, though.  There is a guild on my server that more or less skipped ssra entirely and still made it to elemental planes.  The only copies of RGC they got, they gave to paladins (/boggle).  I have raided with them a few times, and they have near zero ability to deal with a curse-based proc or AE.  I was the only one keeping their tank cured on the minibosses on the way to agnarr.  Guilds like this are kind of limited on fight like arch mage yozzanainwhatever in pofire.  There's really no way to win without several RGCs, so I am guessing that devs decided to put RGC on vendors so that guilds who skipped content will be on the same level as guilds who didn't.<br />
<br />
Whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's not a matter of skipped content. It's a matter of non-existant content that drops the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ssra spawns are so heavily contested on my server that your entire guild must be in the zone camping them before they spawn. There is still a chance that another guild will come to camp them, petition, and you will both have to roll on who gets the spawn.<br />
<br />
My guild refuses to play that way - it is not fun. We are more than capable of killing the Ssra mobs, but have no desire to put up with that. So for us having RGC available through other means is excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thats exactly how it is on our server as well. Fighting over ssra spawns is a mess. Since they have the technology now I'd really like to see them make ssra and VT instanced where a guild can spawn them once a week or so. There are way way too many guilds fighting over that content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm...well I'm in the guild Jinheim is talking about. I guess he is right, since we only have about 5-10 copies in our guild, we should hire him to come babysit us. Obviously we could not of done Agnarr without him, even though we have done it numerous times now. Besides, what does it matter what class you give it to? Hmm...give it to clerics, yeah that way they can worry about curing everyone while looping. Or maybe shaman, because they don't already have enough things to do on a raid. Paladins DPS isn't that high anyway, why not them?<br />
<br />
Yeah we made it to EP without SSRA, because it wasn't necessary. Besides on a server with 8+ guilds fighting over spawns, alot of times it wasn't even worth it.<br />
<br />
Jinheim, I guess you raided with us on a bad night when our RGC holders weren't there, but don't go assuming you can't do stuff without it, because we have proved you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Before you start yelling dumbdown, remember that even though it will be avaliable on the adventure merchants, the better stuff (Bane, RGC, etc) will only be avaliable once you've done alot of adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Putting RGC on a vendor is a slap in the face to everyone that has ever had to fight and struggle to get a copy from Ssra. This is nothing more than dumbing down the game.<br />

<br />
<br />
What was the slap in the face was putting RGC on only 3 mobs (all linked) in 1 zone in the game.  Having it required in PoP yet providing no means to get it was the slap here (and research didnt come out til LoY).  LDoN finally fixes this problem.  The least they should have done was make it a rare drop off the mind worms in AR like its listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Uhh, I think alot of you are missing the point of the matter here.&lt;br&gt;<br />
1)The spell is rare. Too rare. Its rare because it currently only drops off a few mobs that only big &quot;raids&quot; can get to.&lt;br&gt;<br />
2) SOE knows its a needed spell (they are admitting it by making this availability known) and knows the issues with getting it. They are trying to add it in a manner that is fair to all.&lt;br&gt;<br />
3) The spell will still drop like it always has and will still be valuable.&lt;br&gt;<br />
4) Buying LDoN in no way assures you of getting the spell. It only increases its availablility.&lt;br&gt;<br />
5) The spell will still have to be purchased, albeit with Adventure Points. It may be as one person stated, VERY expensive pointwise. i.e. You may need to gain LOTS of adventure points before being able to purchase it. Therefore it will still remain &quot;difficult&quot; to get. So, if you want to make money on it, get busy adventuring, save your points, and sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lame imho.. was looking forward to one day getting it now it's handed to me on a silver platter.. =( clicky grcs now obsolete too =(<br />
- Yeay, RGC dropping of TWO fricking mobs (maybe 3) in the most griefed, contested, (insert vulgar expressions here) zone makes it fair for most guilds ... Newsflash, there are guilds who skipped Ssra/VT completely and are in elementals. They had no access to RGC wich is a pretty key spell in many encounters. VI finally made a good move making an essential spell available to many. Oh and right click clickies will be obsolete? Pass the crackpipe please, I have to waste a spell slot for RGC while right click users have it easy. But yeah, obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">All the rightclick RGC items I've seen are useless. The cast time on them is so long that whoever you are curing will be hit by another AE just as you cure the first one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just when I thought we shaman could of been a minor threat with new curse line dots...<br />
<br />
RGC can be bought from a merchant.<br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />
At least make our curse line be lure -300, or steal mana AND hp at 512 a tick for 4 ticks, that would rock.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wow, trying to make this sound bad? Like trying to kill one of three highly contested mobs or sitting on your ass for weeks in CT sewers is something of an accomplishment?<br />
<br />
Nah, it isnt. And this &quot;Wawawa, RGC will be vendor buyable&quot; sounds too much like &quot;Wawawa, they upped Torpor drop rates, Im no longer l33t for having it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Try to distinguish yourself by how you play, not by the tools you play with...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Are they gonna have any other spells for sale this way? That would frankly be awesome.<br />
<br />
Imagine. Rather than sitting on your butt camping the emperor, or having your guild clear out a zone for you, you could just take a group, brutalize a few dungeons, and pick up a spell. It'll be about as tough as getting Malo out of DokB, i'm sure, if not tougher, since what I saw of the point system was pretty pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wonder if regular Remove Curse will be on the adventure merchants too, the one that only drops in Echo Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The spell really needed to be more common.

<br />
Ironically enough I scribed my copy last night which dropped from AL.  I have to agree though, the sheer rarity of this spell has been pointlessly frustrating.</div></div><hr />
