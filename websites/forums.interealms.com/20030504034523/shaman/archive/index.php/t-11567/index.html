<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if this is live yet?  I know the components already drop (got staff shard of luclin, yeath 70 left, and mist of povar all off goo's in PoD), but my question is...  Has anyone actually found enough components to do a single spell yet, and if so, have that had a wiz/ chant/ nec/ mag attempt a combine?  I have heard it's live, and working, and I have also heard it's not available till next patch.<br />
<br />
For those that are willing to try, and if you get a DNC, have the researcher put a parchment and quill into the lexicon to see if that works (all the pure caster over 50 spells require those two items).  Also, the combines must be done in the new research books handed out by the NPC's in Gulf of Gunthak, not the old ones.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

I wanna find this out too...<br />
<br />
Thanks much for actually posting WHAT MOBS the research items came off of... PoD has been good to me as a solo spot, but haven't gotten a drop yet.<br />
<br />
I gots me a Staff Shard of Luclin too ;)...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As of this morning (11 March) the bits for Primal Essence were DNC for a mage and an enchanter, both with and without parchment &amp; quill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoth Utgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you sure have the correct recipe for Primal Essence? I've seen two different recipes, one requiring Yaeth's 73 R (from this board), and one requiring Yaeth's 71 R (from Eqtraders.com). Not sure which is correct, but try both.<br />
<br />
I'm missing one component from all the spells I'm trying for, so haven't attempted to get a combine yet myself.<br />
<br />
Btw, Cazic Thule seems to be a good place for the new research stuff. In the short little while I was there last week, I saw two components for Torpor and Primal Avatar drop within about 20 minutes of each other (in sewers), along with a few others I didn't bother looking up.<br />

Currently working on getting the words and I'll see if they can do it. Already have the spell so it's no loss for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bathemael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is researching of spells linked for certain classes?  I've heard that Necros have to research Cleric spells, Ench - Shm.  Is this true?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>thunderpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any INT caster can research any WIS healer spell. So a mage, chanter, necro or wizzie can research Aego, Torpor and/or Moonfire as long as they have the correct book, words and high enough research skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
doh... Islowen. i got three drops..Staff shard of Luclin, Yaeth 70left and mist of povar too! I just hope it isn't like this for a good part of our community or there is a serious code problem of the loot table ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nbinen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can confirm that at least some of the recipes are working.<br />
<br />
An enchanter friend created my Everlasting Breath spell for me using quill, parchment, Yaeth's 50 (left), and a Sliver of Moonstone.<br />
<br />
As far as Primal Essence goes, I have seen yet another recipe that calls for Yaeth's 61.  That combination is DNC.  Which combination did you try Bathemael?<br />
<br />
EQTraders has recently added a section for spell research which is very well organized and includes a cross-reference to show what spells can be created with a particular research item:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The PE version with Yaeth 73 R is the one we used.<br />
<br />
And Everlasting Breath is also an int-caster spell, so it's been in the game for a while.  Anybody have a purely shamanic spell successfully researched for them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Both caster and priest recipes should be live.  If something listed on EQ Traders isn't right please drop a note saying so, preferably in the forums there but I try to keep an eye out here too.  :)  Niami will report it to Frizznik (the new EQ tradeskill dev) for fixing.  There's already been one recipe that turned out to be wrong in the book in game.  Part of the reason that these haven't been officially announced as live is that there are still some kinks to be worked out.<br />
<br />
The main thing is, with so many variations floating around and as confusing as those bloody page names are, we need to know exactly what ingredients were combined and gave a DNC.</div></div><hr />

Where'd you get the sliver of moonstone, if you don't mind my asking? :)  A friend found the page for me (in Dulak, on the Windscorn boat, I believe), but I still need that darn sliver.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>nbinen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unfortunately, I bought the Sliver of Moonstone in the bazaar.  I'm not sure where it actually dropped.  Sorry.  :)<br />
