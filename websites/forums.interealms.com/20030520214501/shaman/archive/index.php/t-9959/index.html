Hill giants I refuse to touch within 20 miles of. The zone is cluttered with mean people (killstealers), stupid people (level 30's kiting Hill giants for 10 minutes delaying spawn times by huge amounts) and whiners.<br />
<br />
is there anywhere I can go to make some decent coin at this level? I was thinking possibly farming tradeskill items and then selling them in the bazaar (Like acrylia) but I couldn't think of any efficient places to do so nearby.<br />
<br />
If you could also give the suggested selling prices of the loot that results that would be great because since this is my first character I probably won't know what to sell it for.</div></div><hr />

Acrylia in Dawnshroud Peaks (spelling suxors) sell small for 100 large for 150<br />
<br />
