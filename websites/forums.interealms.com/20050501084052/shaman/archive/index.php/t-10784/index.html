<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it was a tough choice. Actually saw Malo AND Torpor for sale in the bazaar today. Of course I couldn't afford either, but I broke down and begged friends for the pp and I got Malo!! I figured Malo would help me get Torpor and I couldn't pass up Malo for 50k! The guy selling Torpor was asking 65k......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you raid a lot then Malo was the better choice<br />
<br />
If you solo then Torpor would have been better, but malo is still good.<br />
<br />
EDIT: grats btw...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats again, Genine. I can imagine your heart skipped a few beats when you told me malo was no longer up for sale which was just temporary. I go LD often in the bazaar, I'd been sweating every minute of that transaction :)<br />
<br />
Hopefully I'll be there someday. I can't wait for the day I no longer see:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">grats on the purchase.<br />
<br />
Seems people are starting to wise up. Saw 2 copies of malo for sale on Tunare in that price range (give or take a few thousand).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">are people selling them back???<br />
<br />
yesterday i saw malo at 100k on karana.. as I don't think the same guy would have sold it 50k today.. so we have had 2 malo and 1 torpor on karana in 2 days?? woaa unbelievable<br />
<br />
anyway as i'm still broke.. couldn't afford them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats on picking up Malo for a reasonable price.<br />
Hehe, one copy of Torpor for sale tonight on Tholuxe, 100K, /sigh. Of course as slow as I level it might actually be available and reasonable by time I hit 60. :) <br />
edit: Oh, the same guy had a copy of Q, for a measly 150K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Andisoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cool bro, looks like we are both having a good day. <br />
<br />
I finally got my last 65 spell yesterday (Blood of Sayrn) with a rune i obtained in Plane of Earth.<br />
<br />
For those who dont know, Blood of Sayrn is the most rare 65 Shaman spell to get back from the otter. One night we turned in 15 runes and got 9 Malos's, 4 Torpor 2's and 1 Focus of Seventh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What's Malo? ;)<br />
<br />
Grats Goosh!<br />
<br />
Krup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grats!! It sounds like a tough choice, but either way, you win! I have a much higher level of appreciation of malo now that I have it and use it. It's sooooooo nice not getting a resist on our resists debuff spell. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks guys!<br />
<br />
As far as raiding, my guild is part of an alliance that is on rotation. We are just starting to move our way up the rotation list. We killed Sev, so now we move up into Talendor rotation. I don't really raid 'a lot' but I do show up at almost every alliance event and I do believe that I am the only shaman in the alliance with Malo. I figured it will make our fights easier which, in turn, would better my chances for Torpor drops! With my luck we will get 2 Malo drops or something :p We are also looking at starting HoT raids and figured this would be the biggest help. I rarely solo. If I want to solo I log on my wizard alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Malo is certainly a difference maker.  I cannot remember how many times that it has helped me alot in just trying to get something slowed.  In fact, in PoV and up I tend to cast malo on the pull, and then slow once it allows me to cast again, thereby upping my chances at effectively landing slow 1000 fold.<br />
<br />
Congrats though.  I know that I was pretty excited when I managed to snag myself one.  I think that I have saved myself countless times with Torpor, as well as kept myself near full mana almost constantly with it, but without malo, then it would not have been near as easy.</div></div><hr />
