<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know there is allot about class ballance atm ( and there will allways be ) <br />
<br />
but what about race ballance ?<br />
<br />
at the summit racial aas was dismissed because people should not get punished for a choice they made 5 years ago <br />
<br />
but are they not doing that to the trolls and iksars atm? ... <br />
<br />
regens was changed some time ago so every race now regens allot faster the longer they sit on the ground. but still trolls and iksars have a 20% exp &quot;nerf&quot; that have not been changed <br />
<br />
for those who dont know that much about the exp mods to races&gt;<br />
<br />
halflings about 5%+ ...  no idea why but i gess it is because they are cute and tasty<br />
barbarians have a 5%- because of slam ( or so i have been told )<br />
ogres have a 10%- because of slam and immunity from stuns at the front and a small regen boost ( note that this boost should be out of effect now)<br />
trolls 20%- because of the regen they used to have and the slam ability<br />
iksars 20%- because of the regen they used to have and the forage ( skill lvl 50 ) and a small ac bonus because they cant wear plate (been told they also have a stat nerf but havent checked that my self. and that does not really matter any more since stats are so easy to raise)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly why I proposed racial AA in the first place AND brought up a case against Racial exp penalties on the EQLive forums.<br />
<br />
I don't understand how racial AA's would &quot;punish&quot; people, and class AA's don't. Ah well. Just delete all races but Frogloks and Dark Elves and let both be all classes.</div></div><hr />

true that was the way it used to be ... every race had its posetiv and negative side ...<br />
<br />
the thing is ... i cant understand why did they have to change something that have been ballanced and accepted for over 5 years ? <br />
<br />
everyone knew what they were going into when they chose to play a certain race ...</div></div><hr />

Hi.<br />
<br />
Race doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
But race does matter. People do get punished for picking a certain race. Iksars cant use the JBB or any other plate armor. Trolls and Iksar have a 20% exp bonus because of their enhanced regeneration (from what Ive heard). And certain races cant use some armors and weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, and literally every time they increase the level cap 60-65, 66-70, those same races get a 20% penalty that they DIDN'T choose.  For the most part, when people made race selections, they knew what it was and how long it would last--to level 60 and not farther.  Now they get that extra 20% penalty on exp from 61-70.  If you could click a button and switch from a troll to a frogluk and also get 30AA worth of exp, would you?<br />
<br />
How about when it's level 100 and you could change and get 200AA?  When does the penalty stop?  Regen was effectively nerfed, wasn't it?  Anyone want to tell me our standing regen is worth a 20% penalty since the seated regen was changed?<br />

<br />
That should say 20% exp penalty, not bonus.  But i as a Troll dont notice it if there is one, its been that way for 65 levels, im used to it i guess :)<br />

No, the standing regen isnt worth the 20% penalty. You're right. I forgot about the regen changes.</div></div><hr />

this is not about how well each race acts in the high end ... race does not matter much there .... this is about how you get up there! .... this is about getting punished for a choice people made 5 or so years ago ... yes allot are lvl 65 now so it does not matter much to them ... but when the lvl cap is raised to lvl 70 wont you fell somthing when you see just about every race lvl 20% faster than you killing the same number of mobs as you ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The races are pretty balanced though in my opinion. That is, other then the hopefully-to-be-fixed regeneration and the barbarian experience penalty (5%?).</div></div><hr />

     Every race has its drawbacks...Ogres are huge, take up lots of space, are evil, not as messed up in faction as the Iskar, and they seem to run as slow as old people driving on sundays...I dont care how fast other people level..I care about how fast I level...Im a big meat wagon with a taste for halfling and gnome...Little people beware..Its dinner time and your on the menu...<br />

that was the way it used to be ... i chose to play a iksar because they had a better regen compared to some of other other races and accepted the 20% nerf because of it ... but now that they have removed that bonus compared to others what is the point with the 20% nerf ? <br />
<br />
and yes i feel left out in the cool because i lost one of the posetive sides of my race but while all the negativ sides are still there</div></div><hr />

<br />
first off i chose my race because of the extra regen they had compared to others ... and i accepted the 20% nerf because i could see a reason for it ... what i dont like is that after 4 years they deside to change how ever race regens so we now lost the bonus regen we had compared to other races <br />
<br />
you chose your race because of their looks ... how would you feel if they desided to change that into somthing that you dint like? and could do nothing about<br />
<br />
lvling does not matter that much to me any more since i am used to the slow exp  ... how ever the fact that i lost my bonus regen compared to others does matter to me since they have done nothing to replace that bonus</div></div><hr />

Race doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So if my math is correct, you take a Barb and a Troll and start them at the same time, and lvl them to 65 together with same play time, the Troll would only be 55 1/4, when the Barb hit 65 ((.15 x 65) - 65).<br />
<br />
That's a HUGE difference.<br />

<br />
No...<br />
<br />
Bashes and kicks do not immediately interrupt Ogres from the front EVER. Ogres always get a channeling roll to regain their spells, as if they had been hit with a regular attack. <br />
This isn't the case with any other race. 99% of the time a succesful bash or kick will interrupt my spell, even when it doesn't result in a stun.</div></div><hr />

When was this apparent nerf? Perhaps you're thinking of the time they nerfed the AA regeneration (not racial regeneration) to the level of every other race. If you remember, it used to be double that of the other races, through fault or design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They apply that to race, but not to deity.  From a RP-persepective, it's certainly plausible to add quests to change your deity.  But SOE has no problem continuing to punish those who picked a crappy deity, or, worse yet, no deity at all (ergo, no access to cultural armor).  <br />

<br />
I think saying &quot;nerf&quot; here in the above post was incorrect.  What the poster was refering to was the recent change in sitting regen where the longer you sit the faster you regen health.  <br />
<br />
I chose a troll because I liked being able to regen faster and have less down time then other races and I had no problem paying a 20% penalty for it.  But now, I don't regen at twice the rate of other races, so why should I have to pay 1/5th of my experience to this missing bonus?  <br />
<br />
Yes, trolls/iksar still regen faster than other races, but no where near what it was before.  I don't feel we should lose the penalty, but we should definitely have a much smaller penalty, trolls - 10% (the now tiny regen bonus is no longer better, or as good as, the ogre frontal unstunnability) / iksar 15% (because of forage and AC bonus).</div></div><hr />

<br />
racial regens was nerfed when they gave a great regen to every race a few patchs back ( the longer you sit the more you regen for ) ... there was perfect logic behind the aa regen nerf<br />
<br />
people are allways thinking about class ballance so noone but trolls and iksars took any real notice of this ... the bad side of it that is</div></div><hr />
