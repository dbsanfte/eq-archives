<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Topic pretty much says it all, I'm going to hit about 10k in the bank soon and was either going to get the cheapest horse or an earring of the solstice.  See but now I can't make up my mind!<br />
<br />
Which would you get if you had my gear?  (magelo in sig)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very good question, I was concidering the same thing.   My gut feeling is if you spend more time outdoors the horse would be the best bet and when I eventually get around to playing again I'll spend most my play time in PoP.<br />
<br />
Anyone with direct experience to contribute?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
WITHOUT a DOUBT, get a horse. :)<br />
The cheapest glue-factory horse will give you a tremendous boost in mana regen.  ESPECIALLY if you have a JBB.<br />
<br />
The Solstice earring is a nice earpiece.  But you won't notice the FT1 effect if that's the first FT item you've ever put on.  I have both.  The Solstice earring was a nice upgrade for my earrings from the Tribunal earring I was wearing, but didn't change anything.  The pony immediately improved my soloing power from the very first mob I killed astride my glue-factory rescue pony.<br />
<br />
You may like dungeons.  Fine.<br />
Realize most of PoP is outdoors.  Both the Plane of Innovation &amp; Plane of Decay have some amazing exp grind spots for the high 50's &amp; low 60's player.  If you are mid-50's there are some great areas outdoors to grind on the moon.  High 40's there's CoM...outdoor dungeon!  Low 50's there's lots of places you can solo astride your pony.<br />
<br />
Grinding on horseback will make your mana stretch that much farther.  NO aggro from switching out spells.  That's significant in PoP when sit aggro can end up wasting cleric mana on you and possibly wiping your group.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice,  I'll go rescue a pony from the glue factory tonight ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just to reinforce, get the horse!<br />
<br />
I tried to go into a dungeon recently after about 9 levels of being outside with my horse and I had to leave after about 5 minutes. I make so much more exp being able to chain pull while duoing war/shammy outside that the dungeon exp bonus doesn't even matter. Horse is about as nice to have as a fungi, if you solo outside, maybe even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just to clarify<br />
<br />
HORSE!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I'm to the point I have going into dungeons because I'm always forgetting to sit. The way I play I am always casting SOMETHING! I have 0% down time so a horse is worth it Wieght in gold!</div></div><hr />

<br />
With KEI it makes even MORE of a difference.  As your are medding constantly while on horse and not moving, attacking or casting, the KEI gives you that much more mana to play with.  Wanna nuke?  Gopher it!  Give the JBB a rest!<br />
<br />
I'm about half way to buying my cheapo horse.  Once I get the plats, I'll be staring at his flea-bitten head whenever I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">just curious qabout this.<br />
<br />
can't be on a horse and be in bearform too right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, you can't be on a horse and in bearform as well.<br />
<br />
I'd go horse all the way. All the reasons have been said before this post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>baazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd never really considered buying a horse before, but after reading this thread I thought I'd give it a shot. I cleaned out my bank account - buffed up my charisma and headed to the stables. I grabbed Kei and took my new nag to my current hunting grounds (Spirocs in TD) and mounted it. The first thing I noticed - Great big horse head blocking my view. This was very annoying but on a hunch I cast shrink on myself and the horse head disappeared, though still about half the time I tried to click on or loot a mob I'd end up selecting myself or conning my horse. There were also two other annoyances that became apparent. First the acceleration and deceleration periods take some getting used to - I wasn't always sure when I stopped to cast a spell. Second on horseback you can't crouch to interrupt a spell - didn't realize how useful that was until I couldn't do it anymore. Despite the annoyances I noticed a marked improvement in mana recovery. From the time I got to the Island to the time my Kei gave out (slightly less than two and a half hours) I pulled in just over 3 yellow in exp. I'm normally happy getting 2 yellow per Kei. All told I think it was definitely worth it. I'll be keeping my horse and looking to upgrade to a faster one in the future - I just wish Iksars could purchase a mount that better suited Iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Whilst not having a horse, I would probably say not to a horse if you are 60 with aa's, I rarely sit to med nowadays relying on canning. Reduced aggro on spell changes would be nice but most of the times that this is critical is on a raid and they tend to be indoors.<br />
<br />
Even grinding with my monk i rarely sat pre 60 and I did most of my dmg via jbb (later epic as well), i worked out I could cann my slow mana back during the fight duration (no fungi as well or would have been even easier).</div></div><hr />

Well, your still missing out the the mana regen you would get while meditating, while doing all of the above.  I also almost never sit, I'm usually pulling, slowing, and trying to get in as many cann 4 casts between cann 5 refresh times.  But I still have more mana because I sit on a horse with all models off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, a horse makes a lot LESS of a difference with KEI. <br />
<br />
Let's say you get 25 mana per tick medding. If you are standing, with no horse, you get 1 mana per tick. With a horse, you get 25 mana per tick... 25x the mana regen.<br />
<br />
With kei, you get an extra 14 mana per tick, whether medding or not. So without a horse, standing, you get 15 mana per tick, and with a horse you get 40 mana per tick... About 2.5x the mana regen.<br />
<br />
So a horse makes 10x more difference with no kei...<br />
<br />
So get one :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I picked up Stumbles the epileptic horse about a week ago.  No way I could live without it now.   Only problem I have is now I'm always a little itty bitty shaman (damn horse ears) instead of my usual huge self.  Horse all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Aye the horse is just awesome with mana recovery.  I can pull a mob at lvl 43 with togor's. Pull the critter back to my waiting doggie pet and send it in.   Hit it with my cripple line and venom of the snake and scrourge for good measure too.  Then i cast my glue factory horse.  Canni a few times to get back to 80m and let the pet eat the mob.  Fight lasts like 50 to 60 seconds and if i want i can speed it up with a roar or two.  Click off my horse since its slow as can be im at usually 90m and 80 health pet is at 80 health and i pull my second mob.  Hehe if you can get a horse buy one trust me it will make being a shammy much more fun and alot easier too.  <br />
