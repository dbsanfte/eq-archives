<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got stoicism today and think its amazing.. but was wondering does anyone still use chloroplast or greater heal? and if so why?  I get the feeling that stoicism is completely better in everyway except maybe for that heal that you need to get in while they are running away or really low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chloroplast heck ya still use it but I think you mean, Chloroblast though.  Stoicism is great but yeah I still use SupHeal myself a lot of the time, since it's a heal over time it has its limitations for tank heal'n if there low.<br />
Also it does have that -30% to attack and snare, and if I remember correctly atk slowing effects negate any haste on target while there in effect so ya got that to think about to.  Great downtime heal though or caster heal =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming you mean chloroblast, not chloroplast...<br />
<br />
I still use chloroblast. In fact, I never have it unmemmed. It's a nice, quick heal and is suitable for backing up the cleric when a caster's being beat on or something. You can think of it in these terms: In an emergency situation, Chloroblast will heal 425 HP in 3 seconds time, with Stoicism you can heal 160 HP in 6 seconds time. You can see how it can be a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
Stoicism is, however, a workable main group heal, and efficient with it. It's great for cannibalizing also, or for healing casters when the situation isn't immediately lifethreatening. Indeed, because it's a heal over time, you can also do other things (such as cannibalize) while it's in effect.<br />
<br />
I haven't long had Stoicism, and still haven't got a good feel for when to use it - I still use Chloroblast on tanks a lot, to avoid the downsides. I even have been main healer in a PoP group using mostly Chloroblast. :) I've just hit 58, so now I have to get a feel for Kragg's Mending too!<br />
<br />
I'll say this: it's nice having these different types of heals, it gives us options, but it's a pain trying to work out where to fit them all in my spell line up. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best time to use Stoicism seems to me to be when you're 900-1k hp down.  That's with spell regen, Iksar regen &amp; sitting as soon as it's cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the 50's I always kept Chloroblast mem'ed in slot 1 so I could fire off a quick ALT-F1 when I needed a 3-second heal.  Even though chain Chloroblast barely keeps up with tier 1 POP mob damage output.<br />
<br />
I got Torpor not long ago, and I no longer keep it memmed.  At 62, the mobs do so much damage that Chloro can't really keep up, and I need the spell slot bad.<br />
<br />
If I'm serious about healing I will have the 62 quick heal Tnarg's Mending up, but it's damned expensive - 450 mana for 1300 hp, compared to 400 mana for 1950 with the mini-CH Kragg's Mending and 200 mana for 1600ish with Torpor.  And with a cast time of almost 4 seconds, it's not THAT much faster than Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looking again at the original post, since you refer to *Greater Healing* and Chloroplast, I'm now assuming you meant what you said. :) Sorry!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd say, yes, it's still worth keeping Chloroplast/Regrowth up - they're still more efficient than Stoicism in terms of HP/mana, so as long as you're not full health for significant periods of time, they'll still work in your favour.<br />
<br />
As for Greater Healing, a similar thing applies as to my arguments about ChloroBlast above. It's faster to cast, and heals more HP up front, so still worth having memmed as a quick caster heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have never dememed a direct heal.  Torpor/stocism/Q is great but its not a direct heal.  its not going to heal the person right away.  Tnargs mending is an awesome spell, 1300 heal in 3 sec is great, and an awesome O sh!t spell.<br />
<br />
I have heard people say, i dont need a direct heal cause i dont get in O sh!t circumstance, and thats silly.  you dont have control over O sh!t times you just need the fast heal.<br />
<br />
Basicly i have ALWAYS kept a direct heal memed whatever my latest one was.  and look forward to tnargs at 62 its an awesome spell (dont be afraid of its hefty mana cost)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chloroplast is regen, not healing. It keeps working in the background whenever you use Stoicism. One does not replace the other; you should use both.<br />
<br />
During battle, you still need to use regular healing on melees, since Stoicism would seriously slow their attack and movement rate.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's Mending keeps up with PoP damage AND is more mana-efficient than Chloroblast or Superior Healing, so no, it is not too expensive to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I always have torpor and tnarg's up. Always always always. Any time I take down my quick heal, somebody dies. CB is effective as a patch heal, but Tnarg's just puts it to shame.<br />
<br />
I also hate using Kragg's. It costs 50 mana less and does 650 hp less than Tnarg's, but takes three times as long. I can patch and cann twice in the time it takes me to land a incomplete heal. Or, I can fire off two Tnarg's and cann in the time it takes a CH to land and actually do more healing. Mana consumption doesn't even factor into it-- we're shamans. Of course, I pretty much refuse to be healer in groups anymore, so /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ultrazach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 61, I quit using Chloroblast and re-memmed Sup. Heal. Only because I aquired  Improved Healing 3 and a Mana Preservation 3 items. These two focus items (Underking Idol &amp; Ob Death Shroud) have made Sup. Heal worth using again. I frequently get close to a 700 HP heal with Sup Heal now for just a bit over 200 mana. And thats WITHOUT the healing AAs, so I assume it will only get better.<br />
<br />
Now i just need a spell haste item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Having just dinged 55 and done stoicism quest on the same day I now have access to both of them.  I was using stoicism exclusively for self healing, soloing alot and tanking in da face.  But something to note, maybe it's a bug, not sure.  I did my usual solo routine, run around bazaar/nexus donating for aego/virtue, kei + VoQ/haste.  Once I was all buffed up I'm off to solo in Maidens.  So there I am banging away on an ugly Goranga Lookout when I notice I'm down to about 30% health.  I think no prob target myself cast stoicism.  SPELL WILL NOT HOLD!  Cast again, same message.  I'm a little slow in the learning department, so I cast it one more time, and you guessed it, SPELL WILL NOT HOLD!.  Soooo, I root it let dogdog tank for a bit, mem Chloroblast and heal myself, then get back in to kill ugly.  My guess is that there is some affect to the higher level chanter haste spell that negates the snare effect thus not letting stoicism take hold.  Not a problem when I use my own alacrity, or lower level haste spells from a chanter.  Just something to be aware of.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this woth stoicism/topor/Q?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stoicism will not take hold if all 15 buff slots are filled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/nods and agrees with Mukkul<br />
<br />
heh always make sure you have 1 free buff slot for HoT spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I do is to endure that the buff slot display has room to display exactly 15 buffs so if they are all full, which is very common on raids, then click off one that is least desirable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nope, wasn't full buffs, only had about 9 buffs on at the time this happened.  The only one that was out of the norm was the chanter VoQ spell.  Stoicism was not takeing hold for some reason.  When it faded and I put up alacrity in it's place, stoicism would then take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I assume by VoQ you mean Vallon's Quickening.  i dont recall having any issues with that but who knows.<br />
<br />
And even though i have Q, therefore dont have to worry about tanks getting pissed, i always keep tnargs up because you need a direct heal.  i think i would rather demem Q over tnarg just cause i would always want a quick heal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">VoQ = Voice of Quellious I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Torpor/Q definitely stacks with VoQ, did you check that you didn't have some bard slipping selo's in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The reason i assumed vallons quickening when he said VoQ is because a mana regen buff has zero reason to not stack with Q, plus he said he normaly gets VoQ but got something extra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Plz don't ninja my post.. thanks guys for the info.. i'm only 46 so i'm not accustomed to hearing about alot of the spells that i have... i usually solo and maybe partner (never had a full group ever..except to pk) but for the last couple of days it seems more efficient for me to 1. slow mob 2. let dogdog tank for 10 seconds while dotting mob which gains me aggro  3. tank it til i'm around 2/5 health pull back cast stoicism cast venom of the snake which gains me back aggro 4. mob is almost dead by now or dead 5. cast stoicism on pet after its dead and pull again.. with kei i'm able to pull nonstop unless i have to run really far to get mobs ( i would tell you where but its a pretty safe spot for goods to level and i don't need evil/newt visitors coming to say hi =P)  But thanks again for the info!! i do keep greater healing memmed.. and if i have enough mana i cast chloro on myself and then use up the spell slot for something else.</div></div><hr />
