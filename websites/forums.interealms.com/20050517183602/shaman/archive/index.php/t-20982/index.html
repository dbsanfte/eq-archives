EQ2 quote: &quot;Qeynos - the city that shines as a beacon of hope...&quot; (from a voice over in the preview)... Good rocks! Down w/ evil! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I picked an iksar way back for the alteration casting animation :)  Figured with most of my casting being alteration type spells that I might as well enjoy some aspect of it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wish i would have started with iksar, hehe forage in ldon for the potions could have been nice i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Barbarian here, if I were starting over today with what I know now (now that faction is a non-issue) I would be ogre, Stun immunity from frontal attacks is the pwn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Barbarian here - if I could do it again I would be an Iksar because everything about old-model iksars is cool.  The way they look, the way they run, the way they stand, the way they attack, and the way they cast spells is all awesome.  Looks is hands down the #1 factor is picking a race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the other poll was funnier when it implied Barbs weren't real shaman.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">except according to this poll, over half the &quot;real shaman&quot; are Barbarians.  Master race obv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">...Master race obv.<br />
Sez the noam...  =OP</div></div><hr />

Waaaah!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">oh please.. we all know cats are the superior race.. just look at our brothel's in shar vahl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I started as a barbarian Shaman on day 1 of Veeshan.<br />
<br />
Had no idea about the benefits of the 3 races at the time. I chose barbarian because a friend had a barbarian warrior.<br />
<br />
If the same choices were available back then as now, I probably would have gone Iksar. I just like the looks of the Lizard Shaman.<br />
<br />
I still think the different races should get different Pet models...<br />
<br />
A Vah'Shir with dogdog at it's side just isn't right...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Retired shaman is a barbarian. Why? Because I didn't want to play a fat baby in a craptacular newbie zone (ogre) or a fat slob with rabbit ears in a diaper (troll), and, well... I tried to go Iksar, but after drowning four times.... Hey, YOU try being a newbie someday!<br />
<br />
If i could do it all over again, i would go froglok. Small, not blind, GREAT animations, even if the armpr graphics suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Are we supposed to select which race we are, or which race we would choose if we had to do it again. <br />
<br />
I am a Troll. I love it. The regen is sick. However, the XP penalty leveling through the 50s was abusive, to say the least, so if I had to choose over again, I would probably go Kitty, which has nice racial modifiers without an XP penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">oh please.. we all know cats are the superior race.. just look at our brothel's in shar vahl.<br />
<br />
/agree! It's even better when you're both a certified hero of the city AND a &quot;military officer&quot; (see: Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl + Officer's Cloak of Service)... but even besides that, King Raja still says it's &quot;brave of me to approach him&quot;... it's a walk up some f-ing stairs! Not like I got stopped at the door and &quot;State your business&quot;, I just walked in.<br />
<br />
Does any other city allow it's citizens to become a military officer, and a certified hero, and have harems? I didn't think so! Fear the Vah Shir! The Erudites might have flung us to Luclin, but it's their loss now! /cackle<br />
<br />
(Closest only other city I can think of with harems/brothels, is Neriak, and that's just plain kinky - talk about giving a whole new meaning to harm touch, eh? too bad dark elves can't &quot;Lay on Hands&quot; :D Vah Shir can't do either, but, you can't be a hero of Neriak, now can you? unless you find some way to get the trolls out, then you might be a hero)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I am an Ogre.. reason I made an Ogre is cuz my RL buddies were also Ogres. I don't regret being an Ogre, either.. the unstunnability means I can tank things and channel spells that any other shaman would have trouble tanking/channelling. Ever try to cast a spell and get bashed and immediately get interrupted? That don't happen with Ogres! Ogres are teh win!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd be a troll if i could do it all over.  Phatty DE cleric guild quests.  Plus scratching green warts on the ass is always a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, first off, the poll is for what u actually were/are. U can, however, state what u would be if re-done. Heh... Frogloks are alone. I feel lonely =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Does any other city allow it's citizens to become a military officer, and a certified hero, and have harems?

<br />
if you're going by quests then i'm a soldier in the army in gukta, but thats as high as you can go- at least for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vannilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Cabalis has a single (well-used) Half elf maiden behind a locked door, supposedly a trade from a brothel in Neriak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I play an ogre shaman, I made the ogre because the dark team rules...and all my friends were evil.  Not taht I would have made a Barbarian like 50% of you guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I chose barbarian, because I was a barb warrior (first char) killing in halas and saw shaman smoking me in kills, so I thought hey I'll try them, and pretty much only class I played(except my 2boxing monk)<br />
<br />
retired both btw&lt;cancelled acount&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Barbarian, but that's only because Vah Shir weren't available at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Shaman's allways reminded me of indians &amp; stuff, race most close to that was a barb at that time. <br />
<br />
I just couldnt bring myself to play an evil race for a class that for me reflects good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't see my race up there.  Consumate Wood Elf here.  First thing I do in any zone is click my crown :P<br />
<br />
  White haired WE with one eye in silver chain armor is just FAR too damn good lookin ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>horaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I always think of Voodoo and Haitin witch doctors when I think of the Shaman class. Probably all of the DoTs. It's one of those it can go good or evil though, cause it has aspects of the native Shaman or Medicine Man, as well as the Witch Doctor.<br />
 For me though, I was always a Barbarian. Though I have to admit, Iksar are tempting. The stats, AC bonus, and Regen are AWEFULLY tempting. But Barb for me.</div></div><hr />
