<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AnonForAReason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe Im the only one who has this problem, but....<br />
<br />
I am constantly being ignored in guild chat. Most of the time, it is during a raid, and although things *can* get a little spammed at times...its the consistancy that I find insulting. <br />
Example:<br />
On out last raid, I went linkdead in a room, and catching up with the rest of the guild would have meant training them with several mobs that would have wiped the raid, without question (assuming I made it there, and I feel I could have) Now....my whole group knew I was still in there....and its fairly common that a group will report to a raid if someone goes linkdead. I get back in game, I report that Im back, and I double check to make sure that the path to them is not safe. Two people confirm it is not safe. So I ask for a mage and rogue to group up, so I can invited and CoH'ed....few min roll by, nothing. At this point Im thinking respawn is going to be soon, and I kept in mind that Im usually ignored anyways, so I ready Weaponshield hotkey and Thurg gate potion in antipation...One of my best EQ friends knows about my situation (thank God he pays attention) and starts /t ing mages and rogues....still nothing...I make another comment in guild chat...nothing....then I get respawn, I WS, and gate out. Needless to say, I was rather unhappy (why else would I post here about it?) and this is not the first time Ive gone ignored, which really compounded the problem. <br />
Now on a raid with 2 mages...diffusion of responsibility isnt in play, unless both are really lazy. I make no comment about either mage, as I dont know them very well personally, but that seems pretty lazy to me.<br />
<br />
Of course the first thing you (I know I did) might think is, well, maybe you should just speak up more. Type in all caps if you have to. Please keep in mind that I am by nature, a fairly quiet person. Also, along with feeling ignored alot, alot of comments I make as generally unaccepted (Im never rude or vulgar, I just never get a response from people for reasons unknown)<br />
<br />
So I ask those who have actually read all this...is this common to you all as well? Am I wrong in thinking that maybe Im just not liked in my guild, and Im either too stupid to see it or guildmates are hiding it? Does anyone have any ideas how I might remedy this problem? I hate to spam guild chat further with repeated caps messages, but if thats what it comes too... Or is it that Im just stupid/retarded/uninteresting that whatever I have to say couldnt possibly be worth listening to?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have the same problem occasionally, but I find it not to be very often, and usually when I am there is a purpose I grudgingly have to find exceptable. The only thing I can say about my guild is, I have 4 people in there willing to help everyone in the guild on quests, other than me. Which is great being one is a Cleric, another a Paladin, and the other two are Bards. So, whatever we need to do, we pretty much can. What annoys me is the Enchanter, Rogue, and two druids that think of no one and half the time respond to nothing in guild chat at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>corilleous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, u said u asked for rogue and mage right?  my question is, did you blindly mention it in guild chat you were behind and need help or did you actually send tells to the people you needed to get you back in?  i find that a lot of times, people will die, then say in guild, &quot;i need buff a b and c pls&quot;, 5 minutes later they repeat the process.  if i die, i send tells, usually fully buffed again in a minute or so depending on the fight.  also the same thing goes with other things like coh etc.  send tells.  when you just openly say in guild chat, i need this from this class pls, and theirs more then 1 there, like 3 or 4 mages, i guarentee they will all assume the other will get you.  make things easier and talk directly to the people you need to get help from, things usually work out a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have 2 regular hunting partners. They are not slack jawed morons. They are loyal, reliable and thoughtful. We cover each others butts closely. There is never a question of sharing or being there for each other. You never log when somebodys dead, you never leave anybody behind.<br />
<br />
The minute we have to rely on others it goes to crap. Sadly it's not that YOU are being ignored. It's anyone who is not important to THEM at that so-important-moment who is being ignored. Keep your friends close and treasure them, cause they are the only ones you can consistently RELY on.<br />
<br />
When you find a good person in the field, thank and appreciate them. But rely on your friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being ignored in general is a state of being for this ranger on guildchat, *especially* when I'm LFG.<br />
<br />
However, when there's a specific and urgent need for attention such as being part of a raid, IMO there is no excuse barring the raid party being presently engaged (doing mass CR's, engaged in mob, performing a trigger, etc.) or having urgent pressing issues that need to be addressed before yours.  I'm not an uber raider but do recognize that the good raid leader pays attention and if he can't do anything about it at least acknowledges your situation.  Do keep in mind that it's damm easy to miss tells especially if the channel is being spammed with nonsense, so sometimes you do sometimes have to repeat yourself a few times.  That's when it helps to have an advocate double-voicing your concerns.<br />
<br />
In your post, it kind of seems that even if you shouted &quot;I'M NOT GETTING RESPONSES FOR A ROGUE AND COTH, SO UNLESS SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGES ME I'M GOING TO RUN TO YOU AND TRAIN YOUR AZZES&quot; might not have gotten a response either.  though if i was full on tilt i might have announced it and gated out, not actually ruining the raid.</div></div><hr />
