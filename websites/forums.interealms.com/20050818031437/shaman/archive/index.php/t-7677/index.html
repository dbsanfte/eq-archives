<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know what level you can single in bridge area? Or any tactics to do so..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was never able to single the bridge reliably until level 54, occasionally getting adds at 53.  50+ allows you to single the U turn i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I was instill pulling at 42 with only mild problems. I managed to break the whole bridge area and the two spawns up the stairs to either side. The biggest problem is the three spawns that are right in front of and right past the gate respectively. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I could not single pull the three behind the gate past the bridge until 46 (still get adds with Vapor golems, Apparitions and some shadows), until then I had to enstill 2 of, kill one off, reinstill one, kill the other and finally take the third.  Biggest problem in CoM is keeping your pet under contol as it is tight quarters.<br />
<br />
For the 2 in the front you can enstill pull or get aggro on both of em and zone out.  When you come back in the one up the left side will be re-positioned in a spot where you can cast on it from the back of the hall and can be single pulled.  Balconies I still get two quite often but 2 is very easy to manage.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CoM was nice to pull at 45ish range.. solo .. IF I could find a few mobs missing. I hated walking in to the zone to find only myself there... as i had to break the bridge and gate (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did it recently at 51 while I was collecting notes and pages for my epic. Just make sure you are as far away from the gates as you can get and pull with slow.<br />
 <br />
Had to do it for days, until I got all the pages and the spectral dropped the students log :(<br />
<br />
What I did was buffed up my pet, slowed the mobs and debuffed them, then let my pet go to town while I got my mana back up to full in case I ran into trouble with trains. I was able to pull all front mobs then the room where the courier spawns and keep up on the spawns. I tossed out an EB or shock of venom when I wanted to speed things up and just made sure my pet was hasted and I had regen.  51 is a good lvl for soloing though ;)<br />
<br />
At 51 everything was light blue to me though, occasional dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Perciviel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">did they change this zone? i use to solo here at 34 guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">City of Mist at 34? I doubt.... killing 2 red cons would've been tough, killing 3 at the gate, nearly impossible.<br />
<br />
Maybe you are thinking 39?</div></div><hr />
