<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this on Lanys' shaman site, and got quite a good response. I'm curious as to how we fit in with other servers, so I'm posting what I posted there, here :)<br />
<br />
I would like to know what kind of gear I should be aiming for in the future. I don't want to start a &quot;who's the best shaman&quot; thread, just want to compare and decide on some upgrades I can hope for :) Also, it may help some of our lower level shaman to better understand how to maximise their shammy playing abilities.<br />
<br />
I am basing the calculations to figure out the ranking, very heavily on a friend druid's system., but I did tweak it a lot to bettre suit the shaman class (*in my opinion*).<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Pool - This is the lifeblood of any caster. Without it, we can't do jack. But mana for a shammy is not hard to obtain with canni, and is very easy for a lvl 60 shammy to get through canni/torpor. Even so, a large mana pool means you don't have to canni as soon, reducing HP, and increasing your chances of dying. Imo, hp &gt; mana though, as your mana pool will only last till it's empty if you can't canni - with canni it's essentially endless.<br />
<br />
Flowing Thought/Mana Regen capability - This includes all mana regen capabilities. AA abilities, FT items, other mana recovery items such as burrower necklace and shei ranged (with lunar whispers and boon of recovery, respectively), along with the 8th shawl. This adds to our ability to regain our mana. More mana regen can only be good. FT1 gives 10 mana per minute, FT10 gives 100 mana per minute. One FT lets you regain one point of mana per &quot;tick&quot;. A &quot;tick&quot; in EQ, in case you didn't already know, is 6 seconds. 60 seconds per minute, 10 ticks per minute. This is for the lifetime of your shaman, wherever he is, standing or sitting, this is added to their mana all the time. Now, effects, such as boon of recovery, have rune components as well, but I'm talking mana regen capability.<br />
<br />
Hit Points - When HP &lt; 0, you die. You need HPs. HPs are good. As a shaman, hp are doubly important to us, due to the fact that we can turn them into mana. If we have hp, we have the chance at getting more mana. Hp on a shaman are our lifeblood, our provider of mana, our ability to prevent downtime, the reason why we can do so much and not have to worry (in theory) about running oom. They are our number one stat.<br />
<br />
HP regen - very very important to a shammy. The quicker we regain HP, the faster and more safely we are able to turn them into mana, which in turn allows us to play our part as a shammy. <br />
<br />
Resists - Resists reduce the amount of damage you take from a certain &quot;type&quot; of damage, more specifically, spell damage, as well as your ability to resist negative spell effects (i.e. snare, slow, etc.) Resists are good to have. Having more resists means you will either prevent your HP from going below zero (remember, HP &lt; 0 = bad), prevent you from having your ability to aid your party or kill your mob from being hindered, or just save you from the annoyance of smaller mobs that cast on you as you pass by. Having resists are very nice, especially as shammies have to be in range of mobs' AoE's/spells to be able to debuff them.<br />
<br />
Certain stats - Most specifically, sta and ac, then wis. These directly relate to our HP, ability to keep our hp, and our mana pool. It is very important to keep these stats as high as possible, wis is possibly less important, as our mana pool can always be topped up with canni, still, wis is very easy to raise and we should take advantage of this to provide us with more mana to start out with. More mana = good. More HPs = good. AC is important because we draw a LOT of agro, with things such as turgurs, and we get summoned and beat on lots. High AC *does* appear to make a difference. <br />
<br />
Everything else - Other stats are all nice and stuff, but it toally depends on your playing style, whether you should focus on improving them (atatck for example) or not. For a soloing shammy, attack is nice for when you melee the mobs you tank with a pet. But not everyone is a soloist - I for one need company while I play - that's why I play the game, the interaction with other people. Seeing as there are the two different styles of play (grp shammy or solo shammy), I won't include this as a aprt of the calculation system. <br />
<br />
Abilities - with Luclin, Verant really gave an enormous power to a class that was already very versatile and strong. With canni 5 and SCRM, <br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Calculation System&lt;/u&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;1 point per point of mana&lt;/b&gt; - This should be straightforward. <br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;100 points per point of FT/additional mana regen capability&lt;/b&gt; Some may say this is a bit much, but 15 points of FT (the theoretical FT max, sans AA abilities and other non-FT mana regen items) would give 3000 points, that's a lot of freakin points, but this is very, very important to have. Also, if we all use 200 x mana regen, it doesn't really matter, as it's all balanced.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;1.5 point per hit point&lt;/b&gt; - the reason it is 1.5 and not a straight 1, is to emphasize its importance.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;1.5 points per resist&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;1 point per AC&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;1 point per stamina&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;1 point per wisdom&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;200 points per hp regen&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;500 points for malo, SCM, canni5, torpor, each&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
All these figures should be worked out unbuffed. You can either note your stats down in game, or use magelo. Will be nice if we could each post a magelo link with our calculations though, helps us see what items we should try and obtain. <br />
<br />
Btw, most of this post is my opinion only, you're welcome to put your points forward, indeed, enlighten me!  :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for posting that other calculation tool, it'll be fun to play around with just for gear. But the reason why I did this system, was that it was specifically for shammies. I was looking for a ratio that would reflect the importance of mana, hp, regen etc for &lt;b&gt;our&lt;/b&gt; class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your going to try and weight having torpor then I think it needs to be weighted much more heavily than you have it. Cann V should also be more heavily weighted. Going from MC 0 to MC 3 1/5th of your possible points for FT was not readily noticable for me. Going from no cann v to having cann v was easily noticable for the amount of mana it gave me.<br />
<br />
Also there is 0 reason to have sta and wis considered. Why do you want wisdom to be considered? Because it gives mana right? Well your already looking at the total mana pool including all the mana given by having x wisdom so why give people credit for having the actually wisdom when you already count the mana it provides? Same thing for sta.<br />
<br />
Finally hps needs an even bigger modifier, x2 at least. Just look at your list and it should be obvious why. You say hps is more important than mana yet 7 out of the 9 examples you listed people had higher scores for mana than hps. You base mana pool is higher than your base hps and you get more mana from each point of wis. You end up with alot more mana than you do hps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhooz, my profile leaps incredibly because I'm an iksar (18/tick regen sitting).  You don't seem to calculate that into your above profiles, saying 0 hp regen.  Just cut it down to aa stuff and I'd be a bit lower, but seeing as it's an iksar bonus, I think it should be listed.<br />
<br />
Also agreed on your assessment of ft.  Yeah it's handy to have, but I don't think it's worth 500 pts in a rating scheme.  I'm currently wearing an earring of the solstice because the stats are awesome, it happens to have ft1.  If I was given an earring with the same stats, but 20 more hp/mana, I'd toss the earring in a second, even losing the ft.  It's just not that important to me as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Any other fun stuff add in extra points?  I keep a fungi tunic on me, though I don't wear it full time (normal exp groups I do, but raiding or in CT I usually swap it in and out).  That's a possible 3000 more points (15/tick).<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of rating all my stuff anyways, I just look at the ac + hp and compare it against what I'm currently wearing.  Trying to stay over 1000 ac w/ fungi on, while increasing my hp as much as possible.  But since I'm kinda bored, I think this is more how I look at things: (hp is straight hp, mana is straight mana, not counting sta + wis additions to those)<br />
<br />
1 point per point of mana.<br />
20 points per point of FT/additional mana regen capability.<br />
3 point per hit point <br />
.25 points per resist  (I'm in a very small guild and we rarely raid.  Stone of morid + frog crown + buffs is more than I ever need)<br />
5 point per AC <br />
9 point per stamina (3 hp per sta x3 pts per hp)<br />
6 point per wisdom  (6 mana per wis over 200)<br />
50 points per hp regen <br />
500 points for malo, SCM<br />
1000 for canni5, torpor<br />
250 for additional focus items (mana pres 3, extended affliction 3, etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end, once you get past a certain point (let's say 1000 ac and 2000 hp unbuffed), furthur upgrades are more difficult to obtain, and provide less benefit than before, depending what you're doing.  Anything that is going to be shaman soloable is doable by that point, I can't think of anything I couldn't kill w/o an extra 500 hp or ft10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About 15000 if I wear a Fungi instead of Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
Thats in normal gear.  I can get many higher points (18000 range) using gear I don't normally use because of the way your point system is.  I could easily gain a ton of resists that are worth 1.5 at the loss of AC worth 1.  Resists also play little part in most of Luclin, thus I don't care about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is fine and all but the real ranking is wether or not you can play with what you have. I seriously doubt that having a 14000 score matters much if you spend 90+ percent of your time grinding exp.<br />
<br />
Having a very high score also wont enable you solo something like the named snakes in Ssra. You need a sizable guild and experienced people to be able to do that. These are much more important factors than wether you score 10000 or 14000.<br />
<br />
If I didnt know better I would almost think that this ranking-system is something Verant has come up with to keep people playing :)<br />
<br />
PS. I agree that Torpor (and probably also Cann V - dont have that yet) is much more important than FT5. And Torpor combined with Cann V should give a bonus :)</div></div><hr />

But whos counting? :p<br />
<br />
Ure Hp regen should not count more then ure FT, in fact if anything it should be 1/2 what a point of FT is.<br />
<br />
And Jenamdar from AL is the uberest of all shamans dont need no formula to know that heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Torpor and Can V are much more valuable than the amount you listed, so is spell casting mastery.  I'd put torpor and can V at 1000 to be honest.<br />
<br />
Resists should be half of what points of mana are worth, resists just don't matter much anymore.<br />
<br />
HP regeneration and Mana regeneration are not worth as much as you list, I'd possibly put HP regeneration at 10 pts per and mana regeneration at 20 points per.<br />
<br />
Primal Avatar should be listed, tanks in my xp group love this spell.<br />
<br />
You should also have bonuses for certain focus items and aa skills.<br />
<br />
SCR3 gives you +1 tick on torpor, SCRM gives you another, for instance.<br />
<br />
Affliction haste, extension and efficiency are HUGE bonuses for a shaman as is spell casting haste and mana preservation (to a lesser extent).<br />
<br />
If a shaman has all these focus effects it's worth much more than an additional 500 hp and 200 ac, for instance.</div></div><hr />
