<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">tricky tricky, well after failing my first 8th cudgel fight (cleric got too close and triggered all 4 guards to respawn, aggro, as well as the (at the time) invincible venril sathir who beat us all down), trying to get the pieces back for another shot, and i know this HE paladin that has the bones.  i have the rest.  the problem, oracle vauris is yellow con at 60, on scaled mystics faction so most non iksar are kos.  oh yea and he's fast and hits for like 400's-- easily as fast as sow.  we tried some tricks to try to mq, once he actually took it then said i don't want this and gave it back, THEN proceeded to pimp slap the paladin.  all and all, paladin took about 4 deaths and kept wanting to try (why i have NO clue lol), but i abandoned.  any ideas on this one or should i just camp my ass in kc and watch for vs to loot it myself?  sigh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The paladin, sadly, follows the wrong gods and will be unable to do a MQ even with faction work.  The only thing I can think of is to get your hands on a Ball of Golem Clay from old CT and some Puppet Strings and give it a go.  The clay was the only illusion I found that got you from KOS to indiff in Kunark.  This may have been changed of course and finding the clay is probably harder than taking out VS again.</div></div><hr />
