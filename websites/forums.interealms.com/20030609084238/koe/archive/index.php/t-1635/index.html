<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night Kazzis, Ssauron, Mexl, Calvar (i think), myself were battling for the Frog Kings crown.  Lumenique, Lokes and someone else departed after i got there.  Do I smell?  hehe.. any way.. thanks to Lokes for the guide to the king room from the zone.  <br />
<br />
Cyrssi and Frutee came to join us   but never quite made it.<br />
<br />
About the same time...<br />
<br />
Ssauron died nobley at the hands of frogs.  During his corpse retreival... I got lost and kilt... but I finally did get his corpse back to him (sorry for the delay).  <br />
<br />
By the time CR was done... the party was over.<br />
<br />
A thank you to Knarlz and Cyrssi for the res and ports.<br />
<br />
On the up side... Im better acquianted with Live side guk now.<br />
On the down side... I died before my crown was arrived.<br />
<br />
These things considered... I would like to regroup in an effort to attain the crown and a little bit of XP.    Please post here if interested at this time and date.  If unable to attend...<br />

Isn't LGuk kind of damp and dirty, with slimy frogs all over? You might get some on you! :eek:<br />
I'll be there, but about an hour late. I will camp in LGuk tonight in order to be ready.<br />
