We've been chomping at the bit to get Emp lately, every time he gets near EST the server gets patched and he goes back to Euro guilds.  We got our first try a week ago and got him down to 40%.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, he's up and untouched because Bane weapons were broke.  Who needs banes, not us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats mate - theres nothing like a first time Emp kill. I still remember our first kill. US guilds pretty much held the monopoly on the Emp spawn. We had our guild wake up at 5am so we could get the kill before the US guilds started raiding. It's also worth noting, we finished raiding that night at 2am. (We had basically no emp bane in the guild either, and only 38 people for our first kill. heh)<br />
<br />
Anyway, grats guys! VT candyland awaits!</div></div><hr />

Now the melee want us to try it without DOTs...</div></div><hr />
