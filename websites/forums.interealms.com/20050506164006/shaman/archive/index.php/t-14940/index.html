<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Havegrillen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i couldnt find any info on it here so i thought i might ask about if any of you have seen the topic brought up before or know anything about it.<br />
<br />
but me and a mate had a discussion about spell casting reinforcement and the class mastery aa that adds up 50% to the duration on buffs, and then the focus effect on the 8th shawl if it will add up a total 70% to the duration or not? <br />
<br />
im not sure if this will or not , my friend tells me that its capped at 50% no matter what and even with 8th shawl it wont make any difference so the mastery class aa is a waste of aa points really. <br />
i honestly dont know but thought it would stack together adding it up to 70%, some say it does, anyone here knows 100% for sure cus i dont feel like spending aa a place that i cant use for anythinig :(<br />
<br />
thanks for your help,<br />

The cap is at least 70%. Beyond that no one knows because no one has been able to get higher. Yes SCRM and 8th shawl are both worth having.</div></div><hr />
