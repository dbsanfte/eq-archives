<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would replacing rapid bear (5 AA) and hastened rapidity (12 AA) with dire charm (animal) be unbalancing?  Other restrictions came be added, like level 65 and so on, but it would add a lot of new strategy content and be a great boost for fun.  I think more then any other AA, I would like this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No. not enough zones for it to be useful. plus Rabid Bear lets me own mobs like priest of discord or Askr the Lost :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />

No.  Instead here's what I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
1. Change it to a 15 minute refresh and let hastened rabidity knock that down an extra 10% with each level of investment.  <br />
<br />
2. Change Tainted Bite to mimic the 75-150 cleric hammer proc except make it a disesase based DD proc, and give tainted bite the same proc mod (530) that the 63 cleric summoned hammers have w/ hand of the gods..<br />
<br />
This would turn us back towards our battle priest origins.  We'd have to be alot more careful than clerics with aggro control of course, but it would be FUN  :D and a worthwhile DPS bonus regardless of whether you were swinging a rusty spear, your epic, or the Sharkspine Club.  It would also make Malicious Decay worth casting on mobs that we can't touch with our cold and poison nuke lines where our damage can sometimes be extremely limited.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great idea.  I'd add that it would be nice if rabid bear out-damaged what we could do by chain casting a nuke while it was active (which that proc bit almost certainly would accomplish.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't want to be a cleric melee clone. I'd like it to add damage bonus and some accuracy or something. doing damage through actually hitting something &gt; lame procs. but making the proc a Disease DD is a good Idea though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i don't think we'll ever get dire charm. we have a pet that cons DB to lvl 65 toons. before considering giving shammies DC i would improve the present pet so that it has more DPS/HPs than the LB mobs that druids/chanters DC.<br />
<br />
however, we're not a pet class so i honestly see no reason to improve the present pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like rabid bear, its just a shame hastened rabidity is such a joke. I like Frekkels idea of an upgrade, that would be cool. And by the way what would seperate us from cleric melee is rabid bear gives double attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The problem with giving Shaman DC is your are forcing Sony to admit that they messed up four years ago when they TOOK AWAY Charm from Shaman.  Now Druids can Charm AND DC so it's not like this ability is neither present in the priest class or without historical precedent in the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
Upping Jobarer (DogDog (tm)) to what Enchanters can DC would probably step on the toes of the Necromancer and Magician more than the Druid. One reason it would be cool for a Shaman is they can buff their pet way better than a Druid.<br />
<br />
Speaking on behalf of Enchanters I have no problem with Shaman getting DC.  Strengthening another class does not weaken me.  And if Druids are not a &quot;pet&quot; class then what is that Bear I see running around?<br />
<br />
IOW - Sony says: &quot;Shaman and Druids are priests - not pet classes, but we're gonna give Druids Charm Animal AND Dire Charm anyway. Shaman get Turgurs and Alchemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
