Yes, I know the whole discussion on how it was overpowered, to the point that mobs were either totally MR to avoid them being slowed, etc.  But, with the implentation of slow mitigation, I dont see how this still so madly overpowering as one poster keeps claiming.  And especially seeing how many other classes besides shaman have slow (Chanter, Beast, Bard, countless proc toys).  <br />
<br />
After reading the above thread though, the first thought that truely popped into my mind was....  What would a shaman be without slow?  Our whole class is *balanced* or upgraded (or lack of upgrades), around this single level 51 spell.   Without it, would be 1k nuking wizards with near 8 second cast time on that nuke.... Or a druid / necro with dots (though both do better .. necro in raw dps, druid with thier MR based dots)... A buff bot that has no real purpose, cause we all (or most of us) know how unimportant any stat is (except stamina, which isnt even MGB'ed on raids im on because everyone has it maxxed, and those that dont just request it, so no need for the MGB)...<br />
<br />
Im NOT whining, or anything, just that thread, and the perception of how powerful slow WAS (notice the emphasis on WAS), has got me to thinking what would a shaman be, without it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of the mobs at the time were balanced with those slows in mind, much as SoRZ, AoW were tuned for endless mana due to mod rod 3, etc... it wasn't that it was overpowering, it is just that the previous model for tuning an encounter didn't scale well through PoP, thus mitigation was introduced. (and for a while, on a few mobs slow actually hasted them../shudder)<br />
<br />
Slowing also has come in handy for reducing the holy trinity approach to grouping (war/ench/cleric), several classes can slow to varying degrees so that adjusts your need for healing/tanking power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As Bracy once said...<br />
Slow has the effect of slowing TIME. With slow, a single second spans the course of several seconds...<br />
<br />
What can be more important than that?<br />
<br />
Seriously, we would still be a Jack of All Trades.  Without it, we would still be &quot;nice&quot; for groups, but probably not very desirable.  If for some reason they decided to take it away from us, I'd hope they'd give us a serious boost in one area or another - better healing &amp; minor rez, or better dots, or better nukes.  Or a better pet &amp; melee abilities, although that'd double up a lot with beastlords.<br />
<br />
Well, assuming they took slows from us &amp; still left it in for other classes...  without any kind of slow in the game, there'd be major revamps needed.  VI, followed by Sony, went with the model of increasing difficulty by increasing mob HP &amp; DPS, so without slows, a lot of encounters would be a lot more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;EVERY<br />
<br />
mob that CAN be slowed, HAS to be slowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every mob that does damage to someone means someone has to be healed.  Healing spells are the stupidest thing ever put into the game.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
It's been gone over again and again and again.  If there was some stranglehold on slow by only one class, there might be a point.  With the fairly wide range of acceptable slowers for an xp group, this point is gone though.  BST, ENC, SHM can all slow adequately and a BRD can even do so in most situations.  Compare to how many classes can adequately cover heals in an xp group : CLR DRU SHM.<br />
<br />
Slow is no more broken currently than healing spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, several spells were introduced that were a mistake.<br />
<br />
Complete Heal<br />
Droppable modrods - fixed with a nerf.<br />
75% slow<br />
<br />
But they are in the game now and won't be removed.  The game's balanced for them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think it was so much a mistake to implement a 75% slow as it was to restrict the availablity of comparable slows.  With the addition of 65% BST slow and 70% ENC slow already available, that's not nearly so much of a problem IMO.  <br />
<br />
It's similar to the complaints about the huge gap between CLR healing power and everyone elses on top of the fact that nobody could res but clerics.  Add 90% res for paladins, bump up the healing power of DRU and SHM to be sufficient for most xp groups and the problem is a lot less.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, I'd say it woulda been a lot easier to maintain balance had they capped the best slow at say 50%, not put any sort of CH in game, and not made everyone so dependant on res from overbearing death penalties.  CH was the most idiotic mistake made by far.  I played several MUDs before EQ and CH or &quot;Miracle&quot; as it was known in many DikuMUDs was a known problem in most of them for the same reasons CH is a problem in EQ.  Considering EQs background I'd have expected them to know coming in that a spell like that was bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shaman Dots are just AS good as necro dots..<br />
<br />
Necro Blood of Thule 335 x7<br />
Shaman Blood of Saryrn 320 x7<br />
Necro Horror 430 x5<br />
Shaman Bane 420 x5<br />
Necro Dark Plague 132 x20<br />
Shaman Breath of Ultor 131 x20<br />
<br />
Shaman Dots are right in line with Necro and druid dots don't even come close to ours.<br />
<br />
I know this is off the subject, but just some information for ya....<br />

<br />
Bah humbug on that one. Necros have a dot for every resistance. They have better dots. They have better DD. They have a MUCH better pet. And they get undead slows, FD, ghetto heals, mez and rez. <br />
<br />
Any &quot;percentage&quot; based spell is by default overpowered on RPGs because the usefulness of the spell increases with the difficulty of the encounter. For example, burst of fire does 6 dmg at level 1 and 6 dmg at level 65. At 65 its useless. But, if burst of fire did 6% dmg at level 1, at level 65 it would regularly be doing 1200dmg on a 20K hp mob. A huge difference. <br />
<br />
But, everyone and their mother can slow these days, and all of them roughly in the same 65-75% so no big deal. <br />
<br />
I would like to see shaman focus shifted from slows to &quot;curses&quot;. With the addition of curses to the game it seems a logical arena for the shaman class. I'd like to see more 30 second DoTs, 30 second DoT + debuff curses, and more &quot;types&quot; of slows, such as a casting speed slow curse like the ones I get hit with in LDoN missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman Dots are just AS good as necro dots.. <br />
No way, we are outclassed.<br />
<br />
Look at Lucy and make a comparrison.  Sure, in any standard EXP grp the differences are pretty mild as generally we only use Bane for 420 a tick while Necros have horror at 430 a tick.  Their spell costs 20 less mana, does 10 more dam a tick, but most importantly, necros have a -30 resist adjustment on horror.  While your bane gets resisted unless you malXXX for 300+ mana first, chances are theirs is racking up damage.<br />
<br />
Soloing the difference becomes far more noticable.  They have 6 60+ DoTs that can stack, one has a 75% snare on it.  We have 3, no snare and our mana costs per point of damage (per tick) is 1.81 while theirs is 1.76 (ignoring snare dot).  Looking at the total damage/vs mana over time the difference gets wider.  So, they have more stackable damage, it's more mana efficient, but the real kicker here is they have resist adjustments on all their dots while to get that we need to cast an EXTRA spell that even then doesn't have the total adjustment when averaged out (Saryn's Kiss has a -200 check on it).  Malos is a 55 adjustment that doesn't include DR while the BUILT IN average for necros is -86 (BoT, Horror, SK, DP, FP).  Even more amazing is that their dots work 4 of the 5 resists (FP checks on fire), while we can work only DR, PR, and MR.  Overall, there is no comparrison.  We stack up pretty well though as a distant 2nd, ahead of druids (not by much).<br />
<br />
On raids (a topic I'm less familiar on, please correct me if you see an error) with FD and their top 2 damage DoTs, it's safer to have a Necro doing damage than a shaman (although it's likely they'll be twitching, or using a pet to rack up absolutely insane damage, depending on the zone).<br />
<br />
While I wouldn't want to play a necro, please don't mislabel us by saying we're as good at damage over time.  We're not in the same class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How good is slow? It's so good that since Turgur's was introduced with Kunark with Malo and Torpor, Shamans have recieved no signficant power upgrades in the following five expansions. Not one. Adding a disease-based slow is the best thing that was added to our class since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On forums all I read are complaints.. when we raid in shm chat we talk about all the cool stuff we would like like true ae slow etc.. but in reality the game looks very balanced to me.. I raid every day and I see all the peeps on the raid having a lot of fun.. could not ask for more..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When grinding in an xp group, any other class can go afk at will and the rest of the group keeps on trucking.  When I go afk, the group sits there waiting.  Yep, slow is powerful.  Nerf it and you'll need double the clerics that are so hard to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The premise of the ranger thread is slightly off to begin with.<br />
There are too many frikkin classes in EQ<br />
There are many games out there - find one with fewer classes and play it.  Whining about it 4 years after inception is moronic to say the least.<br />
<br />
No CC, then root/park<br />
Hehe.  The ONLY reason this is viable is because so many mobs are pure melee or just plain stupid.  Root a wizard player in an arena fight while you go beat on one of his friends, and he's gonna nuke the *^%&amp; out of your healer.  So if we weren't being handed melee mobs on a platter, mez would be just as needed, and according to that thread - just as broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The key to necros is FD....I play one on the side and with FD I can stack unlimited damage on a target with little or no agro (gawd help me if FD fails though). I rarely have any spells resisted at all. I cast only a few buffs on myself and pet. Its like a totally different game. <br />
<br />
Everything my shaman does takes WORK. All very mana inefficient. <br />
<br />
That said, I play my shaman more than my necro for the challenge. Being a necro is just way too easy for me. <br />
<br />
As for slow being overpowering, get over it. The game is tuned toward slowed mobs. As more players get Time-quality gear I expect SOE will start nerfing slow with more mitigation or immunity to compensate for insanely equipped players without having to up mob dps or hp. <br />
<br />
Either say, slow is the only thing that allows beasts and shaman to solo (efficient for beasts, inefficient for shaman). Remove slow, and there is really no reason to play a shaman. Druids and Chanters each bring more to the table than shaman do. The class would be relegated to Bot status.</div></div><hr />
