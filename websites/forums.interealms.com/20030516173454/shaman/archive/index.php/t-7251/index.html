<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">EverQuest Online Adventures takes place during the Age of Adventure; a time set approximately five centuries before the original EverQuest for the PC <br />
<br />
Where would that put the Iksar and the Vah Shir?  Would the Coldain just be shipping out?  The Iksar a slave race?  The Vah Shir being the dominant race on Odus?  <br />
I'm assuming both expansion races would be undiscovered when the game hits gold, but it would be interesting to see them down the road if the game takes off.  Or perhaps go in a different direction altogether and make Froglok or Gnoll PC's.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rellix CoastBearer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They announced long ago iksars and vah shir wouldn't be in the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sure, not initially, but I mean, ever?  Guess it depends on how many copies they sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kalduin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only race in the beta (when I played it) was humans. And there was only one model for them. The games still a very long way off and no one that reads these boards will know more then anyone else right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mythus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The races at this time include all the original races included with the first release of EQ except for Ogres.  They're counting humans as being 2 separate races with one being the ones that start in Freeport and the others in Qeynos/Surefall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The bit about dying was interesting.  According to the FAQ, upon death characters lose a bit of exp and some money but show up on their bind spot fully dressed.  According to the FAQ there will be no player corpses.<br />
<br />
This sounds okay, in principle, but for my current experience in the game this sounds awful!  So, you're raiding a dungeon and a guy dies, just how do you quickly and easily get him back to the raiding group?  <br />
<br />
With the dangers inherent for melee travel, not to mention the difficulty bringing a single character through a dungeon of aggro/see invis mobs...this just sounds odd.<br />
<br />
Kind of a moot point since I won't be playing, but I'm interested in seeing how this pans out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They should implement the &quot;gray yard&quot; in that game to answer Gloriana's concerns, which are totally valid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is supposedly going to be a way to resurrect dead people back to the party.  You also don't exactly lose experience when you die if I understand it right.  When you die and gain more exp, part of it goes to pay off an exp debt.  If that's how it works I like that idea of losing future exp rather than losing some of your current exp which could cause you to delevel, for example.  I always hated that you could delevel in EQ, it seems to me if your character learns how to do something he doesn't &quot;unlearn&quot; it.</div></div><hr />
