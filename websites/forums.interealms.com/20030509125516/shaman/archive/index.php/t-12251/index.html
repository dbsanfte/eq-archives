<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently set up a wireless network here at my house.  Then it dawned on me that the wireless router/access point runs at the same frequency as my cordless phone, 2.4ghz.  If I buy a new cordless telephone that operates above a frequency of 2.4ghz would I still get horrible interference between the two or would both the phone and the router function fine?  Thanks for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been considering setting up a wireless network myself, but haven't yet - so although I don't have personal experience, I can tell you what I've read &amp; heard - the 2.4 Ghz spectrum is pretty crowded, with phones, wireless networks, microwave ovens, and even some fluorescent light fixtures.  Getting a 5.2Ghz phone would help, however setting your network to channel 1 or 11 has been reported to help with phone interference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't been impressed with my wireless performance.  I have an SMC barricade 7004VWBR.  The cable internet running through the house maxes out at 300 kbps, so it isn't that great to begin with.  With the wireless router I can't stay connected to EQ though.  I had to run a ethernet cord the whole way...</div></div><hr />
