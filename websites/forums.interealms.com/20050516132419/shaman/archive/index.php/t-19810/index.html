<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First you put a quest NPC in the middle of a zone with wandering, hostile mobs that will kill you if invis drops.  Then take a really big map and put 100 mobs in there with 10-15k hit points.  Then put the target of the adventure at the farthest possible point from the entrance.  Though of course that's not enough.  Require the adventurers to reach a point in the dungeon other than the final target, say to spawn an NPC.  All the while mobs will be respawning behind you, so instead of killing 100 mobs, you end up killing 200 mobs.  Then put a final surprise for the adventurers that will wipe them and essentially make them start over.<br />
<br />
Here's what to expect from GoD trials:<br />
<br />
1. 2-4 hours of mindless trash mob clearing (sort of like VT, but without the loot)<br />
2. Doing the trials at LEAST twice.<br />
3. Horrendous corpse recoveries and long waits<br />
4. A sincere hate for SoE<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
There's also a secret timer on these expeditions.  It's about 5 or 6 hours.  You get a 15 and 5 minute warning and then get ported.  Such horrible design to secretly limit your time.</div></div><hr />

Horrendous CR and long waits? Quit the expedition and start over... Much faster than trying to CR.<br />
<br />
I've died in them a few times until we figured out what classes work. Only a few where you must have a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to start over on most of them if you wipe.  I've done the collect, the assassinate and the rescue (gee, I wonder if the last one will be a kill 60).  The respawn times for the collect and assassinate are quick, the rescue is a slower.<br />
<br />
Why should there be respawn at all?  It makes the trial almost unbearable.  Our guild's first Rathe kill took 2 hours.  Most of these trials take a minimum of 2 hours and you get crap loot (if any) and I hear some of flags are bugged if you don't get them in the right order.</div></div><hr />

Look at your gear and look at everyone elses.... nothing against you but PoTime wasnt supposed to be a requirement for this expansion.<br />
<br />
I've mentioned it before but the only people that really rave about how good this expansion are just bored with PoTime.<br />
<br />
Using Aruman as an example (hope you dont mind :) )  When you say that there are only a few that you must have a warrior... you are talking PoTime warrior right? With PoTime support classes...  This is where folks start to lose the connection.  So instead of a 8k Buffed up warrior you are looking at a 10k Unbuffed warrior, with 600-800 higher AC.  With support melee dealing 2-3x the dps.</div></div><hr />

I'm a Time geared shaman and I think these new zones suck.  I'm not bored with Time though since it's a loot deluge every few days and the fights are fun.  And yes, if you aren't VT or EP geared, you will most likely have a lot of trouble on these trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm enjoying them, they're good experience, not too hard, not too gimp to be a walk in the park. And yes, there is an instance timer, they said in the chat that the instance timer is one you wouldn't resonably reach, but of course, 6 hours isn't that =-p I was expecting 10 or 12. Also get your 65 GoD spells in there, except the single &quot;quest&quot; one which requires Kod'taz access(oh, err, and the ancient). Can get some pretty nice loot in there as well, in the form of armor, and augments. All in one groupable setting. The 5th and 6 trials are a lot harder mobs then 1-4 (sewers), but the loot there is VERY good. Elemental+ quality loot, and can you obtain it with a single group.</div></div><hr />

I'm not raving, I just said I liked them.<br />
<br />
I don't think you have to be EP/Time equipped to accomplish the initial ones. A couple of them are basically long Normal level LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
Some of the items I have been seeing dropped in the expeditions will help, and spells do drop in them also.<br />
<br />
As far as the warrior comment... I highly doubt you will succeed on a few of them unless you have a warrior. You will need their capabilities. Tried one with a few decently equipped non-warrior melee classes today and got raped bad.<br />
<br />
Now, past Vxed and Tipt, you better be PoTime equipped if you hope to get anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">These are awesome.   I'm loving them.  Why?  Because they are challenging.  They aren't easy, not in the least sense.  once you get to know them sure they are, but not at the beginning.  If you expect to finish every one the first time through.. then go back to BoT.  Some of these places seperate those that are willing to do what it takes, and those that just don't have the skills.  Quit now if you have to, that just means that there will be less people in these zones.<br />
<br />
Really, i'm serious, anyone can get from point A to point B in the sewers in 10 - 20 min easily.  The plant is going to be a bit more difficult, but the rest isn't that bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes point/snicker/point/haha/neg rep .<br />
<br />
<br />
Now take a breath and listen.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love this expansion. This is how level 65 content should be, a challange. These dungeons and zones are very difficult and that is such a turn on to me. I was talking about this with a elemental capable group i was in last night and the core of the topic was how boring PoP is. <br />
<br />
PoP is nothing more then dreadlands style chain pulling. You can argue all you want that it isnt, that mobs get progressivly harder and there for it takes more skill. But at its core its simply camping 1 in corner of a map and waiting for your monk or bard to pull a mob to you. Maybe you move in a small little circle or something, but basicly its just chain pulling. Its harder yes cause the mobs hit harder but that requires only a small adjustment to the timing of your heals and requires you to actualy pay attention a lil more. This isnt a real skill, most people are used to easy groups like you find in BoT and places of the like, that when you have to do anything that requires the minimal change from the norm, it feels like it is taking mad skills. <br />
<br />
Mind you im not dogging this style of EXP, frankly for the record in the long run you will yield more exp per hour then in a GoD/LDoN style zone. There is nothing wrong at all with a deadlands style chain pull group, its just not what some of us like is the point im trying to make.<br />
<br />
I feel that GoD and even a good LDoN group, requires some class skill that you cant fake. GoD in what i have experienced thus far, the mobs hit very hard, there are see invis mobs mixed with undead mixed with live, there are alot of dangers and difficulties that you have to master. What i see in GoD is a pressure to know your class, i see experienced players rising to the top and power leveled frogs that are still working on maxing casting skills, eaten and spat out. This expansion raises the bar in player skill and awareness IMHO. Like when PoP came out and suddenly everything was doubleing 220+  at the time it was a big change, till we all adjusted.<br />
<br />
You know i think SoE stumbled upon something here and i hope it catches on. This expansion is so difficult to be productive in that anyone with a short attention span and a desire to hard core level will wanna go back to PoP, while giving enough rewards to make people who love this kind of EQ will want to stay. Its for the dungeon craw lovers and im one of them. This is a place where its not 100% about gear, where you dont get saved by having time gear or elemental, where you get saved by listening to your party and being part of a team. Not just 2-3 people with 3-4 people just hitting auto attack when the MA hits his hotkey.<br />
<br />
Again, from what i have seen so far, i like it. Alot. Last night i spent about 4-5 hours in the sewers, you cant imagine what a big deal that is to me. Its been so long since i could stand playing EQ for more then 1-1.5 hours before i had to log, but last night i was enthralled by the expidition and events. Priceless man,priceless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is bad how ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I populate my guilds loot database with all the loot found in game (focusing on the high end stuff we raid) and I'm simply amazed at the quality of stuff found in the first Tier zones of GoD.  Most of it is Elemental quality or better and the mobs are not that hard at all.   Sure, it only took us 6 Time geared people to kill a few of the named, but its still a 12-18 person raid target for anyone else that will yield gear that took my guild 60+ people and 6 months of work to get (Elementals).  Ferubi alone is full of some extremely nice gear that almost any guild can go after with some work.<br />
<br />
So no, not everyone is going to pass these trials with ease and reach the next zones fast.   Nor should they.  With the quality of gear I'm seeing it should take a decent bit of effort to reach those zones, even if it means some are going to spend a few months farming gear in Riwwi, Ferubi, etc.   Not everyone should be able to reach the higher zones instantly.  Just as non-guilded or people from non-hard core guilds are reaching Elementals now, so will they eventually reach the higher zones in GoD.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the trials I've done so far, I like them.  They are somewhat challenging and the AAxp from them is pretty damn good (got 2 AA from the Plant trial we did).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Litgruv:  I agree with you 100%<br />
<br />
Jaradis: I absolutely love your guild's database.  I've been using it forever and it really is the best around.<br />
<br />
Everyone else:  If you think sewers are bad, wait until you do mountain :)<br />
<br />
All-in-all, I think Litgruv pretty much said everything I wanted to.  Those of you that remember being level 60 when PoP came out will remember saying things like &quot;OMG THEY DOUBLE 285!!&quot; the first time you zoned in to podisease.  Give it some time and everyone will adjust and it will all be trivial again.  Obviously, the PoTime geared people are going to beat it first, but that is to be expected.  Everyone will beat these, it just takes a little time.  Remember PoJ trials?  I remember thinking they were going to be damn near impossible.  22 tries later, I beat it and got my PoV flag.  Since then, I helped countless more people through their trials and it got easier each time.  Now, it is a complete joke.  Same thing with LDoNs.  I remember when LDoN first came out and I thought hard missions were just ridiculous and damn near unbeatable.  I did one tonight with a pickup group and we finished in 50 minutes.  I was the only person there from a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Give it some time and it will be just fine.<br />
<br />
Oh, one last hint:  If you are having trouble clearing through sewers and it is starting to become tedius, just use invis.  Some mobs will see, but it is pretty easy to just invis to a see invis mob, kill it, then re-invis.  The first time I did plant it took a few hours, but once we tried it with invis it took like 30 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sounds like you'd need a lot of people to make this even reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Trials are one group max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/shrug, I enjoyed the sewer trials... the only one I didn't like much was lair, but that wasn't because of the difficulty level (only because its kind of tedious).   And they aren't THAT hard to beat first try, you just have to actually be careful and work well with the groups you go in with.<br />
<br />
Though, I am going in with time equipped people, but I think anyone in elemental gear or possibly VT gear should be able to succeed without much problem.  (if you don't believe me, we had a ranger with like 7.5k hp tanking for the entirety of the hardest trial, so a VT equipped tank should be able to do it without any issues)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh no theyve gone and made the trials in GoD hard.<br />
How dare they ?.<br />
<br />
Jesus the expansions been out 5 days and you're already whining how hard it is.<br />
Basically the gist of what im getting from most of these posts is that you want them to make stuff reasonably easy so you can complete the expansion and then just get down to farming it then whining that SoE doesnt do anything for high levels ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree, it's a little early to be whining about how hard it is.<br />
 Simple fact, if it's more than you can handle, you have two choices:<br />
 1) Avoid them and continue what you did before the expansion<br />
 OR<br />
 2) Keep trying and enjoy the challenge while you're at it.<br />
 I guess 3) would be throw a tantrum and whine on the Message boards. &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
 Oh, and as for Time not being a requirement, did someone miss the part when they said some of the content would be designed for Time flagged folks? Several parts of GoD WERE designed for people who have made it to Time and are looking for new challenges. Sony would be idiots not to create more challenging content for those who have dedicated the most time and effort into thier game.<br />
 At the same time Sony is offering alternatives to gain xp and loot for those of us who probably won't reach the Elemental Planes let alone Time.<br />
 Sounds like they thought this out pretty well actualy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Only 2 things I dislike about GoD, and it's not the difficulty of how hard mobs hit, or how hard expeditions/trials/or whatever.<br />
<br />
1) Way way way way too many creatures infesting areas.  I'm mean... waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many.  Having to rely on invis to make a lengthy run past a vast amount of pointless mobs just to get to a quest NPC, is uncalled for.  There isn't even a spot to reinvis yourself or someone else.  If I had a fixed duration invis, it wouldn't be so bad, but I don't.  So far, I've been lucky, but for others not so.  It's not challenging, it's anal.  Heck, I'm surprised there weren't mobs put in the graveyards.<br />
<br />
Cut the mob population down by half or at least put in several clear spots for a chance to reinvis, and I'll be happy.<br />
<br />
2) Respawns in instanced zones.  I don't get it.  I thought LDoN was to be the foundation for future expansions, but they only use a bit of it (instancing).  I liked LDoN's idea of no respawns, because it made a realistic impression of clearing a dungeon.  No reason GoD couldn't be the same.  If they change that, I'd be even more happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm actually glad they put in respawn -- to make it challenging enough, they either need that, or annoyingly short time limits, and I'm a big fan of being able to take my time when necessary.  If there were no time limits nor respawn, it would be way too easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a few places in the zone where you can re-invis safely, you just have to check for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There's lots of reinvis spots, they just aren't obvious.  Normall you'd run to a corner and invis there, but that's generally a bad idea.  Most of the safespots are actually right in the middle of open areas - no mobs path there so it is safe.</div></div><hr />

We had the earring drop. No one wanted it. Those drops for a EP or Time guild are crap.  The ring would have rotted too.  The girdle might have been picked up by a caster as a switch-in haste item.<br />
<br />
Actually, the three named we killed dropped a crappy shoulder item (no one wanted), a spell haste 4 augment (an applicant took) and one other item that rotted.  The random mobs seem to drop better loot than the named.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Replace &quot;challenging&quot; with &quot;tedious&quot; and your statement will be more accurate.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the only aspect that pisses me off is the huge time investment these things take.  People leave groups, they AFK, they have sisters who come in and reboot the computer and so on.  The most challenging part of GoD is actually keep a group entertained and together for 3 hours.  Come on, it's 6 people, why should it take them more than 2 hours to get a stupid flag?  PoJ trials were like 15-20 minutes maximum and those were challenging when PoP came out.<br />
<br />
If Sony thinks a challenge for a Time guild is to make them spend 3 hours in a group killing a mob then moving 10 feet and doing that over and over, I can only imagine what the boss fights are like.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I was sort of enjoying the trials, mostly because of the prospect of good loot (the items are overall quite useable for my guild)....until last night.<br />
<br />
We are a pre-elemental, pre-VT guild but well equipped and have no trouble with LDoN hards.  These expeditions seem easier than LDoN hards overall, with better loot.  The big difference here for me is the TIME INVESTED.  Also the fact there is no variation in the zones, 10 hours of staring at green gets tedious.  Last night we did Lair of the Trapped (the 3rd trial from HP).<br />
<br />
For example, well, here's the spoiler for you for the Lair trial.  <br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 14 18:50:54 2004] You have entered Sewers of Nihilia, Lair of Trapped Ones.<br />
<br />
Alej is in the very farthest room from the zone-in.  We figured he was there but he wasnt marked on our maps.  He is buried under a cave in.  There was quite a few see invis mobs and undeads so we did not attempt to invis around, until we were almost to Alej.  After hours of killing trash mobs, we were tired of this and wanted to speed things up so we tried to invis the last bit to Alej.  Invis dropped at a bad time and half our group was killed before evac.  Our bard did manage to speak to Alej though.  Speaking to him, he said - hi, I am trapped, I need help.. go back and find my tools at the ZONE IN, this other room by the zone in and this other room in the middle of the zone.<br />
<br />
It took us like 30 minutes to CR.  We had to locate a necro guildie to come in and join the expedition to summon our corpses.  <br />
<br />
When we got underway again, we come in to find the dungeon is halfway despawned.  With just one mob type in each of the 3 areas described...plus some see invis hallway wanderers for fun.  We had to kill every single on of these mob types in the first area, then get a flag message that says you have located the first tool.  Repeat x 2, for the other 2 areas.<br />
<br />
We were killing in the 3rd and final area when we got this message:<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 14 21:52:19 2004] With his very last breath Alej shouts, 'My time is up, I'm beginning to feel my life wither. Thank you for trying friends, if only there was more time.'<br />
<br />
We got the 3rd and final tool flag on the mob we were killing when he shouted...sadly when we reached his spot 2 minutes later, he was dead.  It was very frustrating to stick with it this long and then fail by mere seconds.  We weren't a slowing killing group either - cleric, shaman, bard, warrior, monk, wizard.  Bane never had time to go full duration on our mobs.<br />
<br />
Oh and I love the trials because of the outstanding resists on the mobs.  I have to malos everything or turgurs is resisted.  HOORAY FOR A -40 MR CHECK SLOW!  As I expected, all they did was jack up the resists so it's damn near impossible to slow them in any timely manner without malos.  Having to cast Malos on mobs that live 40 seconds is a waste, but I can't land bane (hooray for the only LDON dot with no resist adjust!!) without it either and I am trying to raise spec conj...</div></div><hr />

Oh, and as for Time not being a requirement, did someone miss the part when they said some of the content would be designed for Time flagged folks? Several parts of GoD WERE designed for people who have made it to Time and are looking for new challenges.<br />
<br />
Actually, in the chat they said all the raid content was aimed at the high end people (Vex Thal, elemental, Time geared). There arent any raids designed for the average player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Did my first shot at the sewers plant today, was a lot of fun (if agravating at times).  I just joined a pickup group that happened to be wandering around and we ended up trying it out.  Got pretty far into it, almost to the stonemite room, but the cleric wasn't paying a lot of attention the entire time, and we ended up with a 3 pull and wipe.  It was a pickup group though, I thought we did pretty well.<br />
<br />
My complaints based on this 1 thing:<br />
Cleric pretty much required.  If said cleric dies, you may as well just cancel the adventure and start over.  Way too many mobs see invis (at least this time), and you have next to 0 chance of clearing through dozens of 1200 hitting mobs while naked.<br />
<br />
There arent any raids designed for the average player.<br />

I believe he's talking about these regular trial things, not any raids.  1 group content is definitely not a raid.</div></div><hr />

I don't give three craps about the drops.  The people who can use them probably aren't going to get them because the trials are three hours of slow ass-rape with a splintered baseball bat without a reach-around.  Mobs should just drop spells and tomes instead of gear for people who can't use it.  Poorly geared players are better served by doing LDoNs anyway.  Anger of Druzzil and Plainsight effects can be bought from adventure merchants.<br />

What zone(s) are you talking about? There are places in Qinimi and Barindu, which are pretty much the only zones you can run through anywhere with invis.<br />

I did attempt the Purifying Plant with a guild group the day  or two after GoD launched, and despite the fact that we had our asse shanded to us a good number of times, we learned it very quickly, and once we figured things out, we started working our way through with ease, despite my repetitive deaths.<br />
<br />
I love GoD.  Sure, mobs hit hard, and the ones that proc suck also.  Hell, they run too fast also, but it makes it a FAR greater challenge.  I still do not mind Ldon, but after awhile, it gets repetitive, even if you consistently do hard ldon adventures.  Same mobs, same dungeons, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm yet to see the loot drop (for my groups) in GoD, but when it does, it'll be quite nice I imagine, and a well deserved reward also.  My guild is by no means elemental capable, we still kill Burrower beast, terris, Behemoth, carprin cycle, and soon to work the zeks (VZ/TZ), and we have essentially skipped SSRA and fully skipped VT, but we do fairly well in GoD already.   First time in, we cleared the first half of Purifying Plant with a Shm(me), War (8kish Hp), Cleric, Drood, Necro (yay for corpse summon and rez) and an Enc.  I was malos pulling almost all mobs (did need pacify on occasion), War tagged off of me, I'd slow, and we'd go from there.  Usually after our first wipe or three, the only death was me on the pull.  I'd get proximity aggro before i could cast (standing at the top of steps, looking down for example), and i'd try to run back to the group, but a 5800hp shaman (buffed) doesn't last long against an unslowed mob smackin ya for 1200  :D <br />

However I do love the augment drops off the vxed/tipt mini bosses.  That is how Ldon should have been - instead of its current state of retardation.  The smith event was a treat (after it took 4hrs to camp the last piece).<br />
<br />
On the other hand...spell itemization is silly.  Having the npc coded to drop a spell of a caster in the instance would rule (wishful thinking but won't happen - undoubtedly hard to code).  I hate doing these things and seeing magician/paladin/necro spells drop and not seeing cleric (at least they get good ones), shaman, wizard ones drop.  Having them no drop is kinda weak in the sense that every spell I've had drop in an expedition I've been in has rotted.  I do see that it is their attempt to go around any flooding of the markets that can happen (ethereal/spectral/rune system with turn in was possibly the sweetest they ever had).  On the flip side you can invite someone into the expedition and let them loot if the spell drops near the zone line.</div></div><hr />

The mobs hits harder, but they also die faster.  I notice the mobs having quite visibly less HPs than mobs in PoP.  Faster dying mobs means you go through more of them faster, so of course they need to give less xp per kill.</div></div><hr />

1) The placement of the quest givers is silly, I do not mind running a few zones and dodginbg see invis mobs. That is part of the fun.<br />
I do however mind that see invis mob patrol the NPC area.<br />
<br />
2) The bug that lets empty corpses poof when you are not online is retarded. I understand that instancing has its limitations but going LD and coming back only to find yourself going to the 14-day GM petition line is plain stupid.<br />
<br />
The good parts:<br />
<br />
1) The zones give at least a feeling of danger, things are not easy and people have to keep paying attention (for now at least)<br />
<br />
2) The drops are more then rewarding for the level required. Seeing stuff that is on par with EP/time level loot drop from 1 group encounters should make this a must visit for every non uber player in the months to come.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it would be terrible if people got to experience most of the expansion which they paid for w/o being in a raid guild 24/7.  The difference beteween GoD and PoP so far is that we knew they'd say GFY to the casuals and that the aa's and spells are horrid (at least for sk/shaman).  So, no casual I know in my guild has purchased it, nor has anyone else I know.  No reason to complain further, therefore, since the days of casuals like us subsidizing raid content are over.<br />

Sorry, did you miss all the chats where they said this was a high end expansion? I want time guilds to have something do do... gets them out fo my guild's elemental mobs :P They needed to raise the bar. Theres several zones for casuals. Abysmal Sea, Natimbi, Qil. I Tanked in Qil... I would hope a casual tank could do the same.  So is there content for level 65 tanks in crusty, and 1700hp shaman who have 2 aa? Not really, btu they should go do the previous content. A reasonably equipped group can exp in the hanging gardens w/o any trouble.</div></div><hr />

That last mop in tipt so is killer, he might require a warrior (did all the other trails with a SK tank).<br />
Loot in the sewers is forgetable for a time guild, and way to much crap over spells.  The augments dropping in Vxed and Tipt are godly, better then the 20/20 augments you need 1150 LDoN points for, and they fit into wrist and hand slots.</div></div><hr />

Hardest I got hit for was 1900ish, lots of trash mobs hit 1100ish, I had around 1330ish AC and 6200hp (virtue+SoT) (full defense aa) and was getting knocked about a bit doing malos on inc and slow immediatly after, and having a great time! was like being back in seb at 52 ;) <br />
<br />
Funnily enough the only 2 times I died were moving invis and it failing at bad time. Also, I have never seen a naked cleric run so far on one shaman invis without it dropping - 3 dark blue zones, and right through an instance after rogue had trained see invis stuff away ;)</div></div><hr />

I made it as far as the first turtle in natimbi before I had to reinvis (and had to do so another two times before I reach the HP).<br />
<br />
anyways, after spending two days in the first ikkinz trial.. I just want to say.. This is hella fun.  I mean, I don't even care so much that we've spent 12 hours in a zone and can't get past the name, this stuff is challenging, and I love it cause of that.  Dont' get me wrong, I can't wait to finally pass this part, but it's nice to be able to say that it presented a good challenge.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and they are right about Kod'taz.  I personally love the zone.  It's easy to move around in invised.  Even the see invis creatures can be gotten around if you move high on the mountains.  The zone is wide and big, and there are so many named everywhere that it doesn't take long before you can easily get the stone to get your shiny new trushar spell.  I will agree that this place will be prob train central when more people get access to it. But, there are something like 19 zone lines you can go to.  The only thing that I don't care for about the place is that the trial areas are so out of reach.  They are in the middle of temples, surrounded by see invis guards.  The only real quick and easy way to get there is DA, and that's susceptible cause each zone in area has three potential doors, so it's kinda pick and hope you get lucky time.<br />

I guess it depends on your perspective.  For me (an unguilded shaman who prefers single group activities) any of those 3 items would be a nice upgrade at this point.  If they can be obtained by a single group that sounds great to me.<br />

Litgruv's testimony makes me actually want to get the expansion.  I like single-group content that's challenging and rewarding, and as he says, where skill somewhat matters and everyone contributes.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">i'm going to stand by and say that even the most casual player can get to Kod'taz right now.  It's not going to be easy.. especially not getting through Tipt, but LDoN plus the loot dropping in God right now before Kod'Taz will equip up anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to agree in part with you here. Loot drops are = to EP gear /LDON(some say better).  You may have to repeat a few trial (IE farm) gear before you can advance.  Tipt I find to be a Bitch and you will need to bring your skills as well as decent gear to survive.  <br />
<br />
It will not be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Having worked at the trials a bit I can say, as an unguilded, non-uber, non-raiding shaman, that they are damn tough...but completely managable for a solid, well equipped group that works well together.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend a pickup unless you know the people, but if you have a group of good friends with some decent gear (yes, even those &quot;wimpy&quot; pre-ep geared folks, like me, can hack it as long as they're decently equipped), you can do just fine...and have a lot of fun while you're at it.<br />

This is only true for sewer btw, there is no &quot;exp instance&quot; for mountain, even though the person getting the expedition have all flags you still get an instance of mountains that can be used for flags.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Snoww, there seem to be a couple servers where people just don't want to try out the new content until the ubers have gone through and the loot levels are nerfed. No idea why, but Bristlebane seems to be that way too. Only been able to pick up on trial group since release and we had to pack it in because the cleric decided to /q out on us right before we started.<br />

<br />
Got our Kodtaz access tonight!  Tipt and Vxed were not as hard as people make them out to be.   Made it through Vxed on Monday, been busy since then.  Tonight we tried Tipt for the first time and made it through in a couple hours with only one small mishap (me, bard, warrior had to visit our binds!).<br />
<br />
I think we may be the first people that are not members of the 2 oldest time guilds on Terris with Kodtaz access.  Maybe a few random people from the other 3 time/ long-term elemental guilds are in, I dunno.. but we are certainly the first members of a non-VT capable guild to make it.  <br />

The monk couldnt zone in to Kodtaz tonight though, because we had a ranger (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=107364&amp;resize=true) with us for Vxed flag.  No charming, no tricks, no sploits.  Was a fun challenge.<br />

<br />
There's LOTS of very good items/augs easily attainable from the named mobs in there.<br />
<br />
There are also some items that drops randomly from the exp trash in the zone; for example I had this item when I was duoing there for exp: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68702<br />
<br />
&quot;a noc bloodluster&quot; dropped this for us.</div></div><hr />
