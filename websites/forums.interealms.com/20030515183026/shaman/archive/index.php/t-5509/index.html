<br />
Most of the way thru 52 atm, I just discovered that Scarlet Desest provides nice steady soloing at 52 (wish I'd tried it at 50 or 51!).  Anyway, I expect to ding 53 tonight and am looking for some solo alternatives when I am not raiding with the guild.<br />
<br />
I tend to prefer steady streams of blues and safe hunting grounds over yellow/yeds and uber exp. when soloing.<br />
<br />
Any favorite hunting spots you'd like to share for 53 and/or 54 soloing?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Got one yellow in 3.5 hours last night at 54 with non-stop pulling of the two gazebos and approach ramps on each side.  All dark blue at 53, mostly all dark blue at 54.</div></div><hr />

I like both SD and BW...hmmm dawnshroud hoppers? I have some guildmates who could uses their hides.<br />

Thanks for suggestions all.<br />

<br />
This is a common misbelief :o) Its dead easy to get to and from SD without the need of a taxi. If yer a shaman that is.<br />
<br />
I always go:<br />
<br />
Nexus -&gt; Netherbian -&gt; Marus Seru -&gt; Mons Letalis -&gt; The Grey -&gt; SD<br />
<br />
it sounds a longer run than it is. Simply lev, invis and EB at Marus Seru and its an easy run. I reckon it takes 5 minutes if that and brings you to the useful side of SD for a 53+ (I'm 54 currently and am taking a break from SD as I did 51-54 there).<br />
<br />
Also as you're going through the Grey make sure to shout out and see if there are any shissar organs going spare if you don't yet have the Katta EB neck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From 53 to 54 (&quot;good&quot; race shaman) I spent most of my time soloing in Kedge Keep on 2nd floor. &quot;Evil&quot; race shaman might want to try High Keep as mentioned in other posts. If you do solo in Kedge at level 53 don't pull the golden haired mermaid. Waste of time because of potential adds in her room. Just stick strictly to 2nd floor in kedge and you can get to 54 fast soloing. Optionally Umbral Plains in a group. You'll level fast there too, even with the occasional death due to your slowing the mob and getting aggro'd.  I made the bad mistake of getting over confident after the ding to 54 in Kedge and pulled the golden haired mermaid and got a pirhanna add. Root didn't last on either unfortunately and my pet went down fast. By the time I tried to gate I was getting pounded so hard I turned to swim up to zone and died anyway: unding, welcome to 53 again! If soloing kedge on 2nd floor, just be careful to pull only from that floor. The spawn cycle is like 18 minutes I think, so by the time you clear out everything you have just enough time to med to full and start again. It's a perfect solo spot. Scarlet Desert I tried also at 53. Waste of time. Faster XP in a dungeon. Get a fishbone earring and try Kedge Keep. Pull cautiously. Just don't die and you'll do great there. The setup is: invis yourself and swim in to 2nd floor in the south cubbyhole and setup a pet and plant yourself and pet along back wall of cubbyhole. Buff the pet with HoS and spirit quickening. Give yourself a HP buff in case root drops off something, and inch out into the doorway and you should get aggro'd right there for first pull. Inch out to the left or right just a bit to get 2nd pull. Have a &quot;/pet calm down&quot; macro button set so when you get hit you can back the pet up to the cubbyhole. It's very bad to fight otuside that cubbyhole or you will get adds. Pull with slow, or cast root on the mob after you get in and then slow it, and then toss an E-bolt. Add a 2nd E-bolt on sharks when it wears off, and keep root up with pet on the mob. For pirhanna you might want to toss in a disease dot because they seem to regenerate or go down in hitpoints slower than other mobs. Just root and rot, med and repeat. Fast from 53 to 54.  Clear out about 3 to 4 wandering fish outside the cubbyholes before trying to pull the shark or pirhanna. Also clear to the left and/or right cubby hole (depending on if you are pulling from south or east of room) before pulling the mob across the room from you because the farthest mob from you will bring in adds along the way otherwise. It takes practice to get a system down in a spot like this but the XP is worth it I think. Root and rot and med up. I tried melee on the mobs too with my 2hb that does over 100+ dmg a hit, but it's alot faster with root and rot method because these mobs will take your HP down which equates to more downtime and less HP for canning back mana. I only perfected the teqnique in my last yellow in 53 in Kedge, so hopefully these tips will help others so they don't waste time. (And by all means, please don't kill the tiny tiny fish or you spawn bad things in that dungeon that you don't want to know about) - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />

Easy easy kills, bountiful supply, close by to bazaar, never camped, but no loot.  I alternated between these and hornet's nest in BW.</div></div><hr />

Yea two big thumbs up for the rockhoppers. Amazing XP but you'll have to compete with several people. At 52 I got lots of double pulls and some triples but with project alpha enabled it can be handled :) One thing that annoyed the hell outta me is the lower levels training shrooms on me all the time. Easily handled after I'm done fighting but a real PITA when I'm fighting 2+ rockhoppers.<br />
<br />
I bagged 3 flawless rockhopper hides and never seen anything sell so fast. Must have been 3-4 minutes after I stepped onto the platform that I sold them for 200pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know the Rockhoppers and Stonegrabbers in Mons Letalis are lighter blue than they were at 53.. I'm now 54 and see some darks, but not enough to make me want to stay there.  Would the DS caves be different?<br />
<br />
It seems as if even the dark blues don't give as much exp as they did at 53...<br />
<br />
I'm a a Barbie Shaman with modest gear, but do have a JBB and horsie, looking for a good 54 solo spot, preferably outdoors and near an exit..  (Yea, I'm a scaredy cat).<br />
<br />
HHK seems like a decent option but don't want to trash my faction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As you head out from NL into DS  go straight, then a little NW and you will see sets of large rocks just over a hill.  The stonegrabbers spawn at the base of these boulders and are sometimes hard to see bacause they are laying on the ground.  There are about a total of 9 grabbers at the base of 3 different rocks.<br />
