<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SoE recently posted different advancement paths for characters in EQ2.  These involved training, traits, traditions, and tactics: enemy mastery.  There's a small list on EQ2 Stratics, but I can't find the full list that was supposedly being released.  Anybody have some information that could help me out?  Thanks much</div></div><hr />

look under traits on left hand side. I was very confused by this also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For example, at level 11, you get to choose either a gnoll- or orc-specific attack.  My SO's wizard chose a gnoll nuke that did approx 100 dmg, and refreshes once a minute or two.  Didn't get to try out my bard's ability, server booted us off.  *chuckle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's the first site I've seen with the full listing of when you recieve each trait/tradition/tactic, but unfortunately, it doesn't have information about all of the traits/traditions/tactics.  Anybody know of a full listing for these and what exactly they do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ikol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can try all of these also, I don't think we will get much more info for a few more weeks..<br />
