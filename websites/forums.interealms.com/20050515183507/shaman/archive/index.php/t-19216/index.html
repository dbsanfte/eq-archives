<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is where i'm at now level 65 mage/61 shaman/55 cleric.  I have been soloing in my favorite places PoJ punishers/enforcers, CT , and PoV.  I duo box mage/shaman in LDoN a good bit too.  PoJ the mobs seem to die at a good pace  I can clear 4 outside hall and 4 inside M hall before respawn after breaking i can get another 2 from the hall.  Mobs in CT go down good too, i do the Bloodfiend camp(3) the 2 spiders to the right, 2 lizzie after BF room, the tazpor thing and one spider before respawn.  But when we move to the tier 2 mobs they go down way to slow and are very mana intense compared to other places we hunt.  My guess is not enough DPS to kill fast enough to make worth your time.  i can get 4-5 golemns if im lucky before respawn, nowhere never the exp gains as full group.  <br />
<br />
My thoughts were should i lose the cleric and add another dps class once shaman hit 65.  Maybe a ranger or rogue.  i wonder if once i hit 65 with shaman and have BoU, Bane and BoS will a good enough jump in DPS not to worry about it.  Any thoughts guys and ladies?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tombfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like it's time to add a 4th box. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haha, yah. I really don't know what I'd do without the cleric. They just provide so much to the group.<br />
<br />
Enchanter might make a good replacement for the mage. Charms with the cleric to heal and the shaman to debuff can be insanely powerful. Want to clear LDoN's with a trio, there ya go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the idea of someone sitting in front of three computers playing EQ on them all just...just freaks me out!<br />
More power to you if you can deal with it all...but I sure feel like my hands are full with ONE computer.<br />
Maybe I need to learn MULTI-TASKING</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do a LOT of 3-boxing.  I started with a druid/shaman/warrior or monk and have lately been playing enchanter/mage/cleric.  Both work pretty well, but I know what you mean about dps.  Shaman pets are too weak to really help much in your trio, and dots take too long to work for LDoNs where you're always in a big hurry.<br />
<br />
If dps is your problem, don't get rid of the mage.  Mages are some of the easiest dps you can find for 3-boxing.  Hot key the pet attack macro and hit a few nukes - it's easy to handle on your second or third character.  It seems that your shaman, with slows, should be able to keep up with pet heals.  If the shaman just debuffs, slows, and buffs the pets, then you shouldn't need the cleric.  Mind you - I understand how nice it is to have a cleric around.  But if you're feeling the bite from not enough dps, I'd replace the cleric with another easily bot-able (not sure if that's a word) character.  <br />
<br />
My choice?  Another mage.  Think about it.  2 mages with a shaman.  One mage uses the earth pet or air pet for taunt, the other mage positions his water pet for backstabs.  That's a little tough to accomplish, especially in LDoNs where you're moving all the time.  But in dungeon or zone camps, you could position your pets with /guard so they'll approach a mob from different directions.  Wait a sec before sending in the water pet, to let the primary pet build up a little agro with a root or stun.  <br />
<br />
Or, have both mages use the air pets.  Two air pets could mitigate a lot of damage with the stuns they generate - it would make it easier for your shaman to keep up with heals when mobs are A) slowed by 70% and B) being stunned by two air pets.  <br />
<br />
Another option would be a druid.  Druids with dire charm can add some serious dps to your 3-box, and you could snare-kit with 3 pets whacking on the mob while your druid runs around holding agro with low-cost snares.  Not necessarily the easiest 3-box option, in my opinion, but another choice if you don't feel like playing up another <br />
mage.<br />
<br />
A wizard would also be a good choice for a 3-box bot.  Instant damage via simple hotkeyed macros.  Ideal for 3-boxing.<br />

Sounds odd - and I can completely understand not wanting to 3-box two of the same class, but it would be a pretty deadly combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dump the shaman for a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd dump the cleric for a bl before I dump the shaman for one. You lose alot of the beastlords dps if hes gotta play slower instead of dps, and with a bl pet and bl meleeing the shaman can still keep up on heals since mobs die pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For Ease I'd deffinately say Mage/ BL/ Sham:<br />
<br />
I bot my Shaman and never look at his screen, It's all hot keyed.  Mage is the same thing, /assist BL /stand off /pet attack /pause 3 /cast DD.  <br />
<br />
2 Sick damage pets<br />
1 um.... Sick (in the negative context) pet<br />
Mage pet buff items<br />
Haste<br />
Slow/Q= keep Any melee class alive forever<br />
a DPS heavy Melee &amp; Caster<br />

<br />
I would dissagree with throwing a chanter in there.  Too attention intensive if you ask me worrying about charm breaking and what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As i sit at work i wonder why not a necro in the place of the cleric.  Necro are machines plain and simple.  Another pet, DOTS to kill for, FD ..  do i have to go on any futher?  Just thougth i would throw that out.<br />

<br />
Wow, you bot a shm in an xp situation?  When I multi-box I always play my shm as the main screen because shm are one of the few classes that you have to be constantly hitting keys for (or at least the way I play).  Right now I run a shm and mage on one computer and a war on a second, while my gf plays a wiz and cler on two computers.  The wiz and mage (and most of the time war) are ridiculously easy to box.  I don't ever hit any more than three keys, yet, with my mage hehe.<br />
<br />
To the original post author, who does your tanking right now?  Do you try to keep the mobs on the mage pet or can your 61 shm torpor tank?  I would think that a 65 mag/shm/clr boxed trio would lose a lot of dps because the shm would be tanking.  I have done a LOT of tanking with my shm and it's always so much faster when we have just one melee to tank instead of the shm.  Look a little into the future with your trio and what spells are realistically available to you and where you plan to go (elementals?).  If you will be outside of elementals then a shm with Q and a plate tank will be able to keep up on healing and contribute plenty of DPS.  A bst, rng, or mnk could even tank just fine with some nice gear and aa's.  I would say perhaps a pally or sk for tanking and more dps than the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well right now my shaman is 62 and has all 61-62 spells, Str of Diaku, tears of Saryn, BoU, BoS, and Q in the bank for him.  I plan on going all out leveling him in groups till 65 no 3 boxing exp isnt close to grouping.  My only thought about plate tank is the cost of outfitting them to a level where they can be productive and withstand the beat.  A caster isnt very expensive and i have alot of hand downs from my mage.  I would love to 3 box in EP someday but odds are really will i make it that far, probably not.  My guild is slowing moving along with flagging.  We have done all the tier1 flagging but does not have the number to move up to tier2 bosses yet.  If i go with tank class would probably go pally cause we only have 2 pallies in guild and pally things have been known to rot before like that red sord from bot towers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I 4BOX a lot (EQW with a Virtual Destkop Manager to quickly switch between them) with these toons:  65 SHM, 64 PAL, 65 MAG, 62 ENC.  I'm not very successful at LDoN's yet (2-6) but there are few tier 2 zones I can't hold a camp in.  Everyone is right about MAG being ridiculously easy to box, as is a Pally.  SHM and ENC are the tough ones for me and I'm usually on one or the other, depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
I feel for ya on DPS.  MAG DPS is great but SHM dps isn't (not even with MAG toys for the pet) and honestly neither is my PAL.  ENC for me doesn't do much but pull and debuff (I have all his spells designed to handle CC if I need it - no room for nukes/DoT's)  <br />
<br />
I've found that Anathema is helping the SHM dps some and I suspect that Bane will help even more.  I think I might consider working on some simple DPS upgrades for your SHM before you throw out your cleric or SHM.  Since you've got a Cleric you could consider having both BoS and Bane up at all times and using the MAG's BA IV item you'd be able to hold down almost 700 dam/tick on just about every mob you came to. (I have SHM Malos and MAG Malosinia now to ensure maximum change for both DoT's to stick).<br />
<br />
I do agree that dire charm would be a nice addition for DPS and I'm certainly pushing my ENC in that direction.  I'm not sure though that I'd give up on that CLR or SHM just yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would agree with the necro idea.  Necros really aren't to bad to bot and they have a lot of utility.  Can rez in a pinch if there isn't a cleric around, they can help with healing, they can pull quite well, and they have fairly nice pets.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a big fan of botting or multi-boxing.  I'd prefer that a game be enjoyable to play on one account with other people.  I'd also prefer that a game not be so competitive for plats, xp, and loot that people prefer to go to any lengths to avoid sharing all of that with other players.<br />
<br />
I guess the good side benefit to multi-boxing is that it keeps players that I'd probably rather not be associated with busy and out of my way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm power leveling up a monk right now. Really I dont need a lot of DPS in most situations, but the reason I want a second char is so I can cheese some zones easier. Right now we can solo a lot of places, but we alway seem to miss one thing or another. I picked a Monk for FD, now I can FD stuff out, tag with the Shm and take it out easily. The monk at that point is just a nice DPS boost the my dots and dogdog.</div></div><hr />

I multi-box because I like filling spots in my group with my own characters so I can easily avoid incompentant players :)</div></div><hr />
