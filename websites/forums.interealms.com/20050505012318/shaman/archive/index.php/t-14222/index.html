<br />
Well luckily I have my VT key for a looong time, but I need to camp it with a friend of mine. SO we went in, rocked and got to the bridge.<br />
We snared a mushroom and feared. He didn't wanna go over the invis bridge!!<br />
<br />
Same with a thought horror, tried multiple times.<br />
Did they change this with the pathing fix patch?<br />
<br />
Well I kinda wanna get the shard done with my bro.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? (And no, not the cleric DA one please:)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I downloaded a collection of maps for use with the new UI window, which has a good one of the Deep. Through trial and (1) error, I found that the bridge isn't exactly as marked, but knowing which way the error is, I can compensate and safely make it across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can borrow some Holgresh beads, you can follow an Eye of Zomm across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you download the maps off eq-toolbox.com, the bridge is well marked.  Also, you can summon your pet and move forward a little bit.  He moves a little farther and then comes back to you.  You move forward again.  He moves forward and drops off the edge.  You Summon Companion him back and know where the edge is now.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We sent a few gnomes ahead to drop food,<br />
marking the bridge for the rest of us. Took a few <br />
of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Noticed that about the shroom recently, sometimes it will go across, sometimes it doesnt.<br />
<br />
<br />
I second the gnome idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We usually send a rogue. They can survive the fall. And they can mark the path by dropping summoned daggers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Run and jump off on purpose. Fall for a few seconds. /Q<br />
Log back in, and continue the fall which if timed right you will only take a couple hundred damage. If you're really good you can get it down to under 20 pts of damage... :D <br />
<br />
Run up the other side, if your a barbarian, use bearform, makes scaling the wall up to the ramp a ton easier.<br />
<br />
EDIT: You don't need to fight your way in, SoW up, buff resists, invis, and run your way to the bridge and kamikazee off. The shrooms on the other side use to be great exp and collect Seru bane parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I second the /q while jumping.  Though as my cleric I always DA down.  ;)<br />
<br />
Also you can get a shard before the bridge, really no need to go across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Viscerator, you tried the run through and drop method since the pathing changes?  I tried it the other day and all the mobs that chased me just walked straight down the fall after me.   I may have jumped at a wrong spot, so curious when you last tried this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I haven't tried it recently no. But if they were hitting you in midair, color me impressed. It use to be a case of not getting stunned/cursed in order to make it to the ledge.<br />
<br />
In that case you would have to fight and clear, but still the jump /q should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yes the jump /q trick is great :)  just dont /q to early or you will die when you come back happened to a friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well if there are 2 of you its easier.<br />
Buy a couple of tinkered stalking probes and have somebody follow somewhat behind the eye and drop stuff on the bridge to mark the trail.<br />
Summoned arrows, food or what not works great to mark it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, here is the proper way to do it.<br />
<br />
First of all, where the bridge starts.  Off to the right of the fake bridge, if you look closely at the cliffs edge, there is a corner where the cliff bends.  It is a very obtuse angle, but it is there.  It would kind of look like this ___________/ except the angle is wider and its upside down.  If you are facing the opposite side, the edge of the bridge is on the corner and the width of the bridge extends to the right.<br />
<br />
Once you think you know where the bridge starts, go in to bear form.  After you have done that, click off sow and then duck.  When you move, you will move very slowly and slide.  Start sliding off the edge of the cliff.  If you are in the wrong spot, your model will start to go over the edge and will be suspended at a very akward angle, almost completely upside down.  If you are in the right spot, your model will dip for a second and then right itself again, because you are once again standing on solid, yet invisible ground.<br />
<br />
Once you are on the bridge, you are going to want to run between the two big pillar things.  Looking across the bridge lines you up almost exactly with one of the primary compass directions.  I think it is west.  If you turn about 1 tick to the right from whatever the primary direction is, you'll be on course to stay on the bridge.  Go slowly at first, and use the bear form trick.  If you are about to go off the edge, you'll start to dip down.<br />
<br />
Once you have done it a few times, you can just look across the gap and see where the other side of the bridge will end, and can just go straight for it.  I just autorun now I know it so well.<br />
<br />
Also, someone said that rogues survive the fall:  There is a small chance that anyone can survive.  I have survived it before.  In general, though, no one lives.  Last time I was in the deep we had an invisi-bridge virgin with us, a rogue.  I told him &quot;There's a trap in the middle of that bridge that needs to be disarmed&quot; and sure enough, he died when he fell.  After I finished laughing, I felt kinda bad =\.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just close my eyes and run like hell.....makes it more fun for me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Download this attachment for the edges of the bridge :D Thanks for all the tips in this thread - the one from Jinheim made this possible.<br />
<br />
Save &quot;thedeep_3.txt&quot; to the EverQuest\maps\ folder.<br />
Just two lines is all it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was about to flame you for bringing up a 2 month old thread, but then I realized that you complimented me!.<br />
<br />
/cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tikker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you look straight down, and then straight across the chasm, you can see slight purplish changes in the rock<br />
<br />
that's how you can see where the invis bridge is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Plus it's between the two pillars of stone on the opposite, leading off from a little point on the near side.  <br />
<br />
Viscerater killed me!<br />
<br />
I tried that /q out trick, but evidently I /q out too soon.  20k damage keeerrsplat.  <br />
<br />
You owe me a coffin Viscerator!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bard can DA the whole group and all jump down and walk up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Haha, ok your check is in the mail...honest.<br />
One more thing about that /Q....if you jump, and get paranoid and hit /Q before you have fallen a good couple of seconds it will resume your fall from where you did the /Q. If it is still too high.....splat.<br />
<br />
Soooo what you CAN do is /Q again after you log back in.<br />
Example, Jump, fall 1sec, /Q...login, fall another 2secs, /Q, login and fall the remainder of the way for a couple hundred damage.<br />
Good way to do it if your quake-reflexes are a bit rusty.<br />
<br />
BTW, this is also the easiest way to get a level 1 rogue to the bottom of The Hole if you want to spy on Master Yael. Although at level 1, your /Q has to be spot on, because most level 1's don't have more then 25hps to lose in the first place.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The best way to get shards across the bridge is not to !!!<br />
<br />
just camp the thought leeches on the near side of the bridge, got a couple of shards there already</div></div><hr />
