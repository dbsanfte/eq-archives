<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to get a good exp group together for tonight. We can hunt in The Hole, Seb, or HS. I have two yellows to go til I am out of the hell that is level 54 and I am hoping to do that this week. Post here if you are up for some mad exp, and what zone you'd prefer to hunt in. I'd like to have the group assembled by no later than 7 est. Hopefully 6 to 6:30 though :) Let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am up for this.  I am about 5 blues away from 54 and would like to have some shot of hitting 55 by the tourny.  HS is the best xp zone, I think.  Though the Hole is very good as well.  I would also like to put in a pitch for Chardok.  Good XP (not as good as HS or teh Hole though), and again, a chance at getting the SBS.  I will buy an SBS before the tourny if I have to, but it seems a waste.  Where ever the group wants to go (not Sebilis, actually, that place is like Karnors to me - always packed and too many conductors) I will follow, but those are my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Count me in.  I don't really care where as long as the blue bar is moving.  Just let me know where and I'll be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just an FYI...The 2 highest exp zones in the game for one group of 50+ are Kedge Keep and The Hole. That is non-planes and non-Velious because I don't think anyone really has a clue about all the Velious zones and you can't really do them for exp anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok HS it is. We'll start at 7 est sharp. Meet at the drop down.<br />
<br />
So far we have:<br />
<br />
Kilrain<br />
Ludaian<br />
Aaeamdar<br />
Grayeyes<br />
<br />
We need 2 more. Preferably a cleric if possible but I think we can handle it if we get two healers of any kind. Druid/Shaman etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kil, you'd better wait for me!!  Like I told you, hubby faction until about 6:30pm CST, that's 7:30pm EST.  Grayeyes is in Karnors, someone PLEASE wait for me this time!</div></div><hr />
