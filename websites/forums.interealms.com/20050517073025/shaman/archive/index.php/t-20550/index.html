<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sigh, my friend told me he saw a guy in server last week giving away many 500k to people that answered riddles. And then I checked Yantis/IGE and their prices have dropped to rock bottom. Good time to buy some plats heh. Checked some EQ trading sites and saw many new sellers each with millions of plat to sell on every servers with extreme low prices.<br />
<br />
It happens again and again and SOE is slow to react or doesn't even care about it. I strongly believe that IGE is operated and owned by Sony. There is nothing I can do besides posting here to whin about it.<br />
<br />
These people have already made millions and they don't care about the game or the players. It hurts to see the game that I love so much ended like this.<br />

Unless the bug is posted on wide open forum, we will continue to live with it.</div></div><hr />

Well, after spending hours and hours farming to get the plat I need to get some gear..I think I would appreciate it just as much if a friend had given me 500k PP:)  <br />
<br />
I'm just saying how much satisfaction is there in farming for hours and hours for plat?  I'm honest, that is why I don't do dupes, not because I want the 'satisfaction' of farming little to  no-xp stuff for PP.</div></div><hr />

when plat becomes worthless, how am i supposed to buy anything?  let alone those spells?  the value of the lower end items in the bazaar will not keep up with the high end items i have to have, especially on a serve where there are fewer true newbies that have to buy my items to improve, as opposed to their 'mains' getting it for them?<br />
^edit^<br />
<br />
Sony will never ever do this, because of the hollering from ole skool peeps.  but to &quot;control&quot; the economy, all non no-drop items should be forsale off a vendor for a price.  similar to how all LDoN gear can be bought for points.<br />
<br />
i do not care what they price is, let Sony set it.  (granted they will mess it up, but not worse than the current system)<br />
<br />
Sony already sets a min price for all items by the fact that no one would knowingly list an item below vendor price.  why don't they set a maximum price where you could buy the item from a vendor?</div></div><hr />

At least the PoP 65 spells are available to people who can't obtain the Runes.  Malo and Torpor were unobtainable to most Shammies before PoP (Lvls and new spells) and LoY (Spell research).  I just don't get it I guess, nobody wants to spend a few weeks for nice items anymore /shrug<br />

There is a vast difference in spending a few weeks before and a few weeks now. Before you could solo your spells or you could just take a friend or 2 nad be the main healer for a relaxed farming session. Now you need a full group with a dedicated healer in a zone that not everyone has the expansion for.<br />

I dont think its has to do with time at all, in most cases atleast. I am a guildess shaman and you know how many god groups i have gotten ?<br />

Lit, usually I lean toward agreement with your comments ... but this one is a tad bit too revisionist.<br />
<br />
In Kunark you were not casually going out with a group of friends to get Torpor or Malos. They were rare to drop and only the top tier guilds were killing the mobs that dropped them.<br />
<br />
Same with Velious spells ... and on up the line including PoP.<br />
<br />
Initially only the top end folks were getting the spells first. With GoD there is actually a bit more overlap, but then the game has changed a lot. For single group GoD events friends can give it a try and they don't necessarily come from the same guild.<br />
<br />
Each expansion has made it tough on the majority of folks to get the new toys.<br />
<br />
As for the price gouging and over-inflation ... SOE needs to slam those doing it hard. To do so would simply require them to make folks conform to the EULA. Which, ironically, is the reason they don't. If they ever did, then all the folks who ever logged in a friend's account or let a friend log in theirs would have to be treated equally with other offenders. By allowing the 'little abuses' SOE has placed itself, legally, between the proverbial rock and a hard place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Easy enough to get runes in BoT or other droppables to buy spells with. I'd gotten two runes before even reaching 65 that way (and this was long before bot was open to everyone).<br />
<br />
As for the duping I've heard about this as well, if SoE really gave a crap about the game they'd log plat balances and if anyones account changed by a huge ammount in a small time it'd definately be worth researching. Theres definately going to be legit reasons for large cash changes (moving a guild bank or something), but most of the time going from nothing to a few million plat should really be a red flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You most certainly could.  They were just stupidly rare drops.  Lots of casual people could get in pick up groups at Crypt in Sebilis.  Guardian wurms were another source, although it was like 1 in 100000.  Overking, Tola, Prot and Kunark dragons weren't quite so accessible, but my guild killed like 25 Kunark dragons without getting Malo or Torpor.  <br />
<br />
That was pretty the only way to get them - get stupidly lucky on a drop.  Or buy it from someone else who did.  <br />
<br />
Level 65 spell distribution patterns are screwed up.  It's pathetic that essentially the only real way for a non-raider to get those spells is to farm plat to buy in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
BoT is not a good source.  I spent a ton of time in BoT and got 1 rune there the whole time.  <br />
<br />
Then you go the elemental planes and get 8 runes in one night - and nobody needs them.  So you sell them to non-raiders in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
That's great game design.</div></div><hr />

Well i dont know about you, but i remember going and duoing and trioing GW in SF and clearing the VP entrance and camping Emp. All these were not hard and were done with a casual group for 3-6 friends that didnt have to be end game raiders for you to get. Infact the guild i was in at the time raided like once every 2 weeks and we all were very low end, but it was FUN.<br />
<br />
To me personaly i feel that fighting down seb and camping emp is 100 times more interesting, fun,challanging and rewarding then going to GoD and cycling adventures till a named pops then going in and killing it, evac out and repeat. Its a job not a adventure how the system is right now. /shrug<br />

Go Gart- I couldn't agree more. This makes as much sense as to have Sol Ro Tower the #1 place to have ornate drop off yard trash.  Not coincidentally by and large the people w/ SRT do not even want ornate- it goes straight to the bazaar at highly inflated prices, strictly because demand far outstrips supply.<br />
<br />
And why is supply so limited? Because the best zone to get ornate is flagged off limits to the people who would use the gear.<br />
<br />
That's great game design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I tend to disagree with the Sol Ro concept on this one.  The reason for this was that I used to play on Firiona Vie when it first opened up.  When the server opened up it was Rygorr and Crusty armor that was fetching high prices, because people didn't have access to it due to levels.  <br />
     Sol Ro is a present example of a zone that X number of people have access to and Y number of people could use the drops.  When PoP first came out Ornate was awesome gear, and primarily reserved for top-end guild/players as a way to upgrade for the Elemental Planes.  Back when PoP came out you have to be flagged from the get-go.  For the top-end guilds/players speed was the key.  They didn't take time to farm BoT or Tactics to the level it is done today, so Sol Ro was a zone that they could finish upgrading in preparation for RZ and Sol Ro.  Fast forward three expansions and we see peeps who want their ornate gear upon hitting 51 (think this is the level you can complete the quest.), and by the time they are 62-65 they are trading it out for LDoN, raid gear.  When SOE creates content they create it with progression in mind, not farming.  Guild Y needs keys for X zone to get Z gear for zone F content.<br />
If Ornate was to commonly drop in BoT the prices would be lower, but people &lt;62 would be complaining that they don't have access to it.  PoP is 3 expansions old now, and for the most part Ornate gear stat-wise is obsolete.  The focus effects are the only reason people are still wearing a few pieces.  There will always be some form of droppable gear in the game that limited people have access to due to whatever reason.  The gear will always draw high prices due to the simple supply/demand economics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If Ornate was to commonly drop in BoT the prices would be lower, but people &lt;62 would be complaining that they don't have access to it.<br />
The difference between people &lt; 62 complaining and those of us who want ornate but struggle to afford it is that it's a 100% guarantee that a player will be 62 at some point where they can go get their armor.  It is by no means a certainty that a player will become SRT flagged.  In fact, it's highly unlikely unless that player is a fulltime raider, in which case they don't need/want the ornate anyways.  This is a legitimate complaint- it's bad enough raiders get the gear orders of magnitude greater than casual players, but they also have the best access to droppable casual gear as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
There will always be some form of droppable gear in the game that limited people have access to due to whatever reason.  The gear will always draw high prices due to the simple supply/demand economics.<br />
If the scarcity of this gear was limited due to difficulty for the casual player (e.g. warlord's gauntlets out of hard LDoNs), this would be perfectly acceptable as there is nothing per se preventing the player from eventually attaining them.  When an arbitrary game design decision results in the artificial separation of the playerbase (i.e. PoP zone flagging),this is bad.  At least with the drops out of hard LDoNs the player can go there and try for them directly- the best way to go after ornate unfortunately for the non-raider is to camp the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I don't mind playing Capitalism 101 in the bazaar personally, but it really isn't my ideal method of earning gear in a high fantasy game- I'd far rather kill for it myself, as I suspect many other casual players would.  And no, I'd do not want to kill for it with myself and 70 of my closest &quot;friends&quot;.<br />

<br />
<br />
Beg to differ, BoT is one of the best sources. We do BoT tower boss runs at least 3-4 times a week and always manage to pick up at least 2 or 3 runes on each run along with lots of ornate and cool items like Cap of Drowned Souls, Glowing Orb of the Stormwatcher, etc. The entire run of Chaoswind, Thunderclap, Icestorm and Hailstorm takes about an hour and is single groupable and is my primary source of plats. The runes come up so often that they're given away after we roll on the good loots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My thoughts exactly, I believe most of the ornate line drops in BoT and Tactics, so you and 5 of your buddies can go camp the mobs.  The point is that it drops and the named have set loot tables unlike Sol Ro where drops off trash mobs are random.  The drop rate might suck, but it can and will eventually drop.  Of course you are going to have to compete with everyone else who also wants the same drops, but that is how the game goes.  Remember that at one time BoT was closed to the majority of the public.  You had to complete a PoJ trial AND complete the BoT key quest out of PoStorms.  SOE saw it fit to unlock PoV,PoS,CoD,HoH, and BoT to the casual player so they would have a chance at Ornate gear, runes, and decent xp.  Whether you choose to wait it out or head to the bazaar is your choice.  When PoP came out nothing was rotting- the hoard of parchments that normally rot on named today where desperately needed then.  Opening up Sol Ro to the general public would just make it Karnor's 3.0.<br />

SOE didn't neglect the casual player- LDoN was their answer to the casual players' gripes about gear issues.  Through LDoN you can obtain near-elemental quality gear minus the focus effects.  That was what they felt was a reasonable trade-off for not raiding.  Now, gathering points for LDoN is time-consuming, but you will eventually gather up the points to buy the gear.<br />
<br />
There has to be an incentive for raiders to raid, because if there wasn't no one would raid.</div></div><hr />

Before the added incentive of points drew me from PoP to LDoN for exp, I grouped extensively in Tactics and BoT. A rune has never crossed my hands. I managed to get ornate gloves and sleeves in BoT, but the pants and coif are bazaar loot—as are all my 65 spells and most of the 63/64 ones.<br />

<br />
The LDoN system requires a casual player to get the LDoN armour and then three augmentations per slot - about 3000 points per slot.  So please do the maths and tell us how many years do you think it would take a casual player to get a set of LDoN gear?</div></div><hr />

The VERY obvious answer to this is that the incentive to raid ought to be: that you enjoy raiding.<br />

If - as you suggest - no one actually wants to raid then lets make EverRaid back into EverQuest, a game that everyone can play and enjoy playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aren't you saying right here that SRT is already overcrowded because so many guilds are there already? In that case what difference would a few more casual peasants make? You're already in the elementals anyways, right?  Or is the real reason that you don't want to lose another country club exp zone where you can make serious plat selling ornate in the bazaar because the prime market for ornate can't even go after them personally due to being locked out of the best zone for ornate.  You can't say SRT would be crowded and then say it is crowded in the same paragraph- please.<br />

That was what they felt was a reasonable trade-off for not raiding.  Now, gathering points for LDoN is time-consuming, but you will eventually gather up the points to buy the gear.<br />
<br />
As has already been established, it's the foci/FT that makes ornate worthwhile.  &quot;Near-elemental&quot; w/o foci/FT is &quot;near junk&quot;.  Do you think I wear ornate boots/sleeves for the phat stats?  I can't get MP/IH in LDoN, see a problem there?  SOE throws casuals one expansion (don't bring up LoY, it did nothing for those of us &gt; 60 that don't raid), so we're set forever?  You don't think we want to progress as well?  Why do you think PoV/BoT are so crowded?<br />
<br />
<br />
There has to be an incentive for raiders to raid, because if there wasn't no one would raid.<br />
There has to be an incentive for casuals to play, because if there wasn't no one would play.<br />
<br />
I've come to terms w/ SOE's apparent willingness to abandon its casual playerbase and continue the &quot;gear gap&quot; and artificial separation of the playerbase.  From my perspective, SOE is counting on WoW's release to siphon off nearly 100% of the casuals out of the game so they can focus on EverRaid and not have to design future expansions for two crowds, raiders and casuals, due to their own poor design.  <br />
<br />
After all, there's way more raiders than casuals, right?  So losing most of the casual playerbase should have little to no impact on EQ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Cause without the lesser people oohing and ahhing over the gear. the gear just becomes another time sink. One of the first things I ALWAYS see when one of the &quot;lesser folk&quot;, steps up to the big time, leaving friends and family to &quot;make it in the big city&quot; (read Elementals/ Raid Guild) Is the item linking to thier old &quot;lesser friends&quot;.<br />
<br />
Or are you telling me that the challenge of farming is what keeps all the raids going? <br />
<br />
I for one can't wait to see what happens to the game once CoH and Warhammer and WoW all come out. Maybe SoE will wake up when a exodus happens and I can come back to a game that only needs people who like each other to advance, rather than 72 of your closest &quot;Buddies&quot; To march goosestepping all the way to victory.<br />

I don't want SRT to be opened because I do see it as a future xp zone when I am bored with LDoN.  I hate BoT for the very reason that it is crowded constantly, there are trains, nasty ooc's, ks'ing, and a hoard of other problems.  For those people that went through the time and hassle to get their flags- I think they deserve access to a quiet zone.   Now, to be honest, I bought my Ornate gear outside of gloves and tunic which I have both replaced since then.  I farmed the plat to buy them.  Do I think that was fair? yes.  It is ridiculously easy to make plat in the game today- you just need to know where to go.  I play Everquest because it is a time sink.  If I was handed gear every 1-2 hours I would stop playing the game- it devalues the experience for me.  If you look at my magelo I think I have 3 pieces of raid gear- 1 came from ChardokB and the other 2 came from BoT Towers.  I am by no means &quot;uber&quot;.  My reasons for keeping people out of SRT is simple.  Flagging for SRT is long and tedious, and the individuals that succeed tend to know their class and their abilities.  I would enjoy playing in a zone that is not crowded with people training, kill-stealing, or just making an ass of themselves in /ooc.<br />
<br />
    LDoN offers 4 lines of gear for each class.  They range from low level to sub-elemental quality.   The most expensive line of gear is 1492 points, but the second line of gear is Ornate quality minus the focus effects- it goes for 400's if I remember correctly.  At level 65, you are looking at completing 8-9 LDoN's to get said piece of gear.  I don't think that is &quot;too much&quot; for the casual player.  Completing 1 LDoN a day would net you a piece of gear every 8 days.  Fully augmenting said piece by playing 1 adventure a day will probably take 2 weeks.  <br />
<br />
     SOE has made the game much easier today in its present form.  The introduction of PoP books, Maps, maxed sense-heading, and relatively easy high-end CR's (read: PoP) have helped the average gamer.  If you die- you are usually only 3 zones away via PoP books.  It used to be a lot worse.  I remember as a melee dying on my way to HHK from Qeynos back in the day, and having to make that run across the Karanas all over again without invis.<br />
<br />
     There are easier ways to get gear in the game than LDoN.  When I am looking to gear up I head over to Allakhazam and browse through the zone guides.  I check drop info, mob info, and force requirements.  I watch patch messages for &quot;zone revamps&quot; and check them out.  There are about 100+? zones today- about 15-30 that are inaccessible without keys,flags,quests.  I would say about 50 of those zones are empty.  Gear drops, sometimes often, and a lot of it is soloable/groupable.  Zones like Droga, Cazic Thule, Dragon's Necropolis, Siren's Grotto come to mind- these zones are usually empty. (not Droga)<br />
Plane of Hate is a ghost zone since re-vamp.  Bring a group and work on Marsinger's quest gems.  Experience is pretty good in the second level area, and gems and armor pieces (turned-in for gems) brings a decent amount of plat to the group.  There is tons of stuff to pull there- the zone is empty!  There are some absolutely stunning zones out there that many never see.  Friends of Veeshan? try running through Skyshrine one day- that zone is massive!  I spent very little time in PoP for xping- its dull and boring. There are lots of idiots running around and the loot tables suck at best.  I enjoy soloing and grouping, and there are plenty of places to do that.  Many will net you more money and drops than PoP ever will.  There are many enjoyable places in the game- sitting around BoT waiting for a group is not one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">EQ made a huge mistake separating the game into Raiders v. Non-raiders by express content design.  <br />
<br />
It was one thing when raiders went below in Sebilis to beat on mushrooms and Trakanon; it's entirely another in PoP and GoD.<br />
<br />
Raider whining is at an all-time pathetic level though.  <br />
<br />
If you don't like raiding, don't raid.  If you like raiding, ****.  Of course there should be some distinction in rewards for raiding, but who's kidding who?  The rewards for raiding are sky-high; if you don't raid you max progression extremely fast and any further progression is essentially stopped.  Anyone who whines about raiding as &quot;work&quot; is just retarded.  <br />
<br />
The game design is increasingly baked, and although I have elemental access I think it blows.  Of course, elemental access doesn't mean much really, but for many it remains an impenetrable barrier and a bright line to doing anything more in EQ.  Is this what developers want?  I don't think so, but it's what they've got.  And shut up about LDON.  A pocket game inside a MMORPG isn't much of an answer, plus LDON gear blows, takes far MORE time for upgrades than raiding and it is incredibly boring.  For me, naturally; I understand others may have different impressions.  <br />
<br />
And I like raiding, go figure.  It's the small group content I find boring now.  LDON is like taking Sominex.  I'd quit in a heartbeat if that were my only option.  <br />
<br />
But Izmalis and these guys are right, and the game design is off track.  The principle is good, but it's gone too far.  <br />
<br />
It's great watching newbie powergamers blast by all previous content in 3 months and glom onto a high end guild who can then head to bulletin boards and defend ****ty game design.  <br />
<br />
Moreover, it's also great reading about bottom feeding powergamers like Winterfury who also highlight a great aspect of current game design.  Time geared groups bottom feeding on BoT towers to either rot loots, gear twinks and/or sell the droppables to non-raiders, and who then act like that means anything other than him jacking off on the boards.  <br />
<br />
My enthusiasm for EQ is at an all time low after 5 years.  They are just dropping the ball.  <br />
<br />
I'm all for ubers having more and better gear, but there's a point at which it distorted.  Too much of a good thing is not a good thing.  That's the current state of EQ.  I like raiding, but trying to satisfy the relentless appetite of some for exclusion and artificial distinction is ruining this game.  <br />
<br />
Bring back the NTOV/Sebilis/Chardok model of zone design.  Bottle keyed/flagged zones to one, maybe 2 zones an expansion.  Monitor upgrade patterns for non-raiders, so folks can actually hunt for upgrades in a meaningful way, including spells, rather than farm crap to sell for plat in the bazaar to buy droppables from bottom-feeders like Winterfury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Sol Ro is much like NTOV.  <br />
<br />
Tons of room to hunt for random drops, with bosses and better drops tucked further away that require more people and somewhat more coordination.  <br />
<br />
People who hunt there essentially don't need the drops anymore, and they sell it off.  <br />
<br />
It's a classic example of a zone that used to be open to folks - and it was good that it was.  The old &quot;it will be like Karnors&quot; argument is such crap.  First off, people liked Karnor's (in a love/hate style), and it was an important part of dungeon progression in Kunark as folks leveled.  Secondly, SO WHAT if that it is like?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the flaws of PoP are increasingly coming home to roost in terms of the state of EQ.  <br />
<br />
I've been a huge fan of the game, subject to grumbling of course, but it has lost it's way in a big way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Actually, to answer your question- I am not in SRT.  I don't want SRT to be opened because I do see it as a future xp zone when I am bored with LDoN.

For those people that went through the time and hassle to get their flags- I think they deserve access to a quiet zone. <br />
The time and hassle of showing up for 70 person raids w/ guaranteed success after you read the strats off the web? How is cramming the majority of the playerbase into a handful of zones a good thing? You stated earlier that raid guilds are getting crammed into a few zones and that's bad- good for the goose but not the gander, eh?<br />
<br />
And don't think I don't understand the difference between a flagged and unflagged zone.  Tactics is far better than BoT and we love it thus far.  But that having been said, I still think it should be opened up- I am 100% against dividing the playerbase in a multiplayer game.  Since you're a huge LDoN fan apparently, you can always go there to get peace and quiet right?<br />
<br />
<br />
My reasons for keeping people out of SRT is simple.  Flagging for SRT is long and tedious, and the individuals that succeed tend to know their class and their abilities.<br />
<br />
Getting carried through flagging by a raid guild means you know your abilities?  I find an equal number of good/bad players in both the raid and casual crowd, since I group with friends in both camps regularly.<br />
<br />
<br />
    LDoN offers 4 lines of gear for each class.  They range from low level to sub-elemental quality.   The most expensive line of gear is 1492 points, but the second line of gear is Ornate quality minus the focus effects- it goes for 400's if I remember correctly.  At level 65, you are looking at completing 8-9 LDoN's to get said piece of gear.  I don't think that is &quot;too much&quot; for the casual player.  Completing 1 LDoN a day would net you a piece of gear every 8 days.  Fully augmenting said piece by playing 1 adventure a day will probably take 2 weeks.  <br />
<br />
You're way out of touch w/ LDoNs.  Even the 2nd level of gear (which I opted for on my sk as I will never live long enough to get 1492 gear in all slots) is 760 points, un-aug'd.  That's roughly 15 wins just for the armor, assuming the char is 65.  Throw on a solid type 3 item (1k+ usually) and a solid type 2 item (1k+) and you're still talking roughly 54 wins PER piece of armor! 1 LDoN a day is nearly 2 months per slot!  And when you're done, the armor still doesn't hold a candle to 2 year old VT gear.  And all of this assumes you get a group right away and the group wins handily- I can count on this because I have a close group of friends and we 2-box.  How many other people can count on this?<br />
<br />
<br />
     There are easier ways to get gear in the game than LDoN.<br />
<br />
Yes, I believe some refer to it as raiding.  I watched a good rl friend come back to EQ after a year off, join a raid guild w/ his druid and 6 months later he's got more hps and better stats/foci/FT than my sk.  <br />
<br />
<br />
There are about 100+? zones today- about 15-30 that are inaccessible without keys,flags,quests.  I would say about 50 of those zones are empty.  Gear drops, sometimes often, and a lot of it is soloable/groupable.  Zones like Droga, Cazic Thule, Dragon's Necropolis, Siren's Grotto come to mind- these zones are usually empty.<br />
<br />
Because for the most part they suck- the gear is even worse than what can be obtained in LDoN and PoP.  Yay, more +40 hp items! And exp anywhere outside PoP is brutal at best (can't comment on GoD as I don't own it).  Plane of Hate is the only zone you list that may hold any interest for the casual 65, but even then LDoN hards offer better gear and easier RvR.<br />
<br />
Gart, it's refreshing to see someone who raids who can actually see the long term negative effects of dividing the playerbase to the current extent.  Unfortunately SOE remains blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I think I agree with most of what you are saying Gart.  The flagging progress is a tremendous pain in the ass at best.  I started seriously playing Everquest shortly before the Velious expansion came out, and I loved it.  Velious always seemed to be filled with big boss mobs and large (maybe only my imagination) loot tables.  I think other things have changed the game as well though.  While Karnors was a great zone to learn about dungeon crawls and zone progression it was also in an out-of-the-way area.  Before PoP books you needed to either hoof it out there or track down a porter.  It took a bit of skill (not much) to GET to Karnor's.  In today's gaming environment there is no skill required to get to PoP zones other than knowing where the portal is at.  I see way too many Bot's, Ebayer's, and just morons out there than I did back in Velious.  It was harder to level back then, so people that couldn't play their class never really got past level 30 due to hell levels.  We don't see that today.  Now we are faced with powerlevelers and twink X classes being shoot out daily.  Being level 65 is no longer a viable form of class/game competence, and I see opening up a zone like Sol Ro which took many monotonous hours to be flagged for a bad idea.  High end gamers really are not looking for excessive amounts of plat.  They are spending their pp on three things: tradeskills, twinks, and toys.  To think that they or I would want the zone closed off for farming purposes is crazy.  They, as well as I, will be more concerned with getting the flags and moving on.  I hope to complete my flags, but I am not sure to what end it will do for me.  Being Elemental/Time flagged and being Elemental/Time flagged and actively raiding are two entirely different things.  <br />
     Do I think that the gear is imbalanced? yes.  There is a major difference between Ornate and Elemental gear stats.  I think the developers screwed up on that, but there is no real way to correct that now.  I see LDoN as their attempt to patch up the problem.  LDoN is the timesink for the casual gamer- its dull.  I hate it, but that is where my most readily available upgrades are at for this present time.  I will continue the drudgery of the slaughter fests to get it.  I also see a problem with focus effects- some are readily available while others are only on weak stat gear.  <br />
<br />
Mana Preservation- while getting easier to obtain is stuck on one piece of gear for the casual gamer.  There are a few ways around this, but they require completing long quest or hunting in nasty zones.<br />
<br />
Healing Focus Effects- the casual gamer has access to 3 items- ornate arms, a cloak, and a range item.  The stats for the arms are ok, the cloak horrible, and the range item can be used for better affects.<br />
<br />
Did anyone notice the focus effects given on the Tipt trial bracers?  Druid get a Vex Thal? extended enhancement focus, Clerics get an Elemental quality healing focus, and Shamans got Fury of E'ci? wth!<br />
That focus effects one spell, and I don't even use it anymore due to the ridiculous cast time on it.  Casters are in the same boat with Anger of Druzzil- a focus effect that I believe is already pretty common.<br />
<br />
Shamans finally had access to a Spell Haste IV focus augment thorugh LDoN, but its type 3, so effect to fork out the points for a piece of LDoN gear so you can get the augment.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a revamp of focus items.  Stop putting a nice focus on a ac5 20hp 30mana wrist and a lousy focus on a ac25 100hp 100mana item.  When upgrading gear I hate having to decide whether a focus is worth a loss of 80-100hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The person that mentioned that is in one of our time guilds.  This stuff all ends up in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Well, the point of my comment was a response to the statement that BoT is not a good source of glyphed rune words. In fact, it is, for those 65's who really need them.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm in one of the Time guilds but a few points to provide proper perspective:<br />
<br />
a) I've only been in this guild a couple of weeks and not only do I have NO time gear, I'm not even elemental equipped. My best gear is my ldon gear that I earned, bought and augmented myself from Everfrost; my Magelo is right there for anyone to see: 875942. <br />
<br />
b) The statement that &quot;this stuff all ends up in the bazaar&quot; isn't *entirely* true. I in fact still equip my Cap of Drowned Souls (personally looted from Thunderclap, augmented with my Sparkling Gem of Protection, personally looted off the enraged mama lizard in Tipt); and my Glowing Orb of the Stormwatcher (personally looted off Thunderclap). Sure, I sell the extras, like I said, it's my principal source of plats, but it's not like I'm slumming to farm stuff I would never use, one-grouping this encounter is challenging, exciting and fun. That we can do it in an hour is more a testament to our experience at it than any kind of dominance by virtue of gear or guild status.<br />
<br />
c) None of my time-flagged guildmates participates in these Bot Tower boss runs with me. It's a little group of folks that have been doing this for some time, long before I joined the time-flagged guild. None of these guys is time geared and few of them have elemental gear. We're mostly old friends making our way through the planar progression like everyone else (I will of course have an advantage here now having recently joined a time-flagged guild, but it hasn't been a factor yet).<br />
<br />
Again, the point of my message was to point out that BoT is in fact a very good source for plentiful Glyphed Rune Words. If you're interested in hearing more about the BoT tower boss runs and how we approach it tactically, let me know. Fun encounter.<br />

I for one would love to know what classes/gear/tactics are needed to do this as we love challenging single group content.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I don't mean to be harsh, but I am dismayed at the upgrade path options that are now placed in front of a significant percent of players through sloppy or stupid design (as I see it).  People are slammed to the end of their progression path, and then they hit a wall.  This creates a sense of frustration, and I don't think a game developer really wants that.  <br />
<br />
This is an adventure game, not BazaarQuest - where the goal is find phat camps to farm for plat, or worse, buy plat from creeps like IGE.  But folks are clearly given incentive to do that.  Distribution of gear and spells now essentially hinges on those who don't need those items farming them to sell in the bazaar to those who do need those items but who can't obtain them in the course of their ordinary gameplay - or any other equivalent items.  <br />
<br />
It's bad design and ultimately it hurts everyone if the game is degraded.  <br />
<br />
A very significant range of people will stop playing if this trend does not begin to switch.  EQ will of course plow on, but it needs to address certain issues or it will lose people it doesn't need to lose.  <br />
<br />
It's not groundbreaking to predict decline 5 years into a game cycle, but the point is, it doesn't have to decline.  This is a powerful, deep and terrific game, but it is increasingly distorted on many levels.  <br />
<br />
One hour, one group BoT tower boss raids are not typical, and I'm sorry, but my many many hours in BoT convince me it sucks as the primary distribution point for ornate and spells for those who actually want to try to get it themselves without being committed raiders.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what I said that deserved the name-calling and hostility. Like a lot of folks who post here I've got some decent gear (none really uber) and modest amount of Aa's (136) and I love playing my Shaman. I play my character hard, I quest as much as I can, I earn most of my own drops and I buy and sell in the bazaar for whatever I want that I can't get on my own. I like to think that the fact that I've just last week been accepted into a time guild is more a reflection of my commitment to my class and the game than anything else.<br />
<br />
I'll start another thread called &quot;Single-group BoT tower boss'ing&quot; since you inquired. We always wind up with nice loot and it does help me to pay the bills for the spells and equipment that I've acquired indirectly (my own major purchase that I did not loot is my Ring of Firewarding), but I gotta tell you, the real reason I do this event at the end of a long day of raiding or GoD trials is because it's such a rush. The fact that the rewards are both mental and material are part of the joy of this game and should in my opinion be celebrated, not castigated.<br />
<br />
If you see me on FV sometime, please stop and say &quot;Hi&quot;.<br />

This the Sol C ring? Pretty sure that's no drop. Did you mean something else?<br />

I'm on Firiona Vie, it's not NODROP here.<br />

I'd kill to go back in time and start my chars on this server.  Hell, I'd pay right now to move there.  Oh wait, I can't- I may actually get to upgrade my character w/o raiding then.<br />
<br />
Can't have that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I better exit this thread now, I don't seem to be doing too well here. Sorry for the miscommunication. /wave<br />

Sorry, my apologies.  Was worried maybe you'd misread and thought I was calling you names or something.<br />

Izmalis, Fv server was a neat idea, but its not holding up all that great.  When everything is droppable, it makes everything farmable for plat.  Being in a lower progression guild can be tough because some raid nights there is literally *nothing* of note up.  Its already been grabbed, and too often the loot put up for sale in the bazaar.  Even a year ago, it wasn't a problem, but there is a lot of raiders on FV now, and not enough content in the game to let everyone raid and farm both.  Great for the non-raider, great for the raiders at the top, sucks for all the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Just to add a counterexample to the idea that ornate is only for twinking or selling in the bazaar...<br />
<br />
On Brell, Alarius, the guild that's in 4th place in the whole POP progression, totally skipped on doing VT.<br />
They went from doing Velious and some other Luclin targets, straight into POP advancement.<br />
Before they got flagged for Ele planes, they spent many many hours xping in Sol Ro gearing up on ornate armor which was an upgrade for them at the time.<br />
<br />
Ornate isn't just for twinks.<br />
Ornate is what many many people wear when they first get flagged for Ele Planes where they can start getting the next level of upgrades of armor in POP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Winterfury, the hostility is not at you per se, but at the pattern that is increasingly emerging.<br />
<br />
You are a bottom-feeder however.  This term is accurate.  <br />
<br />
There is nothing really wrong with that on any particular level, as everyone pretty much does it.  Including me.  I also am a bottom feeder, because it is fun.<br />
<br />
That's fine, if people enjoy it they should be able to do it.  This is a game, and that's the point.<br />
<br />
The problem is that bottom-feeding is consuming content voraciously from those for whom it is not bottom-feeding - and loot is now primarily distributed by those who get things to sell in the bazaar to those who do need for plat.  The plat is farmed in camps or bought from IGE.  This isn't a good cycle.<br />
<br />
It's very difficult to compete when you need 2 groups to accomplish what others do with 3 people.  Just the speed factor alone makes it a huge problem.  <br />
<br />
Now a lot of people can do more than they realize, and there often targets to work on.  This is true.  But I look at members of my old guild, and they are not progressing at all.  A lot of folks got frustrated, and they are drifting away.  Interest drifted into apathy, and people log on more rarely now. <br />
<br />
But in a larger sense, the loot distribution patterns in EQ, and the progression path, are screwed up.  There is something signficantly wrong with the structure now.<br />
<br />
It's possible I'm finally just burned out.  But I do think this game is sadly awry from what it made it great. And what's more disappointing is it can be fixed in a way that's better for everyone, ubers, frustrated powergamers and the genuine casual player.<br />
<br />
PoP progression took a questionable game design idea and created a mess.  All this flagging, keying bull**** has some kind of role in the game, but it shouldn't drive the whole game structure.</div></div><hr />

I can see how that would suck for the middle tier guilds. They've needed to start instancing raid content for a long time, but understandably they'd rather crank out new expan$ions than fix past broken content.  <br />
<br />
FV would rock for my group of friends though, assuming we could generate enough plat to buy our gear.  Of course that still wouldn't be nearly as much fun as getting it ourselves, but at least we COULD get raid level gear, unlike the current situation on our server.<br />
<br />
&quot;Endgame&quot; for us is pretty much getting to the point where we can beat LDoN hards reliably, take down BoT wing bosses and go after some nameds in Tactics (Glykus, we will have a rematch soon!).  Of course, once that's completed we're all going to quit as there's nothing left for us to do- we're just hoping WoW is released right about that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Hey Gart,<br />
<br />
Pony up an apology to Winterfury and mean it man. You don't need to be rude to him, especially when you are wrong. You have great points to make usually, but the hostility here is just out of line.<br />
<br />
If all four tower bosses are up when Winterfury gets his group together and charges at them then more power to him and his team. There is nothing bottom feeding in the slightest about hitting the four tower bosses with a single group. Nothing.<br />
<br />
It might be difficult to compete on a speed basis when you need three groups to achieve what another single group can take, but in this instance there was not the slightest bit of arrogance in the post from Wintersfury. Nothing leads me to believe that he and his group will walk over a group setting up in a tower, etc.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of idiots around but lets not attack every single person that uses skill and creativity to enjoy taxing encounters with a minimal force.<br />
<br />
On Rodcet Nife, Ascent (Premier guild) has been three grouping Sol Ro when they have nothing better to do. I think they are currently trying to two group it and might have, I just haven't heard. There is nothing bottom feeding about this is there?<br />
<br />
People deserve to be able to challenge themselves, and if something that takes a full raid force for one guild can be beaten by 12 people from another it should be applauded. It might also make you move a little quicker the next time you want the target.<br />
<br />
Nice post by the way Winterfury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Well I wouldn't qualify what Winterfury is doing as bottom feeding, he actually wears some of what drops from the BoT bosses after all. However taking any number of people to tackle an encounter where none involved would use what drops is bottom feeding. That's my definition anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Apologize for what?  <br />
<br />
I said the guy was a bottom-feeder, and so he is.  Hell, I pointed out I bottom feed too.  Most of us do at some point or another.  That's how I, like many, got plat to buy a lot of my spells.<br />
<br />
My hostility is directed to what I perceive to be a problematic game dynamic.  <br />
<br />
I agree with you, more power to Winterfury, and absolutely he's free to farm bot towers for sellables.  The game is basically designed for him to do so to sell to others in the bazaar.  That's the point.  <br />
<br />
But he is a bottom-feeder and there is a problem with progression and character advancement in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">So calling out a rude comment deserves a negative reputation bump? And yes, a good hefty red one with associated points reduction. What's with you guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Yeah, I got one too.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was from me Gart. I assumed you gave me the one I got as it had a hefty points tally with it. I put a note with it and signed it. I don't anonymously post........ if it wasn't you, I apologize.</div></div><hr />
