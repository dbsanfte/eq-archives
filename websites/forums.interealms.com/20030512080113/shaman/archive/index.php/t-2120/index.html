<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well my 60 Druid friend and I decided to give the Arisen Iksar a shot, so we went down to see Oracle Qulin.. But stoopid drood aggroed him and got his ass kicked.. So he really didn't want to fight on the shore. Dragged him to kaesora to get him rez'd and decided I'd just hand in and pull the skelly there.<br />
<br />
This ended up working just fine, and although we were thrown off a bit when he started summoning, I managed to slow it and logged over my main to beat its ass down. Anyways, when we finally finished I made my way back to the shore to give the skull fragments to Qulin, but he was gone! Druid couldn't find him on track either. Went out to do some other stuff and came back after he had repopped, but apparently he doesn't want the fragments unless he's already been triggered :( .<br />
<br />
[Thu May 30 21:03:07 2002] Oracle Qulin says 'Suddenly without warning the skull flies from Quilin's hands and flies into the murky waters.  It stays submerged for a moment and then flies toward you, but this time an entire corpse is attached to it.'<br />
<br />
[Thu May 30 21:16:57 2002] --You have looted a Wet Skull Fragments.--<br />
<br />
[Thu May 30 21:21:26 2002] You tell your party, 'where did qulin go'.<br />
<br />
[Thu May 30 21:24:28 2002] Jentriken tells the group, 'he's not on track bro'<br />
<br />
Oracle Qulin says, 'I have no use for that item Waeb, you can have it back.'<br />
<br />
My only thought is he must despawn after about 15 min. Think the GMs will sympathize? Took me fuggin forever to find a group of people to go to HS with, and ended up giving away about 3 prods and helping lots of people get their keys cause they too lazy to do it themselves ;p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NPC trigger mobs despawning like that is normal. I'd say your odds of getting the skull back are somewhere between slim and none. Of course, the worst that could happen is they say no so there is no harm in trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is worth talking with a GM about.  I am still trying to get the Dusty Skull after spending several days in HS and I would hate to have to go after it again.  Since you are trying to hand the correct item in to the &quot;correct&quot; NPC you should be able to weasel some help out of Lebounde.<br />
<br />
If Vedan was still server GM it would not even be an issue and you could go on your merry way with note in hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The same thing happened to me yesterday. I read it was a 50 sk, and being a 60 shaman I figured I'd solo him. I spawned the Arisen Iksar, but unfortunately he ht-ed and killed my pet before I had aggro (was casting malo/slow). Well, I managed to kill him with epic and melee, but at the end he ran. I looted, came back, and as you described, no Qulin. Cursed a few times, and logged back on a day later. Qulin was back, but turning in the loot did not work. Went to Charasis for a new dusty skull, showed it to Granix again, gave it to Qulin, waited till he spawned the sk again, and just gave the loot I already had from first time. Voila, note, and cudgel 7.</div></div><hr />
