<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all.  I am somewhat new to the game, but from personal trail/error and reading the posts on this board i feel i know a good bit about shamans.<br />
<br />
However, a rl friend got me started in this game, and twinked my shaman pretty heavily(i tried other chars, shammy was one i liked best, so he twinked it).  <br />
Anyway, he gave me gear that HE thought shammys used, and i didnt know enough then to tell him otherwise.  <br />
<br />
Nowadays i know, but he doesnt.  For example he gave me GEBs, and i want to get JBboots for their AC, but he 'wont let me', or 'will be seriously pissed'.  He also gave me 6 wis rings, and wont even let me sell those to get 6/65 rings.   <br />
<br />
In other words he wont let me equip MY shaman as i see fit.<br />

<br />
thats my current magelo profile, youll notice its leanin towards wis side...Im trying to get more AC and HP jus not enough cash at the moment :(<br />
-<br />
<br />
Anyway, what do/would you guys do w/ a friend like this?  He thinks he knows best cause he has a 52 bard, but he barely new what canni was.  He even told me &quot;shamans CANT tank&quot;. =\<br />
<br />
thx =-)<br />
<br />
oh yeah, what price do the minor JB pieces go for, like the helm etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">start a new char, take the items you want off of your existing slave...err shaman...and do it the way YOU want to.  Then tell your friend to stuff it, you've sold the other stuff.<br />
<br />
Its hard to play a character and really 'get into it' when you can't even decide what to wear.<br />
<br />
Minor JB items are 500pp if you look enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah...<br />
<br />
he has been amazingly generous though, given me some amazing stuff, and lets me borrow his fungi, so i dont want to dick him over.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i can beat the crap out of him irl =-) hes a stinky hippy :P:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well just say...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey screw you hippy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then<br />
<br />
&quot;I do what I want! I smoke crack for breakfast! whateva whateve whateva&quot;<br />
<br />
Then<br />
<br />
You either give back the stuff you know dont fit a shaman and get yourself banded and work your way up the &quot;totem&quot; pole or make him see the light.  Cause bananas on your feet is not the shaman way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd give him back the twinkage you don't care for and fill in those items yourself with ones you would like.  That's the honorable way to go about it.  <br />
Give those GEBS back to him, as well as any other items you don't care for.  Work for the items you want, and buy them with your own pp.  I guess you don't have to strip down and go naked, but once you have an item in hand to replace what he gave you, it's only fair to give the item back to him.  After all it was a gift, requiring time and effort on his part to obtain.  He can sell them for pp then and tho he may not &quot;approve&quot; of your particular gear choices, he has no reason to be upset with you.  <br />
<br />
I've twinked several of my RL friends who now play.  One of them had a similar situation.  He decided to be a rogue and I twinked him out pretty decent.  I gave him banded, with a Iksar regen bp, a slimy poon for stabbin and another dagger for offhand when he was ready for it.  I gave him a couple swords to use as well to train 1hs.  Oh and I gave him dragon arms and dragon boots (from WW).  So suffice to say, he was a well equipped noob.  He got himself to lvl 20 fairly fast and made a twink necro.  <br />
He then decided he liked necro better and switched mains.  I was a little peeved cause I had spent a bunch of decent items twinking a char he won't play again.  But he grew into his powers and got most of his equipment himself.  The bp and boots and such he gave to his RL friend who started playing shortly after he did.  I've met the guy too and that was fine that the twinkage was going to a worthy cause.  I later gave him more items to twink the necro with, but most of the stuff he wears is stuff he gained himself, and gained pride in doing so. <br />
<br />
Sooo.  While nobody has the right to tell you what equipment to wear, it would be horribly rude to sell off the gear he gave you.  Offer it back to him as you replace it, with thanks for the use.  If he wonders why, just tell him you've learned a lot about the shaman class and these items just won't work properly for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I just looked at your profile.  It's some decent stuff for the most part.  Your hps are fairly ok, your wis is ok too, and your hat needs work haha.  I'd suggest getting a JB hat, as you can pick one up for around 300pp and that should be well within your capacity to raise.  Your earrings and necklace are ok, but since you're a barbarian you have another cheap alternative.  Save some Ivory that you find in your huntings and imbue it with a spell you can get in Halas.  Then take the pieces of imbued ivory to your local enchanter jewler and have them combine it with enchanted gold and enchanted platinum to make earrings and necklace respectively.  The earrings are 4 ac 4 wis 4 CR, the necklace is 5 ac 5 wis i think.  <br />
The necklace you have is reasonable tho.  The bp is not, replace that thing ASAP cause dammit that BS tunic sux ass.  It even sucked back when I was your level, I quested some totemic for myself to wear at lvl 27 I had my bp which I wore till 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh... watch out for those quiet, skinny hippies ... They are the scary ones ;)<br />
<br />
Regardless of what you do, it will affect your RL.... Fix the problem, not the symptom... and if he continues to be an ass about it ... /ignore .. and find a new friend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">depends on whether you'd rather worry about your gear or worry about your friendship. gear can be replaced, good friends can't, easily. imho, play your shaman more and don't worry about stuff. maybe you'll decide that you like being a grouping, wis-heavy shaman. perhaps you're more the solo type. you might decide you don't like cannidancing. personally, i'd be very appreciative of the twinked gear. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks all =-)<br />
<br />
yeah, i think im goin after the totemic BP, or saving for a froggy bp.  <br />
Anyway, i am talkin to him now =) trying to get him around.  ATM i think i can go step by step, like switching to rings now, and im already gonna get a JB helm, been plannin that for awhile.  i might use :shock: alchemy to get some pp for that, cause ive been asked for sow potions twice this past week in OT, and have been seeing some people /auc to buy some pretty frequently.  Im startin to get to the level where i can be more self made, but its taking time.  Once i get my little puppy i can solo more, thus potentially getting much more pp.  Also im moving to solb in a few levels, so a good income SHOULD come from hunting there =-D<br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />
<br />
ps. yes, fear the hippies(though i wouldnt call them quiet, more like loud and kinda annoying =P)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: dont worry that im not bieng appreciative, cause i am.  its just that i would like to arrange items as i see fit, so i can get the most out of my shammy =-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not much to add really, but I agree with most of what's been said.  Upgrade what you want, give him back his stuff in stages, thank him, and be done with it.  By no means should you ask for his permission to upgrade with your own cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What Landragoran said. I wouldn't sell the stuff, start buying ac gear as you can and return the items that you're switching out. <br />
<br />
If he doesn't want the item back, dunno how rich he is,  you can always sell em and put the money towards your fungi/jbb/ikky BP/REiF fund but other than that, good ac ger for a shaman really isn't that expensive.</div></div><hr />
