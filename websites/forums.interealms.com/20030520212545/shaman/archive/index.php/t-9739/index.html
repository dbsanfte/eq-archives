Pulled this from the AB forums, replaced Norway with Finland because the Finland version was the original, enjoy!<br />
<br />
To all of you who have been over here (in Finland) and gotten a glimpse of how this stuff works... Here's a written explanation. <br />
<br />
Temperatures: <br />
<br />
+15°C / 59°F <br />
This is as warm as it gets in Finland, so we\'ll start here. People in Spain wear winter-coats and gloves. The Fins are out in the sun, <br />
getting a tan. <br />
<br />
+10°C / 50°F <br />
The French are trying in vain to start their central heating. The Fins plant flowers in their gardens. <br />
<br />
+5°C / 41°F <br />
Italian cars won\'t start. The Fins are cruising in cabriolets. <br />
<br />
0°C / 32°F <br />
Distilled water freezes. The water in Oslo Fjord gets a little thicker. <br />
<br />
-5°C / 23°F <br />
People in California almost freeze to death. The Fins have their final barbecue before winter. <br />
<br />
-10°C / 14°F <br />
The Brits start the heat in their houses. The Fins start using long sleeves. <br />
<br />
-20°C / -4°F <br />
The Aussies flee from Mallorca. The Fins end their Midsummer celebrations. Autumn is here. <br />
<br />
-30°C / -22°F <br />
People in Greece die from the cold and disappear from the face of the earth. The Fins start drying their laundry indoors. <br />
<br />
-40°C / -40°F <br />
Paris start cracking in the cold. The Fins stand in line at the hotdog stands. <br />
<br />
-50°C / -58°F <br />
Polar bears start evacuating the North Pole. The Fin army postpones their winter survival training awaiting real winter weather. <br />
<br />
-70°C / -94°F <br />
The false Santa moves south. The Fin army goes out on winter survival training. <br />
<br />
-183°C / -297.4°F <br />
Microbes in food don\'t survive. The Fin cows complain that the farmers' hands are cold. <br />
<br />
-273°C / -459.4°F <br />
ALL atom-based movent halts. The Fins start saying &quot;****, it's cold outside today.&quot; <br />
<br />

Hell freezes over, Finland wins the Eurovision Song Contest.</div></div><hr />

I must inflict what history I recall. <br />
<br />
Yes, little Finland has an Army. It even has a history from WWII. <br />
<br />
The Winter War of 1939-40 saw the Soviet Union demand Finnish Territory at threat of war. The Finns declined. The Soviets, thier command devastated by the purges of the 30s, attacked and were stopped. Such was their belief in an easy fight, they invaded in Winter.<br />
<br />
Average daily temps were in that -50C range and the Soviet men and equipment froze stiff. Two Soviet divisions (20,000)in northern Finland were defeated by a pair of battalions (1600?).  While the Soviets eventually regrouped and pushed through, the Finns sued for peace and won a settlement. Post-Stalin estimates of casualites run in the 250,000 range. <br />
<br />
Later, Finland allied with Nazi Germany to reclaim it's territory. However, after reclaiming it's territory + some strategic spots, the Finns ceased. When the Soviets countered, they pushed north of Leningrad until they fought to a draw near Vipurri. Finland settled with the Soviet Union. <br />
<br />
Unlike the other German allies/territories- Hungary, Rumania, Czechslovakia/Poland, or the other Baltic states etc... Finland was allowed to remain independant and nuetral, though she lost territory and had to pay reparations.  She still has a small army and came through the cold war well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's not relating to Finland.  It's relating to Canada.<br />
Current temperature in Winnipeg, Manitoba right now is minus 23 Celcius, with a wind chill of minus 32.<br />
The last really cold spell we've had was 2 (maybe 3) years ago, with the temperature dropping down into the minus 30s Celcius for a few weeks, and I think it actually got down to minus 40 at one point, or just a degree or two off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nah that's usual Juujuu :) Here in Baltics (Estonia, more precicely) the temperature has gotten tad warmer, used to be -25 to -30 Celsius during the DAY, and closer or around -30 Celsius at night, for quite some time. Now, over the weekend, it got warmer and was then around -10 to -15. Today the weather gets somewhat colder again, temperature is between -15 and -20 celsius. Snow storm outside, you can't see stuff 5 meters away. Winter, sweet :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Applies to Alaska, too. I'm prone to walking barefoot out in the snow to take out the trash, coming inside and saying &quot;It's a bit wet out there&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is sad but true :D . I remember the ever so evil Kiikala training camp and standing in guard in the middle of the night when it's -30°C cold :P. <br />
<br />
Asyn's comment just shows how ignorant some people are. Btw the rest of europe is very lucky there's only 5 million of us  fins  around not something like 80 million :P</div></div><hr />
