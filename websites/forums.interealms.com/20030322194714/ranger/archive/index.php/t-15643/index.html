<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tocsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can any experienced PvPers recommend good gear for a new Ranger in PvP. I currently have a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic and a few ringmail items. I also have a pumice stone locked and loaded. Should I be thinking STR, MR, WIS, or just plain ol AC items? Thanks for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've heard it said, and I tend to agree that MR or other resists &gt; all.  Always sacrifice AC for better resists, if possible.  Snares and Roots, Flash of Light, etc. are the things that will get you killed more quickly than not having enough AC.  Can't move or see, you won't be lasting long as a melee.  That's why the DRT is a nice little item for lowbie Elves like us.<br />
<br />
And don't ignore DIS and POI resists, too.<br />
<br />
Basically, you should have all of your resists as high as possible.  100 is a good minimum, pre-buff number to shoot for, but that's a long way off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MR, MR, MR.  DId I say MR yet?   As long as you have MR its very hard to stop you.  Can't be rooted, Snared, Blinded or slowed.  If they dot ya, cure it.  If its  a DR based dot, kill ya foe then heal.<br />
<br />
 My Mr in pve gear is 130 ish unbuffed and 200 in pvp gear.  I can an do intend to get hit higher.<br />
<br />
Now remember if you are tash, malo'd and OOS things change but hopefully if  you are in the range of level 60s you will know when to run and when to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, unfortunately, on Sullon, I've been in the range of level 60s since 6th level.  I see your point, however. (But what's OOS?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tocsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now when we say MR, are we saying purely MR or do we mean all kinds of MR....Vs Fire, Vs Heat, Vs Poison, etc. I assume we mean all kinds. Luckily, I've been having pretty good luck in the bazaar and have been picking up some low end pieces with various types of MR and some STR to boot. =)<br />
<br />
PS As for knowing when to run, that I know; but being able to do it is another matter..lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good question. I think Morgani is saying to concentrate on real MR, cause that's the one that will keep you from getting snared, rooted, blinded, Flash-of-Light'd, etc.  We have cures to deal with other attacks, I guess, but I have had it happen where I didn't get my heals off in time and died anway.<br />
<br />
Thing is, MR is the easiest to raise, along with FR, CR. Disease and Poison are harder, which I think is what helps make Necros and Shamans successful.<br />
<br />
Then again, I'm only in my 20s, so this is all theoretical...!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You want straight up magic resist.  And when people say MR, they strictly mean MR, not FR or PR etc.<br />
As far as specific gear you want, it really depends on which zek you're playing on.  Rallos gear is a helluva lot more different than Sullon gear, simply because you can lose it on RZ.  If you have the cash, specific gear is easy to get in the bazaar.  Some decent ranger items pre 55 if you have the $...<br />
Jagged blade of mourning, wurmy, sentry bracers, shield of the arisen occultist (back), kylong helm, tribal war boots, your typical assortment of bd gear, crescent blades of luclin, earring of the solstice, essence earring, engraved royal velium bp, phase spider carapace, bloodstained mantle, imbued granite spaulders, sentry girdle, bft or nightmare bow, etc.  all of these items are great for any of the non rallos zek servers.<br />
for rallos zek, no drop gear is hard to come by but some cheap items would be the mantle i mentioned or you can try picking up the goblin bracers from loio.  that's the gear that comes to mind, hope it's helpful.  do a search on allakhazams if you need more within your lvl range or budget :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ginzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">btw OOS is occlusion of sound, a bard song that lowers MR.<br />

I see a few of us sullon zekers lurking here - A fun server to be on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tocsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye Ginz, it is has been a fun server, at least in my short time there------Even with the PKing...lol. I never knew there were so many ways one could be killed. But I look at it as a learning curve and paying my dues, so to speak. Also, it only seems fitting that Dark Elves should surround Kelethin from time to time, or a big nasty Ogre hang out at Crushbone and terrorize all who enter. And it's really cool when the high levels sweep in and run em out! Zoning in anywhere is always an adventure. I've been on a blue server for 3 years and I've never had so much fun as I have had the last month or so. My in-game awareness has increased tremendously, my reflexes have sharpened, and I'm becoming an even better EQer. Now, If I could just win a few more fights...lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, that's why I say that in some ways, there's as much roleplaying on Sullon as anywhere else... I see an Ogre, I know it's evil, and I won't be grouping with it.</div></div><hr />
