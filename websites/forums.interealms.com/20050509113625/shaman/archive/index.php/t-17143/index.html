<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day I went out to the Dreadlands Via the Druid ring. Was there to get Greyish Bone Chips from Karnors Castle for Canni 2. As soon as we popped in I was amazed at how beautiful the area was with the fall coloring in the leaves. We then ran over to the old Combine spires and sat atop a large snow covered peak just admiring the view. The run to Karnors was pretty plain but Karnors Castle its self was pretty impressive from on high with Spirit of Eagle. What I posted for was to ask you guys what you think are the most impressive zones visually. Im mid 40s now and think its about time I did some sight seeing. Give me some suggestions please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Everfrost on a clear day with the clipping plane all the way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jaggedpine forest with the clipping pane all the way up, and showgrass on is a really pretty zone.... unless you suffer bad lag in which case you need clip pane at 0 and showgrass off.... kind of takes the beauty away. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess this thread willbe for the high end machine then, cause my clip is always all the way up. It goes without saying that clip being way down and particles and showgrass off that everything is going to look less than worthy. I agree with both the aboves, I love both of those zones.<br />
I'll add another.<br />
<br />
Wakening Land</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The boat ride from freeport -&gt; BB can be nice, especially if you catch the sun falling down over an island or something like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The boat ride from freeport -&gt; BB can be nice, especially if you catch the sun falling down over an island or something like that<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't ridden boats since SoL came out, but I did enough times that I can't get the boat music out of my head.  Of course the best part of the boat music is the bell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone wise I was playing my necro and grabbling lowbie gear for cheap int items and noticed Steamfont is pretty cool.  The giant gears past the mino caves are pretty neat.  Also as far as nice boat rides go take the one to Iceclad for some great views.  Beaches to Ice is pretty neat.  Also the FV boat is just a cool one to ride on.<br />
<br />
As far as bridges go the coolest one before expansions was East Karana to North Karana, it was and still is very impressive.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hollowshade moor - Norrath 'setting' over the grimling islands.<br />
<br />
Tenebrous Mountains - looking up at the vampire castle with Norrath behind it.  Kinda spooky looking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My choice is close to TM... Katta Castellum is fabulous looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I always thought that &quot;hidden valley&quot; in Dreadlands was pretty beautiful too; I'm a sucker for the fall anyway so those fall-colored leaves with a hot pink Norrathian sunset as a backdrop make me giddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Too many....  some really cool zones out there.  I appreciate a lot of the landscapes.<br />
<br />
- The moonscape in Mons Letalis<br />
- The enchanting charm of GFay and Kelethin<br />
- Steamfont has a nice view<br />
- Always loved the coloration of Butcherblock<br />
- Dreadlands in the lost Valley is very cool<br />
- I like the port-ness of Firiona Vie and Freeport.<br />
- The Overthere has some beautiful sunsets.<br />
- I like the barren landscape of Skyfire and lavastorm.. desolate and fiery and full of igneous rocks.<br />
- the ruggedness of frontier mountains<br />
- the jungle and wildness of Warsliks woods, Emerald Jungle, Swamp of No Hope (that crazy waterfall is cool), Trakanon's Teeth.<br />
- I love the barren icelands of Velious (EW and WW), and GD, IC, and Velks have a very &quot;crystalline&quot; feel about them.  Like a winter wonderland.<br />
- Great view of Norrath from the moon in outdoor zones... and the tropical type foliage.... it's a neat experience.<br />
- I love Plane of Tranquility --- great coloration and smoothness, it may be a boring zone, but at least it's nice to look at.<br />
<br />
But my all-time favorite secret hiding place and good place to sip back on some Dwarven Ale is the secret atoll out in the middle of the Timorous Deep.  It's like a little secret tropical paradise.  All they need is the Swedish Bikini Team and it's perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The waterfall in East Karana...  Heck the Trail up to Highpass for that matter. <br />
<br />
Gorge of King Xorbb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The hidden oasis in Timorous Deep is a really nice spot.  <br />
<br />
I have always loved Xalgoz's temple in Kaesora.<br />
<br />
The dragon bridge in Iceclad was a marvel the first time I saw it.<br />
<br />
Also, the iksar statue where the water runs between his legs, between FV and LOiO.  Something about that view always inspires me.  The whole Kunark lore could be so cool, if it were a little better fleshed out.  The ruins all over the continent are well done.  Also, the Aquaduct in Trak's Teeth (or EJ?) is a nice sight.<br />
<br />
I'm not a huge fan of sights on the moon.  Maybe its nostalgia, but it just doesn't feel the same...sure watching Norrath set is pretty cool, but it feels more contrived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like Rivervale in the rain (or in the sunshine for that matter).  Can just picture all the little hobbits having a rainy day inside.   ;)<br />
<br />
Aviak huts in SK are neat, and i wouldn't doubt that a lot of people nowadays haven't seen them.<br />
<br />
Wander around solb and sola and look for wall art.  They're great little pictures of goblins and nag and kobolds and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The waterfall in Stonebrunt Mountains is absolutely fabulous; whoever designed and drew that one should have gotten a bonus. I'd love to be able to figure out how to capture the loop and use it as a desktop.  Crystal Caverns with the huge glowing crystals was always one of my favorites also.  But even from the beginning of the game the sunrises and sunsets have always been top notch, especially over desert dunes or ocean where you can get the whole show. :)<br />
edit:spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">goin down the river in warslick woods thers 2 ikky statues underneath the bridge.<br />
<br />
Had that sceen as my desktop image for quite a while...sunset at the bridge in velious was another one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Drifting down that big hole in Crystal Caverns with invis and levitate up is probably my all time favorite. <br />
<br />
A close second would be the waterfall in the hole. Standing at the top, looking down and not even being able to see the tiny puddle at the bottom then jumping off and trying to hit that puddle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm a fan of Stonebrunt too.  The waterfall was my first thought when sightseeing.<br />
<br />
The calm ocean view looking out from the castle in Twilight sea is impressive.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert is an interesting sight with the red sky over the white sands.<br />
<br />
Seeing a yard full of Shardwurms in Great Divide was stunning the first time I went there but Skyfire Mountains was even more impressive with giant wurms walking all over and the beautiful chromdracs flitting around. (be very dangerous for a youngster though)<br />
<br />
There's nothing like the first time you walk through Kael Drakkal.  Create a worshiper of Rallos Zek just for the purpose.  :D <br />
<br />
The firedancers in Shadeweaver's Thicket can always catch the interest of my kitty. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Iceclad is pretty impressive with the giant ice bridge and Tower of Frozen Shadows.  Old world I think I like Rathe Mts and Lake Rathe most, but I enjoy visiting Everfrost, my home town, from time to time.<br />
<br />
You are a little ways off from them, but Plane of Fear and Air look pretty spiffy.  Chardok looks really neat.<br />
<br />
Most impressive places I have seen anywhere I think are all the indoor giant dragon caves, NToV, Veeshan Peaks and Sleepers Tomb, you cant go there now, but maybe someday :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've only been impressed one by EQ landscape.  In hollowshade moor there is a really beautiful river flowing down a green hill, with alien flora all over the place, and norrath setting on the horizon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, my ranger proposed marriage in the Forbidden Valley above the druid rings, and married his wife in East Karana, overlooking the waterfall. Two of my favourite views.<br />
<br />
I agree with a lot of the suggestions - Kunark with its trees and Velious ice scapes are particularly good looking. The dragon bridge in Iceclad is stunning, the waterfall to Thurgadin is pretty.<br />
<br />
A lot of Luclin looks good, but not usually as pretty. The moonscapes are detailed and have a more realistic feel to them, but they're still moonscapes - the other worldliness of them is impressive in its way, but not beautiful. Although seeing Norrath from the moon was amazing the first time I saw it.<br />
<br />
A lot of PoP is impressive, even stunning at times, usually due to the scale of it, but rarely beautiful. One exception would be Xegony's isle on Plane of Air, particularly the rainbow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Coughlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Always a fan of Stonebrunt Mts. Very Japanese looking to me I guess, probably because of the moss and stuff. The waterfall is also pretty amazing.<br />
<br />
Skyfire Mts, I also liked the first time I saw it.<br />
<br />
The bridge in Velious amazed me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I always thought that &quot;hidden valley&quot; in Dreadlands was pretty beautiful too; I'm a sucker for the fall anyway so those fall-colored leaves with a hot pink Norrathian sunset as a backdrop make me giddy.<br />
<br />
I think the 'Hidden valley&quot; in Dreadlands is also my favorite spot. The first time I was there I must have taken 20 screenshots. I even sometimes go there just to see it or sit and do some tradeskills.<br />
<br />
My second favorite spot is sitting on the beach where Gornit spawns in the Ocean of Tears on a clear day. The sound of the waves hitting the shore makes it so relaxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One thing I would suggest doing if you want to do some sight seeing is to explore all the different cities.  I tend to get into rut and only visit certain places on a regular basis.  And with the introduction of the Plane of Knowledge people have even less reasons to visit different cities.  I’d suggest starting with player cities.  The creators of this game did a very good job of giving each city a different feel.  I was amazed the first time I entered the ogre city.  It reminded me of watching the Flintstones when I was a kid.  Ak'Anon itself sums up everything that’s gnome.  And the neon look of the dark elf city is quite unique.  A quick way to visit all the player cities would be to create a newbie character and explore the city you start in.  When you’ve seen all you care to of that city delete the character and create another. If all your character slots are full you can do this on a different server.  And once you’ve finished with player starting cities head over to the moon and some of the Luclin cities. Katta Castellum, for example, is a wondrous city to explore.  <br />
<br />
If your feeling really adventurous head over to EQ Atlas and pick a not too dangerous zone, for your level, that you’ve never been to and go explore it.  Put on levitate, a fresh SoW and invisibility and go exploring.  And of course keep gate memorized just in case.  After over two years I still find zones, even low level ones, which I never knew existed.  Perhaps I’ll take this suggestions to heart and head over to EQ Atlas myself.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wow, what a great thread this turned out to be! Im going to take most of this advice. I have played nothing but evil aligned chars since the beginning of EQ but I think Ill take the above advice and make a noob bard and do some running around the good cities.<br />
YAY!<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One other thing:<br />
<br />
If you want to see some really beautiful sights and landscapes in a first person RPG, pick up morrowind.  Hands down the most beautiful game I've ever played, and it's fun too :D<br />
<br />
When you start the game you start out in this swamp city, and you have to travel down the road a ways inland to a larger city to really start the game.  You can just shell out some gold and ride the morrowind equivalent of a train there instantly, or you can just walk.  I advise walking :)  The shape of the land, the sunset, the plants, the roaming animals, the music and ambient sound... it just all works together beautifully and is very enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You guys are bringing a tear to this old Iksar's eye.  I like the Sunset in Skyfire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Sanctus Seru looks pretty neat I though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I was really impressed with one of the LDoN dungeons. Rak, I believe. <br />
<br />
The area where the Named was on a Assasination mission was a fairly large room with a hole in the &quot;ceiling&quot; opening out to land. You could see some trees and clouds up there and there was water flowing in from the top creating a waterfal and pool in the room we were in. Incredible! After we killed the named, I called the whole party in to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hidden island in TD is sweet but so are the islands with the iskar statues on them.  TD is a great zone to wander around if you have levitate. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Go sit on the hillside in West Karana right next to the path to the Qeynos Hills zone, right at sunset.  Gorgeous. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'll agree with the poster who enjoyed the LDoN dungeons.  Fantastic look and feel, especially the mobs.<br />
<br />
BoT is another stunning zone IMHO.  I love the high ceilings, the size is impressive.  The Plane of Fear though has one of the most distinctive looks I've seen from the various monuments/shrines, the miscoloured sky and the rain of blood is fascinating.  I also like the look and feel of Torment, it's actually kinda spooky.  When I wanted to wind down though and just chat with friends, I'd go fishing in my old stomping grounds in EK by the barbie villiage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think my favorite was a bug. <br />
<br />
one day I was walking through Gfay and I could see the sky.  I had hoped that they had changed it but alas they fixed it. I was really cool tho. seeing the sunset behind the trees with the tree houses at a distance was very cool. But then IRL my favorite places are in the woods too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Katta Kastellum. <br />
<br />
If youre not kos, go in one day, full clip plane and all the bells and whistles turned on. Look inside the buildings at the ceilings.<br />
Truly amazing.</div></div><hr />
