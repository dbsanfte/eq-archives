edited, forgot the 'not' in the first line, my mistake. Sorry, all the gimps and flamers replied needlessly. And please note the question was asked about what I was talking about was answered politely, others answered as they were asked, but hey, you flamers am flamers.</div></div><hr />

I don't have the mental intellect to figure out if I am one of the gimps or not, but that aside I would like to commend you on making one of the worst posts ever on these boards.<br />
<br />
You seem to have the idea that people are here to serve you.... did you know that no one is paid to answer? I would recommend that you re-word your post to actually request assistance.... after all.... you are asking for help...... aren't you?</div></div><hr />

I keep hearing since the last patch that our epic was 'flagged'. meaning you have to do each step or else Rak eats the tears. Only reason it concerns me is I am doing it over again for my new re-rolled shaman, have max faction and simply wished to minimize the annoyance factor since I did my original one the regular way. No big deal if it is, i just wanted to find out. And after the flames in the thread towards me concerning the Fabled boots from the '42' moron, I hoped to avoid them here. but he seems to enjoy being an ASSuming ass...</div></div><hr />

Your presentation of your question was very poor i think is the issue. No one knew what the heck your talking about. Trying leaving more detail next time please.<br />

AFAIK there is no flag requirment on our epic. But i sure would be for it if there was.</div></div><hr />

too darned bad. Learn to deal with it. perhaps if 42-boy had not been such a creep in the other thread i would feel different. And note I did not say it was a BAD thing, i simply asked for info. Seems that threatens some types.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't expect to post a message that makes no sense to anyone who reads it, insult said people who are reading it, and expect an overwhelmingly positive response, imho.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything, I thought it might work for your question, whatever it may be...  so sue me.</div></div><hr />

Yes i read Hitchhiker too, and thanks for the advice. However if you dislike me so much, simply ignore any thread or reply I make and move on. And let's see, i made an observation made with my own eyes and you came back and called me in essence stupid without even having tried to confirm or deny the facts. Yup, i call that a flame. and that makes you a flamer.<br />
<br />
Buh-by</div></div><hr />

The above quote is Airtreader's from the Fabled SoW boots thread and then he posts this thread asking about the epic that he doesn't care about...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So since this &quot;is a question for all the gimps...&quot; then you are expecting people that you obviously look down on as gimps to answer your question for you and NOT flame you?<br />
<br />
Here's a tip.  Just ask a question if you have one and leave it at that.  Don't come here with a chip on your shoulder and START the thread by insulting anyone who might possibly answer you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Way to take a swing at the one guy not jumping down your throat in this thread...<br />
<br />
<br />
I think whats &quot;threatinging&quot; in this thread is the fact that somone posted a thread that has no info on what its about, then gets mad when people dont know whats going. I also thing that said poster should re-examine who is trying to give them information and help them as opposed to who is not.<br />
<br />
No one is required to care about you or anything you post. Its a privlilage to get a reply and a answer and beyond that any help. With out this understanding and no respect given you shall recieve none of the above.<br />
<br />
&quot;Learn to deal with it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

*** is your problem ?<br />
Litgruv merely stated that you asked a question without actually asking a question or even giving us a vague hint of what the question was about.Well apart from the thread title.<br />

<br />
Hey bud, suggestion for you. Next time you come asking for something, try asking politely. Even a street begger knows he has a better chance to ask nicely and be polite even if he doesn't get that spare change. You are better than that, aren't you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am currently working on my epic, I plan on completing every step and in order. I figure I am about half done having just finished my clicky sow boots. I can offer that I have not recieved any flag messages other than the standard True Spirit Faction ones to this point. I'll be happy to post the results of my tear turn in when I get that far, but I'd be suprised if there aren't half a dozen more patches between now and then so I gues my information won't really be current. On second thought, maybe I'm not the best source of information at all since I'm at work. I suggest that you might want to find a better source for shaman information than gimps like me who take the time to post on this board.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">well to be fair from the title of the post I knew what he was asking grats me and a solid reading comprehension.<br />
<br />
but damn dude lighten up already and take some time to post clearly. your post makes almost no sense at all I had to interpret the entire thing to know what you were asking when you should have just posted it clearly.<br />
<br />
dont start with an attack and expect no response to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">With some context, I (and I assume the others who have posted) have sufficient reading comprehension to infer what he meant...  But by itself, it could have myriad meanings.  I was leaning towards some flag you got upon completion of your epic...  Maybe something for the big 5th anniversary festivities.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, looking back at the original thread, I guess I will publicly admit that if he did, in fact, see a shaman get slapped with the new boots, then my comment was out of line, and I apologize.  ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and what does &quot;In before the rickshaw&quot; mean?  I tried googling it, and got 2 matches on the entire 'net...  Both in everquest message board threads, interestingly enough.</div></div><hr />

I've got an idea. Let's just not respond to this fools trolls. That's going to get him more riled up than anything you'd post insulting his obvious stupidity.<br />

I wouldn't have posted myself but it's the only way I could pass my opinion along....<br />

I already had my tear waiting in the bank and plan on attempting Rak this weekend.  If someone gets to it before then, please post your success or failure.  If no-one else attempts it before then, please check back on Sunday and I'll post my results.  If anyone wants to see it, I can post a screenshot with the Max Ally message or do another turn-in to get a log of the text.  Either way, I plan on posting a log of the Rak Raid (success or failure).<br />

(it's kinda jive speak for &quot;in before the lock&quot;.  it means you think the thread is going to get locked, and it's also a subliminal way of sayin that said thread has degraded to the point of uselessness.)<br />
<br />
as for the thread itself, every single person in this thread has agreed that the origional poster's post was incoherrent at best, and rude and inflamatory on average.  I would like to personally congratulate airtreader for doing something that we shaman have been trying to do for years...  bringing us all in agreement.<br />
<br />
honestly if you read the threads on the crucible frequently you will find that we argue alot, but flamming is pretty rare...  Yet here you are with two threads and half a dozen flames...  A smart man would realize the problem lies within.  Try treating these boards (and the people within them) with a little more respect, and you'll most likely recieve some.</div></div><hr />

'In before the rickshaw' is big over there. They have a special section (Retard Rickshaw) where they move, obviously, retarded posts from the other sections of the board. The posts are not locked in the rickshaw so the local flame trolls can take their shot at said retard. Also, you can't edit posts in the rickshaw.<br />
