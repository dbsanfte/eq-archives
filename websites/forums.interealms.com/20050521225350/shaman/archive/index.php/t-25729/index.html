<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far its been really fun.  The constant trains in Dreadlands were annoying, but despite that, about 20 of us took out the Hatesfury Dracolich without much trouble.  (after one wipe hehe).<br />

Grats to me on my first Artifact<br />

Boy, I haven't fought a dragon in such a long time, I had almost forgot about the simple things, like belly casting hehe. <br />
<br />
This is some info about the event:<br />

I'm just hoping that Trolls get a new town out of this deal hehe.  Regardless, I can't wait for the new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont think that we will get a new town out of it. if anything we will get moved there and have to share it with the DE's again. no love for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The NPC's killed it on Xegony - no loot for us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was dropped twice on DRo, and dropped the same artifacts each time.  The first time it dropped the code was still in place to allow the NPCs to kill it an still leave a body.  Wasn't a raid setup so the drops were pretty much just ninjaed.  Second time there was a pickup raid and the loots were rolled on.<br />
<br />
Didn't get anything myself, but congrats to those people that did!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was there no way for Good to prevail?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure if good could prevail.  We tried to kill the leader of the evil side and found her to be a bit much to handle.  Didn't help that we weren't setup in a raid and there were a lot of people there that at best were clueless and at worst were purposely screwing up.  When engaged she did a 2000hp aoe pretty regularly and spawned lots of spectre adds.<br />
<br />
Maybe if she was killed then good could have triumphed.  Biggest trouble with the event was that people went for the easy kills (riders and dragon) and then broke up.  The rest of the event was plagued by incredible acts of stupidity by a few people who trained anyone who came near the FV zone line.  The pile of corpses there, and in the tunnels on the FV side were quite a sight to see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If Lanys hasn't taken over Firiona Vie on your server - in the FV event mobs aggroed by PC's do not poof on death. A level one gnome would be apprehensive to both sides, can bind in FV, can get there via boat gnomes.....<br />
<br />
Some awesome loot just rotted while I was there. My 55 gonme mage picked up a droppable  +15 attack aug &amp; an awsome melee belt, an okish sceptre thing for pure casters (better hp/mana/resists than tacticians bulwark), &amp; a good all/all ear from Al'akabors quest.<br />
<br />
Got to see Lanys walking up the stairs to the temple where Firiona Vie had been standing. Dragged a few corpses...<br />
<br />
A few evil races decided to help things along by leading huge trains into the elf town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess a sword that looks like the Lord Inquisitor Sword dropped. Nice stats on it as well but that is a one of a kind sword LOL (till the next expansion probably) LOL. <br />
