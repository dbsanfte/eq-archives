<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best area to hunt for quick and efficient pet weapons for a lvl 65 Shaman if no Mage is available?<br />
<br />
(I want to get the doggie dog geared up quickly for a tough MOB)<br />
<br />
Thanks much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want weapons that proc, crystal caverns (velium weapons) or split paw (dagger of dropping, gnoll hide lariat)<br />
<br />
If you just want cheap weapons to make it dual wield, buy some rusty daggers off newbie vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wanted to add to this subject. I've found that simple dual wields like rusty weapons tend to keep agro on pet when I dot. When using a &quot;velium&quot; or &quot;lariat&quot;, I've found that I will get agro ALOT more. Anyone else tried this out? All I can think of is that I see pet pause in the middle of a proc and each hit must generate it's own hate. Less hits, less hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Buy wooden practice daggers in Shar Vahl.  Take the PoK stone, zone in, cross bridge, make right, buy from vendor around the corner (he calls out to you every now and then).  It's like 1 sp 9 cp or something per dagger.  Slightly heavy, but you're a tough shaman-- who cares, right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In Dulak the Drunken Pirates and whatnot dropped either a broken bottle or a shiv every time.<br />
I notice that each time I hand a pair of these to a new pet the pet misses like 20 times in a row and then just hits like crazy after that.<br />
<br />
If I could find something stackable I would be really happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heck just goto the guys fishing in the pond in PoK at the far west building.  They 99% of the time have rusty daggers for sale.  Other then that you can pick up a pack of rusties in pretty much any newbie yard of pok book.  Best of all though is to go find your mage summoned items in the bazaar for about 10-20pp.  There is ussually least one mage there with them forsale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hallard's Resales in East Freeport, near the entrance to the slums. Hallard has an unlimited supply of rusty weapons. Now and then I stock up on rusty daggers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/ooc seeking the services of a High lev mage to summon a haste muzzle and proccing weaps for my pet please will donate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love gnoll lariats for the stun.  I keep any ole junk weapons for general use (shivs are cheap and easy to find on vendors in the Bazaar) and save lariats for soloing or groups that need every edge (whenever there isn't a mage, of course).<br />
<br />
The lariats drop in Splitpaw or can be found for 5-10 plat in the Bazaar if you watch for bargains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">mage gear rules, fer sure.  <br />
<br />
for weapon farming, I like the tizmak caves.  seems to be more weapons for the time spent, and a little less traveling time, too.  I can spend time in there (a couple of hours while watching a football game, for example) and get 4 or 5 bags of weapons, then dump in in the bank for later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another idea is to buy a bunch of summoned items when there is a mag available, put them in a couple bags and then /duel someone and die. Summoned items will remain on your corpse for a week and you can loot them as nessecary. Just remember to get them before the week is up or you loose them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why daggers?  I used to buy them for the low delay, but remember reading that attack speed is a fixed amount on dogdog other than haste spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">mage gear rules, fer sure.<br />
I've seen several threads here where shaman's gripe about being asked to buff an experience group, but not join it.  Keep in mind that you may be doing the same thing to a mage when you ask him for gear (and yes we get asked A LOT).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Summoned mage gear rocks.  I don't know about your server, but mine has at least one vendor in bazaar selling summoned stuff pretty much 24/7.  Failing that, coastal merchants tend to accumulate rusties, and the troll merchant in PoS (by the exit) sells 'Dagger' for like 1 plat, endless supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">normally, there is 1-3 mages in trader mode selling summoned gear for between 7-10 plat each on Prexus.  if not, i search velium under 9plat.  then warrior, 1b slash or pierce below 5 plat, and race all.<br />
<br />
when we had guild event in the arena, i also bought all the MR items by slot for him that were under 5plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just take the PoK book to Nektulos and kill skeletons that wander around the book until I have enough rusty weapons. I'll check the kitty vendor out next time - sounds like a good Troll-friendly place to shop, thanks! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">normally, there is 1-3 mages in trader mode selling summoned gear for between 7-10 plat each on Prexus<br />
<br />
must be nice. average price i see on 7th is 30 pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally i like off hand only weapons for this. If i'm not getting mage weapons my main goal is to get fido dual wielding. Chill dagger is one and can often be found in the bazaar fairly cheaply. Another good one is etchaka's (sp). A great spot for those seems to shadeweavers. The vendors there always seem to have lots of aprentice etchaka's sold to them.<br />
<br />
1 weapons gets fido dual wielding so I have to carry around less and they last longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've found it's pretty easy to vendor-mine the Magi at the adventure camps. I usually grab a few 4-6 plat weapons when I hit a camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gorgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I use rusty daggers for 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1. cheap<br />
2. low weight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">drop rate on Gnoll hide lariats is fairly low now, so they are out for farming. I actually have a mage, I think summon dagger is a level 1 spell - just drop a pile of them somewhere. I haven't bothered doing that much in the past - must remember to summon some armor &amp; an elemental defender &amp; see if the AC makes a difference sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yea, I made a trip to splitpaw too a few months a go hoping to get lariats, no luck I got like 1 but alot of dagger of dropping. Serregated dirks are pretty cheap too know 50-100pp, a bit expensive for doggy, but if you keep him alive it can be worth it. <br />
On a side note anyone try any PGT's?  Those are pretty cheap too know.</div></div><hr />
