<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have been made a class representative for the priest forum on the druid boards. So I am going to try not only say what I think shaman need but rather what you all think we need. I am going to be posting a few polls later on, but to get the options for these polls I need a frame to work with. So I am going to outline what I think shaman would be happy with.<br />
<br />
Please tell me if you would be happy with this, or if not, what is missing. Do not post specific ideas please - that is partly reserved for the polls and partly for further discussion.<br />
<br />
Proposed shaman improvements:<br />
<br />
* Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of emergency heal for shaman, most likely as an AA.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of group or AE heal (mainly for raids).<br />
<br />
* Increase OoW DoTs by the same percentage that necromancers receive.<br />
<br />
* Make shaman DoTs more useable by decreasing DoT aggro and / or adding resist modifiers to them.<br />
<br />
* Increase shaman nuking power to roughly the level clerics are at now.<br />
<br />
* Increase the HPs of the focus line to be above the HPs rangers and beastlords can provide.<br />
<br />
* Replace the stat modifiers of the OoW buffs with effects like strikethrough. The overall effect of such a buff should be of a magnitude a little below that of Bulwark of Vie (seeing as vie wears off with damage).<br />
<br />
* Slighty increase the resist modifier on Nihil. Slightly increase duration on Nihil.<br />
<br />
Would that make you happy?</div></div><hr />

Nope  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you will do very well as our representative, and i've shown more friends that i can recall your summary of shaman problems thread, and many have seen the light.  that being said, i just gave up on my shaman all together, after 3 years, all the time invested, i couldn't do it.  i thought that shaman healing was decent enough with max aa/focus/daluda's, as i never really wanted to play a cleric.  <br />
<br />
* Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
agreed, if this is possible.  <br />
<br />
* Add some sort of emergency heal for shaman, most likely as an AA.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of group or AE heal (mainly for raids).<br />
<br />
some use for our mgb for heals or some type of divine arbitration type thing would be nice, it doesn't have to be huge or imbalancing but just throw a bone on this one.  <br />
<br />
* Increase OoW DoTs by the same percentage that necromancers receive.<br />
<br />
* Make shaman DoTs more useable by decreasing DoT aggro and / or adding resist modifiers to them.<br />
<br />
honestly, i don't care at all about the % increases.  dot aggro is 100% messed up and always has been.  it's mind boggling that a 5k worth of dots over 45 seconds has the same aggro as 50k worth of wizard nukes over that same period.  it just doesn't make any sense, i was always happy with how well my shaman could dot, but it was only useful soloing/kiting, as in raids most shaman do like 1/1000th their potential dps heh.  <br />
<br />
* Increase shaman nuking power to roughly the level clerics are at now.<br />
<br />
not sure if i would word it like that, but essentially shaman need a nuke that doesn't make a level 49 wizard with ice comet laugh at.  lower cast times/more damage.  <br />
<br />
* Increase the HPs of the focus line to be above the HPs rangers and beastlords can provide.<br />
<br />
* Replace the stat modifiers of the OoW buffs with effects like strikethrough. The overall effect of such a buff should be of a magnitude a little below that of Bulwark of Vie (seeing as vie wears off with damage).<br />
<br />
yes, focus needs more HP.  in my opinion the more important issue, however, is the uselessness of every other buff besides focus (and fa for raw atk), and what will be done about it.  buffs that matter to people today are hp/ac/mana regeneration/haste/atk.  shaman are terrible in all of these, so that needs to be looked into.  <br />
<br />
* Slighty increase the resist modifier on Nihil. Slightly increase duration on Nihil.<br />
<br />
no comment there, as i was plenty happy with nihil when it was 60% and had a worse modifier.  try using it in its current form on old velious stuff like zlandicar and you'll really notice how great a spell it is.  personally i think it's fine the way it is.  it actually made us the masters of slowing again, albeit this has become more and more pointless over time.  <br />
<br />
Would that make you happy?<br />
<br />
shaman mana regen is great on paper, but actually having something worthwhile to do with our mana would have made me happy.  like i said, i just don't have fun playing my shaman anymore so i won't, but that doesn't mean i don't think there are ways to fix the class.  give shaman better nukes, finally look at dot aggro and how ridiculous it is, make buffs worthwhile again, and they can salvage the class that has become a bot for everyone or a fa whore.  none of us want to be crappy druids or crappy necromancers on raids, so something needs to be done to at least give shaman something worthwhile to do with their mana again.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dunno if this has ever been said, but i think we need an agro reducing spell.<br />
<br />
personally i think that's all we need.<br />
<br />
ooh and the ward, i would like for it to be immune to everything or some how be able to last thru an AE encounter. it's an AE heal, allbeit a very slow one, it should be able to withstand AE encounters.<br />
<br />
sure, better heals would be nice, but i'm not losing any sleep by not being able to heal like a druid...cause, i'm not a druid. do you think i wanna be in teh CH rot?</div></div><hr />

argh i cant link anymore lucy seems to be laggy  but they added dam mod 5% on focus   a 5 dam mod on group dikau like spell   uh, 5% avoidance on agi   5 dam on str  and some kinda dodge like mod on dex i belive</div></div><hr />

Are all of those items equal.  I mean are they basically of equal value?  If so how many of those item would constitute a real improvement?  Two or Three?<br />
<br />
We don't want to come off as asking for the sky, so we may want to put an actual number.<br />
<br />
They all seem good.  Great work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks like we're in good hands ...<br />
<br />
I'd love to see FA boosted to a reasonable duration, and given something to make melees really beg for it (decent strikethrough maybe?). Otherwise, those suggestions will do for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm if shamans had bulwark of vie and divine intervention it could help balance things a tad. Perhaps charisma could be made a shaman version of divine intervention as a suggestion. Another idea is a quicker casting maloxx version.<br />
<br />
I agree with suggestions you have, the one I wanted to see was a -resist on our magic based dots which you have mentioned. <br />
<br />
As a suggestion of abstract structure, it could be divided into; <br />
Enhancement/improvement to heals<br />
-straight improvement to heal<br />
-aa that crits every heal for a duration.<br />
Enhancement/improvement to buffs<br />
-Extended ferine avatar or instant recast of.<br />
-Enhanced ferine avatar, perhaps a +5% haste mod or a +ability to crit<br />
-group version of Fa.<br />
-New defined buffs, charisma as DI alternative<br />
-longer duration of focus.<br />
Enhancement/improvement to Dps<br />
-quickened casting of damage spells<br />
-resistmods on dots<br />
-Improved damage of nuke<br />
-alternative idea, (I still think my pet avatar idea was a good idea, it doing enhanced increased damage hits for a duration.)<br />
Enhancement/improvement to Debuffs<br />
-Quickened casting<br />
-Effective alternative to slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">one thing i would like to see in that list, too:<br />
<br />
some decent debuff-upgrades (one of the few things a boxed shaman cannot do that good), as malos/sinia upgrade, a decent cripple, maybe different debuffs that give neg modifiers on melee-foci (strikethrough etc.), that don't stack on the mob (or they would become too powerful).<br />
<br />
just an idea, all in all the proposed changes would make me a happy leezord  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">they already a step ahead of you :)  <br />

Those are old changes, and they are not as good as they look, sadly. The agi one is still somewhat decent. 7% avoidance should produce about about 4% less damage taken in actual play. I would like to see 6 to 7% there.<br />
<br />
5% damage however will only add about 1.5% to melee, which is simply not enough.<br />
<br />
Compare to the warrior disciplines on lucy and then browse the steel warrior forums for what these disciplines actually do in game if you want to get a handle on what effect does how much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">* Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
Fine. I'd still like an upgrade to kragg's. Yes some shamans squeal about being healers. Yes some shamans squeal about shamans being forced at gunpoint to join the rotation. Yes you wouldn't mem it every group or event. Yes, i'd still like to be able to heal more than 2k if i'm casting a 10 sec spell dammit. And yes i'd like to see raids with 5 shamans 5 druids and 5 cleric, not 10 clerics 3 druids and 2 botted shaman.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of emergency heal for shaman, most likely as an AA.<br />
<br />
I had an idea for a short lasting buff in the line of Burst of Strength that would add a set amount of damage mitigation (say 25%) to one player to get us over the hump where mobs are either immune to slow, or mitigate it to bugger all, or it takes to long to debuff malo and then slow. People didn't like my idea because it was another buff they would have to mem and it was short lasting. I'd still like to see something like this so how about making it an AA. <br />
Or give shaman a similar AA to cleric DI except only the caster takes part of the damage. Eg your tank gets hit for 1k you take 20% of it. Seems to fit with our cann line. We toe the line with life and death.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of group or AE heal (mainly for raids).<br />
Group Q at 70. It's only right.<br />
<br />
* Increase OoW DoTs by the same percentage that necromancers receive.<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
* Make shaman DoTs more useable by decreasing DoT aggro and / or adding resist modifiers to them.<br />
DoT aggro has been the prime &quot;SLAP IN THE FACE&quot; to shamans since summoning mobs were introduced.<br />
<br />
* Increase shaman nuking power to roughly the level clerics are at now.<br />
Ok. I'd also like to see the bogus resists on rain spells reduced.<br />
<br />
* Increase the HPs of the focus line to be above the HPs rangers and beastlords can provide.<br />
Grrr we went from second HP buffers to optional but nice to have if nothing better around. SLAP IN THE FACE<br />
Note the revised OoW focus doesn't seem to have a damage mod. Either the stat overclocking better have some real meaning that we don't have to parse for 5 bleeding years to show the effect is negligible or just make it a decent HP buff.<br />
<br />
* Replace the stat modifiers of the OoW buffs with effects like strikethrough. The overall effect of such a buff should be of a magnitude a little below that of Bulwark of Vie (seeing as vie wears off with damage).<br />
See my suggestions above. Having buffs that last an hour and do a lil bit over a long time is fine and i'm glad they appear to be adding buffs that may have an impact. But, increasing &quot;chances&quot; to do this or that doesn't equate to a real noticeable effect. What i'd really like to see is a spell or AA that matters in those RIGHT NOW moments when three mobs are inc and your 6 sec cast/refresh on slow means you have to let someone die. Unfair considering clerics are the only class with rez.<br />
<br />
Some more suggestions. restated, , if anyone else cares...<br />
<br />
Acumen: replace stam regen with 6 mana (or X endurance) regen. Bsts can buff mana regen and hp regen. SLAP IN THE FACE!<br />
<br />
Spirit Quickening: make it summon pet weapons (and haste muzzle) for the love of gawd.<br />
<br />
Avatar/FA: Make it last 15 mins. Nobody you cast this on gives a rat's butt about the stats, whereas everyone cares about resists, making Ferocity a better option. SLAP IN THE FACE!<br />
<br />
GL with your endeavours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if 1/4 of that stuff happens, I would be overjoyed. I doubt we will see much more balancing now, after todays patch, until after the release of OOW and even then it may take a month or two to gauge the effect the new levels have.<br />
<br />
What I would push for is:<br />
1. bump the OoW heal to 1800-2000<br />
2. A 1K fast nuke OR a 720/tic DOT.<br />
<br />
Those 2 are what I would LOVE to see pre-OoW, even if they are just OoW spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well mturk i wouldnt disagree with you but for rogues and rangers and real &quot;dps&quot; classes im shure that would be a huge improvement  .... alltho i do agreee  that their should be more avoidance on agi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Looks like a good list of changes to push for.<br />
<br />
If you can get anything meaningful in the place of stat buffs that would be great :)  I'm sure SOE already knows exactly what stat buffs provide, let's see if they can do better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">To balance Shamans we need:<br />
<br />
1. A 2k fast heal(base) spell + a targetable Divine Arbitration(AA) that only balances out the Shaman's HPs and the target's unlike the real Divine Arb.<br />
<br />
2. A 6 second cast time nuke for around 1700<br />
<br />
3. A poison based DoT that does around 700/tick with a -50 resist mod<br />
<br />
4. A curse DoT that does around 800/tick with a -100 resist mod<br />
<br />
5. -70 resist mod for Balance of the Nihil<br />
<br />
6. A proportional upgrade to Canni V<br />
<br />
7. A carbon copy of the disc Stonestance, call it...Spirit Shield(that one sounds familiar, doesn't it)<br />
<br />
These are the changes I wanted to see for Shamans and you are adressing them almost all, so I couldn't be happier honestly.<br />
<br />
The only thing I'd add is durability. <br />
We all remember Rangers etc. telling us &quot;Dude, you tank better than me&quot;. <br />
What I'd like to see is a Shaman being able to tank a *slowed* mob for a limited time, as this was part of our CC(offtanking a slowed add).<br />
Mob's DPS(in late PoP and GoD) went through the roof so that a slowed mob is still deadly for a Shaman and I feel, that, if you increased our straight tankability, the gap would be too big compared to the other casters, which would create an imbalance. <br />
Thus my &quot;stonestance&quot; suggestion. An AA like that will allow us to tank an add and root it off or escape death for those 2 ticks with the limitation being the reuse timer.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
5% Damage Modifier will increase their DPS by 2.5%(this isn't guessing). 2.5% of a Rogue doing 300 DPS(basically the best rogue that will come out of GoD) is 7.5 DPS(15 DPS for Champion). Hardly significant imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sounds good except for one thing, and I think its just the way it was &quot;worded.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
* Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
This quote makes it sound like a shaman with heals/slows is superior to the second cleric- which leads me to believe that another shaman could replace the first one as well.  Maybe if the quote should read more along the lines that a shaman, as a back-up healer, would bring more utility that would be beneficial over the excess healing that a second cleric would bring to a group.  I think that's what you meant, but the wording you used makes it sound like a shaman with heals/slows would superior in dmg mitigation to the &quot;current&quot; cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Its not significant, but its one of those things people LIKE to have on them. Factor in the +attack we are giving, as well, and it looks darn good to other players.<br />
<br />
This game is based a lot on &quot;perception&quot;. There are not many people who would say &quot;Lets take the Druid instead of getting a slower, because a druid can heal unslowed mobs more efficiently than a shaman can heal with a slowed mob&quot;. People just don't think like that. Sure 5% damage is about 3-10 dps, but honestly, every little bit counts with those guys. I mean, they will wear somethig for +10 attack and leave the AC and hps in the bag if they can. <br />
<br />
I am not unhappy so far. I think they are REALLY trying. We managed to get them to change the buffs back from +stats to +things we asked for. Maybe the numbers are lower than we like, but lets face it, we are NOT going to get everything. Personally I feel that we are a sliver from being a solid addition to any group, and the new HoT + Regen + new looking buffs are 3/4 of that sliver. Add a fast nuke, a bigger heal, and a decent DOT and I am happy. 2 tics of  750 is not horrible. Not when I am casting another spell while its happening. 420+40 isnt bad, not when I can be casting Tnargs while its happening. <br />
<br />
Balance is a difficult thing. They have a lot of classes that need help. Progress is all I ask, perfection isnt ever gonna happen. As long as I &quot;feel&quot; like they actually care, I will play my Shaman no matter how trivial the &quot;numbers&quot; look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hi there and welcome to the Crucible boards.  Although I don't think there is anything to complain about in your list, I do think that there is a priority level in what at least I would like. As a side note, I have been one of the biggest supporters of increasing druid healing so they can function as a primary healer in Vxed and tipt type zones.<br />
<br />
I am at a bit of a loss why druids and shaman need to be a single voice, though, since it is pretty aparent to me that Sony has decided that only druids and clerics are to be primary healers in the harder content (really only clerics but I'm tossing druids a bone).  You have your own fight to fight.<br />
<br />
My view is that shaman are a slowing utility class who can heal as one of our functions.  I think it is a big mistake to mix the issues of the two classes outside of balancing shaman healing to reflect a druid main healer.  Your quote of:  <br />
<br />
&quot;Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned&quot;<br />
<br />
really is about pumping up shaman healing so that druids can function as a primary healer.  Which is fine in my book, let's not confuse things by adding in the 2 cleric in a group argument which is only used in my experience in enchanter charming groups.<br />
<br />
My list according to priority:<br />
<br />
1) Make ancient canny non ancient.  It is a class defining spell unlike the other classes ancients, and this is especially true with the upgrade to Q. Also, make it available to non-raiders somehow...quest, high # of ldon pts, whatever but make it somehow available.<br />
<br />
2) Either increase single target heals or decrease casting times or both.  Base the changes on what Sony does with Druid healing.<br />
<br />
3) Decrease casting time on our DD's.  As a utility class who generally needs to malos, slow, buff, debuff and spot heal the casting time of our nukes in faster action fighting needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
4) Make buffs mean something (addressed in new test Lucy spells).<br />
<br />
5) Increase duration of FA (Champion) and give &quot;wears off&quot; message.<br />
<br />
6) Double the potency of Canny4 and double the recast time.  Net effect is the same but carpal tunnel is addressed as is the shaman's need to react quickly to fighting events.<br />
<br />
There you go. <br />
<br />
Purdypog, 65 Shaman Quellious<br />
<br />
PS: There is no doubt that your before mentioned group HOT that can be MGB'd is a good idea since shaman MGB's often go unused and it would add a strategic element that would increase the value of shaman on raids. DOT's are worthless in a fast fighting environment and I personally would not fight that fight.</div></div><hr />

our DoTs are okay if they are usable, which they currently are not.  Add some resist mods and completely remove any counter agro. conversely look at how much each tick is generating and compare it to what a &quot;DD&quot; for that amount would create, and adjust accordingly..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sounds good except for one thing, and I think its just the way it was &quot;worded.&quot;<br />
- snip shaman over second cleric quote -<br />
This quote makes it sound like a shaman with heals/slows is superior to the second cleric- which leads me to believe that another shaman could replace the first one as well.  Maybe if the quote should read more along the lines that a shaman, as a back-up healer, would bring more utility that would be beneficial over the excess healing that a second cleric would bring to a group.  I think that's what you meant, but the wording you used makes it sound like a shaman with heals/slows would superior in dmg mitigation to the &quot;current&quot; cleric.<br />
Currently a shaman healing on his own has the option of either straight healing - and being strictly inferior at it then a cleric - or taking a while to slow the MOB and then heal.<br />
<br />
In some content the cleric can keep a tank alive with straight healing, yet a shaman can not, due to the tank dying in the debuff time or getting so low on health that the shaman can not settle into his efficient heals.<br />
<br />
In yet other content the shaman can not heal as well as the cleric, period. Slow simply does not prevent enough damage to ever make up for the loss in healing. Thus, no matter the group makeup, you only group shaman if you can not find another haster.<br />
<br />
What this would change is scenario 3 - increase shaman heals enough and you shift scenario 3 into scenario 2, where you want another healer to keep the tank alive while you slow, then both healers settle into their efficient heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My requests:<br />
<br />
* Longer duration Champion (30 minutes, or at LEAST 20 minutes). I'm willing to give up the idea of a group FA like spell, but dammit, I want a longer duration. <br />
<br />
* Meaningful buffs - buffs going over the stat cap are NOT sufficient</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I agree with pretty much all of it.  As a couple others pointed out that can be added to the list: some sort of AA or spell like &quot;jolt&quot; or evasive damage.  Many classes has means of damage prevention or deagro such as DA, jolt, FD, RuneAA/Mez, Fade, Stonestance/Weaponshield type discs, etc.  Druids and Wizards don't necessarily have anything either, but at least they have quick evac to get out of rough situations (not really recommended during raids).  Slow doesn't count, because I still have agro and I still take damage and can die if the mob isn't or can't be taunted off and I'm unable to heal myself (interrupts) or not healed by others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Good luck Veeshan.  All of these ideas look good so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
1.  Group FA, longer duration, shorter re-cast time.  I don't care if it costs a peridot or more to have it last a full hour.<br />
2.  Group Q.<br />
<br />
I think those 2 should bring alot to the plate for raid buffing, and during AE fights.<br />
<br />
And an evasive spell/abilit like what Ramhorn has pointed out above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I should probably answer each suggested fix as a better response.  You will note that I am very sensitive to the overall balancing of content.  <br />
<br />
IMHO the most important changes to shaman are the &quot;big picture things&quot; like availability of class defining spells, the ability to get into experience groups, to be worthwhile in raiding situations, to support druid healing to prevent having to have a cleric main healer and the mind numbing carpal tunnel click click click of canny.  It is my opinion that just fixing the existing spells to better reflect actual shaman playing styles is the most appropriate fix - not new spells or aa's which will unbalance content.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
* Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned this should read &quot;increase shaman single target heals so that a druid (when re-tuned) can act as a primary healer in advanced content without total shaman healing support (which eliminates shaman dps)&quot;.<br />
__________________________________-<br />
* Add some sort of emergency heal for shaman, most likely as an AA.<br />
<br />
I have no issue with this and it certainly is a good idea but makes for overall content balancing issues IMHO.<br />
_________________________________-<br />
* Add some sort of group or AE heal (mainly for raids).<br />
<br />
(same as above). Both would provide strategic deployment so I'm all for them, but they are mainly tied to overall content balancing.<br />
________________________________<br />
* Increase OoW DoTs by the same percentage that necromancers receive.<br />
<br />
No need to tie shaman DOTS to necro's.  We are completely different classes. Anyway our DOT's are worthless in faster fighting content.<br />
________________________________<br />
* Make shaman DoTs more useable by decreasing DoT aggro and / or adding resist modifiers to them.<br />
<br />
Since DOT's are worthless in shorter fights they are used by the soloing shaman so no agro fix is necessary.<br />
_______________________________<br />
<br />
* Increase shaman nuking power to roughly the level clerics are at now.<br />
<br />
No need to tie shaman nukes to clerics - a very bad example of class balancing IMHO.  Balancing shaman dps (both direct and indirect) with beastlords is a more appropriate fix if you want to talk class balance.<br />
________________________________-<br />
<br />
* Increase the HPs of the focus line to be above the HPs rangers and beastlords can provide.<br />
<br />
Well, focus has been our best longer duration buff so I agree, but it must be overall content balanced.  No need to bring in rangers or beastlords into the equation except in regards to situations where buff slots are limited - but if peeps want to use ranger or beastlord buffs on raids its fine with me.<br />
_______________________________________<br />
<br />
* Replace the stat modifiers of the OoW buffs with effects like strikethrough. The overall effect of such a buff should be of a magnitude a little below that of Bulwark of Vie (seeing as vie wears off with damage).<br />
<br />
As per changes on test, done.<br />
_______________________<br />
<br />
* Slighty increase the resist modifier on Nihil. Slightly increase duration on Nihil.<br />
<br />
Probably the only difficult decision in the entire list.  I think that it is an overall content balancing decision and not a class balance decision so I leave that up to the developers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hey, good luck Murtak.<br />
<br />
Although I'm still out of the game, and have seen nothing at all in OoW that remotely interests me, my comments, for what they're worth, are:<br />
<br />
Shamans need only 1 buff: A version of champion that buffs ALL stats (str, dex, agi, sta), and ATK (as well as the damage modifier).  It should last as long as the craptacular stat buffs for OoW listed in Lucy: 1 hour and 30 mins.  It should come in single and group versions.<br />
<br />
Shaman healing is no where near sufficient.  A burst heal around 2k is the minimum needed.<br />
<br />
Shaman dps is way behind what it needs to be.  Forget the dots, they will remain useless, unless the design of OoW returns to Kunark-Velious era format.  The cold and poison nukes are pitiful.  Oh, and dang it, get them to fix rabid bear.<br />
<br />
It seems that the &quot;vision&quot; for shamans in OoW is the same old, useless long fight model that is no longer valid in the modern EQ game.  Glori's brief conversation with Ryan the spell guy at The Summit indicates that the developers think they've fixed shamans by giving them a 1.5 sec 75% slow.  Somehow, this view must change.<br />
<br />
Additional comment added in edit:<br />
<br />
Oh, and the stupidity of making cannibalize spells our ancient spell is repeated in OoW.  Sure we get a regular canni upgrade for OoW, but the GoD spell is still ancient, and our ancient spell in OoW is yet another canni upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Krohgre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Proposed shaman improvements:<br />
<br />
* Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
In reality we need to address the mindset of the clr/dru/shm healing % currently held by SoE.  It needs to change to something around 100-75-50.  If our heals get upped along with the other two classes, nothing will really change, especially with the upcoming new levels, gear, HP increases etc etc.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of emergency heal for shaman, most likely as an AA.<br />
<br />
I like the idea, one way to give us a burst heal without going near the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; <br />
<br />
* Add some sort of group or AE heal (mainly for raids).<br />
<br />
With patch changes, Group Q would be the ticket now at 65 and Group T at 70.<br />
<br />
* Increase OoW DoTs by the same percentage that necromancers receive.<br />
<br />
If DoT aggro or reisist mods dont change, this really is somewhat a lesser concern IMHO<br />
<br />
* Make shaman DoTs more useable by decreasing DoT aggro and / or adding resist modifiers to them.<br />
<br />
I would trade the entire DIS line for resist mods on POI line.  Lower recast on Bane would help us tremendously.  Bane is the only reliable DoT (and Epic Click) that we have that reliably lands on boss mobs post KodTaz.  Exp farming is different, but only time I use DiS line is via elem pants click and thats because: 1) it casts faster, and 2) cost me nothing if it bounces<br />
<br />
* Increase shaman nuking power to roughly the level clerics are at now.<br />
<br />
Agree in rewording.  975-1100 fast cast (5 sec ish) POI and Cold DD would go along way, but only if they dont have massive recast times (ie dont use the RNG model.  Need POI upgrade before cold though.  <br />
<br />
* Increase the HPs of the focus line to be above the HPs rangers and beastlords can provide.<br />
<br />
Agree fully.  Toss the stats, add HPs.  Give us END regen on it in place of stats.<br />
<br />
* Replace the stat modifiers of the OoW buffs with effects like strikethrough. The overall effect of such a buff should be of a magnitude a little below that of Bulwark of Vie (seeing as vie wears off with damage).<br />
<br />
Agree fully.  I do think that this doesnt answer buff limit problems though.  That and that this could be Shm-Bot relegated need to be looked at.<br />
<br />
* Slighty increase the resist modifier on Nihil. Slightly increase duration on Nihil.<br />
<br />
Balance as it is now is GTG IMHO.  Its really done what it was supposed to (answer the malos + turgurs takes to long) complaint.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Ok coulda been more clear.  I didnt mean heal ratios either, but rather overall effectiveness.  Im not talking in this sense about a %CH.<br />
  <br />
I think I wasnt clear, but my intent was % effectiveness.  In that case 50% isnt a bad thing.  2 shaman can replace (maybe fill in for is a better word because I sense inc CLR hate) 1 clr on a raid.  3 druids can &quot;fill in for&quot; 2 clrs spots on a raid.<br />
<br />
Big guilds in high end need both SHM and DRU (or really NON-CLR) to increase in healing effectiveness to remove the reliance on CLR for raids.<br />
<br />
SoE needs to stop taking the % to the heal #s and adjust it to be a % of effectiveness.<br />
<br />
But I guarantee you we dont get upped super heals alone and I also guarantee we wont equal DRUs in healing power.</div></div><hr />

Our heals have been mitigated.  That needs to be corrected.  Until Slow mitigation, Shaman were able to function as a MH thru Slowing and the heals we had.<br />

With Slow being mitigated, our healing should have been increased to keep pace . . . it wasnt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">5% Damage Modifier will increase their DPS by 2.5%(this isn't guessing). 2.5% of a Rogue doing 300 DPS(basically the best rogue that will come out of GoD) is 7.5 DPS(15 DPS for Champion). Hardly significant imo. <br />
<br />
In a group setting, I agree.  On a raid, however, you have to realise that the spell isn't hitting ONE rogue.  Lets say there are 6 rangers/rogues out of the 54ish people on a GoD+ raid.  That'd be 45 dps.  Add in another 2.5% to every melee'ing class on the raid (lets say 1/3 of the total raid body are melee's/hybrids), that'd be 16 melee, all of whom are doing at LEAST 100 dps with melee for another 25 dps, total of 70 dps.  Keep champion up on 3 of those rogues/rangers (not hard to do) and, not counting attack, and the mod is adding 115dps (an approximation, but you get the idea...) to whatever other dps you're doing on a raid.  That, imo, is a rather significant addition to our raid role.  I won't say I'm drooling all over this change, as all of this buffing can be done rather easily by a bot, but calling it insignificant because of its limited effectiveness in a single group setting isn't right IMO.<br />
<br />
As for the effect of the 7% avoidance on AGI spells, it *will* be noticable...compare a tank with CA3 vs a tank with LR5.  The bonus from AGI is greater than the difference between CA3 and LR5, this is significant in a raid and group setting.<br />
<br />
Again, these aren't the endall solution to our problems, especially since all of this can be done by a MQ bot set up to autocast on an individual, group, or MGB with just a /tell, but these changes, the upgrades to our HoT's and regen spells, and the new blast heal are all steps in the right direction.  In fact, with these changes, the addition of PR to our DR debuff line, a dot aggro fix (especially on poison), and a damage boost to the poison nuke, I think we'd be well balanced in a raid setting.  A group heal would also be fantastic, as I'm generally either healing the entire group at the same time on a raid (ae damage, people not staying at max melee range, etc..) or not healing at all (warrior aggro has made it tough to get aggro while paying attention for most classes hehe).<br />
<br />
In a group setting, I think we'd still need some work.  Remember, our competition for groups is the other slowers, not the other priests, and Bards, Enchanters, and Beastlords bring a LOT to groups.  For one...call me crazy, but don't you think its about time dogdog learned to dualwield/doubleattack WITHOUT having gnoll hide lariats and ykeshas crammed down his throat?  How about we give doggy innate alpha status, boost his damage a bit, and give us a pet buff with slightly better haste/atk than enchanter haste.  This way, they can pretty much balance the dps of the pet without worrying about a superior haste being cast on him, or giving him a pair of weapons, at around 60 dps.  Give him NO tanking ability (ie less hp than True Spirit) so he's still a *companion* and not a pet.  It still wouldn't stack up to a 66+ necro/bst/mage pet, and we don't have pet foci, but it would be a really nice way to do something *significant* while we're spending 1/3 of a fight casting our debuffs.  That, along with the current changes and some of the proposed ones, would bring us much more in line with the other 3 slowers.<br />
<br />
As is, we offer insignificant heals, poor buffs, and low dps while slowing.  Bsts contribute great dps, mana regen, and essentially the same hp/atk we provide.  Enchanters can do mana regen, ridiculous dps in areas that allow charm, runes (even the no compenent ones are worth having up on cleric/tank in some spots), and crowd control with their slows.  Bards can do everything.  Well ok, not everything, but they can pull, boost dps significantly (trusik, overhaste), boost mana regen, melee for nearly the same dps we can do nuking, and slow all at the same time...with selos + DA to save a group in some areas, and a ton of other stuff...i love bards ^_^  I'd say with a boosted dogdog, a 1700ish base heal/630 per tic HoT (GoD+ you should have a healing foci and spell haste, along with healing aa's IMO, if you don't you're skipping content and shouldn't expect to be balanced), a 15% increase in poison nuke dps, MEANINGFUL BUFFS (hey, didn't verant, and then soe, call us the king of melee buffers for a whlie there?..), and an accessable &quot;big&quot; canni (as in the ancient GoD canni....except not coming from endgame zones) to increase our &quot;uptime&quot; (ie casting spells not related to mana regen), I'd say we stack up pretty well with Enc (assuming no charm, which is broken in its current form) and Bsts... and Bards seem to be 4th choice for slower, on e'ci at least, anyway, because they're generally looked at as pullers.<br />
<br />
/shrug i guess what i'm trying to say is, add a boost to dogdog to that list (at least make the new dog autoalpha, my mage friends are getting sick of me), because a form of *significant* dps that starts on engage, rather than after the mob is debuffed, would really solve a lot of our problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or not, your choice.  But Shaman have, up until recently, always been able to function as a healer.  Once our heals started getting mitigated, that changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Damn good list, Murtak.<br />
<br />
I'd like to add 3 things, though.<br />
<br />
1) Giac's &quot;shaman stonestance&quot; idea is great. It would be nice to have an emergency defense for when we draw aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Increase FA/Champion duration and make it an effective buff (i.e., more significant combat effects). I'm just adding my voice in on this one - seriously, maintaining a FA rotation is one of the most miserable, tedious things in the game. It's time to throw away our timers and enjoy the game more.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) I would still like to see something that makes us appreciably better slowers than the other slow classes. Upping our slow percentage is clearly out of the question. The fast cast time and resist mod on Nihil are a step in the right direction, to be sure.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see more content where slow matters. Experience groups in Kod'Taz, for example. Tons of things mitigate slow, but the fights are long enough for it to make a difference. They still aren't long enough for me to use DoTs reliably, but hey, one thing at a time.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see shaman slows bypass one level of mitigation, even on bossmobs. I know this has been said before by other people. I know the content is tuned for a certain amount of expected DPS after slow. I think there is a way to make this work, though. I am imagining 6 classes of mobs:<br />
<br />
Slow-immune (0% effective)<br />
Minimally slowable (5% effective)<br />
Slightly slowable (25% effective)<br />
Partially slowable (50% effective)<br />
Mostly slowable (75% effective)<br />
Fully slowable (100% effective)<br />
<br />
(Please note that I just chose these numbers for illustration purposes, they would need testing to balance the final percentages.)<br />
<br />
So against a 1000 DPS trash mob which is mostly slowable, we would have:<br />
<br />
Bard slowed: 52% x 0.75 = 39% slow, 610 DPS<br />
Beastlord slowed: 65% x 0.75 = 48.75% slow, 511 DPS<br />
Enchanter slowed: 70% x 0.75 = 52.5% slow,  475 DPS<br />
Shaman slowed: 70% slow, 300 DPS<br />
<br />
Bumping us up one category would hardly break the game. Some bossmobs could still be slow-immune, which for us would be minimally slowable - e.g., something like Fennin is now, where slow does almost nothing. Our slow would be 5% effective, while everyone else's wouldn't land at all. This wouldn't matter too much on bossmobs like Fennin, and would be easy to tune.<br />
<br />
It would also offer some interesting content tuning possibilities for groups, in terms of both tanking and healing. For example, it might be possible to do Trials with a Enc slower and a War tank, or a shaman slower and a knight tank. In terms of healing, a druid would be good enough with a shaman slowing, but you would need a cleric if you had a beastlord slowing. <br />
<br />
Obviously, it would be easiest with a warrior tanking, a shaman slowing, and a cleric healing. Making this trio too powerful can be limited by creating encounters that do not revolve solely around single-pulled mobs with insanely high melee DPS. For example, adding in linked pulls which require CC, or AE requiring group heals and cures would allow other classes to shine as well. At the very least, this would offer some relief from much of the current content design, which relies so heavily on the optimal tank/optimal healer working in conjunction.<br />
<br />
Mobs could still be doing their &quot;target DPS&quot; as set by the design team, even after slow. The only difference here is that there would be a good reason to have a shaman as slower, rather than some other class that brings far more to the table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a nutshell, balance our heals NOT against slow, but balance our heals against our ability to strengthen the player.  Damage shields, hp buffs, %dodge, etc..<br />
<br />
That way, regardless of whether a mob is slowable or not, the shaman's value in any encounter remains constant.  <br />
<br />
In addition, we might add dps with %strikethrough, %chance to hit, %increase proc buff, etc.. to the point that its a MAJOR noticeable difference when a shaman is present.  <br />
<br />
A beast adds dmg with his pet and directly.  <br />
An enc adds dmg with charm, nukes, dots.<br />
A shaman should add dmg by enchancing his group, nukes and dots.<br />
<br />
We used to make a group do more dmg, but we all know that isn't the case anymore.  <br />
<br />
1 bigger fast heal<br />
1 group heal<br />
2-3 offense buffs (relying on % increase or ability increase)<br />
2-3 defensive buffs (% increase or add abilities like mitigation or dmg shields)<br />
1 bigger nuke<br />
Lower dot aggro<br />

I don't recall saying haste, ranger atk buffs, or cleric spell haste were insignificant, I seem to remember saying that the 5% damage mod WAS significant.  Don't snipe people, the idea is CONSTRUCTIVE conversation to get our class improved, not &quot;changing the subject because I don't have a counterpoint and want to argue.&quot;  Ranger atk buffs amount to 130 atk, which is really pretty damn insignificant against most mobs for an endgame ranger/rogue.  That's the general idea behind making Avatar a longer duration group buff, 160 atk wouldn't really *do* that much anymore, so why are they putting these ridiculous limitations on its duration and cast time to make sure only X number of people per shaman get the buff, and its a hassle to keep up.  <br />
<br />
What, exactly, do you think an enchanter is doing in an endgame raid setting where basically nothing is mezzable and pullers/offtanks are doing all the crowd control?  They're casting VoQ/VQ and remembering how uber that charmed pet was in the ikkinz trials before it was removed.  Diminished raid roles are not the province of shaman and shaman alone.  Oh, and in case you didn't realise, we can still haste cap decently geared characters.<br />
<br />
Don't snipe unless you have something to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">* Increase single target heals to a level where shaman are, through a combination of slow and heals, clearly preferably for a group to a second cleric as far as damage prevention / healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
I agree with this only so far as Druids also get healing upgrades to be in a similar situation. We should not be a better *healer* using heal and slow than druids using their heals. We should be approximately equal in most situations.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of emergency heal for shaman, most likely as an AA.<br />
<br />
Possibly but the recast time on this would have to be long or the amount healed less than that used by the Cannibalization AA. Otherwise, shammies will just shuffle it with Cannibalization and bleed mana. In either of these situations, the AA would probably appear unnattractive for the cost. In addition, we already have the most mana efficient HoTs. If we got the best burst heals, even if the are self only and AA based, I can see other classes complaining. <br />
<br />
I think what you are trying to say is that we need some better CC abilities since two of the three the other slowers bring this to the group. Maybe a better suggestion would be an AA to reduce the recast time on VP.<br />
<br />
* Add some sort of group or AE heal (mainly for raids).<br />
<br />
An AE Q at level 70 would be nice but only if clerics get a better one. Their one and only trick is healing. They need to be the best at it, preferably by a smaller amount than they are now.<br />
<br />
* Increase OoW DoTs by the same percentage that necromancers receive.<br />
<br />
This would be great for soloing. However, in group situations, shamans rarely use their DoTs because they are slowing, buffing and patch healing. For raid situations, I'd prefer them to fix the agro problems first. Having a 700 damage per tick DoT, for example, is not great if you get summoned and smashed the second you cast it.<br />
<br />
* Make shaman DoTs more useable by decreasing DoT aggro and / or adding resist modifiers to them.<br />
<br />
For comments on agro see the previous post. I think a small resist mod (-20 or -30) to Bane and the higher level spells may be in order. That means, with Malos (-55 to resists), their resist mods approach those of Necro and Druid DoTs (usually -100).<br />
<br />
* Increase shaman nuking power to roughly the level clerics are at now.<br />
<br />
I think the main problem here is that we cannot contribute significant DPS to a short fight. We aren't a nuking class. We knew that when we signed on. However, considering that short fights are no the stable, we do need a leg up here. Whether this takes the form of better DoTs (with more damage and/or less agro), higher damage nukes or faster casting nukes, so be it. <br />
<br />
We also need to be careful to not eclipse other classes. Being given comparable nukes to clerics mean we basically nuke as well as enchanters. Admittedly, Enchanters have great caster/mana regen buffs and CC. However, their charms have been nerfed where they made a big difference (i.e. GoD) and, if their targets have good gear, even shammy hastes will cap haste percentage. If you have multiple enchanters on a raid, one can buff, another CC and the rest stand around nuking. Sound familiar?<br />
 <br />
* Increase the HPs of the focus line to be above the HPs rangers and beastlords can provide.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a few more hit points on the focus line but remember that, although ranger and beastlord buffs look good on paper, you don't see everyone tell the shamans to stand back and watch the rangers and beastlords buff the raid! Irrespectively of how &quot;crap&quot; focus is, you always get focus and a shammy sta buff MGBed on a raid.<br />
<br />
* Replace the stat modifiers of the OoW buffs with effects like strikethrough. The overall effect of such a buff should be of a magnitude a little below that of Bulwark of Vie (seeing as vie wears off with damage).<br />
<br />
I think this is already done for the OoW spells.<br />
<br />
* Slighty increase the resist modifier on Nihil. Slightly increase duration on Nihil.<br />
<br />
I can't comment on this not having used the spell but I have a suspicion that the resist modifer and duration on this spell are going to stay put.</div></div><hr />

I really don't care much for buffs, but saying, that(and I am using your numbers for melee characters here) 2.5% * 0.33 is a significant DPS increase for a raid, seems a little optimistic to me. <br />

I think it's very flawed to want to balance us by making us spend AA doing it.  Other classes don't have to spend time doing AA to be balanced.  There's not a reason in the world we should have to either. <br />
<br />
Other things I want:  canni is a core ability of the shaman and the upgrade to both canni 4 and the AA canni ability we usually call canni 5 are very long overdue.  As core operating aspects of shamans, both improvements should be storebought, or at least canni 5 should have an AA upgrade and canni 4 should be storebought.  What would we think if cleric CH's dropped until they did more AA's or got a new spell that did the same thing, or if warriors suddenly couldn't use edged weapons unless they got a (possible rare) drop that let them do it?<br />
<br />
You should NOT have to jump through hoops and pay all  kinds of extras merely not to be unbalanced.<br />
<br />
That's a terrible paradigm that shamans need no more of in the game.  It accomplishes nothing and is both hurtful now and sets a hurtful precedent for the future.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
This quote makes it sound like a shaman with heals/slows is superior to the second cleric- which leads me to believe that another shaman could replace the first one as well.  Maybe if the quote should read more along the lines that a shaman, as a back-up healer, would bring more utility that would be beneficial over the excess healing that a second cleric would bring to a group.  I think that's what you meant, but the wording you used makes it sound like a shaman with heals/slows would superior in dmg mitigation to the &quot;current&quot; cleric.<br />
<br />
Not so. Because, while heals stack, slows do not. The first cleric would still be required.<br />
<br />
This particular suggestion is actually counter to the general sentiment expressed by the community that shaman are less desirable than other slowers. A 2 cleric group would likely still have have one of those present, so I dont see how Murtak's suggestion could be implemented. Shaman can allready function as secondary healer in most of the content in contention. The only way to rig it would be to have a second cleric handicapped in someway or to have shaman slows that much better than than other classes.<br />
<br />
You could probably create content to do this sort of thing with roughly the current paradigm, by having it with extreme dps but fully slowable with low resists. The dps would have to be so extreme that the magnitude of the slowed dps after different class slows exceeded the difference in magnitude between cleric and shaman heals. That in turn would require initiating the engagement with riposte/parry discs so that the slowing can take place, and that is not really a practical way of designing content in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I really have to say no to buffs, too.  I think they're a dead end, just like arguing over slow is -- what it's worth, how we can improve it, whether we should.  It's all very counterproductive.<br />
<br />
I think our main outlets for the stagnation of the shaman class are healing and DPS.  Frankly, I think healing will be a very difficult road to go down as clerics, the most powerful healer in the game and arguably the most powerful and influential class in the game, will by and large do everything possible to thwart our advances in healing to any worthwhile extent.  When they aren't outright antagonistic toward us getting better healing, most of them flat out just don't care.<br />
<br />
So whether improved DPS is a better fit for our class or more desired or not, I think getting more DPS is probably our answer.  <br />
<br />
I think of myself as a healer -- always have.  Even thought of myself as a healer back when I was a druid, when I first started this game, and almost no druids ever thought that back then.  I like healing, and like helping.<br />
<br />
But more than that, I like participating.  Whatever it takes.  <br />
<br />
At this point, I think we will probably have to forget significant healing upgrades, and just look toward DPS.  <br />
<br />
As DOTs are ridiculously high aggro and shaman dots are resisted at a ridiculous rate, and mobs don't last long enough or DOTs to matter and that will NOT change with new expansions, as mob design is set in stone now, I think DPS via DOTs is another dead end.<br />
<br />
The most &quot;live&quot; direction I can see us going in that matters, is nuke DPS.<br />
<br />
Which seems like the least shaman-like avenue of all.<br />
<br />
I see the heals area being a little more live, but to no meaningful extent.  That is, I think we may eventually get more healing improvements, but don't think they will matter enough for people to find a reason to include us in groups over other slowers.  I don't see people pushing aside chanters or beastlords for the minor healing improvements I envision us getting.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is my read on the situation.  I'm not allergic to concentrating most of our improvements in DPS, but it's not my first choice.  I think we might as well concentrate on it, though, because I don't think we are going to wind up very happy at all with any healing upgrades we get.  And I think the more we concentrate on it, the more likely we will be to push into place something we're not going to wind up liking and that is not going to matter overall.</div></div><hr />

Actually, this is what the class description says:<br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />

just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">The main issue we seem to have is cast times. Sure we have a weak nuke, but i can chain cast it all day with nuke/canni/nuke/canni.<br />
<br />
If the cast time on it was made fairly fast, we could actually contribute to the mob clearing phase.<br />
<br />
A few kills by the trigger happy shaman will make me smile, not the obligatory &quot;oh ****, i nuked another corpse&quot;.<br />
<br />
Same on the heal, either make it heal enough dmg to top up a tank and not make me explain to the ranger why his pissy little chloro blast is mana well spent when the tank gets below 10%. or make it fast casting enough so I can rip off a couple of heals in a row.<br />
<br />
Same with Bane, sure its a good short dot, but its resisted so often that with the super long cast time I only ever mem it for a few seconds, then de-mem it again. Mana is better spent on nuking.<br />
<br />
Actually if they could make a decent resist modifyer on bane, and make it fast casting I would be happy with that rather than making the nukes faster etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am soooo rarely below 80% mana that I dont have the oportunity to blow this supposedly awesome mana regen we get.<br />
<br />
Its been a long time since I have ever had to actually concentrate on cannying in order to keep up, and that was only with a LDON group that had low DPS so I was nuking like a drunk wizzy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wish you the best of luck in your role as spokes beastey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">In Kunark, Velious and Luclin I was perfectly capable of being the sole and main healer in a group.  Pop up to tier 3 I can be the same.  <br />
<br />
I want to be the sole and main healer of a group in elementals, hard ldon's and god.  I am a priest.  Changes to the game that mean I cannot be so are fundamentally beoken as they have changed my classes role without providing a new role that I can undertake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Hmm if by everyones standards they want shaman to be a main healer, then an emergency heal will be necessary perhaps. Since say mob_001 is in camp, hitting for 900s, you have a small dilemma, do you malos, slow, heal. Do you hot, risk slow ,heal. An emergency heal type thing may be necessary if this is the group function, shamans want to serve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">&quot;Add some sort of emergency heal for shaman, most likely as an AA.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it's very flawed to want to balance us by making us spend AA doing it.  Other classes don't have to spend time doing AA to be balanced.  There's not a reason in the world we should have to either.<br />
Gonna jump back on my &quot;Use AA for Balance&quot; bandwagon. I think its the BEST solution out there. Everyone CAN earn AA (but they cannot get all spells, all gear, all focus unlesss they raid at the high end). All classes can be better balanced at the TOP CUTTING EGDE of content with AA, without adversly affecting the lower and middle ends of the spectrum, much easier than saying &quot;OK Now Tnargs is 1800 base, go to town Shamans&quot;. <br />
<br />
Give end game shamans tools they need to cope with the content they are on, but do not make them unattainable for other people who choose not to raid or move through content slower. What else can POSSIBLY solve this equation than AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">One addition Murtak. Its time to just make Talisman of Aclarity = SLTW haste. Stupid not too. Heck, we could take a Raid MGB role with it, since it puts almost everyone with 41% haste items so close to the cap its not even significant.</div></div><hr />

I would like to file that under minor fixes. Yes, it is absurd but I do not see it as a class balance issue, just a huge inconvinience.</div></div><hr />

Agree, just thought I would put it on the table. Something to get when they pull something we REALLY want, you can say &quot;Well at LEAST give us equal Haste single and group&quot; or something, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Stun or bash or something.  Currently shaman have 1 method of interrupting a caster--VP--and it's once every 3 minutes.  Only three races even get a skill of (1), most don't even get that.  I'm not sure why SoE gave bash to the class with stun spells, but there you have it.  :p<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Actually, this is what the class description says:<br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
<br />
Healing is a secondary function, according to the official class description<br />
<br />
Not wanting to derail the thread, but the class description has changed out from underneath us.  <br />
<br />
Class description from beginning through Planes of Power:<br />
<br />
Shaman. Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primative races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you can see why the 'older' shamans are upset.  Nothing like training for football for 5 years and then being told you're  a basketball player starting last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I'd like to see the cast/recast on malos reduced significantly.  And either some sort of emergency heal or emergency debuff thing, AA is perfectly fine for me, as the reuse timers can be ballanced better that way without hogging spell slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Upgrade our healing - its so low, we cant even save a priest if they draw aggro. I dont care what % I am in relation to a cleric. I care about what % i am in relation to mob dps. Currently that % is loading please wait...<br />
<br />
Nukes  - for some reason, our cast tiem jumped from 6 to 7.8 on our nukes. Theres no good reason. Dropn them back down to 6.<br />
<br />
Buffs <br />
<br />
Stat - more% on omens buffs. Those %'s they have now look good for our 65 buffs, which by and large, are worthless<br />
<br />
Stamina - flat % hp increase. Add in a stun resist component. NOthing is being done to our stamina buff in GoD from what I can see. With the diminishing returns, this buff will be abotu 150hp on a tank. Thats not worth a slot.<br />
<br />
Haste - better haste, longer lasting<br />
<br />
FA - group version already. Look at what rangers do. Enchanters do with the attack power on their haste. Its NOT as big as Rytan wants to believe. The only reason he thinks it is, is because hes enamored with stats. I WANT SOMETHING to MGB. I can accept it wont be a heal, they are agaisnt this. Melee dps booster seems most logical.<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
<br />
Id like some cool debuffs. Lots of gates mobs seem to have procs. Id liek to see something to lower the proc amount by a certain %. Say 20% proc amount reducer added to cripple.<br />
<br />
Id like to see a hybrid debuff/group buff. Similar to SK's taps. <br />
<br />
Id like to see an overslow/group overhaste combo. Fast casting, lure based 10% overslow, 10% overhaste.<br />
<br />
OVERALL PRIEST DEFENSE<br />
We're not even speedbumps on exp mobs anymore. Priests as a whole, have fallen below Enchanters in terms of how long it takes to kill us (their runes give them more to chew through). ALL priests need a defense upgrade. We're lambs to the alsughter in omens, I guarantee.<br />
<br />
Our dodge cap needs to go up - its been 75 for 5 years now. <br />
<br />
We need to block with shields - even a low amount will help.<br />
<br />
Mitigation changes - upgrade druid a tad. upgrade shaman slightly. Upgrade cleric a bit more. Armor type shoudl matter SOME.<br />
<br />
Even with these changes, we wont be replacing tanks on content thats non trivial for us.<br />
<br />
Clerics have DA, DB, Divine Arb, Bestow Divine Barrier, Divine Intervention, Innate Divine Intervention.... Druids get ??? Shamans get... ??? You can tell which class the devs deem important to keep around. Druids and shamans BOTH need an &quot;oh crap&quot; button. Id like to see a dodge one for druids, and a riposte one for shamans. 6 seconds or so. Frankly, Id love to see rabid bear just be changed into a 2 tick riposte aa.<br />
<br />
Rez<br />
<br />
I woudlnt turn down rez. I think giving SK's rez (clerics/pallies get it, Necros get a form... sk's should too), and enabling COTH in more zones will promote the games health more. The biggest complaint about rez is if the cleric dies, the expedition is over. Clerics shouldnt be THAT important. Giving 2 classes ways to get people back in action would help that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, how about some alchemy potions for that?  I'd settle for a self-rez potion that would make me pop at my last corpse, even for a 75% rez.  Even better if the potion was no-drop (or not, gotta think about it).<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Alchemy Water of Life potion: 75 % rez, droppable / sellable, cost to manufacture single ~600 plat, trivial ~ 250.  Retail cost would therefore be around 750 plat:  would not threaten any current rezzer's niche.  Would be mostly a recovery from bad wipe item.<br />
<br />
A lot could be done just by un-nerfing Tears of Saryrn:  change high resist factor to lowered resist factor, remove 4 target / 4 hit cap (so if 5 targets in AoE range: you hit all five, for 3 waves; instead of current you hit only 4 of them, and waves 2 and 3 get cancelled), set refresh time to normal (2.5 seconds).  Compared to the AoE nuking power of intel classes, this would still be mild (wizards would not fear that we are overtaking their dps role).  But with minimal recoding effort for SoE it would give us a decent AoE punch, and a decent single target punch:  one mob taking 3 rounds of 650 each (=1950) plus possible crits would mean shaman have some respectable fast damage to offer in many situations.  And it would still be situational:  couldn't do it with mezzed mobs around.<br />
<br />
I add my voice as well to the interesting buffs / interesting debuffs chorus.  Debuff mob's casting ability, give us a cripple that does some actual crippling, and oh yeah, how about that silence spell.  Give buffs that add strikethrough, dodge, and similar.  And 65 minute, group, MGB-able FA -- no it's not overpowering, it would still be a less powerful effect than what clerics, enchanters, and beastlords can cast right now.</div></div><hr />

Clerics get a huge boost to their emergency healing from divine arbitration. Why should shaman not get some panic button AA as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, I was thinking more of our regular heals.<br />
<br />
A panic button healing help would be okay I guess.  I just panicked myself envisioning us having to bribe our way to usefulness by buying outsize AA's for our regular healing, not for special situation healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Jumping back in...<br />
<br />
I think you should be more ambitious. Nothing new has gone into the shaman class since kunark. Our role has been eroded slowly (sic) whereas all the other classes have multiple new things to do. <br />
<br />
My spell list looks almost identical to my kunark spell list. I still struggle to keep my group alive if a mob is unslowable. Groups still take a FAR bigger risk going with a shaman than with a cleric because of the harsh penalties for an unrezzed death. Raids still have a ratio of 5:1 or worse of clerics to shaman.  <br />
<br />
Either make a new debuff to make up for the loss of our damage mitigation capability due to the slow nerf or give us a new spell to enable us to keep players alive.</div></div><hr />
