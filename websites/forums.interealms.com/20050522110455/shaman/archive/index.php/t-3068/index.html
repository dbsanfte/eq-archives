<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im just curious as to how much I should pay for ivory imbued neck/earrings.<br />
<br />
Is ivory a drop, and where could i get some at level 29?<br />
<br />
ac+wis= YAY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was able to find ivory on both the cockatrices in the Overthere and the Dreadlands, I also have seen it for sale in Fironia but I presume that is because that is where most good aligned people do their trading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ivory is a relatively common drop from the Ice Giants that guard the Entrance to Permafrost Keep, in Everfrost.<br />
<br />
Obviously, at level 29, you aren't going to be killing these beasties any time soon...but do not despair. The Ice Giants are a favorite camp for groups of level 40+ and soloers of level 45+. Generally, these players will end up selling their Ivory to vendors for around about 5 plat, so if you ask nicely to buy their Ivory for 15plat (say), they will almost certainly oblige. <br />
<br />
It is also well worth checking with Starn Bearjumper (the guy who sells the DoT spells at the ruined temple on the Tundra), as he is the closest vendor to the Ice Giants.<br />
<br />
Hell, I give the ivory away to any young shaman who is well enough informed to know that (a) it drops at the IGS and (b) it is necessary to make the Tribunal earrings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was selling my earings for 200pp after getting replacements.<br />
<br />
Ivory drops randomly off of various 29+ mobs in dungeons.<br />
I got some from spiders in CC and also found some for sale in Thurg.  I also got some in Siren's Grotto of a level 53 entrhalled bulthar...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">100 to 200 for a pair of earrings would be about right, you may ask jewelers if they have imbued ivory in stock.<br />
If in stock, and they dont have a price, offer 500p for a set of the 3 items.  (i sell mine for 400, but if they have it in stock you dont want to irritate em)<br />
<br />
If they dont, get 5 imbued ivory on your body and ask for a GM jeweler.  Ask if they will make 2 gold plus ivory combos and one plat plus ivory combo.  Thier cost of materials will be 130p, if they dont fail.  Offer thier cost of materials (which will be 105 more for each platinum they fail) and 100 to 200p for the combine.  This should be fair if they have the metal on them and are not busy.  If they are busy, expect them to be bothered by the offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xenonym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got most of mine from Najena, off the earth elems I believe.  I'm willing to bet same might be true in Steamfont, even with the lower level elems there.  I imbue any I loot and keep them on me although I have my full complement of ivory gear.  Same with jaspers.  <br />
<br />
Got mine done by a guild jeweler, and it was NOT trivial at near 250 (forget if he is or not), so chances are if you find a high level jeweler, they will be happy to have a free chance at a skillup.  At least that's been my experience.  If you find some greedy ar$e who charges to click, then I'd say keep advertising.  <br />
<br />
If you're on Torv (I don't remember if you said your server), /t Masool and I'll be happy to give you a couple ivories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ivory is fairly common on Centaur chargers and Avocets in SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're going vendor diving, try North Freeport in the area of the bank. It may be the Najena and Solusek drops or it may be from elsewhere, but I find ivory on those vendors a little more often that usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ivory seems to be pretty common drop off the evil eyes in beholders maze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JedanaIcehealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've picked 'em off of Cynthia in Rathe as well...and an occasional loot off of gnolls in Splitpaw and in SolA as well...</div></div><hr />
