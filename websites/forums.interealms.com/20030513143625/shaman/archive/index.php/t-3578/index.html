<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just a note to add here, if you are thinking about questing these with an enchanter and attempting to MQ the items in iksar form - dont!  Your chanty will get eaten =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For information also for the Helm you need the Sythrax  building plans from that Troll in underwater caves in FoB.<br />
<br />
Well these plans also drop from the skeletons in the caves with him. These are alot easier to deal with than him. :cool:<br />
<br />
There is one that wanders in the tunnel as you enter the caves that can be pulled without aggro to all the others. It takes some patience but this is how I eventually got the plans.<br />
