<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Druid/Cleric boards have tons of threads going back and forth over the new hate generated from the last patch for the incomplete heals Druids have, yet we don't have one thread here. I wonder if that's because we already get so much hate already from our spells we don't notice or if it's because, like me, we avoid using that craptacular heal as much as possible. Is Kragg's generating massive hate for anyone? I don't think I have even cast it yet since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some of the other Shaman were complaining about it on our MB raid.  I was outside slowing spiders so I didnt notice anything.  Havent had the oppertunity to be main healer and need it since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have also noticed this, and warned all of my guild Shaman/Druids to be careful.  Was very noticable when PLing my friend's 27 Ranger, using KM to heal myself after cannibalising - the mob came straight for me soon as the heal landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I havent noticed any extra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Many high level shammie don't use KM anymore or just use it sparingly. I know that I personally am going to be working my AA and try to pick up an Improved Healing item which would obsolete KM using TM. <br />
<br />
An UBER/semi-uber shammie with the right AAs and items have all the healing they need with TM and Q.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: BTW, I'm just adding this as to an explanation as to why many are not talking about this issue here. I'm not trying to minimize the fact that there may or may not be a problem with changes in aggro with KM :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never cast it enough to notice; Tnarg's is way better and always has generated a fair amount of Heal Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use it to heal my warrior when we fight the Guardian Wurms and was really worried about the new agro rules.  After only 2 fights I can report I did not get any agro using - cast maybe 10 times only though in this situation.  So my worries were for naught - so far anyway.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was in NTOV on a guild raid last night and KM was REALLY pissing off the mobs in there.  I'm talking I KM'd myself after getting some aggro and had TWO nearby mobs that were actively being tanked and taunted peel off their tanks and come over to me.  It's true I had just Crippled them, but still.  Other shaman in the guild had similar experiences.<br />
<br />
I can believe that it varies a lot based on the zone you're in, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From the 1/15 Patch Message:<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
- NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a manner similar to traditional healing spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I knwo they raised the hate level, I was just asking how noticeable it was to Shamans, Druids are complaing quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hate to sound silly, but i got aggro from Can 5/Torpor. The aggro didn't come from low hp as I had more then enough to avoid that type of aggro. It came when I torpored myself. That heal aggro was pretty upsetting, stupid nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pcapone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i got some extra agro in PoV last night</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Torpor agro wasn't changed - or at least it wasn't according to patch message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">torpor wasnt changed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Before this patch I could be the healer in the Exe trial and not gain any aggro from using Kraggs.  Haven't had the chance to try this again but from what I'm hearing I would get pummeled if I tried it again.<br />
<br />
WTG Sony on another nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah I dont see how it would work to be main healer in the trials anymore after this extra aggro. Maybe with a great mezzer. Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I noticed a small amount of extra agro using kragg's mending in POI. Nothing major though, and I find it hard to call this a nerf, more a bug fix, we're been getting agro free heals all this time which is patently not the way it's meant to work.<br />
<br />
It is kinda refreshing to see shamans take this in our stride though - over at the druid boards they want Divine Aura and Feign Death in &quot;compensation&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail,<br />
<br />
I have noticed extra aggro from Kragg's.<br />
Especially in PoI factory, Valor, and Storms.  I don't think I would have really noticed it except our main healer died a few times, and the heal aggro was more noticeable to me on those occasions when I wasn't actively working offensive magicks.<br />
<br />
/shrug.<br />
Am I happy about more aggro?  Nope.  Worth screaming about it?  Nope.  <br />
<br />
I'm used to aggro.  It is just one more spell I need to keep a closer eye on casting when I'm low on health, that's all.  Tnarg's is just around the bend for me anyway. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have noticed the extra agro from this.  It isn't normally a big deal, but it can make it hard to be the only slower and healer for a group.<br />
<br />
Get a double pull, and you have some hard decisions to make.  Slow the first mob, and if you have to heal the tank before the 2nd mob gets slowed you are in trouble.  It isn't all that easy to quickly slow multiple mobs in PoP, because they all require malo.  I got my a$$ handed to me once for healing the tank before I got the 2nd mob slowed.  gotta like eatting the HT then the unslowed hits.  Try to channel slow w/o malo and either a resist or interrupt and you are history.<br />

Fighting in HOH<br />
<br />
65 Warrior with Primal Cord Hilted Spike Driver (EB) <br />
Warrior Engaged,<br />
Cast Malo, Cast Slow, 2 -3 sec pause, cast KM <br />
Got agro.  Warrior wasnt even fully healed as it did about a bulb &amp; hald and he was down about 3<br />
<br />
Seemed much more than pre-nerf.  It would now be very hard to be the only priest in a group and handle slows and heals because of agro.  ((Not to mention built in inefficency))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The taunt from KM is much more reasonably present now, the only time its actually got me whacked was playing with Gorenaire with a bard, I KM'd and promptly got smacked about for it =)  Otherwise I simply don't think it heals enough for it to generate sufficient agro to out taunt any reasonable taunting class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You know, I hate to say it, but I LIKE this change.  I often group with charm classes, and 2 Tnargs is sufficient to take the heat off a chanter or mage with a charmed pet that just broke charm.  I can take a beating a hell of a lot better than they can.  Frankly, this can be a nice tool in the arsenal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Primary healer and slower(habit) last night in PoN with this group:<br />
<br />
2 shaman, 2 warrior.<br />
<br />
I KM'd the warrior's when they got low, as well as myself on the Cann cycle.<br />
<br />
I never got aggro from when I cast KM, even after I lost aggro from slowing or throwing in an occasional dot in addition to epic.<br />
<br />
Sorry clerics and druids, but it's not the heal, it's you or what you are fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">did the exe trial again yesterday (for some friends) .. and was nukin' and using kragg's to backup the druid using his iCH  and neither of us got any aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I often duo in the planes with my warrior husband, and never remembered getting aggro from KM...until last night.  It was mildly annoying, but didn't cause any deaths or serious health loss.  <br />
<br />
At least now I know why i was getting aggro..next time I'll read the patch message more closely :)  I was beginning to think I was doing something wrong, or just plain smelled!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I always thought the no aggro was how they wanted it designed.  They purposely coded it to not be a &quot;heal&quot; so that you couldn't get some of the benefits that other heals get from aa and focus items.  The icon is even different that all other heals.  Therefore I concluded that the non aggro was by design, silly me.</div></div><hr />
