<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject line says it all. Anyone have any ideas as to why the Priest classes did not receive this AA ability?  Would it have been to over powering?  Please post your thoughts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

PS if you not sure what this AA does please see this link http://eq.crgaming.com/archetype/Details.asp?Id=26</div></div><hr />

Still would be hadny to have though against those mobs that you do you're gonna die within two seconds if you get any aggro at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i dont have aggro problems unless i want to have them 95% of the tiem.

Id never train it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would train in it, albeit we'll never get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, SK's get Spell Casting Subtley.  They might be fools to train in it, but they can.  <br />
<br />
It just shows the people who were the brains behind the AA system slapped Int-based classes with a general format and the same with Wis-based to their general format, disregarding any thought to each class playstyles.  It has nothing to do that we can take hits better than Int-based classes. <br />
<br />
I might not train in it, for the simple fact of I like to be able to agro something off someone (like a cleric or chanter), but definately SCS fits the class.<br />
<br />
Why not Spell Casting Deftness?  Yes, I understand there are certain things one group should have and the other not (and vice versa).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If we could train it, i'd put it near innate int on my list of priorities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well usually the only time I'm getting beat on by a mob is when its UNslowed, because of the massive aggro I get from resisted slows.  <br />
<br />
So definitely yeah I would train it, if we had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If this affects any spell that generates agro then I must assume it includes heals.<br />
<br />
Healing spells generate agro.  <br />
AA ability that reduces agro = agro free healing.  <br />
This would make the priets even more unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Would it be good for shaman? Possibly.  Especially when one only has a warriors poor Taunt button to rely upon.  Just think of all the nukes or DoT's one could land.<br />
<br />
Would this be good clerics? Absolutely.  Would make CH less of a taunt thus taking all the risk out of healing.<br />
<br />
Druids? Dunno I dont play one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If we could train it, i'd put it near innate int on my list of priorities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Schpleef, <br />
<br />
May I ask why you would say this?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Please understand that I have just began to play a shaman and I am just beginning to understand this class but I have seen many posting on this board stating how agro the Poison based dots are and asking that the agro be turned down. This ability would seem to help with this.  <br />
<br />
Actually this post isn't directed to Schpleef but to all readers of this board, so please do not take offense, Schpleef<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Playing a smart shaman means knowing your agro limits. Giving us that AA would just make playing a shaman even more brainless. You want to lay 5 dots on a mob in an exp group? Play a necro. <br />
<br />
in simpler terms, we dont get that AA because we can slow and have generally higher AC than other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh no, other classes have an ability that we don't! How dare they give different abilities to different classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We dont get it the same reason we do get Priest ones.  why do we have to have everything other people have?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would never expect this but as I read the many posting saying the agro on DoT are to much, I see this ablity as a possible solution.  Also, in PoP, I see so many Shamans getting pounded on when they cast Slow.  <br />
<br />
I think Cali made a good observation stating that this might create agro-less healing. A very good point.  Perhaps, this AA should not effect Healing spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm not sure why a shaman wouldn't want this.  I also am not sure why people think that having this AA would suddenly make playing a shaman too easy.  Both of those statements make me wonder if I'm playing the same game as they are.  There is a LOT more to playing a shaman than spacing your spells out, and I can't think of many times where I want to draw aggro, which is the only time you don't want this ability.<br />
<br />
Quote: &quot;a pissed off slowed mob is alot easier to deal witht hen a unslowed one. Id never train it.&quot;<br />
---Huh?  A slowed mob, pissed or not, is always easier to handle.  Am I missing the point of this statement?<br />
<br />
Oh well, not the first time I've disagreed with people.  I don't think we should get it necessarily, but if we had it as an option, I would probably want to train it at some point in my career.<br />
<br />
In regards to healing aggro, I don't think this would apply.  Normal spell aggro comes from directly doing damage to or debuffing a mob, where healing aggro is indirect (the target is the player, not the mob).  I don't have access to the code, but this is how I understand it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd never train this AA because I play with aggro.<br />
I need my aggro and I hate it at the same time.<br />
<br />
I hate my aggro when it's time to slow a 2K+ quadding mob that AoE rampage..<br />
I love my aggro when it's time to park adds that are eating my cleric in xp groups.<br />
<br />
Even in raid I use my aggro to aggro adds on cleric and bring em to chanter or split a pack of mob pulled to let chanter time to mez etc.<br />
I don't want to have to cast a damaging spell for that. I want to keep my slow aggro thanks.<br />
<br />
However, aggro on dots is insane. Having a AA that lower my aggro on every spell NO ! having aggro of dot lowered yes ! Having a AA that lower aggro on dots only F**k NO !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I stated that I wouldn't train it as I almost exclusively solo.  I split tanking duties between my pet and I, and if I want to more decisively control aggro I can do so with a quick root.<br />
<br />
It would be absurd to give this ability to the priest classes.  Why not give shamans ports, snare, and quad-kiting nukes?  How about a God-Mode AA, 1 hour of god mode with a 65 minute reset timer?  And dire charm of course!  How dare shamans not have dire charm?  Its so unfair!<br />
<br />
Jesus use your heads!  Yes our poison dots have too much aggro.  It'd be a simple fix to lower the aggro on them, you people want game-imbalancing changes in shamans' favor as a fix?</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, I'm happy for Schpleef it is Friday because I think he needs that weekend!<br />
<br />
This was merely a question that I proposed.  I believe this is what these boards are for.  No reason to get upset about it. <br />
Being a caster with this ability, trust me the agro reduction on this spell is not &quot;amazing&quot;  it may get me an additional nuke off before I need to cast concussion (agro reducing spell)<br />
<br />
Once again thanks all for their input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True , i guess its a situational thing. Me personaly in a XP group i have over 5k , so a resisted slow on a PoP mob hitting for 500+ im still able to get 1 , maybe even 2 more slows off and i generaly dont get that resisted 3 times in a row after malos. Not to mention the healer has my back unless im the only healer which is rare.<br />
<br />
Im a sick breed of shaman though , i gain pleasure from getting aggro and being beat on ;)  <br />
<br />
Keeps me awake<br />
<br />
Plus as wuddaru stated above , i need my aggro. when someone gets aggro that cant handle it like i can , i wanna be able to yank them off with a DoT or a recast of slow. I find myself doing that so often anymore that i have make a &quot;offtank&quot; hotkey. That reason alone is why i cant train this even if we have it. It would cripple my crowd control abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, lots of people bent out of shape over nothing.  Nobody is demanding or even proposing that priests/shaman be given this, it's just a discussion.  No need to start cussing people out, blaspheming, or taking the argument off into crazy, extreme tangents that have nothing to do with the discussion at hand.  Those are tools for people who don't have anything useful to say.<br />
<br />
I still would prefer to have reduced aggro on all spells than not.  My job is not to pull adds off of the cleric to park them, that's what rangers, pallies, and shadowknights are for.  At least, that's what I use my ranger for.  I don't know why that's your responsibility, I would imagine you would be needed for other more important duties.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I would not say that every shaman would have to train it, if for whatever reason you are needing to get aggro all the time, then we are playing our characters totally differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy , my perspective is that if you have adds , you want them dead. So by the SK ( who cant root btw ) or the ranger or any other DPS intensive class getting off the mob thats being taken down , its only prolonging the situation causing more mana to be used for heals and such and causing more danger to the group in general. Fact is we arent a high end damage dealer , we spend more time buffing then we do putting out damage.  When we get adds i pop out SC on the main mob and CC ( root park/slow/debuff ) the rest, not always in that order.</div></div><hr />

For those of you with thick skulls, I'll repeat myself:  Priests, including shamans, do not have this skill for a reason.  The reason is called &quot;Class Balance&quot;.  I'm not one to credit SOE with much of anything, but I've got to agree with the way things stand on this.</div></div><hr />

You beat me too it.   Shaman the best class for splitting a mob for root parking.  I wouldn't want to change this.  I like my job.</div></div><hr />
