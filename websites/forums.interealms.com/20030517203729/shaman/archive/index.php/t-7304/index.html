<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The post saying shamans can get 39% of an AA lvl in 1 hour might be right. I tried soloing in Ssra basement, I never really did a whole hour tho. I seldom have the time for it, or something always pops up. (I need to stop being so darn friendly)<br />
However, the XP I gained in 30 mins would end up at 30% or so in an hour. So if you got Aego/C3 and most of all, know your limitation and know how to pull down there... Its not impossible to get 39%. But you will have to work very hard for it.<br />
<br />
Just a thought I wanted to share....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tried it last night, got 31% and I was on 90%aa and 10%reg lvl 60. So it would have been about 34,5%.<br />
True, its the best place I have found</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you truly want to know with the new PoP zones you can get one aa point every 45 mins in some zone with a full group so you dont need to solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, but I just got pop today. Going to find out now )</div></div><hr />
