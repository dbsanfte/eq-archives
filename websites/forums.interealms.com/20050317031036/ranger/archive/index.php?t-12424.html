<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rivenblade</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really appreciate your help with this matter but the site you gave me also says it went live 10/23 as well as has cry of fire listed as a spell. they also have a new root listed witch for some stupid reason is STILL only 1 min like our 60 root but this one has no DD. for the life of me I can't figure out what verant is doing to the ranger. Also wondering if this mask of the stalker is truely a ranger spell now or another jumbled fact. seems VI doesn't even know *** there doing. oh well if you come across any info pls keep me posted.. and again I am very grateful for the time and info :). Also I would like to add if I find anything I will post it for you as well.<br />

VI has been known to throw in bogus info into the file to throw the players off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@ LyssaRZ: I think you give VI to much credit.....Its more like they don't know whats in there more then putting in bogus info to throw ppl off ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keltaras</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm that it is NOT in the PoK library as previously posted on another post, I checked all of the pathfinders including the female half elf (there is no female wood elf).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the existance of the spell casting information in the DAT file does not mean that the scroll exists yet.  They let the DAT go out quite often with test data or new spell data.  But the lack of the scroll prevents people from obtaining the spell itself.  Lucy saying it went live on 10/23 just means that it appeared in the DAT file for live servers.  Lucy has no way of knowing where or how the spell is obtained (scroll, proc, potion, etc).</div></div><hr />

No Harmony of Nature on any of them.. Someone post if/when it finally goes live please =)</div></div><hr />
