<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I swear, this has to be one of the buggiest patches in the history of EQ.  Listen to all the bugs that have been founds so far :<br />
<br />
1. Rallos Zek is dropping water flasks on his loot table<br />
2. Rallos event has a chance to crash Tactics<br />
3. Emp wraiths depop when Emp dies, no rifts<br />
4. Monk FD is 100% memblur<br />
5. 2 people so far I have talked with found a 32k hp item with other really weird stats that went in any slot in their charm slot and when they tried to link it, couldnt, and when they tried to move it to another slot they died (once they got back to their corpse it was gone).<br />
6. Archery and Nuke aggro is screwed up (it wasnt suppose to go in this patch)<br />
7. Tallon Zek's regen is screwed up, we got him to 6% hps then his hps shot up to around 65% before we wiped, was going up 5% every tick.<br />
<br />
    Now I know they have had buggy patches before, but geez, this is a bit much dont ya think?  7 big bugs, think about what would happen if a MT of some guild heard about the 32k charm bug and then ended up getting it...hi 40k+ god-tank.  I hope Sony has enough sense to see that this patch completely screwed up so many things and will take down the servers and fix it today.  This is just too much.<br />
<br />
Edit : Forgot one, there is a bugged hammer with over 1000 mana too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At least some people are getting into the game. My PC completely freezes at the EULA screen. It took several hours of searching through the tech help forums and trying all kinds of &quot;fixes&quot; before SOE acknowledged the problem and posted a work-around. If you're having this problem, use &lt;shift&gt;&lt;alt&gt;R and then left click on the EULA screen. It seems something got hosed up with making EQ the current app and now you have to tell Windows to make it current. This problem seems to be occuring primarily with Win XP users.<br />
<br />
Edit - BTW, when you go through the exiting procedure for EQ, it loses focus again and you have to reboot. Or at least I do if I want to get back to my desktop.</div></div><hr />

We killed him before this and never had that prob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Loss and healed hp is updating very slowly currently also. Very annoying when canniing or when I use stone on my cleric.</div></div><hr />

1) PoP mobs not enraging<br />
<br />
2) Fenn Ro being a fook load harder<br />
<br />
and for the most horrible bug....<br />
<br />
*3* Pathing being half decent omg omg nerf mobs need to run a mile away before even coming close to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">2) Fenn Ro being a fook load harder<br />
<br />
Fennin Ro was pretty gimp compared to the 3 other Elemental Gods.  He's a straight up fight for the most part (no adds, rings, etc) just clear **** for an hour or so and then go at him directly.<br />
<br />
Now they need to make his son Solusek Ro more than the pansy that he is.  Sol Ro is an absolute joke of a god, we killed him on accident with a late night raid of people that went up to &quot;test&quot; him for the first time.  Imagine our surprise when we killed him first attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Another bug!  During the Terris Thule fight she does none of her special stuff cept for the statues at the end (no 24 butterflies, no AE dispel).  Good news though, Emp bug was fixed now and SSRA got repoped with it so we got to flag the few stragglers for VT we still had (which we intended to do with the first emp).</div></div><hr />

Im not real sure what your intention is but I think its a REALLY annoying habit to make things harder after the local uber-guilds have had the exclusive pharming rights for several months. It only breaks an already broken game even more.<br />
<br />
If fights are not hard/challenging enough for you anymore then dont do them.</div></div><hr />

Not really haha, plenty of mobs are alot easier now than they were when first killed, Seru and Emp come to mind.  Both of these mobs are now 40% slowable (at first unslowable) and have like half the hps they had before now.  But yeah I know what you mean, alot of times this does happen, and not just on mobs, but on zones in general.  Like in HOH when specs dropped every 5 mobs, after the ubers got finished with that it was changed so you MIGHT get 1 in 5 hours there.  Windblades \ Girdles of Mith too (though those were dropping WAY too much, but they nerfed em into to almost non-existance now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok our guild was on second night of three night ToV &quot;blitz&quot; <br />
<br />
Mobs in West tov do not give gate messaage. The health on them will jump up and down... it's down to 15 percent, it's up to 25... it's down to 10 percent, it's up to 20... <br />
<br />
When they do gate it's instant and not when they should be gating.. they are doing it when health is as high as 25 to 30 percent.  They are not summoning like they usually do, but when they do it really sucks lol. <br />
<br />
I've noticed the usual slow / malo messages are not realiable to see now, and i have to be in the mobs lap to get them. <br />
<br />
Our poor wizards were getting pounded. They have not basically got to relearn their class, and if they do almost anything that causes a crit might as well write them off to a rez. <br />
<br />
Slow in west tov was not getting any form of aggro like it used to. Any one else notice less aggro with slow any where else?<br />
<br />
Just a few things we have noticed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Last night my guild fighting Tallon Zek, Rangers and Wizard, Mage down<br />
quickly after first or two shoot or critical dd, I throw 4 Bane of Nife, 4 Blood of Syran,2 Breath of Utor didn't get any hit until most ppl dropped.<br />
<br />
Next we try Vallen Zek,  one Enc nuked a critical 2000 dmg at VZ 90%and got summoned to right away.  Even I cast slow + cripple can't get agro from VZ.  Caster brust dmg agro really broken now. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah maybe, but it's not a reason to give him a bugged like hell rampage that make him fooking harder.. It's not funny to cast a spell / throw an arrow at him and because you are the last one doing something to his hate list before rampage, you get the rampage round (no range on that rampage... Gratz zonewide rampage !). So when a mob rampage every 2 sec...<br />
We lost all our dps class in the first 2 min.. He used to be a fast 5 min fight.. but this time, because of that fooking rampage, after 8 min he was at 77% /sigh <br />
They screwed with hate list..no doubt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I believe that you can add rampage distance to the list of bugs.  It sure isn't acting as it used to, at any rate.  Last night, during a fight on RD (one of the HoH trials), I got onto the rampage list.  I carefully backed out of the fight, to the other side of the room, in fact.  We had him pinned to one wall in the room he spawns in and I had my back to the opposite wall (must be about 1000 feet) and I STILL died to rampages at that distance.  I sure hope it's a bug at any rate.  I hate the idea that I can be meleed from across the zone.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is a new bug, but during the AD fight last night, the Crystal Roar icon was disappearing right away but I would continue to take DoT damage for about 30 seconds after it was apparently gone.</div></div><hr />

- Happend on Tarew Marr more than I can and care to count. It wasn't the server down but a router infront of it so login server couldn't reach it and thought it was down. The server was up and fine. Really fun when you engaged RZTW and the fight going smoothly then bam ... LD.</div></div><hr />

Hehe notice that 100% memblur is the first thing announced being looked into.  Most monks welcomed this change.  Of course since its a BENEFIT, no matter how minor, it HAS to be fixed before the major player DETRIMENTAL bugs.  I've heard people use this old EQ cliche forever.  Its just amazing how true it is.</div></div><hr />

If I remember correct RAMPAGE always hit someone other than MA, usually go to 2nd highest or so<br />

Think a major programer got canned right before the patch was to go though or something.<br />

btw, major bitchfest on that one was people bitching bout the people who got to keep the CoF's =P  well, besides the total of bout 20 hours of downtime.</div></div><hr />
