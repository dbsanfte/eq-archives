<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all<br />
<br />
i need a little reading material suggestions, i have read the Wheel of time series up the the 8th book and im just bored with it Now. I was wondering if there where any book series that are set in the Nordic/Viking time period and follow Vikings? That is my favorite time period(reason i made a barb).<br />
<br />
Im looking for a series or a few books that compare to the WoT books but not as drawn out.<br />
<br />
<br />
hell any series that is similar but not as long would be appriciated.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definately not completely similar but anytime someone talks about reading I have to give big ol props to my favorite author:  Terry Pratchett<br />
<br />
I own every novel I can find from him and every single one of them has made me bust out laughing for no reason (ppl look at you weird when you laugh while reading :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Read Beowulf. Not nearly as drawn out, much higher quality literature.<br />
<br />
For a real kick, read it in Old English. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might like the Belgarid series by David Eddings, he wrote a lot of good series.  A lot of fantasy. <br />
<br />
Maybe the Sword of Truth by Richard Goodkind(I think thats the author). It isn't finished either 1 more book I think.<br />
<br />
Riftwar Saga if your looking for something short but good kinda like EQ in a way by Raymond E Fiest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm enjoying George R. R. Martin's current series, the first is Game of Thrones. Another great author is Gay Gavriel Kay, I loved A Song for Arbonne and Tigana.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I can't think of a Viking storyline off the top of my head!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even though I'm just repeating the suggestion, the power of Pratchett must be known by all.<br />
<br />
Read Pratchett's Discworld series. There's 26(?) novels so far in it, but they don't connect together for the most part, so you can stop at any time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I too made a barb because of the nordic theme (when i first looked at barb models i was dissapointed to see kilts, i wanted them to be full on vikings).  There was a movie out recently called the 7th warrior or some such, the book it is based off of was written by Steven King or another high profile writer, but based heavily off of manuscripts by a middle-eastern envoy to norway, it describes alot of viking traditions and a few adventures.  Beowulf is also good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I read the WoT series also... got stuck in the middle of book 8 and cashed out. Jordan's books are good, but after a while they begin to feel like a soap opera, with him dragging the story out for no reason that I can see.<br />
<br />
But if you like the viking era, I suggest you pick up the 3-book cycle (all 3 combined are the size of ONE Jordan book!) by Harry Harrison: The Hammer and The Cross, One King's Way, and King and Emperor.<br />
<br />
The books are alternate history: what would happen if, in the middle ages when the Holy Roman Empire of the Germans which spanned Germany, France and a bit of Italy and worked to basically convert everyone to Christianity had opposition? In this alternate history, a strong king unites the Viking nations (Sweden, Norway, England, etc) into an empire to rival the Christian one and which is based on the Norse religion, though it tolerates others. Sound intriguing? Heck, what if that Norse empire united itself with the Muslin empire to the south of the Christians, who in turn ally with the East Orthodox Byzantine Empire?<br />
<br />
Everything includes huge doses of knight vs. Viking battles &amp; skirmishes, a LOT of detailed info on the Viking society, and is easy to read. It's worth it to pick up the first book in paperback &amp; judge for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The book I believe he is referring to is called  Eaters of the Dead  by Michael Crichton. (He of Jurassic Park and Coma fame)<br />
<br />
The movie is called the 13th Warrior and stars Antonio Banderas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tery Goodkind writes the Sword of Truth novels, quite recommended. I'd put it a couple of notches higher than the WoT books (burned out on about the 4th WoT myself when they started becoming redundant). <br />
<br />
I'm reading a series right now loosely based off Norse mythology by an Australian writer named Sara Douglass called the Wayfarer Redemption. She's completed two of them with the third on the way, nice thick books easy to read and quite tasty. :)<br />
<br />
If you've never read the Thomas Covenant trilogies by Stephen R Donaldson I'd very highly recommend them. Really profound and enjoyable to read. You care about the people in the story by time he's done, and it will leave you thinking for a long time to come; they're the benchmark I use for everything else.<br />
<br />
Another very highly recommended trilogy is the Coldfire books by CS Friedman. Where a holy paladin must come to terms with true evil; &quot;for you, priest, I will become the most subtle evil of all, the one you will grow to trust and call friend.&quot; I just can't say enough about these.<br />
<br />
Hope these help, good readin'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The books were previously published overseas and for some reason my small library in Bothell, WA had all three in paperback, so I read the whole series, pretty good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For a GOOD Viking movie, I'd recommend Yellowbeard.  Cleese, Cheech AND Chong... ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though like bazillion thumbs up on the Sword of Truth until the 6th book..then it tends to peter out..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Book good to read. <br />
<br />
If dey have pictures.<br />
<br />
An an arrow showing what side is up.<br />
<br />
(Back when I roleplayed ALL the time as Pana the barbarian enchantress I emoted :opens up her book of spells, sadly it is upside down, but she seems to not notice.)<br />
<br />
Now Pana is a hot boxed clarity Caster. /sigh I have become what I hated the most. a non roleplaying conveniance hot boxer.<br />
<br />
Ahh well back to the subject.<br />
<br />
Viking mythos. There is a book called Storm sheild. It is a middle book in a series and might be out of print. But it deals with old Celtic legends.  There is also a book called Fireshapers Doom, that is also the middle of the series. The entire series of books are Quite good though and is kindof Modern world meets the Irish ledends Lugh of the long arm and such.<br />
<br />
Other books.<br />
<br />
Hmm. One of my favorite Authors. Simon Green. he writes some very fun fantasy and semi sci fi stuff. Blue moon rising is one of my favorite books of all time because of the charecters.<br />
<br />
Also George R. R Martin is amazing. The song of ice and fire kicks much ass.<br />
<br />
My favorite book is by an author named Steven Gould. Jumper is the name of the book. A very simple sci Fi book. It asks what would someone do if he found out he could Teleport...<br />
<br />
Much of fantasy today seems to be angsty and whiny to the extreme, but there are hundreds of good books out there. Much much better than the last 5 of Jordans Crap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You could try the Last of the Renshai series, by Mickey Zucker Riechert. It's not set in the real world, but it does have a lot of Norse mythology in it (and Viking countries). My character's first name comes from a minor character in one of the books. Entirely coincidence that it's similiar to The Rathe in EQ, as I didnt know about that zone/diety when I made my character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bimaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yet another vote for Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. If you like the first 6 or so of Robert Jordan you will LOVE Terry Goodkind. Dwarfs it in all areas.<br />
<br />
Not Viking related at all though.</div></div><hr />
