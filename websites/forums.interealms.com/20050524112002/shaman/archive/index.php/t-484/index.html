<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brakins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm an Ogre shammy and i was trying to get my lvl 34 pet spell in W. Karana but the barbs wont sell to me, is there somewhere else i can go to get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The pet merchant is indifferent to all I think. She was to my troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As you run along the coast from the North Karana zone, and approach the Barbarian village, the pet/charm spell vendor is the first Barbarian you'll encounter, along the water's edge. She is indifferent to everyone and far enough removed from the other Barbarians that you're safe dropping Invisibility. When I hunted in the Permafrost/Everfrost area, she was the merchant I used to sell loot to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like you were clicking on the wrong chick, all spell vendors are indifferent to everyone.<br />
<br />
There was a bug once where you could become KOS to beta neutral faction by killing PoD or other beta neutral NPC's but I think that was fixed a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Just try again.<br />
<br />
If all else fails ask another shaman in the zone or have someone show you the right lady.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah I had troubles finding her at first as well.  I searched all the barbarians in the village but coudln't find the right one.  But she is far apart from the rest of the merchants, kind of on her own near the lake.  You will be able to find her just by looking for the only female barbarian that is not actually in the village.  If you are coming from Queynos hills (via the SG port if invis) when you get to the village from Queynos hills just hit the village walk down to the water and follow the water left til you see her.</div></div><hr />
