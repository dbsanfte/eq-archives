<br />
TEMPLE TERRACE, Fla. (Reuters) - An 8-year-old Florida boy drove himself to school in a stolen car after missing the school bus, police said this week. <br />
<br />
The youngster was caught when schoolmates told a teacher they had seen him park the car in the faculty lot at Riverhills Elementary School in Temple Terrace, a city northeast of Tampa. <br />
<br />
The boy, who could barely see above the dashboard, had crossed at least one busy four-lane intersection on the 1.5-mile route from his home to the school. <br />
<br />
He was suspended from school for up to 10 days for endangering himself and others, but was not arrested because police did not see him driving the car. <br />
<br />
The boy said his uncle had been giving him driving lessons since last week in the car, a 2002 Ford Focus that had been reported stolen, police said Friday. The car theft was still under investigation. <br />
<br />
Police said neither the boy nor his mother knew the car was stolen, and that the mother was not arrested because there were no signs of neglect at home. <br />
<br />
&quot;He wanted to show it off to his friends I guess,&quot; said Temple Terrace Police Capt. Tracy Mishler. &quot;He made it (to school) right on time but he bragged about it and that's why he got caught.&quot; <br />
<br />
The boy's uncle, Darrick Wilford, was arrested on Tuesday on an unrelated vehicle theft charge.</div></div><hr />

Why are you people so afraid of Bowie?  Fine, I will take it off just for you AS SOON AS I find a picture cool enough to replace it.  Which could take a while because everyone knows how cool Bowie is.<br />
<br />
And yup, it's from the labrynth (sp? heh)</div></div><hr />

The kid felt so much pressure to get to school on time that he stole a car and drove it (at age 8) there. Ahhh, the irony.</div></div><hr />
