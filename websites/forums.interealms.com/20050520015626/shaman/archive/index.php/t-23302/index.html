<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's still in beta and I know things are subject to change but so far they haven't seen any real changes in a while. These are my own personal point of view and hopefully Sony will see these and at least choose to do something.<br />
<br />
First we have 6 Omen-Shaman-PH spells still. Obviously something needs to be done with them. Looking at the info that is left in them they seem to be single target and group diaku which should probably be changed back to dex type spells and should be combat effects like str and agility are being changed. A root upgrade which isn't a big deal either. The malos upgrade which wouldn't be a bad thing. Personally I'd like to see more improvements in the cast time/recast time than in the amount debuffed. Finally single target and group hastes. For single target biggest request would be LONGER DURATION and for the group haste bring it up to the same level as the single target one.<br />
<br />
Starting from the bottom and working up.<br />
<br />
Putrid Decay<br />
New combo pr/dr debuff spell as a hard to resist disease spell. Don't see anything wrong with the spell but not really sure when this is going to be useful.<br />
<br />
Obkin's Spear of Venom<br />
New poison nuke. Once again poor efficiency on the spell and due to the small size of the nuke doesn't end up being any better dps. Make the spell more efficient or make it better dps compaired to Ice age.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Regrowth and Talisman of Ancestral Regrowth<br />
New regen spells. Seem to be fine as far as mana cost and amount regened goes. Regen spells in general seem to be rather useless. Best use seems to be balancing out weak ae dots. No issues specific to the spell tho.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Grace and Talisman of Ancestral Grace<br />
First really new spell so to speak. Agility being replaced by an avoidance mod seems like a great change IMO. Would be nice if spell still raised agility too for that occational person who still wants it but really rather minor issue.<br />
<br />
Wanvu's Focusing and Talisman of Wanvu <br />
Hps wise fairly straight forward and nice upgrade to previous focus spells. Seems to be currently setup to still buff str/dex and allow them to go over the cap. Instead it really should be the same added dmg and combat effects that str is and dex buffs should be. No reason to go half way and make us cast both Focus and what would have been the stat buff. Once again it would be a nice bonus if it added the new effect and the old stat buffs (not going over cap is fine that would be a bit much I'd imagine) to cover all bases but not required.<br />
<br />
Snarling Spirit <br />
Can't really tell much about the pet yet but I will say in general shaman pets need some major help. They do very poor dps and have hps, ac and defensive abilities so low that they die very easily. General requests based on previous pets.<br />
<br />
1) Make pets innately duel wield. We're still the only class that has to give thier pet 2 weapons to get them to duel wield. Even sk pets will innately duel wield.<br />
<br />
2) Much higher hps and defensive abilities. I don't expect a earth pet that can tank for me but it would be nice if the pet could survive more than one round of melee or an ae. My guess puts our pet hps at 2-3k hps unbuffed. Really needs to be 6K or so to have a viable chance of surviving in current content.<br />
<br />
3) Innate sow. Hey the damm thing is a spirit wolf after all.<br />
<br />
4) better dps. In part 1 will help with this some but even weapon equiped to duel wield our pet dps is extremely low.<br />
<br />
On a somewhat related issue please make up your mind if we are a pet class or not. We get all the pet aa's to use with our marginal pet but we don't get the pet focus's to help keep our pet at least remotely useful. It's not like allowing us to focus our pets is suddenly going to turn them in to mage pets. It's just going to help them keep up with changing content.<br />
<br />
Obkin's Mending <br />
Given the current precident that shaman heals are 47% of a clerics heal I expected to be disappointed by this spell and it didn't even live up to that. Our OoW heal drops to only 44% of that of a clerics heal and drops in efficiency. At the very least this spell needs to be upped by 80 hps to 1770 hps healed with out changing the mana cost currently on it to keep the current shaman vs cleric ratios in tact and keep our hps to mana ratio the same.<br />
<br />
Beyond that tho I feel the healing gap between clerics and both shaman and druids needs to be closed. On the shaman side that is going to take giving up some on our slow. That doesn't mean changing our spells in any way. It means more common and higher amounts of mitigation. Make our new heals much better and in those zone make every mob at least mitigate to the partially slowed level if not slightly slowed. Totally immune should still be reserved for boss type mobs tho. Game design issues would be much easier making slow less effective accross the board and balancing shaman would be much more viable. Sure we'd be pretty over powered in old content where slow is effective but hey honestly we already are. <br />
<br />
Crippling Spasm  <br />
Upgrade to cripple and nothing I see wrong with the spell it's self. If the aggro follows that of the cripple line I do expect it to be pretty high aggro tho. My problem is I get the strong feeling that this is going to be Sony's answer for hey shaman have another useful debuff. My problem with that is half the spell has no real effect on mobs as far as we can tell. AC debuff will help out the melee dps delt to the mob and the dex debuff will help decrease procs by the mobs including things like rampage and flurry. Agility and str tho haven't had any noticable effect on npcs that I'm aware of. One useful debuff (ac) and one situationally useful depending on the mob (dex) debuff isn't going to make this a major spell. Sure I'll probably cast it on named mobs but in normal group situations the benifits are few to small to justify it's use. Add something more substantial to the spell if you want us to see this as being a important new spell. Possible ideas include attack debuff, decrease duel wield/double attacks by mobs.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Vigor and Talisman of  Ancestral Vigor<br />
Upgrade to our sta spells. If lucy is reading the info right it increases sta by 75 but allows 40? of it go go above the cap. Stats buffs going above the cap isn't a bad idea to make them always contribute something but it does have issues still. Stats in general and sta can easily be confirmed, have diminising returns as they get higher. Going from 170 to 180 sta on any class adds more hps then going from 290 to 300 does even tho they are both 10 sta improvements. Past 255 sta seems to give half the hps that sta before it does. More hps is something that people almost always like but given the returns on sta at that point it really seems pretty sub par even if it all goes above the cap. Assuming a warrior with all aa's get something around 3 hps a sta past 255 (i think thats close, shaman are half that) sta buff would add 225 hps. For casters it would probably be close to 100hps added. Doesn't seem to bad until you compare it to the 1830 hps clerics new virtue buff adds or even the mere 700 hps that shaman buff adds or the amount of hps you can get on gear at this point. I'd much rather see the spell converted to some sort of time effect like Str and agility have been. Sheilding would be the obvious choice it seems altho stun resistant is another possibility.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Bulwark <br />
Upgrade to our ac spell. Since it doesn't stack with cleric ac buff or virtue so it's rarely used. Seems like a pretty normal upgrade tho. Nothing really to say. Straight forward upgrade to an unused spell.<br />
<br />
Pained Memory <br />
Exact same spell as our GoD ancient spell. All in all not a bad thing really. Nice upgrade to the cann line making it less of a hastle to use with out making it over powering. Ancient upgrade to the spell looks nice too.<br />
<br />
Obkin's Rain of Venom<br />
Pretty straight forward upgrade to our poison rain spell again. Unfortunately these spells seem to have some innate issues. Inefficient, difficult to use and seem to hard coded to have a high resist rate. Pretty much a pointless spell till issues with rains in general are addressed.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Strength  and Talisman of Ancestral Strength <br />
Nice spells. 5% more melee dmg rather than str of the cap is a nice improvement. Not gonna be a 5% dps improvement but it's something different and useful. Problem is druids get Lion's Strength 1 level before Ancestral Strength. It has the exact same effect and duration but shorter cast time and costs less mana. Typically speaking druids have had str buffs but they have always been behind the level of shaman's why is this one the same effect and slightly better spell in other ways?<br />
<br />
Ice Age <br />
Typical of shaman nukes. Slow casting, smaller and relatively ineffective in general. Not surprised by this spell but still fail to see why shaman should be so totally innept at nuking that even clerics and enchanters nuke significantly better. At least bring us up to parr with clerics and enchanters.<br />
<br />
Breath of Wanvu <br />
It's a disease dot. Nice upgrade from the previous version I guess but still a rather useless line of spells. 2.6 minute spells in the era of 30-45 seconds fights are worthless. ~4.5k dmg base dmg for 687 mana is descent if the spell ever had a chance to run threw.<br />
<br />
Probably the best thing that can be done with disease dots would be to add some useful debuff on to them like enchanter dots have. Ac debuff, attack debuff or maybe even something new like a spell casting slow or increased chance to fizzle/be interupted.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Vengeance <br />
Not a bad upgrade on the most useful of the dots. 30% increase in dmg and slightly more efficient at dealing it. Still a bit behind nuke dmg especially considering even this the fastest dot we get doesn't always last it's full duration. Wizards can do 40% more dmg with a single spell than our dot does in it's 30 seconds and they do it for the same efficiency. As pointed out by Chutoi necro's curse dot seems to have been updated to be more comparable to nukes in dps and efficiency department but the rest of thier dots and our dots don't seem to have gotten the same treatement.<br />
<br />
Now dots in general have problems. They seem relatively week in comparison to nukes since they often do less damage and are no more efficient than nukes but have to work over a duration. Additionally they seem to generate more aggro and are riskier to use. The exact cause of the aggro seems to be dificult to tell. My best guess is it's a variety of factors. Counters, especially poison counters, seem to generate a fair amount of aggro from just the counters. Some spells also seem to generate aggro because of additional debuffs included on them, ac debuffs for example. Part of it may be that it's just constantly applying aggro every tick and that is just that many more chances to end up on the top of the aggro list.  What ever the cause Dots are riskier to use and less effective than nukes and still have the disadvantage of working over time.<br />
<br />
Spiritual Serenity <br />
Big problem here. You know when you went and upped all the Heal over time spells so they where actually useful? Well you forgot this one. Cleric HoT seems to have the same issue. Following the scaling of previous HoTs this should be some were around 950hps a tick and 630 mana cost.<br />
<br />
Champion <br />
Nice upgrade but once again seemed to stop half way. Adding the improve dmg 10% is nice, especially with the normal capped stats included too, but why not throw combat effects and avoidance on there too?<br />
<br />
As a general thing on the spell line why does it have to be soo irritating to use. It's ok for enchanters to increase dps with haste by 68% and add 45 attack for 42 minutes with a group spell or a ranger to increase attack by 90 for 1 hour and 20 minutes with a group spell but 160 attack can only last 6 minutes with a 1 minute recast time and only be single target? There is nothing about this spell or spell line that justifies it being such a hastle to use. Increase the duration up to 30 minutes and give it a normal recast time at a minimum. A group version too would be nice.<br />
<br />
Blood of Obkin<br />
Pretty much the same story as Ancestral Vengeance. Descent upgrade to the spell but still has all the general dot issues and will most likely be particularly bad on aggro because of the poison counters, especially since those are doubled. <br />
<br />
I'm sure that this has ended up being a long post and I'm hopeful some of these are just obvious things sony hasn't gotten around to yet. Unfortunately release is coming ever nearer and I don't want these to be overlooked just because it wasn't brought to thier attention.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You've missed a couple of points, Tara.  The issues aren't entirely in an analysis of the spells themselves--it's also a comparative feature.  As you noted, we are actually weaker in healing compared to clerics.  With current OoW spells, we're at 44% of a cleric (not 47%), as you already noted.  That follows through with DoTs as well.  With OoW, we now heal less than 47% of a cleric, but we also DD exactly the same, and now DoT less than a necro by a substantial degree.  Compare the top 2 necro DoTs for example.  670 and 800 a tic.  Top 2 shaman DoTs are 546 and 429.  With only 2 DoTs, we're already 71 dps under a necro.  422/tic.<br />
<br />
There are more than enough problems with DoTs that giving us even weaker ones isn't good.  I'm guessing that clueless **** Rytan can't figure out how to fix agro, and figured he'd just lower our damage so we don't get agro as badly.<br />

We're getting comparatively weaker across the board . . . again.<br />

<br />
I have to say, what is so over powering with Shaman being able to put away our FA spells?!  Shaman are forever being bugged to keep FA running on as many Melee as possible and it's just a huge pain.  Shaman dont get as many spell gems as other classes so we should get the OoW spell slot(s) for free!<br />
<br />
When was the last time you took down Canni?  Or FA?  Or Slow?  Or Heal?  Or Q/Torp?<br />
<br />
It's been said but just running through this one more time<br />
*Canni4<br />
*FA<br />
*Nihl<br />
-open- (typically Nuke, Dot or haste if I'm the haster of the group because the spell once again is CRAP to single target everyone every 10 minutes)<br />
*Q<br />
*Tnargs<br />
*Malos<br />
-open-<br />
<br />
We can swap out TWO spell slots because if we take down any of the other spells we pretty much go to zero effectiveness.  Now on boss mobs when we are trying to debuff and then dot and then nuke... it takes sitting and medding through AEs banging you.<br />
<br />
BAH  Would be nice if FA were a long buff like everything else that we could pull up and buff the raid then swap to utility spells.  Not to mention on boss fights when we are trying to get set for the big fight and you have to continue casting FA up till the fight and during the fight or it drops from half the people you've been casting it on..... FA is a huge pain.  It wouldnt make Shaman over powered if they gave us a longer duration buff it would just *gasp* make the game more fun for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still think that no way no how should our Ancient spells start becoming Cannibalize upgrades.  <br />
<br />
Make it a nuke or a dot, but not a canni upgrade.  <br />
<br />
Same old story on our spell line up: Nukes need to do a little more a little faster, dots need to do a little more a little faster, heals needs to do a little more, and dog needs a more significant upgrade to be a viable companion.  Dog is increasingly becoming as valuable as the druid bear pet, and that bugs me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am somewhat satisfied, but in no way thrilled. We need 400 more on the heal, 500 more on the poison nuke, and 300 more on the curse. I SERIOUSLY do not see any of those things unbalancing us in any way when we are level 70 !!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hadn't actually looked at where necro dots where. Looking at them tho I wouldn't use the 800 a tick dot in the comparison since it's an ancient spell. Necros currently are the dot dps class and I'm fine with thier ancient spell giving them a bit of an edge in that area.<br />
<br />
Comparing other dots thier best curse dot is Dark Nightmare and is 670 a tick for 5 ticks compared to 546 a tick for 5 ticks for Ancestral Vengeance. The necro dot does ~22% more dmg but is notably more efficient since it actually costs less mana. Looking at the Ldon spells. Horror is 10 dmg more than bane for 20 less mana. So only 2% more damage and efficiency is closer.<br />
<br />
Comparing poison dots thier best is Chaos Venom 436 a tick and our is 429 a tick for Blood of Obkin. Only ~1.5% more dmg but about 10% cheaper mana cost. Looking at PoP spells their dot is 335 and ours is 320 so ~.5% difference and once again thiers is a bit more efficient at 35 mana cheaper.<br />
<br />
Looking at the poison dots I don't think there's anything really out of wack there. We're slightly less effective and a bit less efficient but not a drastic change between expansions.<br />
<br />
The curse dots on the other seem a bit out of wack. The necro dot seems much closer to where dots really should be but the shaman one seemed to have gotten missed in the process.<br />
<br />
Necros also have some dots we don't have direct comparisons to. The life tap dots or snares are more useful for thier other effects than strictly as dots but Pyre of Mori is pretty nice. At 435 a tick for 9 ticks it's only 15% more mana cost for ~30% more damage compared to the poison spell.</div></div><hr />

Note putting it in the code tags seems to prevent vb from adding a bunch of extra blank space in from the html in the table.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dark Nightmare and Pyre of Mori actually look pretty good in the dpm catergory altho the later really should be better since it lasts nearly twice as long as Dark Nightmare. Chaos Venom and necro's old dots and all the shaman dots are all pretty simular to the efficiency of wizard nukes.<br />
<br />
The wizard nuke is just a straight up volume upgrade while the necro ancient is a pretty sizable step backwords for dpm while a descent upgrade in dmg done. Probably figured before they changed Dark Nightmare.<br />
<br />
Really looking at it Dark Nightmare stands out as the one dot that was tuned more reasonably and given a bump to the damage dealt with out changing the mana cost making it a fairly efficient spell. Which given the nature of dots they should really be more efficient and more dmg in the single spell. Dark Nightmare has the efficiency and is larger than all but a wizzy's largest nuke. If this was used as the template so to speak for the other dots I would be very happy. The longer the dot the greater the dpm or total damage delt advantage should be IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can look at that table and start thinking that dots v. nukes aren't too different.  But what isn't factored into that table makes all the difference.<br />
<br />
Not only are our dots less mana efficient, cramped by long durations, and low on the damage, but they:<br />
<br />
-are plagued with agro problems.<br />
-have no innate resist modifications.<br />
-do not resist on a per tick basis.<br />
-suffer from poor itemization.<br />
-do not mirror the Fury of Magic AA necessary to keep them updated.<br />
<br />
Poison, disease, and curse counters should no longer determine agro.  Agro from dots should mirror agro from nukes that deal similar damage.  Making each tick resist on a per tick basis would not only alleviate inefficieny issues, but it would also allow us to drop an early dot on a mob, letting us make full use of our dot's duration.  But I think much of the difference in damage comes from the fact our AA for increasing dot damage is in no way comparable to corresponding AA for increasing nuke damage.  And this follows for itemization as well.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather see these spells than many of the spells SoE made for us:<br />
<br />
Panther Speed: (8 sec cast, 6 recast, 1 hour duration, 750 mana, group spell)<br />
Increase movement by 63%<br />
Increase attack by 35<br />
Form of the Kodiak: (8 sec cast, 12 recast, 2 hour 24 minute duration, 700 mana, self only)<br />
Illusion: Kodiak (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5411), no faction adjustment.<br />
Increase hitpoints by 22 per tick.<br />
Increase ac by 35.<br />
Increase all resists by 15.<br />
Increase hitpoints by 225.<br />
Champion: (change duration from 6.5 to 36 minutes, increase mana from 437 to 705, decrease recast from 60 to 30, group spell-not mgb'able)<br />
Add ferocity 2.<br />
Increase melee damage modifier by 10%.<br />
Increase Endurance by 15 per tick.<br />
Primal Roar: (.75 sec casting time, 1.5 minute duration grp spell, shaman cannot cast spells for 30 seconds, 300 mana, recast 4 minutes)<br />
Increase ac of all group members by 85.<br />
Allow for all melee stats of group members to exceed cap by 150.<br />
Increase damage dealing capabilities of melee group members by 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Honestly, I could care less about damage-per-mana. SOE has successfully made mana amounts a fairly trivial factor in almost every situation. Most classes are not even MILDLY limited by mana availability anymore. There is so much mana in this game now its sick. Its a non-factor. As a Shaman, in many group situations, I use a TON of mana each and every fight, but I RARELY go below 60. Yes, I am a class that has excellent self-mana regen, but still, mana is meaningless. The entire concept of a &quot;med break&quot; is completely obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I understand your point Blazz, however, I think the point of the comparison is that Dark Nightmare is vastly superior to our best, short-term dot.

So, we lose the unresistable, lose 2.5 secs cast, have another sec recast, shorter duration for being able to debuff an extra 55 PR. This spell is only going to be used on boss mobs, after malos/sinia. <br />
<br />
What's the point, really? We are now the kings of debuffing mobs PR?<br />
<br />
Speaking of malos, no upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The point of putrid decay is that it stacks with the malos/inia lines, ie you can debuff a mob by up to 125 PR if you wanted to. Potentially usefull on large targets if you want to nuke or dot. One other interesting thing about it: it checks against disease, so you might need to cast mal decay first in order to get it to stick (mal decay would be overwritten when it lands though). Seems a complicated way of doing things, allthough there are situations where you might want to use it I suppose. It does have a -200 resist adjust though, so it would be a hard to resist spell under most circumstances.<br />
<br />
For the new STA lines, keep in mind that the spell increases the STA cap by 75. In addition, increased levels should add a further 25 to the max, and there is an AA skill that allows you to raise it even further. All in all a level 70 with this buff should have a STA cap at 430. Even if they reach that with items, they will still need the buff to go past 355. For example, my warrior, who is decently equiped by most standards, would be at 347 STA if there were no cap. With the spell on and all the other factors maxed, she would reach 422, ie she would not be maxed. The vast majority of EQ players have less STA than Yella, so the spell should have a positive effect on allmost everyone. Even those who could reach the new max would still derive a hp benefit from the overbuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Man, I agree completely with howler on this one. An upgrade to our bear form line would be amazing, if implemented like he said. A lot of regen, some AC, hp resists, and maybe some mana regen. That would be a spell you would always see me using, especially since bear form is just a wasted buff slot now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A DPM table actually shows DoT's in their very best light. Although it was supposed to be the huge advantage that made up for their duration.<br />
<br />
It's really DPS that's the problem though. A wizard throttles up to full DPS as soon as they start casting and have superior AA and more available focii to increase the disparity (this also should be counted in real world DPM too). Given they're getting a stackable DD focus and the ability to drop 9K hate at a button press all DoT users are going to be left in the dust on any modern (read fast) encounter. This of course hits necro's harder because their `utility' role is stagnant (no increases in OOW).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is even going above the cap sta doesn't give a huge benifit anymore. <br />
<br />
Working the math down using magelo's hps formula we end up with sta past 255 ends up giving  sta x 3.25 x 1.22 or ~4 hps per sta for a warrior levle 65 warrior with maxed hps related aa's. So in best case situation 75 sta over the cap is gonna add an addition 300 hps. For a shaman it's gonna be half before you factor in the ND bonus and since we lack PE and the other options it's end up as Sta x 1.6 x 1.1 or 1.76 hps per sta or about 130 hps for us. Should end up being ~100 hps for an int caster. 100-300 hps really doesn't sound like a major buff at this point.<br />
<br />
Is it totally useless? Nope. Does going over the cap make it a great buff? Not in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If the stat cap does go up to 355 on stats with levels and further aa's it just means it's harder for the &quot;going over stat cap&quot; effect of the spell to even matter and the spell is essentially just the same old sta buff we've always had anyway. Not an entirely bad thing since sta is the most useful of the stat buffs but compared to what str and agility are being replaced with now it is weak.<br />
<br />
Even if the person is sta capped and the entire buff is going over the stat cap I don't expect the addition sta to add that much hps and to be marginal at best. Yeah everyone will ask for it but even in best case situation brells already adds more hps.<br />
<br />
All these calcualtions are also dependant on sony not putting in a second step down and making sta past 305 even less useful which is still possible.<br />
<br />
A sheilding effect or stun resistance would definitely be more useful and more desired than 300 extra hps at this point in the game. 300hps on a 10k+ tank just isn't a big deal at this point and for GoD and I'm assuming OoW raiding content thats a weak tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
since i play both classes, what is your problem with necros doing more damage?<br />
Everyone jumps on the DPS train, shamans never been a top notch DPS class, why become one now?<br />
When i play my shammy i often wish i had more DPS but our class is not designed to be one. Post POP every class thinks they need 10k HP buffed and do DPS like rogues or something.<br />
If you are unhappy with shammy DPS, go play a bard, im sure you will be loving your shammy again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">300 hp is still a significant pop and i'm pretty sure that people, particularly tanks, will still want it. To put it in context, how many people would choose a 100hp BP over a 400hp one? Not too many I bet  ;). The value of hp goes to survivability, and for that it is not so much the amount of hp you have but how close you reach to zero between heals in any particular fight. If your current margin for error is 2400 hp (20% on a 12k tank) 300hp is a big deal.<br />
<br />
A buff that gave shielding would be nice, but I think that would be more appropriate for an AC buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I guess what it boils down to for me is this (For Oow):<br />
<br />
Healing/Buffing:<br />
1.  If our new sta+new focus buff = druids new pot9 in terms of hp<br />
2.  If our new group heal over time+new fast heal = druid fast heal<br />
3.  if our new group heal will be mgb'able.<br />
<br />
Dmg: <br />
3.  If our new spell dmg + %increase in new FA'd melee dmg = at least new necro dmg<br />
<br />
Then I'll be happy enough to keep playing a shaman for now, but continue to play my alts till they are powerful enough to switch my main.<br />
<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, SOE additionally made FA group castable and increased its duration, decreased the casting time on ice nukes, gave us one instant life saving AA (transfer of life canni style or something), made our pet duel wield, made our group haste = single target haste, allowed targetable group shrink with confirm box, and for the heck of it gave all shaman the forage ability and more actually useful alchemy potions, then...<br />
<br />
then I'd continue to play a shaman.  Until then, I'm just leveling my necro, zerker (in case they get fixed:), and beastlord for the day I switch mains.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
If, on the other hand,<br />
<br />
1.  We continue to have the weakest fast heal and slow is still substantially mitigated everywhere...<br />
2.  Our HP buff is the weakest of all casters<br />
3.  Our stat buffs become worthless again as soon as people re-max all stats with new uber gear X<br />
4.  Our nukes are still the weakest of any caster<br />
5.  We have to carry a bag of friggin rusty daggers everywhere<br />
6.  Our group heal isn't mgb'able or has a long recast so its useless in groups and useless in raids (respectively)<br />
7.  Canni gets further degraded because of fast paced battles and &quot;big chunk&quot; ancient style canni is out of reach of most shaman.<br />
8.  Battles continue to be very short, so dots are useless or not fully effective<br />
9.  Our one slightly useful buff (FA) is also our most annoying buff due to recast time<br />
10.  etc..<br />
<br />
I'll probably be either A)  leaving EQ or B) switching mains <br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
I think the only reason I keep playing my shaman is I have so much time into him already... and in the back of my mind, I think, man, it can't keep getting worse can it??  EQ classes go through phases, with one being worse off for a while, then rebounding, etc.., and I have this hope that one day SOE will wake up and fix us.   The hope is still there, but with the overall feeling I'm getting about Oow, the hope is fading fast.  <br />
<br />
But I&quot;m not giving up yet, I&quot;ll wait and see what actually comes out, and probably once again upgrade my several accounts with the new expansion.  Time will tell I suppose, but I don't know how much patience I have left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would rather not have EVERYTHING upgraded.  Asking for hey, up this, and oh, up that, and make that last longer, and...<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to work.  It seems like they are trying, but still, every one of our main available roles seem lacking.  You got the very sad single target heal upgrade, pitiful nuke, and the same slowing problems you had in GoD (we have entered the era of mass slow mitigation :(  )<br />
<br />
And those lines remain inefficient.  Pick one, beef it up, I don't care anymore.  I'm just tired of having a lot of roles I can fill almost as well as an applicable hybrid, and a &quot;bad arse&quot; slow that is all but worthless in GoD and, assuming OOW will be GoD Version 2.0, OOW as well.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the OOW spells that are &quot;upgrades&quot; in lines for which GoD spells exist seem incredibly lacking.  Perhaps they are seen as replacements for the GoD spells, such as the incredibly moronic GoD ancient canni?<br />
<br />
Also, seems like we'll get a canni that is, basically, the same exact spell as the GoD one, only higher level and allegedly easier to obtain.  What this means is, once you have one, the other is useless (since they will make all canni's grey out when you cast one).  You don't see other classes with GoD ancient spells with carbon copy OOW versions.  This is an obvious sign that putting GoD Canni as an ANCIENT spell was a mistake, and such a high mistake that they have to cut, paste, and put it on an easier to attain scroll.<br />
<br />

Unless they radically change what they doing for shaman (which i losing faith rapidly that they can or will ) i wont be playing eq much mlonger.</div></div><hr />

Most of us dont want to become a &quot;top notch&quot; DPS class, but look at the current situation of Shaman and tell me we dont need SOMETHING more brought to the table, and DPS is one option. What pisses me off about the new necro vs shaman Curses is the HUGE gap in them, when there isnt such a big gap now. Why did Necros get a MASSIVE new curse while Shaman got a MINOR upgrade? This isnt right. If you wanna put Necros and shaman on a scale of 1-10 for DPS, and put Necros at 7 and Shaman at 2, thats fine, but with OoWs spells, Necros went to 8 and shaman went to 1. Sorry, thats not cutting it. Especially not when they didnt even give us an equal ratio heal as other expansions.</div></div><hr />

i smell envy here. lots of it. poor little shammys.<br />
<br />
instead of braggin for more DPS id suggest to make our debuffs stronger. Cripple (as it is) doesnt do ****. they should remake that spell line. there should be the same difference like a slowed / unslowed mob with crippled / uncrippled mob. I never hear MTs yell for cripple but sure for slow. Dont blame another class because SoE leaves shammys behind.<br />
<br />
Bohoohooo Necros got better dots then we did. So what? Does that make you any less usefull? i must have missed the part where Necros get the 90% unresistable slow spell.<br />
Little story: I go LFG as necro for hours, nada. I go LFG with my shammy or bard: bingo, i get a group. Usually even before i go LFG. See the difference?<br />
<br />
I play the most nerfed classes as necro, bard, monk and shammy. believe me i understand your anger / envy. But when you start whining what will happen? Will SoE give shammys new dots when you whine enough about necros? haha sure they will. Wake up man. Most likely they just nerf necros. would that help your DPS? Okay, it will make you feel better for a short period of time. Great taste of victory over the filthy necros.<br />
<br />
I had this **** when those dip****s on monkly business started whining about how superior bards are over monks with lull and fading memories blah blah. dont start this here with necs and shammys please. just get along and be happy that necros didnt get nerfed like  10000 times they already got nerfed or left behind.</div></div><hr />

Shaman can't do even decent dps because we (a) are mired in insane agro problems, and (b) basically lack the capability outside of DoTs.<br />
<br />
Shaman can't heal, apparently because we slow--in fact, our healing has actually be proportionately REDUCED in OoW, weakening us further.<br />
<br />
Shaman don't get a 90% slow.  Shaman don't get an unresistable slow.  Most of the time, shaman don't even get an unmitigated slow in harder content (most of OoW from reports).<br />
<br />
No one is asking for a nerf of necros.  They're asking for a increase for shaman.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, Pot, is quit YOUR bitching.  You may be getting groups with your shaman, but it's in trivial content if you are.  Probably BoT and ldons.<br />

you really are a necro arnt you? (and judging by your gear you never set foot in elemental planes let alone god!) 90% unresistable slow?  erm? wft are you taliking about?, as a shaman i now spend hours lfg too. it looks very much to me you have envy of shaman, but god know why, necro havent half the problems shaman have with slow mitigagtion? we are balanced around slow but have had that directly nerfed, 75% is our maxium slow btw and none are unresistable they are all very resistant, and now with all mobs mitagating it is no where near that now. pls you obvouisly have no idea dont post here unless you can get a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You can look at that table and start thinking that dots v. nukes aren't too different.  But what isn't factored into that table makes all the difference.<br />
<br />
Not only are our dots less mana efficient, cramped by long durations, and low on the damage, but they:<br />
<br />
-are plagued with agro problems.<br />
-have no innate resist modifications.<br />
-do not resist on a per tick basis.<br />
-suffer from poor itemization.<br />
-do not mirror the Fury of Magic AA necessary to keep them updated.<br />
<br />
Poison, disease, and curse counters should no longer determine agro.  Agro from dots should mirror agro from nukes that deal similar damage.  Making each tick resist on a per tick basis would not only alleviate inefficieny issues, but it would also allow us to drop an early dot on a mob, letting us make full use of our dot's duration.  But I think much of the difference in damage comes from the fact our AA for increasing dot damage is in no way comparable to corresponding AA for increasing nuke damage.  And this follows for itemization as well.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather see these spells than many of the spells SoE made for us:<br />
<br />
Panther Speed: (8 sec cast, 6 recast, 1 hour duration, 750 mana, group spell)<br />
Increase movement by 63%<br />
Increase attack by 35<br />
Form of the Kodiak: (8 sec cast, 12 recast, 2 hour 24 minute duration, 700 mana, self only)<br />
Illusion: Kodiak (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5411), no faction adjustment.<br />
Increase hitpoints by 22 per tick.<br />
Increase ac by 35.<br />
Increase all resists by 15.<br />
Increase hitpoints by 225.<br />
Champion: (change duration from 6.5 to 36 minutes, increase mana from 437 to 705, decrease recast from 60 to 30, group spell-not mgb'able)<br />
Add ferocity 2.<br />
Increase melee damage modifier by 10%.<br />
Increase Endurance by 15 per tick.<br />
Primal Roar: (.75 sec casting time, 1.5 minute duration grp spell, shaman cannot cast spells for 30 seconds, 300 mana, recast 4 minutes)<br />
Increase ac of all group members by 85.<br />
Allow for all melee stats of group members to exceed cap by 150.<br />
Increase damage dealing capabilities of melee group members by 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that's just me.<br />

Well, even at 40 overbuff, that would take max STA to 395, a value the vast majority of EQ players will fall short off, so it will still be used. A minimum of 40 extra STA at 4hp/STA is at least 160hp. That is not too far off from the 180hp Form of Endurance gives, and folks with the mask pretty much allways have that buff on. The acid test for any new spell is will or wont it be used, and this spell allmost certainly will be used by most people.</div></div><hr />

and yes we got one new spell 7% Damage avoidance and Share a New spell with Druids who get it before us.<br />

Poeple are right if you dont like dont play, i for one will now excerise that right, my billing end this cycle, but this time i wont restart it. I waited (i am generally opitmistic) for them to sort out this class, and as it really the only class i want to play (mainly cos exp is a grind now, there is no fun there any more), and getting level just doesnt bring any joy with the new spells (there is nothing i really looking forward too therefore it`s a chore to level cause you just trying to get to 70 as quick as possible ) all this is why eq will fail. Soe and in particular ryan have lost sight that you need something to work towards this expansion and god to a degree just dont.<br />

Clearly, you have no clue.  If shaman played in old era content then yes, you would have a valid point.  Today's fights are fast enough that diversity doesn't really matter much.  It's more of a crutch than a cure.  Classes that specialise in a nitch, be it clerics with healing, warriors with tanking, bards with pulling, or chanters with DPS are classers that are getting groups more easily when trying to but together &quot;ideal&quot; groups for challenging content.  Shaman are currently more suited to obsolete content or soloing.  If fights lasted 90 seconds then our class would be very impressive and often recruited because we'd have time to employ our diversity.<br />
<br />
As it stands, how much diversity can you use in 22 (the time left in most GoD trash fights after the mob is slowed) seconds when cast times for most of our remaining spells (DPS and debuffs) that make us diverse have cast times in the 6-8 second range.  Well, we can heal, but that druid you turned down for the group could be more mana effective healing than your slow was at mitigating that damage, and they can do more damage with less aggro, for less mana.</div></div><hr />

Hrmmm lets start with a precast of BoT on the MA to slow down the beating he/she is going to take in a moment.  Follow that up with a precast of malos by the time the mob gets into casting range.  If you've done this enough it ease enough to time the spell landing as the tank taskes his first swing.  Drop a slow, isn't not going to bounce due to the malos.  Nihli is fine and all but I'd still rather use the malos/turgur combo because of the lesser amount of aggro that turgur brings compared to nili.  Drop Bane next, it may not go full duration but if you are quick enough you can have it go full duration np.   Follow all that with some nukage if you want to add to dps or throw some spot heals down to lessen the load on the groups main healer.<br />
<br />
I do this every battle as I'm sure most of you do.  It seems like an awful lot of action for a 30 second battle.  Because of the effectivness of this routine it makes KT or any other zone an absolute joke.  I do not know what else you would expect to do during these battles as a shaman.   When in groups I know I am making an impact on the exp for the night.  I am making a night exp a very smooth and worry free experience for everyone in the group.  <br />
<br />
I think most people have lost sight of the fact that we are not a die hard priest comapred to the others in our priest class.  We are very much a utility class more than anything else.  Much the same way an enchanter is when comapared to the others in the caster class.  You all may look at this as a negetive thing but I look at it as its what makes us unique and sought after.<br />
<br />
Please don't reflame saying that I have no clue about our class or where we are headed as a class.  I've been on norrath making an impact on Prexus as long or longer than any other shaman on the server.  I play our class to its absolute maximum capability and I have never fealt for an instant that we are lacking in anything.  Then again I &quot;grew up&quot; as an iksar shaman in an all iksar environment.  No enc... no cleric... no druids... we were the CC, the manin healer, the slower, and dps.  Jbb, what the heck is that?  Despite not having the help of all these things I was still able to get groups, and make a large impact in the group.  And same thing when it came to the solo side of things.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed we are still the same class we have always been and SOE is going to keep it that way.  We have needed some fine tuning in the past, and members of this community did an absolutely awesome job of getting those points across to SOE.  I can not thank those responsible enough for their work.  I just get sooooooo sick of the constant comparisons to other classes that plagues this forum.  We are not druids.  We are not clerics.  We are something completely different and because of this we can't expect to be on the same level as the other classes and vice versa.  The druids are no where as diverse as us.  So it only makes sense to have the limited things they do for a group be a step beyond our when comparing numbers.  <br />
<br />
All I hear from this forum is we need more of this... we need more of that.  So far sony has done a good job of listening to our needs and taken care of a few adjustments.  Just be careful not to ask too much or you will see the generosity of the past dissapear and we may be retuned negetivly.</div></div><hr />

And the old timers remember when we walked past the meele were hopping up and down. We made a differance. In all the fights we were involved in. Sure there was a ton of button mashing. And tactical choices out the wazzoo. (Root parking as CC is something that should be required again.)<br />

Now. Single pulls are the norm. And that single monster has a good chance on a bad round of killing everyone. The only tactic that matters is does our DPS kill it before it kills us. <br />

Then rinse repeat 100 billion times to get a level that simply narrows the margin of error allowed before a wipe.<br />

We need to have the game use more varied challenges. Long fights. Short fights and variable ones between. And we need the damn tools to be viable again. Stackable Hot spell with clerics. That is at least half again the base duration as a clerics. So we are valuable in healing over time.  Buffs that matter. That have a duration that allows us to enjoy grouping. But not so long that the buff bot rises once again. (Ferine avatar should be changed to 30 minute base duration. Period. And add combat effects now. Rangers buff better than we do in meaningfull buffs now. Come on!)<br />
<br />
Disease buffs should include an innate cripple effect. And even a minor stackable Malo effect. The damage should be a bonus. But the debuff abilty should be useful overall as well. For the Unslowable fights we should have the ability to still make a contribution. <br />
<br />
Bane line should lose its recast completly. And have a innate -30 resist check. And be bumped up half again in potency.<br />
<br />
Poisen dots should lose the stupid aggro. And probably be bumped up half again in potency.<br />
<br />
We should have at least bare minimum in OoW a 2500 hp tnarqs eqilivent spell. Tanks are cresting 14000 hitpoints now. I would need to cast 10-12 Tnarqs to just heal them. Rediculous. <br />
<br />
I want what we once had. And while this is as effective as peeing into the wind, I will continue to voice my opinion o whomever will hear me. And continue to voice my disdain and lack of respect for the maintainers of this game we all play. Because they are poor  stewards and are killing the kingdom they rule.<br />

And that is the whole issue people have.<br />
We are the same the content is different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Follow that up with a precast of malos by the time the mob gets into casting range.<br />
should read after  the mob gets into casting range, but whatever.  In the the more open areas (wider halls etc ...) malos lands as the mob gets to camp and in tighter areas you can work around some geography limitations by coordinating with the puller.  Still, it's not like the mob arrives already debuffed.<br />
<br />
If you've done this enough it ease enough to time the spell landing as the tank taskes his first swing.  Drop a slow, isn't not going to bounce due to the malos.  Nihli is fine and all but I'd still rather use the malos/turgur combo because of the lesser amount of aggro that turgur brings compared to nili.  Drop Bane next, it may not go full duration but if you are quick enough you can have it go full duration np.   Follow all that with some nukage if you want to add to dps or throw some spot heals down to lessen the load on the groups main healer.<br />
OK, so how much damage are you mitigating on the remaining 25-26 seconds of the fight on a mob that mitigates your slow and is the amount critical to the cleric?  Will the tank die without slow?  Not likely.  Sure, you can say that if the cleric sucks, falls asleep, or goes AFK, THEN the slow is critical.  If that happens too often, get a new cleric.  Chances are a cleric will heal through without slow just fine on single pulls.  How many heals do you save the cleric with a mitigated slow for 25-26 seconds?  If it's less than 1 (on a mostly mitigated mob you are likely mitigating between 3000-4000 damage in a 30 second fight with a slow which is covered by a SINGLE CAST of holy light healing for over 4K with focus and AAs) then why are you slowing?<br />
<br />
What could any other class do in your position?  Your Bane and VS are not doing the damage of almost any other class and you'll likely get more resists than most, making for lost time and mana. Our heals are the worst of the priest types.<br />
<br />
It's not a matter the shamans suck, it's a problem that too many other classes are more effective in the current content.<br />
<br />
I am making an impact on the exp for the night.  I am making a night exp a very smooth and worry free experience for everyone in the group.<br />
No offense, but while technically, you are making a difference, how much of a difference could a chanter, bard, druid, 2nd cleric, BL, necro ... made had they played in your slot?  It's not personal since I don't know you, but it is a fact that we were not designed for this type of content and SoE has not nearly tuned us enough to be more effective in it.<br />
<br />
Much the same way an enchanter is when comapared to the others in the caster class.  You all may look at this as a negetive thing but I look at it as its what makes us unique and sought after.<br />
Enchanter's have unique abilities that are not mitigated.  They are specialists and FAR more sought after than any shaman for challenging content.<br />
<br />
Please don't reflame saying that I have no clue about our class or where we are headed as a class.<br />
Yup, I appologise for the personal attack, I was out of line.  I'm just tired of hearing the same old crap from people who should know better, much in the same way you're tired of the &quot;whining&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed we are still the same class we have always been and SOE is going to keep it that way.  We have needed some fine tuning in the past, and members of this community did an absolutely awesome job of getting those points across to SOE.<br />
We haven't changed, the content has, that's the problem.  We were not designed for short fights against mobs that weaken our only line of spells that we are actually the best at casting (slow).<br />
<br />
I just get sooooooo sick of the constant comparisons to other classes that plagues this forum.  We are not druids.  We are not clerics.  We are something completely different and because of this we can't expect to be on the same level as the other classes and vice versa.  The druids are no where as diverse as us.  So it only makes sense to have the limited things they do for a group be a step beyond our when comparing numbers.<br />
I don't buy this.  It's a computer game, it's all about numbers.  When most classes can fill the spot you take in a group better than you can under most circumstances for challenging content, you should be thinking something is wrong.<br />
<br />
All I hear from this forum is we need more of this... we need more of that.<br />
see my point above.<br />
<br />
So far sony has done a good job of listening to our needs and taken care of a few adjustments.<br />
And when did take care of this?  What exactly did they do?  They upped our regen line, upped our HoT line, and brought our heals up to 47% of those of the cleric (this BTW was not an adjustment as it was correcting a stated oversight by the SoE dev team in maintaining the priest healing %'s established back in Kunark).  Only the HoT improvement was of any real use and the re-tune of some GoD content helped ALL classes, not just us.  This doesn't balance us, it's suppossed to placate us.  SoE hasn't listened, they showed us a shiney object and stole our wallets.<br />
<br />
Just be careful not to ask too much or you will see the generosity of the past dissapear and we may be retuned negetivly.<br />
I hear this a few times, but really, what else could they do that wouldn't impact other classes and hurt the game more?  This is one area where our diversity actually protects us ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clerics, druids, and Shaman, are, however, all priests.  We should all have means at our disposal that keep someone alive.  Our ability to keep someone alive has, in the past, been balanced around slow.  Slow has been mitigated in several ways over the last couple expansions, and our healing has not caught up.  <br />
<br />
While yes, we bring other utility to a group beside slow and heals, so do Druids and Clerics. The major difference is, the Cleric and Druid abilities continue to function at full strength, while our main utility, slow, does not.  Our secondary benefits, like stat buffs, cripple, and dps, have also fallen behind.  <br />
<br />
While I can't expect to do everything a cleric or druid can do, I should be able to expect that the combination of my spells/abilities roughly equal the same benefit as the combination of a cleric or druids spells/abilties.<br />
<br />
With the weakest fast heal, mitigated or immune slows, worthless buffs, and the weakest nukes of any caster class, I certainly do have a right to complain right now.  <br />
<br />
Shaman that get KT groups do provide beneift to that group, however, other group makeups are still better.  We don't provide anything that is &quot;better&quot; than other classes, period.  <br />
<br />
I beg all you shaman that are calling us &quot;whiners&quot; to name ONE FRIGGIN THING we do better than a competing class right now.<br />
<br />
I can think of one thing.  5% greater slow than an enchanter.  Would you rather have 75% slow on a mitigated 30 second battle, or 70% slow on a 15 second battle because of  a charm pet?<br />
<br />
Sure, technically we can take the place of both the backup healer and the slower in a group (so perhaps we knock out the enc + druid) freeing up a slot for more dps or utility.  Well... so what did we just gain here?  Its much easier to see what we just lost.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, we lost clarity.  We lost a charm pet.  We lost better nukes and evac and ports.  We lost snare.  We lost an attack debuff which &gt; cripple.  We lost more mana regen and hp with pot9. <br />
<br />
What did we gain again by taking the place of the druid and enc?  Well, we freed up one more slot for most probably another melee.   Not having C means you don't want a caster.  Not having C means the cleric is probably low mana from time to time.  So, 5% greater slow + one additional melee.  Thats what a shaman usually brings.  Is that a benefit?  Well yeah..  but compare that to what the group lost, and overall, the group is worse off, not better off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A big bump for my evil twin Blazz although we really have to be balanced against the other classes in single group encounters.  But, the solution is very simple for raiding - bigger faster casting nukes.  There we go - we are balanced for raiding.<br />
<br />
The above improved nukes would also help our getting single group content.  As the game progresses so do my opinions on how to balance Shaman given the new content.  It seems to me that if we have the above improvements to DD's and the following items we are GTG.<br />
<br />
1) Increase FA duration to 15 min<br />
2) Make the ancient canny non-ancient. Super nuke should have been our ancient spell (like clerics).<br />
3) Make group haste the same potency as single target<br />
4) Make puppy innately duel wield and allow pet focus items<br />
5) Reduce malos recast to 5 seconds<br />
6) Negative resist modifier (-50?) on our AA root VP<br />
7) Additional defensive aa's (lacking in beta Omens)<br />
<br />
THATS IT!!!!! Sure I would like better healing, dot agro reduction, etc. but this is the real list IMHO and a lot less than we are asking for in the big 10.<br />

Woe is me.<br />

<br />
Shaman can't do even decent dps because we (a) are mired in insane agro problems, and (b) basically lack the capability outside of DoTs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you think that necs have less aggro problems? i think maybe you should play one and find out for yourself.<br />
<br />
No one is asking for a nerf of necros.  They're asking for a increase for shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
read my post again. When enough shamans (wether they are right or not) whine that Necs have better dots, SoE will not give you any new, but nerf necs. Its been like that since EQ came out. They call it balancing<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line, Pot, is quit YOUR bitching.  You may be getting groups with your shaman, but it's in trivial content if you are.  Probably BoT and ldons.<br />
<br />
<br />
that hurts. Not. i dont whine all the time that my class is being left behind and is so poorly balanced.<br />

<br />
May I introduce you to the term &quot;class balancing&quot;? Classes are supposed to be balanced versus the other classes, thus you need to take into account what X class can do. Then, when classes are balanced, the Devs are supposed to create content based on what the classes are capable of.<br />
<br />
Fact is that Shamans are getting left behind in the DoT department for no reason, since aggro is already a harsh limitation. IF you compared Shamans to Necros pre-Omens you'd notice, that Shamans weren't too far behind Necros DPS wise(Necros having more variety, though) on paper. <br />
In reality, however, Necros are considered a DPS class, while Shamans are the lowest DPS class in game. The reasons for this is the missing resist modifier on Shaman DoTs and the fact that Shamans have no way of handling the aggro from the broken DoT code.<br />
<br />
With Omens, for whatever reason(Rytan is a ****tard is a safe bet imo), Necros, who in reality already are the masters of DoT dps by far, gain even more ground due to their 2 brand new curse DoTs that scale unproportionally to the LDoN DoTs compared to the Shaman's curse line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I realy hope they upgrade the dmg from the dots to almost necro lvl. <br />
The problem is that debuffs have lost in power and dps is so much better to have now thats becouse mobs have low hp vs dps now. A normal mob last around 30-60 sec depending on group. <br />
<br />
So what i realy think we nead is upgraded heal or dps mybe dont nead a better nuke but a group buff that boost dmg from all in group.<br />
<br />
Dmg buff (8 sec cast 800 mana 60 recast 30 min duration)<br />
Nuke focus 10-20%<br />
Dot focus 10-20%<br />
melee dmg 10%<br />
Group only and only if you stay in group with shaman.<br />
<br />
That whould give uss the dps boost we nead for groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">There are many good points and analysises, so I wont add anything which may repeat, what is already being said. One thing though is clear - we WILL get weaker again, any other class with whom we have been comparing shaman over the time will actually get an upgrade, while our so-called &quot;upgrades&quot; are too weak and too mild to really upgrade anything, and instead weaken us. We used to be very viable DoT class in the past, on par literally with necros, or with very little gap. Over the time the gap has increased and increased, and as can be seen, still increases. Even our buffs frankly suck, the evasion bonus or damage bonus matters little, since EVERY other class who has such similar stat spells gets these skill bonuses as well. So we don't even get anything unique to actually make us &quot;King of the Buffing&quot;. Even new FA line upgrade, which could have been made into something useful, close to BST Ferocity line, still sucks.<br />

Weee, another expansion to push us further down. Though, who cares, new games are out soon anyway and meanwhile I just level up a BST or something...</div></div><hr />

The problem with this school of thinking is, that content will usually be designed based on what the top classes can do(the damage mobs dish out is based on what a Cleric can heal, not a shaman). <br />
<br />
If, and considering we are talking about SoE everything's possible, content would not be designed to be a challenge for the &quot;specialists&quot;(i.e. NPC's doing damage, so that even a Shaman can keep up the tank), then it will be trivial for them.(After all a Shaman only heals for 44.8% of what a Cleric can, disregarding any special abilities Clerics have on top of that like Divine Arbitration etc.)</div></div><hr />

So there goes one of your &quot;how to play a perfect shaman&quot; points. I supposed if your healing is druid/shaman or shaman/shaman for the group, it might help some, but it doesn't change the fact that our blast heals are slow casting and terribly inefficient.
