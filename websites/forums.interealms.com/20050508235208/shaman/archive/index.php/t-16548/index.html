<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry I think this is so new that there does not seem to be another thread about this.<br />
<br />
I have my Adventure Stone in my PoP Charm.  I figured since they both can be replaced I would tinker with these two.  I found the bird bath and the augmentation went as advertised, but I have hear at least 5 different version of how this Adventure Stone is supposed to gain in power.<br />
<br />
I have heard that:<br />
<br />
You have to get five bits of lore from one theme.  You get one bit of lore for every 2 wins in a theme and you must hail an NPC in the camp of that theme.  I have 7 wins in MM and I have notice nothing from hailing the NPCs in BB.<br />
<br />
I have heard that you must have 2 wins per theme to get the first upgrade to adventure stone.<br />
<br />
I have heard that you can mix and match wins for lore after your first 10 wins.  I am assuming this has to be 10 at one theme or 2 at each since I have had not mention of lore or stories from any NPCs.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for clearing up my confussion.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It only works with one of the NPCs at each camp. You will receive text about &quot;new information&quot; or something like that, for every two wins within that theme. You must complete 10 of a single theme before you'll see an upgrade to the charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Every 2 times you win an adventure at a certain theme, hail the Adventurestone person there and you will get a valuable piece of information. after 5 pieces of info the stone improves. You will get a msg telling you the stone has improved.<br />
<br />
Unsure about the multi-camp thing since I have been trying to get Bane, and solely hunting in Rujarkian (got it today)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone have a list of the Adventure Stone NPC?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">this is how i understand it correct me if im wrong:<br />
<br />
every 5 pieces of info (10 missions success basically) it gains 2hp/mana.<br />
<br />
this can be done 10 times at each camp.<br />
<br />
for a total for 50 times from all 5 camps.<br />
<br />
so if you actually max it out it would have 100hp/mana, and i heard for every 10hp/mana aquired it also gets +1 all stats...so its +10 all stats and the 100hp/mana at max capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">awww man... I have 35 wins.. hailed the npc once<br />
<br />
thats kinda dumb really... quite easy to forget to hail after every 2 wins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can forget to hail for as much as you want, and the game will remember your # of wins.. I hadnt ever hailed the npc at rujark and have 9 wins there.. was able to get &quot;new information&quot; several times by hailing him several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The NPCs in the camps are easy to find. They are in the wayfarer camps, they are not the magi, and they do not have other functions.<br />
<br />
That eliminates the raid recruiters, adventure recruiters, adventure merchants, soulbinder, and magus. Should only leave a handful of NPCs at the camp. Hail them all. You know the right one when you get a message that says either you gain new information, or you need to adventure for more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just go back to the camps you didnt get all your hails done at, find the NPC that does that, and hail them until they tell you that you need to adventure more. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, they will also tell you to go talk to other NPCs that are NOT located in the camps. Normally, those NPCs are located in an adjacent zone, and you pretty much need a tracker to find them the first time. One of these is in WFP, near the PoK book.</div></div><hr />
