<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cailte Canmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Euro guild wiped, dear lord my guild MIGHT have a shot at him for once :p<br />
I take it they wiped to Emp, if so Fake Blood will spawn in 4hrs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, the Loot giving Blood won't respawn for a week, but a Lootless version with a slightly different name will spawn pretty soon.   Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bleh another euro guild showed and got it.<br />
<br />
I will never understand how a server where most people are in the US can have all the best mobs monopolized by euro guilds.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Happens to us all the time.. and it's even worse than normal because we're a PST guild :(<br />
<br />
Better luck next time :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this happens on lots of servers, ssra and VT are very very euro friendly.<br />
<br />
Stick with it, you'll get him eventually, they can't block you forever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Blood of Ssra. No need to be vague.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blood of Ssra. No need to be vague.<br />
<br />
wasnt vague at all, what other &quot;Blood&quot; would any guild be racing another guild for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wasnt vague at all, what other &quot;Blood&quot; would any guild be racing another guild for.<br />
<br />
I hear Emp in seb is pretty hotly contested these days :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">sigh.. lets recap.  Last week emp pops late at night and euro's get him, this week he pops at night again and euro's get him. 3 days later a patch and he pops again for the euros's and theyg et him.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else seeing a freaking pattern here?<br />
<br />
<br />
/sigh this is really getting frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">this has been happening for what? 2+ years now, get used to it, get over it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thats what makes it even harder though, its such a long existing issue =\<br />
<br />
we should like ban together and make a petition or a multi forum thread or something. can put it on the druid forum where soe will see it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">several leading edge guilds complained repeatedly in their updates and forums for quite a while, it's not going to get changed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh my guild leader /feedbacked about it and actually got a response via email according to a post on our boards; they told him &quot;we'll look into it but it sounds more like a bitter guild complex than a bug&quot;. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Try a server that isnt as cutthroat. VT is on a rotation on xev.<br />
<br />
*edit speeeeling*<br />
<br />
but that definatly sounds like it sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">intresting, rotation, man would that take some political skills on my server lol<br />
<br />
But hey, it might be worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">heh, good luck convincing a euro guild to give up free loots to share them half the time on a rot...  just keep at it and it'll spawn on your time eventually.  it's very very annoying but they can't keep you out forever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If Euro guilds put mobs on their time, it's their game unless your guild resets the spawn timer or a server crash runs your way lol. That is the way of the game.</div></div><hr />
