<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many shaman here have completed hard adventures?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is because right now completing a hard adventure seems to be at the edge of our DPS capability WITHOUT bringing my shaman.<br />
<br />
Winnning group makeup (All level 65 with 100+ AAs):  Bard/Enchanter, Beastlord, Paladin/Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard.<br />
<br />
Our gear is a mix of Cazic/Dozekar/BOT Towers (See my magelo for typical gear).<br />
<br />
It certainly looks to me like swapping the beastlord for the shaman in the above group would be a mistake.  We generally do not have a lot of extra time after completing a hard mission.  And I don't think my shaman can do comparable DPS to a well equipped beastlord.  There are plenty of threads talking about the DPS of our various spells, but when you factor in time for slowing/maloing mobs (resists, etc.) the theoretical numbers get degraded (Max 110 DPS for velium strike, probably closer to 50% of that over the course of a fight when you consider other tasks, so 55 DPS + say 25 DPS for the pet, total of 75 DPS).  Add to that the fact that the BL can tank the mobs better than my shaman when he gets slow aggro, which translates to less mana used by the cleric and more mana for a cleric nuke per fight.<br />
<br />
So my questions are:  How many shaman here regularly participate in hard missions AND win?  What does your group makeup look like?  And what level gear does your group have?<br />
<br />
From the &lt;a href = &quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16409&amp;highlight=hard+adventure&quot;&gt;other thread&lt;/a&gt; that answered some of my questions, the shaman that had 5k+ unbuffed hitpoints was able to handle a hard mission no problem (that was fairly high end gear, which probably translates to high end gear in the rest of the group), there was another shaman there with 3500 hps unbuffed that did ok as well.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Keeping a summary here of gear level and success rate.<br />
<br />
5k+ hps and mostly successful: 2<br />
2k hps and successful once (rest of group EP equipped): 1</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've completed a hard Miragul's adventure. <br />
<br />
We had Ranger 65, Bard 65, Warrior 65, Cleric 65, Enchanter 65, Shaman 65 (me). Everyone in the group belonged to the same guild and were equipped with Elemental level equipment. My own equipment is a mix of Thurg/SS armor with a few minor other pieces thrown in that brings me to 2200 or so HP and 1000AC unbuffed. I have nearly all my spells up to 65 (no Malo/Malos). I have none of my 65 spells.<br />
<br />
We were able to complete a slaughter mission with 54 as the target number with a little over 30 min left on the clock. Most pulls were 2-3 mobs with the occasional 4 mob thrown in. I had no trouble slowing without malo/malos and usually before the enchanter had time to Tash. The few times I got the mobs attention after a resist I was able to stand up long enough to slow and to heal myself afterward.<br />
<br />
We did end up wiping to a 7 mob pull while attempting to reach a named that the ranger saw on track, but it was well after we had won. I'd love to do this again, but it seems I can never find a group that can handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So everyone else was in elemental gear Kraaga?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can win hard with most groups, but it is just not worth the time and effort for the AP atm.<br />
<br />
Yeah.  I realize that.  Unfortunately I can't hardly stand to do regular missions anymore because they have so little challenge to a ghetto raid equipped group.  My biggest problem is that there isn't a middle difficulty level in LDoN.<br />
<br />
And oddly enough, the loot that drops from the nameds in the hard missions is actually a pretty decent upgrade for some of us, but wouldn't be any kind of an upgrade for raid equipped players (90 hitpoint arms and 90 hitpoint helms for example).  So for us the reward is actually better than the normal missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
I've failed one hard adventure (rescue type).  If we had tried a slaughter, assassinate, or collection type adventure I believe we would have won.  It was also two of the group's very first Adventure, so the learning curve factor also affected us.<br />
<br />
Our group was comprised of 4 people in the EP, one Velious equipped caster, and myself (I was at about 3400 hp unbuffed at that time) in a mixed bag of gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=642761) that isn't uber but is pretty good I think for someone not in the EP.  We made several mistakes (not binding nearby was a critical mistake, as well as taking rezzes to save time instead of rezzing afterwards) that cost us too much time.  I do not believe my DPS (or lack thereof) to have been a key factor in our failure.<br />
<br />
When the reward level is upped for winning Hard adventures, I plan on trying again with some former guildmates that also aren't in the EP.  Until that time, I have no intention of trying High risk adventures (nor raids).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I heard that on test server hard level completions are going to give about 150 points.....what do they give now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">76 points atm.<br />
<br />
I have done 12 hard missions and failed two of them due to some silly mistake, they aren't hard at all with good gear and a balanced group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've completed a hard mission for collection.  It wasn't that hard with decent players along.  Hard level bosses seem to be a bit on the hard side tho.  I did this one mission where we pulled the boss to zone and tried to kill her there.  She gated, however, and came back with friends to hose us.  That was fun.  I recommend killing boss mobs at their spawn, or at least bringing fast nukage at the end of the fight, last 10% or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Completed 3 hard missions so far, because I lack time to do them.<br />
<br />
Miraguls was slaughter, finished with 20 min on clock, no EP flagged/geared people, regular guildmates.<br />
<br />
MM was collection and rescue, collection finished with 1 min on the clock, rescue with 10 mintues on clock.<br />
<br />
Was it worth it for the extra 20 points?  Depends, one ring almost comparable to Ring of destruction dropped in MM, one on each hard setting.  Dropped 7 augments, 6 for stat boots, 1 for mr (i won luckily) all +7.  One droppable trueborn, dagger of the dark.  About it.<br />
<br />
My view is the hard missions just are not worth it.  I can probably solo a normal mode slaughter and get down at least 20 mobs by dot rotting, if C5/PoT9 and a bit more FT I might be able to down 40 or so, normal mode is a joke.  Hard mode is a semi challenge.<br />
<br />
Go Normal mode if you like being bored, go hard mode if you like challenge (like me).<br />
<br />
Normal slaughter yields the most points overall in record time, thats the way to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dartanian - both Gwain and I have completed Hard Adventures with our guild.  We have gear on the same level as you do.<br />
<br />
I completed my hard adventure pretty easily with warrior, shaman, cleric, bard, rog, wizard. (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=180030&amp;postcount=32)  <br />
<br />
Gwain beat his hard adventure with cleric, cleric, monk, shaman, ranger, bard. (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=180172&amp;postcount=8)<br />
<br />
I feel like I contribute plenty of DPS from nukes, pet, FA and my contributions to healing help as well.  <br />
<br />
I've revised my opinion on Collection missions since my first post that I linked.  If you can avoid it, don't do collection.  It can screw you by no fault of your own, just by the randomness of drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Completed hard ones in guk and MM, didnt even bother to do hard until they fix so you get more points awarded from it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The hard I done, were 1 collect and 1 kill boss and we didnt get a single drop from either of these.. We did not look for mininameds as we were competing against the clock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    So it's easy to slow them without malos(neither tashan) ? When i have try one ,i got resist whit tash (and no malos) and chanter get extreme resist on pacify . May be  dungeon have very different resist rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Strom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dartanian FYI,<br />
<br />
I've only done like 8 missions - but most were on Hard - no fails.<br />
<br />
Group was PAL, WAR, MNK or WIZ, CLR, ENC, SHM.<br />
<br />
Most done with buckets of time to spare. But those groupmates were very well equipped guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Salorm if i had your gear I would just power through normal level as well.  As Gwain said, we do them because the item drops (stuff like 100hp, 90mana rings) are upgrades for our gear.  :)<br />
<br />
I just got done doing another hard mission tonight.  Hard in Takish seemed easier than Hard in Mistmore.  We scored a 95hp, 75 mana earring with an innate 2pt DS for melee classes and a couple +7 resist augs.  War, bard, shm, ranger, monk, cleric all 65 and all of us over 100aa though, one of the strongest groups my guild could put together and we finished 25 mins ahead of schedule in a slaughter mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you are going for points stay away from collection missions!  Sucks depending on the SOE random number generator.  Sure they can go fast.  They can also go slow.  Bad streaks suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 We passed it with about 3 minutes to spare, it was a slaughter mission. <br />
<br />
Not sure what the other guys were wearing for gear, but the only piece of NoDrop I have is my 8th shawl, everything else I bought in the bazaar. (Ornate boots, helm, and tunic too). Sitting around 4920hp buffed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just thought I'd dig this up, just to give some non elemental players some hope for hard missions ;)<br />
<br />
We tried two hard missions tonight, both in Ruj.<br />
<br />
Group was all 65 leader/officers of my guild so pretty well equipped for level of the game - we have no emp/VT, and are in Sol Ro of pop.<br />
<br />
Make up was : Enchanter, Paladin, Rogue, Ranger, Cleric , Shaman.<br />
<br />
Lots of aa between the group, all have class title, and decent aa ( I'm middle of group aa wise at 173). Everyone is also used to hunting together, and can second guess each other pretty well, which is what helps us most; in fact it was the exact same group that we beat Trial of flame with now I think of it ;)<br />
<br />
First mission was assasinate, we got to boss in just under an hour, Boss fight itself wasn't too bad (slowed first time after malos/tash), I spent all my time keeping Q on paladin and tnargs to keep him toppped up between CH's, took us a few mins to kill it ;) I'd estimate Overseer sort of hp with slowable tier2 boss melee, was too busy mashing Tnargs/canni to look more closely.<br />
<br />
Second mission was kill 60 orcs. We knew we could kill a standard orc in under a minute, so as long as we kept things flowing smoothly we could probably win. We kept a smooth fast pace up, ranger an enchanter working the pulls, won with 20mins to spare.<br />
<br />
Overall I use very different tactics and spell lay out. normal mode I can win comfortably with any manner of oddball guild groups (only thing I insist on is snare, and I'm 20-0 on normal). I just use AE slow, 2 rains and Q/Tnargs all over.<br />
<br />
Whereas to win hard, we had a much more 'convential' solid group, I just used velium strike as only DPS slot, and setlled for FA/utility over damage, no dots/rains due to quantity of mezzed mobs. I'd keep Q up pretty much always on paladin to smooth CH's. The pace is high tempo, but the main thing we found that won it was keeping calm and not panicing ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Going to bump this, myself.<br />
<br />
Did a Deepest Guk mass-kill mission on Normal this weekend (58 mobs in 90 minutes).  65 warrior, 65 monk, 65 cleric, 65 chanter, 65 necro and 63 shaman(me); VT gear and some pre-Time gear on them, crap on me.  The warrior and monk went LD about 20 minutes into the crawl, the remaining four of us finished it off with roughly 10 minutes to spare.  I slowed, I dotted, I tanked, was a good for me. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just thought I'd add my experience in Hard just to show you don't need uber equipment or even a CC class to win. <br />
<br />
I'm 2-0 in Hard mission, one was a MM group with pally MT, Druid, Monk, Necro CC, Shm (me), Rogue.  We won with time to spare.<br />
I did a Hard last night in EC with a Warrior, Cleric, Druid, Shm, Monk, Wizard.   Monk did fine FD-pulling we rarely had more than a single pull, some 2 pulls where monk off tanked or root parked.  Was an assassinate mission, we won with 10 minutes left.  In this group the only person to have any elemental drops was myself.</div></div><hr />
