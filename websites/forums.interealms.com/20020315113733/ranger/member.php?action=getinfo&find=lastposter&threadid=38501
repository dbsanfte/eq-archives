<!-- Database error in vBulletin 2.2.2:

Invalid SQL: SELECT thread.title,thread.threadid,thread.forumid,postid,post.dateline FROM post,thread WHERE thread.threadid=post.threadid AND thread.visible = 1 AND post.userid='14680' ORDER BY post.dateline DESC LIMIT 20
mysql error: The SELECT would examine too many records and probably take a very long time. Check your WHERE and use SET OPTION SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1 if the SELECT is ok

mysql error number: 1104
