(though after reading their message board flames, I wonder who I could safely ask for advice ... *wink*) ... I'd also considered a monk ... Hm ... *muses*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Runhhhhh?  I play the SHAMAN when I want to solo.  My primary alt is a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forget Monk. You'll end up trying to get equipment for him with your Shaman main. Trust me - even with the new disciplines - it won't matter.<br />
<br />
Mage? &quot;Hi, we're Sony. Watch us over-react.&quot; To a point Mages are fun. <br />
<br />
MY recommendations?<br />
<br />
Necro or Bard. In that order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm considering starting another and thinking about SK or Cleric. I have a Beastie and Warrior now. Of those two I like the Warrior the most. It gets to just beat stuff up and not worry about all the spells every few lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Runhhhhh?  I play the SHAMAN when I want to solo.  My primary alt is a cleric.<br />
<br />
<br />
What HE said.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for something less group-dependant than a shaman, try a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you need to play a enchanter or a cleric because coming from a &quot;needed class&quot; you will quickly lose interest LFG =)  Just make your first instinct its useally the best.<br />
<br />
bard = to much work plus their ghey<br />
necro = anti-social<br />
warrior = press Q<br />
rogue = press Q<br />
Pally = press Q<br />
SK = pres.. you get the idea<br />
BL = solo everything .. or at least tell everyone you did<br />
mage = /pet attack .. run away<br />
<br />
(p.s. before you all start crying I was trying to be funny)<br />
Cleric = 5 tells a minute while LFG<br />
Chanter  = 5 tells a minute while LFG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are looking for an alt that is not group dependant then casters are about the only option.  Most melees cant solo their way out of a wet paper sack post 20.<br />
<br />
My list:<br />
Necro<br />
Druid<br />
Mage<br />
Bard <br />
Beastlord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had loads of fun with my alt bard.  Easy soloing, pretty easy to get groups (although now their lull is nerfed, ldon pulling is a little harder, but easily learnable).  Leveled to 65 and got 80aa's in around 5 months (time includes playing shaman in end game raiding guild).  Go go swarm/chant kiting and Elemental exp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have several alts, all played to respectable levels, including a ranger, rogue, Sk, Monk, beastlord, wizard, bard, and even have a necro and a druid socked away.<br />
They all have their places and all are fun.....just in general though I find that if you want to group you need to play one of the golden grouping classes, bards, clerics, chanters. <br />
If your looking for solo time, go necro, hands down the easiest class to solo that their is.<br />
That being said, I love the heck out of my bard, I have a blast playing him in LDON and it fun as its a totally different play style.<br />
Clerics have too much &quot;grab an assful of ground&quot; time for me as do wizards (mine has collected dust for 4 expansions now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For me it was Necro or SK. Wizzy can be fun if you can get them to 46 ( c3 ) fast, they level VERY fast so there is alot of return for the work you put in. They are high DPS and also welcome in a group for that and their port abilities. Bards are great is you can handle the finger work, i got mine to 30 solo and started grouping and realized the work involved negated all the fun of the class, solo they are fun though. Druids are ok, but as a shaman its kinda redundent and the trade off from what you lose fromt he shamn and gain as a druid isnt enough i think, from a shaman perspective i mean.<br />
<br />
The rest of the classes are fun but just not as good of soloers.  The mage/necro you can solo to 65 pretty easily if you want, the rest are a lil tougher, though not impossible ofcourse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I recently started into a ranger alt and I am having a blast playing him.  The archery adds a whole new aspect to the melee realm.  Right from the get go I started into the fletching and have enjoyed every seconds of it.  With fletching you can emmediatly see the return of all your hard work, which keeps me motivated to keep tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
I also like the fact that rangers get the root line because I can apply my root parking skills that I learned as a shaman.  Heck, I can root park better than most enc's can mez.<br />
<br />
As twinking goes, just grab an iksar cerimonial BP and a couple weapons and get busy.  Melee twinks are by far the easiest to enjoy.  All the caster classes are bound by their mana and there isnt squat you can do to change that.  Getting the low level crack spells is very much a waste of time since their durations are so quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally my fav is also ranger. I just loooove using a bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bards are great is you can handle the finger work, i got mine to 30 solo and started grouping and realized the work involved negated all the fun of the class, solo they are fun though.<br />
<br />
Funny, I think just the opposite about bards... fun in groups (pulling, twisting etc.) but horribly boring to solo.  Running in circles dotting or charm/swarm kiting just doesn't do it for me.  They are incredibly efficient soloers though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My two alts are a Beastlord and a Necro, but they aren't that high because Shaman &gt; *. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK, I'll bite and give my 2 cents.  I also have an army of alts, all in the 15-40 level range.  This includes a Pally, Warrior, BST, SK, Ranger, Monk, Necro and Enchanter.<br />
<br />
- Ranger, one of my favorites.  Bow, Track, Dual Wield, Double Attack and some nice spells like SOW, damage shields and wolf form, make the Ranger a great class.  Not to mention that in the end game you will be one of the premier dps characters.  Did you notice who the top damage dealer was when they killed the Sleeper, a Ranger (she did 50% more damage than the next person).<br />
<br />
- Pally, nice heals, decent buffs, moderate dps with a 2-hander, lay on hands is a life saver.  Stuns are nice but not very sexy.  Got bored.<br />
<br />
- SK, good dps, nice offensive spells, snare is great, so is FD and Harm Touch.  No real healing (life taps too weak), so not a good solo class.  Too much down time solo, which I tend to do more than group.  Played him before I started 2-boxing, would be different story now, maybe best 2-box partner.<br />
<br />
- Beastlord, great at levels 1-39, gets tough in the mid 40's thru late 50's (due to low level pet), and then gets great again 60+.  What can you say, great pet that quads, slows, haste, heals, pet procs and CH, dual wield and double attack (aa), good buffs, Paragon, etc., etc.  Can't rez :-)  Great solo and in group.  Similar enough to a shammy that I lost interest and I did not like playing pet cleric.<br />
<br />
- Necro, great against anything undead, very good against everything else. Has to use a Peridot to summon pet at higher levels (sux), but has the full bag of tricks against undead.  Charm, fear, mez, slow, dd's, dots, lifetap, etc.  Not sure how a Necro would ever die, with a pet, snare, gate, FD, and shadow step.  I guess anyone can get careless.  Kings of solo, no doubt.<br />
<br />
- Enchanter, just played into the 20's, so limited opinion.  Nice being a &quot;pure&quot; caster, but animation was irritating (no control until aa's) and low dps unless you are charm killing.  Charm killing was fun, but very quirky, either feast or famine, great exp or you die a quick and horrible death.  Doing CC in a group not really my idea of a lot of fun, but solo charm killing is exciting.<br />
<br />
- Monk, nice dps, just got bored with him.  May be a different story now with the new skills.  FD is nice and you jump around like a damn jack rabbit.  Can solo OK at higher level with high bandage skill.<br />
<br />
- Warrior, my current alt.  Want to try out the new skills.  Love tanking and not worrying about mana or spells dropping.  Am also a gear whore, so I love having my choice of the best gear in the game.  Dual, double, new skills, great gear.  What's not to love.  However, if you don't 2-box, lack of heal is a challenge, no real solo, have to group.<br />
<br />
Since I 2-box, the Shaman/Warrior combo has been a lot of fun and easy to play.  You can take down some nice mobs.  As has been said before, an SK is also an excellent choice due to the complementing spells, like snare, but the War is just so much simpler.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my 2 cents.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shadowknights get my vote too for alts. I was testing one out on Discord and I was lovin the superior hitpoints. Woot! 35 Harmtouch! Didn't get too far, but I think mindless meathead sword play with lifetap heals are a welcome change. But if you want to solo at higher levels: Beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like my paladin so much that it became my main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I recently made a Rogue alt, use him for PvP and evil alter ego.... Use my shamman to get some plat for twinkage but right now he is 24 and rising, Have a blast pking with him, I just cant get shammy pking down ( i must just suck lol ) but I love my rogs pvp skills, espicially against a young shaman because i know what they are most likely doing when i attack them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While back when my guild wasn't raiding super often and before AA's came out, I had maxed level 60 and decided to make a monk to play around with FD because I thought it was the coolest thing.  Anyhow I just played the monk whenever I wasnt raiding and since that amounted to so much time back then all of a sudden it was high enough to group with, so I got an old comp together and had my first taste at boxing.<br />
 <br />
Basically though I enjoy the monk because of the pulling part of it and being able to experience a totally different aspect of the game ( classwise ).  I really never twinked my monk either untill maybe about 55 I used a fungi but I was able to enjoy the leveling up experience, these days people twink and PL their alts to see how fast you can get them to 65 etc, cool I guess, doesnt satisfy me as much in the long run I would think though.  Anyhow, best thing I could say is check out all the abilities of the classes your interested in, and pick the one that you think you'll enjoy the most in the long run and go for that.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Go for necro. If you want a fun alt you can play when you don't feel like grouping, it may as well be a feign death class when you feel like running for beer or just watching a little tv between kills. Nothing beats a pause button, and in many cases fd is an instant pause/get out of jail card once channeling gets decent in the low to mid 40's. Add in divine aura, gate, root, snare, fear, you have a nearly unkilliable class with good mana regen, dot's, nukes, great pet. Did I say necro was a great class? <br />
<br />
If you don't mind a bit of work, everyone suggesting bard is right on. My main is a bard, I could solo for great xps at any level to 65 and am desired in groups. I won't play him again however, I like to chat with people, and thats impossible with a well played bard. I only break him out for certain encounters where I am needed for pulling if we lack other pulling options.<br />
<br />
Personally I&quot;ll never play a mage again. The lack of root is a game killer to me, same with my beastlord, both are great classes but with no root spell I am so limited in my options compared to my shaman or necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've been levelling up an SK and having ridiculous fun. I think the part about being full offensive and not buffing makes it so much good for me.<br />
<br />
I've actually had most fun just grouping with lower level folk and playing the good old chilled out relaxed fun EQ I remember<br />
<br />
Bard is my other reccomendation, its just so utterly different to playign any other class that untill you've tried it you wont 'get' it .</div></div><hr />
