<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I found out why I have been rather frustrated with LDoN.<br />
<br />
For a long time I have had a 65 shaman and a 65 ranger that I have enjoyed a lot dualboxing and I am quite good at it I think :-)<br />
<br />
But LDoN has removed almost all the enjoyment of trying to play that duo.<br />
<br />
In all the LDoN groups I have been in both the shaman and ranger have had to be rather active characters. Shaman has to slow, heal, buff, debuff, watch pet, swap spells around and probably more. Ranger has to pull(sometimes), control aggro, snare, buff, check track, try to keep atleast some mana. This is a whole lot of work and maybe if it was like the perfect group it would be doable but when something goes wrong my effectiveness goes drastically down or atleast thats how it feels. And because of the timelimit you have to move around alot and thats always a bit more stressing with 2 characters whether you use autofollow or not.<br />
<br />
So if any of you have any advice about how to actually play a duo efficiently it would be great to hear it. I could also ask you tell me Im a fool for even trying but I know you guys well enough to know that I dont have to tell you to do that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My self and 2 friends 2 box LDON all the time.<br />
<br />
3 2boxers<br />
<br />
SK, Shm<br />
Mag, Clr<br />
Enc, War<br />
<br />
<br />
We have Hot-Ornate level gear on all our characters, and we're like 20-0 when we play together.<br />
<br />
I am able to pull and tank with the SK while AE slowing, healing, nuking and curing with the shaman with little to no problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some AA that have helped me immensely:<br />
<br />
Pet hold - can't talk about this one enough.  Have it hotkeyed so i don't have to worry about controlling pets (both sk and shm use this)<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure - with myself and the cleric casting RC2 when necessary, we rarely have to break out the big cures to cure enchanter debuffs and trap dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Me and my wife almost always dual box in the dungeons as well. Together with our normal play group we're 11-0. When grouping with other people I'm a misearble 2-3. I've pretty much given up on doind LDoN at all when the people I normally group with are not on.</div></div><hr />

Rule of thumb for multi boxing, the more melee you have to do, the more innefficient you are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I only two box adventures with friends i two box with in exp groups and only if we arent going to fill up all 6. Another friend two boxes also. Its not so bad i generally can keep both working and doing their thing. <br />
<br />
  I dont however two box with pickup groups i play one and give it my full attention. I feel i two box well but there are just times like a big pull you dont have time to get cute and seperate its tough healing and casting with my shaman and making sure the pally is keeping mobs attention. <br />
<br />
   Take being able to cast a spell and switch over while the spell is casting and know when something causes it not to work. Knowing when a move is going to happen and putting on AF on the other as the mob dies and you'll know its move time. Also with my friends i know what spells they keep up and how they are going to react to aggro. I know when i can let a mob run over to them and they will be safe long enough for me to slow the rest and than see what needs to be done with the other. <br />
  <br />
   With pickup groups i feel bad if someone dies even if i they did it to themselves because i just couldnt get a heal off on the shaman because i was stunning a gater and caster101 backed/edged to far into a room with a mob and got pasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I two box but boy does it make me mad when I catch someone two boxing in LDON.<br />
<br />
I guess its the difference of being a good two boxer or not and also the kind of characters your two boxing.<br />
<br />
The other night I knew someone was two boxing, cause the ranger would stand there wacking at thin air after the mob moved 10 seconds earlier.<br />
<br />
Half way in to the adenture the other ranger gets killed, slowly. No reason he should have died,  so then I knew it had to be the cleric. Then the dumb ass backs out of the room taking a mob with him so I can't land my slow and where is the other ranger, facing a wall, so half die have evac'ed.<br />
<br />
Things move fast in the dungeons and everyone needs to be on their toes. But Im sure there are two boxers out there that play two classes better than some play one.<br />
<br />
If your good I'd say go for it, if someone can tell your doing it your probably not as good as you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have boxed with my monk (both on one computer) on several adventures and won them all (If memory serves).  The fast pace of movement and target switching does make it much more stressful than normal grouping situations.  Stressful to the point of being not fun at times.  I usually avoid it unless I am feeling especially hyper.  I don't think I would ever want to 2 box in pickup groups though, that would be rude. It would be especially rude if the 2 boxer tried to hide his actions in an effort to roll twice on loot.   <br />
<br />
Monks are pretty low maintenance to 2 box too.  No spells, taunting etc.  I group with friends that know I am 2 boxed so they seldom make me pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We've got 2 people in my guild who together bring thier own group. Usually one 4boxes a monk 2 wizzy's and a cleric and the othere plays a druids and bst. They are very effective at it and are among the top ranked chars on the server with all their chars and have little to no fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have 2 boxed at 55 and 56 but it was with people I am comfortable grouping with.<br />
<br />
If I have to go to LDON with a pickup group, I only take one char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With my regular group I 2-box a shaman and a ranger on seperate computers.  It can be done reasonably effective.  In my regular group we have a cleric and paladin so tanking/aggro/pulling and healing responsibilities are minimal.<br />
<br />
I do not use archery, as I don't have a gamepad and there is no auto attack built in, I've focused on all offensive melee aa's (also got max scf, love seeing myself crit for over 1.5k) and do a great job of dealing damage in this regard.  I usually snare (If live mobs) at 75% with my Ranger and then chuck in a nuke based on my current mana, due to the occasional resist and how quick the mobs die.<br />
<br />
With my shaman I mainly slow, buff and deal damage.  In most cases slow will land first time (I don't use malo unless there is a named), when I do I will usually throw on a Bane of Nife (Until I get Bane) as that is my most efficient way of dealing damage as a 2 boxer (for me) although in most cases the dot will not run to full length so some mana will be wasted.  It does give me extra canni'ing time over chain nuking.<br />
<br />
On a seperate issue since this post has somewhat deviated from its original questions, when I am not with my normal group I will only bring one character (whichever is more suitable) unless there is an extra spot to be filled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Possible.   I know alot of people that do it. and that are good at it.<br />
<br />
When EQ windows comes into the equation is when 2 boxers start to show thier worth.  If you have a machine for each, its not that hard  :p <br />
<br />
I quit playing another box, the fun for me in EQ is making my shaman powerfull by himself.  The more i can do solo, the more i get off on eq, if you will :)  Was very boring to me.  Once you get into a groove with both toons, time draws out like a blade.  Trying to keep as much as possible going on my shaman ties up enough of my time, and imagination :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">2boxing any class + wiz is pretty straight forward... switch that window/screen for 3 seconds a fight to press your nuke macro twice... and when **** hits the fan press your evac macro..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did it, and it worked just great. Granted, I've only done it once so far, but I won't hesitate to do it again.<br />
<br />
I never had to worry overmuch about my 2nd box char following me, but it is such a instinct now to glance at the second screen around corners and such that I don't even think about it.<br />
<br />
My only problem was both of 'us' were underutilized...and it was all my fault.<br />
<br />
It was only my second dungeon, and my first time was a disaster (just my Cleric that time..probably had something to do with it), so both the Cleric and the Shaman were staying out of melee...and there was no real reason for it, as it turned out.<br />
<br />
I had held back because I was afraid I was going to need full mana bars *any second now*, so the Cleric mostly just healed and the Shaman just sent in Old Yeller and JBB'd. As it turned out, the Enchanter we had with us was a true professional...at no point did we ever have a panic spot. I could have had the Shaman somewhere between OOM and whatever Canni had him at the whole time and been fine. My Cleric could have melee'd or nuked a good portion of the time and been fine.<br />
<br />
Next time I'll have Shazzog on the main screen and keep the Cleric on my second screen...then dive in with the Shaman and let the Cleric just Bot and Heal. I hadn't last time just because I am so in the habit of having Duhikae on main screens from when I was PL'ing him and getting him caught up with Shazzog. Now that all of Duhiake's melee stats are capped, there is no real reason to have Shazzog off to the side unless the pulls are coming in so hot and heavy that I can't possibly keep canni'd up between slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tyvek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have 2 boxed since I started playing EQ (release day). I play a bard or monk with my shaman or druid and its real easy if the second machine the shaman / druid. I use a nostromo n50 and put that right next to my &quot;main&quot; keyboard. It control everything the shaman does. For example, if your pulling with bard, just use a target / assist hotkey for shaman and slow, dot, sick pet etc. Put in pauses so that you /assist, cast, then sit down all in key.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, have conversations with yourself once and a while to (&quot;hey shaman! Wheres my HoS!?!?&quot;)(&quot;hey bard, you gonna play mana song or what?&quot;), that will throw people off. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Usually 2-box the cleric with my shaman if we're one down for a dungeon. Shaman does all the pulling, so I leave the cleric towing on one of the casters while we move and concentrate on the big boy. Got PCs side-by-side so it's almost as easy as playing one tbh. Usually do top-up heals, fast heals, CHs and nukes on the cleric with hotkeys and use the shaman to clear up if there's some heavy action going on. Not lost an adventure yet and never looked like it, so I'm more than happy to keep going. Solves all those arguments about HoT/Q stacking too. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have 2 boxed a few adventures, to tell the truth they were the easiest ones I was on, the others I played my rogue with a group, its hard feeling like you dont have control over everything (as I always do with the shaman).  When I have both, I dont do lead type things with either though (like scouting, puller, main healer, etc.) but its easy enough to get the rogue into position and backstabbing while the shaman heals/nukes/dots/buffs.  I try and hokey anything I can to make it easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've got a friend that 5 boxes adventures.<br />

he's like 34-10 or so<br />
