<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey what we should do is convince cleric that they need all thier u/g and that they should all cancell account or not log infor a day..<br />
<br />
<br />
then when noone can group for anything cept ldon normal ... their would be a huge outcry that other classes should be good healer and ..... erm soe will probably just fix cleric and we still be screw.. ops oh well.<br />
<br />
ps dont pre order OOW even if you will buy it, cos the less pre orders they have the more nervous they`ll get:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that sounds like a good idea, but it also has potental for backfire, WHAT if good sham who know what they are doing and the druids can heal just fine at least Pre GoD (you cant tell me you cant heal in LDON hard or PoE :) ) :p ....then they might think to nerf us &gt;&lt;.</div></div><hr />
