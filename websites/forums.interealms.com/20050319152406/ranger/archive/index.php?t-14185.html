Windblade drops since like last week have basically stopped .. havn't seen one drop forever same w/ belt.<br />
<br />
Spec parchs seem to be non-existant since patch now too I've heard of one dropping all day which sux.  They weren't very common to begin w/ and this current drop rate is horrid hope they fix it :( <br />

At the beginning a group that stuck together in one of the temples for a few hours could get a few scrolls per member very easily.</div></div><hr />
