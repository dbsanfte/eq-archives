<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tardaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have heard meny good things about this place, and somthings that sound bad.<br />
<br />
What i wanted to know before i tryed this is where to goto first, how to get there when to go there.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is a repetive thing for u guys.<br />
<br />
PS i am a 35 shaman almost 36</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>franciis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been PLing my 30 frog there and I make about 3-4% per kill at 30 and 31 so far. Took about an hour to level with my 65 chanter. I dont know if i will last until 40 as some people say. I have a flair for the 4-5% per kill myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The clockworks are great and are very easy to kill. The exp is very good and if you don't mind being kos in ak'anon is good exp until level 41-42. But I would suggest stopping killing them at level 39 if you want keep dubios faction in Ak'anon (which I did).<br />
<br />
The best spot to pull to is due west from position 9 on the eqatlas map. There's a bridge that goes over the lava. If you are running to position 9 from lava storm, when you cross the bridge just go left into the corner there, kill the wandering clockwork and work your way west killing the single clock work (theres also a single pull gnome east), and another 2 spawn of clockworks. at level 39 these things are cake to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is such a pain to get to this spot for me.  I go in and get my pet (have tried without but I get further without).  Every single goblin aggro's on me, and I've as of yet been not lucky enough to invis all the way there, always some caster mob seein me.<br />
<br />
And when I finally did get down there in about 45 minutes of perseverence and then just saying fug it and runnin for sol b zone (works better :P).  Still took another 20 minutes to kill the gobbies on the way.<br />
<br />
Anyway finally got there, pretty good xp for the kills, but they spawn too slow for me.  So I left :P.  Get better xp from the halfling guards in Misty Thicket if you can handle 2 or 3 at once (difficult yes...but they spawn quick).  And even better xp in LDoN - being a shaman I've found groups are not difficult to assemble on my own or augment a group with my abilities.  <br />
<br />
Of course since LDoN isn't a viable option for everyone at this time, I was also leveling in Echo caverns on Luclin through some of my lower 30's, at the mosquito camp.  Very easy to hold, just have to be willing to take damage.  And Warsilk Woods has some brutes in the cave to dalnir you can fight as well, again an easy camp to hold...but a bit slow.<br />
<br />
Sol A seemed like it could be better if I had crack and was able to continually fight, but as is I'd be medding most of the time to get mana then sitting and waitin for them to spawn.  Wouldn't go lookin for more stuff to pull because I knew they'd spawn soon, just not how soon and if I'd have enough mana to take them out.  In that essence the camp is good if you are just going to solo and perhaps have company over while playing, or watching a movie/playing a game on a console/reading something.  With all my attention on EQ I just got too bored.</div></div><hr />
