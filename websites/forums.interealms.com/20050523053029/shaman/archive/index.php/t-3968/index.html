<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw one in Bazaar late last nite for 3k so I picked one up.  Not sure if its going to be worth it or not but figured what the hey.  I will still hold on to my Ivory Imbued collar in the meantime.  Wondering what my brothers and sisters thoughts are on this necklace.  Also wondering if this will work Torpor?<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got a deal &amp; bought mine for 1.5 k.  As often as I am casting buffs, sows, speed etc. I love it.  Longer lasting buffs equals more mana.  From what I have read it does not work with Torpor.  <br />

Unfortunately it does not work with torpor.  It also doesnt work with group buffs which is a pain in the ass.  Still a v nice item tho - especially if you spend any time soloing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got one of these a few days after the focus items came into effect. I have not taken it off since. Is it worth it ?? In my humble opinion YES.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got my Totemic Breastplate around 35 or so, and at 44 I still use it because it has Extended Enhancement II.  I will really hate it when I get an upgrade to my chest piece and will need to find an upgrade.  The amulet of insight seems nice but then I will need to find a replacement for my BAM which gives Mana Preservation II.<br />
<br />
I can't afford any of this replacements and yet I still do not have a JBB, a horse, a fungi, or an ikky bp...  sigh =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i am probably the luckiest person i know, i picked up this and an obulous death shroud in parties. i was to say, the amulet of insight is very very worth it. i don't have group buffs yet and torpor is very very far away. i love this thing.<br />
<br />
i know theres another thread around but i havent seen much a difference with aman preserve 3. maybe its just me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can confirm the focus effect on the Amulet of Insight doesn't work with torpor.  I have both.<br />
