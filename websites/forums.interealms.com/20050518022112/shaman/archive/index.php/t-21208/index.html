<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can easily heal a normal LDoN, and I've played ranger with another shaman healing/slowing in a completely non-uber (bazaar level) group - the type of group who can't cope with high risks.<br />
<br />
I've been healer in a high risk LDoN, though that does require a suitable group makeup. (We had a good bard pulling mostly singles).<br />
<br />
I have geared up with healing in mind, and have my GoD spells. I am a better healer than a lot of druids, because I pay attention, I have the focus effects, I have the spells and I have the AA. People look for druids as healers, but don't take everything into account. It's annoying to be in a decent group of 5 and hanging around waiting for a druid to come online because people don't want shaman as a secondary healer.<br />
<br />
Okay so, I got a little fed up waiting for a druid or another cleric to come online as secondary healer in a trial group, so I figured I'd run some numbers.<br />
<br />
Using myself as an example, I have Daluda's Mending, max healing AA, 30% beneficial spell haste and Marr's Gift focus. I am not a bad secondary healer. Compare to the druid we added to the group, who's not a bad healer, but doesn't have beneficial spell haste, and doesn't yet have his new GoD heal. In the group, he was chain casting the %age heal, but that's not affected by spell haste anyway.<br />
<br />
Karana's Renewal: 4680 heal (75% max) in 10 seconds. With AHA3 (19%), is 5569 hp max, recastable in 12.25 seconds. It can't crit and it's not affected by any spell haste or heal focus, so that's it.<br />
<br />
So the most you'll get out of KR is 5569 / 12.25 = 454.6 HP /sec heal<br />
<br />
Daluda's Mending: 1550 heal in 3.75 seconds. With 30% beneficial spell haste, and BoR, this is cut down to 2.3 seconds (recast in 4.55). With AHA3, it heals 1844.5, with Marr's Gift, that goes up to an average of 2075.<br />
<br />
i.e. I can heal 456 hp /sec *not* including crits.<br />
<br />
Along similar lines, if the druid doesn't have beneficial spell haste, and doesn't have the GoD spell (which was the case last night with a druid we added to fill that &quot;healing&quot; slot), with AHA3 and BoR, he will splash heal for a max of 416.5 hp/sec.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know I'm not comparing like with like here, but my point is that people naturally assume that druids &gt; shamans as healers, but it all depends on the druid and the shaman.<br />
<br />
It's not as straightforward as it appears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heh, yes... if you compare it that way.  Cripple the druid, tie one hand behind his back, then spin him around a few times and then you can heal as good as a druid.  Hell, I can outheal many druids and clerics because of my skill (read: attentiveness and reaction) at healing, but I certainly wouldnt draw any conclusions from that.<br />
<br />
The fact is that Druids as a class outheal shamans in every way besides heal over time.  Comparing our GoD quick heal to their POP long cast time heal is a pretty weak argument.  The best conclusion you can draw from your post is that you think you play a good healer and have more aa and focus effects and so you can outheal a particular druid who was only casting his big heal.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, even with no aa and no focus, the druid GoD quick heal will outheal a shaman with their GoD spell with max aa and marr's gift.<br />
<br />
Average heal with Daluda, max aa and Marr's Gift is 2038.<br />
The base heal with Sylvan Infusion, no aa and no focus is 2100.<br />
<br />
The druid POP heal is also still 200 hp more than our GoD one.  You would have to pair up a particularly weakly geared/AA'd druid with a strongly geared/aa shaman and to replicate the kind of results that you presented here.<br />
<br />
It would be pretty annoying if people refused to do a trial without both a cleric AND a druid heh, if they had a Cleric and a shaman already.  I completed all my GoD trials as secondary healer with a cleric.  So I sympathize with your frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, there are some crassy healers out there in the cleric and druid community.  Yes, I too can heal far better than a level 40 cleric (roxxorz!).<br />
<br />
  What people are complaining about is our inability to outheal the damage coming in from the mobs in gates.  If you want to go and play as main or only healer in a gates group, have a blast, post some logs if you pass somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not only are you comparing yourself to a &quot;bazaar Druid&quot;, but you are buffing your Shaman with BoR for no logical reason...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My point is that people make assumptions which aren't always true.<br />
<br />
It's not a bazaar druid, either, one of the best equipped druids in my guilds doesn't have beneficial spell haste because they didn't gear up that way (they notoriously hate healing too).<br />
<br />
I really don't understand your point about BoR either, Giac. What's wrong with BoR?</div></div><hr />

<br />
     Well in your description ,the shaman use 3 time more mana ! Also you compare your best heal ,with their most efficient heal . Good gear/buff (for healing) for us ,and bad/none for them.........oh ! It remember me Thott ! Welcome back  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my whole point though - it depends on gear. People assume that druids are better healers, but it's not always true.<br />
<br />
Without beneficial spell haste, Karana's Renewal is their best heal, which is why I used it as an example.<br />
<br />
If they have the same gear as me, they're going to be the better healer, of course they are, I'm not disputing that.<br />
<br />
What annoyed me though, was waiting around in a GOOD 5 person group for a healer, only to get a druid who didn't have his GoD heal and who didn't have beneficial spell haste - where I could have done the same job he did all along.<br />
<br />
Get my point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Classic example of gimping yourself.<br />
<br />

<br />
I missed the &quot;Okay so, I got a little fed up waiting for a druid or another cleric to come online as secondary healer in a trial group, so I figured I'd run some numbers.&quot; point. <br />
I assumed you were comparing yourself to the Druid in a LDoN setting as only healer for some reason. In that scenario neither you nor the bazaar Druid would have had BoR and the bazaar Druid would have been the better healer HPS and HPMana wise hands down. <br />
I guess your first healer was a Cleric which makes your point of having BoR valid, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I was referring to. 1 on 1 the bazaar Druid will be the better healer using KR, no matter what gear you have. Only BoR will change the situation in your favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is my whole point though - it depends on gear. People assume that druids are better healers, but it's not always true.<br />
People also assume that clerics outheal rangers, yet when you compare a 65 ranger to a 25 cleric the ranger heals better.<br />
<br />
Of course when people compare classes they assume similar gear. And when people invite strangers to groups they usually do not question them about their gear in advance. At least I do not get tells among the lines of &quot;Hey, if you have maxed healing AAs and beneficial haste and a heal focus and we do not find a druid who also has these you can come group with us&quot; very often.<br />
<br />
If they have the same gear as me, they're going to be the better healer, of course they are, I'm not disputing that.<br />
And noone is disputing you may heal better then a druid with lesser gear or an afk cleric or a lvl 9 ranger. It just has no bearing on shaman outhealing druids or druids outhealing shaman.<br />
<br />
What annoyed me though, was waiting around in a GOOD 5 person group for a healer, only to get a druid who didn't have his GoD heal and who didn't have beneficial spell haste - where I could have done the same job he did all along.[/QUOTE]<br />
Except of course if they wanted Blessing of the 9, damage shields, snare, charm, evac, harmony or track. If all you need is Karana's Renewal (especially in a group that already has a cleric and a shaman) you might as well take along a lvl 50 cleric.<br />
<br />
Get my point?<br />
Your points being<br />
- You heal better then a crippled druid<br />
- stupid people do stupid things<br />
?<br />
<br />
If it is not one of the above then no, I do not get your point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not talking about bazaar druids. There are at least 2 druids in my guild I can think of with 5000+ hp, 6000+ mana and no beneficial spell haste. I could link their magelos, but don't think it's fair to name names. It's the way they built their character, some druids don't want to be healers.<br />
<br />
I guess the real point is that beneficial spell haste is very important... Maybe not all druids realise this, but while shamans aren't the most desirable of classes at the moment, we can still play to our strengths, rather than just whine about our weaknesses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but there is no playing to our strengths here. It's not like Druids can't use those foci, your friends just choose not to. This isn't Shaman specific as much as I want to see your point.<br />
<br />
The problem is that a Druid without any form of beneficial haste using KR will still outdo a Shaman with full AA's, Daluda's and Marr's Blessing. So yeah, I can see why a group would be looking for *any* Druid over a Shaman &quot;healing wise&quot;.</div></div><hr />
