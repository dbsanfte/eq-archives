<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok in a nice pickup group at Sebilis Guard.  Playing my level 60 Monk alt.<br />
<br />
Got cast upon a couple of times by the Shaman frogs. Here's where it get's wierd.<br />
<br />
Got hit for 283 one time and 303 another. The old &quot;Spirits of Frost&quot; yadda, yadda, message.<br />
<br />
Conned the Frogs, blue and LIGHT blue to a level 60. Now am I missing something - do Frogs have AA abilities or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my guess would be that you were struck with the level 44 shaman spell &quot;Blizzard Blast&quot;. at lvl 60, a lvl 44 frog will be light blue to you, making this perfectly reasonable. the reason you got hit with different numbers is because you partially resisted both times. i just looked up the spell on casters realm, says max of 430 damage.<br />
<br />
that looks reasonable to me, anyone correct me if i'm wrong. froglok shaman's dont' have JBB's, so i doubt a 44 one would bother with winter's roar :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm a 'tard. (SHADDUP). Had JBB on the brain. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like getting ICed  the best it the varryign resists get hit for 85 then 900 and so oh boy time to torpor.  the new frogs  casting is fun in a messed up way.  otherday i got dazzled by chanter, he tashed me (while grm was down) and then mezzed me.  i was puller for group as well, the whole guild got a good laugh as i sat there unable to move for a good minute.  and when did they put chanters in seb?</div></div><hr />
