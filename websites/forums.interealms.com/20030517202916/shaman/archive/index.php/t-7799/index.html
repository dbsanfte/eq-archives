<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Shaman brothers!<br />
<br />
A question to all of you who are wearing Wolf Caller armor. I have a description of how to get that armor however I am missing a bit of details. <br />
<br />
1- What kind of faction does one need with the ring of scale and what is the best way to get it up?<br />
2- How easy is it to get the components and is there a better place/way to find those drop?<br />
3- Is it worth the work or should I concentrate on some other armor?<br />
<br />
Of all the velious shaman quest armor this looks like the best one to me. However if I am mistaken or if it is impossible to get, what would you guys recommend?<br />
<br />
Thanks a million<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. You need to be Ally to turn in the quest armor<br />
<br />
2. Chain doesnt drop too often... Legs and Breast Plate are very rare. Plate drops will make you sick ;)<br />
<br />
3. Good armor, and a good place to learn some raid skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 - You don't need Ring of Scale faction at all - it's Claws of Veeshan - and you must have ALLY for the quests.<br />
<br />
2 - Gems for the quests drop in various Velious zones, the Unadorned Chain pieces drop in the Temple of Veeshan(ToV) - Halls of Testing(HoT) section - generally considered a 54ish + level hunting area on Brell.<br />
<br />
3 - Depends on what you want/need as well as levels - and the ability you have to get in on hunts/raids to ToV/HoT.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In my raids on HoT, chain is extremely rare. Plate seems to drop quite a bit. It seems streaky. When you get one chain drop in any given raid, i would say you are lucky. We have been several times and not seen any chain drop. Not sure why its like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slayerfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the hated Glove Drop. The SS Shaman glove can best be described as a Latex, surgical, Butt Scratching Glove. IE. you wear it once, scratch your bum and discard the pitifull thing.<br />
<br />
 The other pieces are all very worth having. Yes, there are cooler Drops than SS armor, but in my experience SS is STILL the most available Armor to Shamans. HoT is Doable with very few People PROVIDED that people listen to the Raid Leaders, Don't Overnuke, Don't attack early and............<br />
<br />
 Consider the first 5 to 10 Raids a learning experience, and regard any awarded armor as incidental stuff. I got my Leggings about 2 weeks ago and they're awesome. Up until then, I'd gotten a kick out of refusing to Heal the Rangers and Rouges when they got slowed(That'll teach them for getting awarded my Clicky Cure Pants.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dragonbait</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From extensive experiance hunting both Hot and West Wing Tov. Chain Drops are the rarest items in Hot ie 3 Chain BP in 6 months vs 3 Chain BP drops off West Wing dragons in one raid... SS however is better armor than Kael Based so there you go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Took a while to see chain legs or bp drop for me,then it started,while legs were still very rare,BP's dropped very often,i got mine by default,we had to bank a few and apps were even getting them.<br />
<br />
I had to claim the legs tho,and not many chain class peeps have them yet,or even Kael since we switched.<br />
<br />
My worst luck,arms /shrug<br />
<br />
Gloves suck<br />
<br />
Helm isnt bad,i got a circlet of falinkan to replace mine.<br />
<br />
Boots are good,upgraded to mithril boots lately.<br />
<br />
BP is ok,was still using a Fungi for soloing till i gave it back to the friend who let me use it for nearly a year.Vindi BP is easiest upgrade.<br />
<br />
Legs are sweet,dont plan on upgrading soon.<br />
<br />
Bracers,decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>maggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hi all,<br />
<br />
i tried yesterday to do the quest. after i got to the quest npc, hailed them and couldnt start the dialogue (there were no keywords in [ ]).<br />
<br />
so anybody know, what to say to get the dialogues started? or where i can find some infos about?<br />
<br />
btw. faktion is ally to CoV. so this couldnt be the reason.<br />
<br />
maggok, lvl 58 shaman and king of da swamp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm, were you invisable? If you are ally, you don't even need to say anything. Just hand the armor and gems to him.<br />
<br />
But he should talk to you regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i found with the turnin npc, you have to be very very close, closer than with most quest npc's just my little observation.<br />
<br />
as for your ?'s.. you need ally faction<br />
                         the gems are found in most mid 50's zones in vell SG, and velks i see most of them from<br />
<br />
newp only way to get the turnin drops are to hunt in HoT get the unadorned chain then find the gems and hit SS all the way up top through the maze back and forth lol.<br />
<br />
ryoz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And unadorned chain does NOT want to drop for me!<br />
<br />
10 hot raids, only 1 bracer.<br />
<br />
C'mon, dragons! Throw me a bone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Takes a while to get em to drop - but chain seems to drop more often than silk in my experience.  was luck I got my full suit in the first 3 days of HoT - took us 2 weeks of 5+ hour camping a night to deck out my rogue guildmate in full SS. Best thing you can do is keep at it - they'll drop eventually.</div></div><hr />
