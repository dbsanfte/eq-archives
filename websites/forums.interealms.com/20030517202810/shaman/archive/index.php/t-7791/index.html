<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelroahg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what do i do with the broken arrow from the shaman epic quest?<br />
I have had it for a while and am now getting ready to do the COM portion of my epic quest.. Did i miss the turn in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, no one knows what it is for :)<br />
<br />
Some people save it for posterity, some people throw it for Jabobner to fetch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to confirm what Grippa said, the broken arrow is not required as a hand in at any point in the shaman epic quest.<br />
<br />
Now, is it used in a sub quest? Many have theorised that it could be but nobody has found an NPC that seems to want this item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still have mine in case it is for some other quest that no one has found yet.  But I am thinking that perhaps there is no use for it.  It's just there to trick the shaman into trying to do another sub quest that doesn't exhist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have saved mine to this day, and will continue to save it. It just makes sense. if the arrow is aquired for the test of patience, then wouldnt logically we have to be patient long enough to hold onto it. Granted, people can go back and just get another, but if that does happen, then im just 1 step ahead. They have talked about adding epic upgrades, who knows they may use it then. But everyone else in this thread is correct. So far, noone has found any use for it.<br />

<br />
envisions the erud's crossing:<br />
<br />
shaman1: Camp check<br />
shaman2: Test of patience<br />
shaman3: I'm waiting too<br />
shaman4: me too<br />
shaman1: so is there a list going?<br />
shaman2: yep about 20 people so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will you bear our<br />
obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know who to give it to when it is time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">perhaps after getting what you need from abe, you KILL him and he spawns someone for the arrow??/<br />
<br />
dont matter to me, i would have to go back and do it again i distroyed mine a long time ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I destroyed mine.  Easy enough to get another one if I need one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">this thread is prolly old and dead now anyhow but figured id throw in the idea.<br />
you gotta remember this is verant we are talking about here kings of broken and unfinished quests. my guess is that the arrow was to go to the spirit at the end of the test of paitients but by the time the got to coding that they forgot about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Or maybe...the arrow IS the test of patience.  Ive had mine for a long time now.  Its in my bank.  and Im being very patient about waiting for the end of the quest.<br />
<br />
Heres to waiting....</div></div><hr />
