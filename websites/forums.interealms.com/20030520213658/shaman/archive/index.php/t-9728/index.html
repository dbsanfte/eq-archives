<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking to add some more to my toy collection, I keep at least 2 bags of clickables and proc weapons around, just for occasional use.  Some are pretty handy, some I don't ever bring out.  Droppables work best, but no drop stuff is fine to list, as long as it's not impossible to find (elemental planes, etc).<br />
None of this is actually worn, just hanging around for swapping in as needed.<br />
<br />
Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring - Insta click.<br />
Earring of Purity - 5 sec counteract disease.  Real nice for curing slows and dots.<br />
Earring of Cleansing - 5 sec counteract poison.  Mobs seem to use poison dots a lot less, but still useful when they do.<br />
Di`zok Oracle Shillelagh - Great for farming those greens who just hit hard enough to outdo your fungi, you can slow them without bothering with casting spells.<br />
Tae Ew Ritualists Mask - Free invis.  I haven't had to memorize invis since I got it (other than CR).  So handy.<br />
Sabertooth Amulet - See invis.  A friend was letting them rot so I grabbed one, handy to pop it on sometimes instead of bothering to acumen myself.  Although I finally got group acumen, so this is less useful.<br />
Runebranded Girdle - Haste.  Fun to have, doesn't provide much real use outside the farming of greens.<br />
Boots of Shadow Walking - Shadowstep!  Great fun for duels, causes problems trying to use it elsewhere (especially in dungeons).<br />
Silvery Mask - Never know when you'll want to identify something.<br />
10 Dose Potion of Unlife Awareness - Haven't found an item with ITU, so I keep a stack of potions.<br />
Black Fur Boots - Who goes anywhere without these?<br />
Spiritstone of Cabilis - When I get homesick.<br />
Fungus Covered Scale Tunic - Don't leave home without it.<br />
Hammer of Spiritcalling - 2hb is fun, the snare proc is worthless.<br />
Holgresh Elder Beads - Fun stuff, great for scouting ToV.<br />
Chetari Wardstaff - Knockback pisses melee off to no end, especially in Hate.<br />
Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients - Iksar pride~<br />
Ornately Runed Shell Necklace - Enduring breath.<br />
<br />
Worn items<br />
--------------<br />
Coldain Hero's Insignia Ring - Insta click, damage shield.<br />
Regal band of Bathezid - More damage shield, though not many charges, I rarely use it.<br />
Wolf Caller's Breastplate - Free RH is handy, I'm too lazy to memorize single target boar.<br />
Wolf Caller's Boots - Zing!  I can honestly say I've never clicked these boots in the year I've had them.<br />
Wolf Caller's Bracer - Free ultravision is a nice junk buff, stacks with acumen too.<br />
Spear of Fate - manafree dot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I carry too much junk around, but who knows when you'll need things!  Anyone have any more good toys they like to keep around?  Things I'd like to get:<br />
<br />
Dain's Ring - regen + ds.  Waiting on guild to get around to it.<br />
Regen belt from new SS - Some of those new guardian things around Yelinak drop a belt with clickable Regen or chloro, I forget which.  Be something handy to have.<br />
Collapsable items - Never know when you'll need a fishing pole, or jewelry kit!<br />
<br />
Click my profile and peruse the inventory if you want to see the stats / effects on some of my toys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, Faern has the Fungal (Steals from the Monk when said Monk is sleeping), Epic, and Boots.<br />
<br />
Monk (waking up pissed and Fungal-less), has Bracer of the Hidden (Insta-see Inviso), J-Boots, and 9th Coldain Ring. He also has Royal Ring of Bathezid, but as you said - 5 Whopping Charges.  FB earring, but spent some time in CS whacking Sirens for Enchanter's 7th Shawl and the 5 Charge insta-cast EB's are decently common.<br />
<br />
Enchanter has .....spells. Really haven't fixed them up with too much. Oh - 5 10 slot containers of Tradeskill crap. From food to Geerloks to components. <br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot - Earring of Blazing energy. 11 point DS. Doesn't stack with any other DS. Great to put on pet when farming greens.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills can consume you. Will be so glad to get 8th Shawl and be done with that stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Poison Wind Censor - decent 2HB - procs Gale of Poison (our lvl 39 poison rain ae).  366 damage proc when fighting giant sized targets since all damage goes to the target.<br />
<br />
JBB - duh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do the hogresh beads still work from inventory after that patch?<br />

I have stalking probes but they only last 10 seconds, not really very useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksar, no jb &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
I hear the reclaim energy shovel's don't work anymore from inventory?  That true or just rumor?<br />
<br />
Snare and tash items are a good idea, I'll have to work on getting a j-stick.  Snare hammer/spear, I've got no shot at those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bullwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would often carry the mage Torch of Alna on my Shaman. I had gotten into the habit of right clicking it from inventory to reclaim energy when ever i had to go invis, or zone, or do something that would kill my pet.<br />
<br />
It does NOT work anymore after the patch :(<br />
<br />
Was a fun quest to do a long time ago though. As far as i knew all 4 of those mage items: Broom of Trilon, Torch of Alna, Stein of Ulissa, and the Shovel of Ponz all used to work from inventory for a Shaman. I can vouch for the Torch and the Broom working anyways till the latest patch. Since there is no reclaim energy spell available for the Shaman, i decided to do the mage Torch quest back when i was a newb for the right click effect on it.<br />
<br />
I guess someone decided that being able to summon a pet for no mana via the PoP armor as well as be able to reclaim energy for no mana via the old mage focus items was just too unbalancing...... as if any shaman would bother doing this instead of cannibalizing to regain mana anyways. <br />
<br />
Now the mage items got nerfed so that they no longer work from inventory, and they changed the right click PoP shaman armor so that it no longer summons a pet.<br />
<br />
I like to think about changes like this as &quot;Things that you don't get to read about in the patch message&quot; <br />
<br />
It's not always fun discovering some of these yourself a few days later but at least this isnt a big kick in the nuts to the Shaman class, just a little thing that probably hasn't been working as intended for so long that we just kinda assumed that no one really cared about it.<br />
<br />
Oh well one more clicky gone. Im sad to say that i finnaly broke my torch today,  it had been with me a long time now. I also destroyed the old Broom of Trilon that i have kept in the bank for so long, it was just taking up space anyways, but i couldn't bring myself to get rid of untill this patch - more bank and inventory space for me i guess.<br />

Hah! :p <br />
<br />
The Ritualists mask and the Shillelagh are nice tips that I didn't know about (still a SHM n00b.)  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just for the info, the mage staves of mastery no longer work for reclaiming pets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This item is totally dependant on how far into PoP you are but a few nights ago i got myself a Corpsegrinder, 30/34 2hb 10 dex 15 sta 15 wis 100 hp mana 20 svd procs invogorate (the 100pt heal) <br />
Whenever my guild is doin a long boss mob with low dps (VT..) i throw it on and nuke/canni and let it heal me. It drops in CoD off High Preist Utlor (last mob for the bertoxx flag ring) its basically shaman only cause no cleric in their right mind would go in on this and druids suck. <br />
