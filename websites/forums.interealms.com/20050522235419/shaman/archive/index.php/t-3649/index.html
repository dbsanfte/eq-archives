<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am starting to get bored with CoM but I like the dungeon fighting, a little more exciting. What other places would be good at 55 i a dungeon. I was thinking about some named mobs in LGuk or the front of the Hole? If those are doable, can I get some tactics or maybe other ideas. I would like to get exp with a slim shot at a nice piece of loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">chardok zone in/out are god spots.  cant single them til 57 i think but use the line of sight pulling technique and that might work or root one, fight the other.<br />
a lot of loot in chardok is random off ANY mob, ie stave of shielding, sarnak battle shield, chokadai hide spauldors.<br />
also check hunting areas 50-60 on this board, has some good spots and strategies. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You don't say whether you are soloing or grouped ....<br />
<br />
Chardok is indeed nice, and with a group you can do the gate area, or possibly beyond, depends how good the group is.<br />
<br />
The Hole entrance, I was soloing at about level 49, and I could do the first 5 or 6 elementals. That was before I got my epic, at 55 you might even be able to solo up to the first golem. With a decent group, including a chanter, you can go beyond the drop and get super fat xp :)<br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins, you can solo the entrance, but watch out for adds that path almost to the zone line, and also watch our for the transient patrollers, they are necro casters and very nasty. Again, with a reasonable group you can go in a bit, the first room with the fallen pillar in it is a nice spot to camp and rake in the kills.<br />
<br />
You could possibly try and get into a Cazic Thule group - in fact I was there last night but I'll be the first to admit 55 is still a little low. One resisted slow can get you pounded down very fast. Soloing is not an option in this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is possible to solo in CT, but you need to be a 60 shaman with torpor and malo.  Also...leave the big raptors alone...even slowed it was outdamaging my torpor :( (but, my AC is low).</div></div><hr />
