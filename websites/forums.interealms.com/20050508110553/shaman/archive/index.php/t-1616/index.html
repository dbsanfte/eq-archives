<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to be pretty big into getting as much AC as possible awhile back. I sacraficed alot of other stats just to get that extra AC. I think I topped out at 1415ac unbuffed back when my guild was doing NToV alot, and I had always taken AC into consideration first before any other stat. <br />
<br />
However, lately I decided to do away with my AC gear and concentrate on getting all HP/Mana gear. I noticed some people asking if people would use IGS over the coldain shawl quest shoulders. I think that the 7th shawl, and of course the 8th shawl blow away IGS and just couldn't see why people wouldn't use them just because they wanted a little extra AC. I think that AC is pretty meaningless after you get past 1200. I went from 1400ac to just barely under 1300ac and haven't noticed a damn thing. I gained around 400hp though and a ton of mana. I think I had 3300 total mana before and now I have 3900 total mana. <br />
<br />
I get annoyed everytime I see a Shaman talking about AC like it is important to us =P HP is probably one of the most important stats to us since we use cann alot. Mana is another very important stat obviously because we cast a ton of buffs. If there is a difference between 1250ac and 1400ac for Shaman it is very small. Obviously if you have 900ac and then you compare it to someone who has 1200ac there will be a noticable difference, but for the most part I have seen absolutely no difference.<br />
<br />
Just thought i'd toss that out there, i'm sure it has been talked about some but I just hate seeing the same old arguements about AC brought up over and over. AC is an eye candy stat. If you enjoy bragging to your friends and stuff then AC is the way to go. But if you enjoy making yourself as effective as possible HP/Mana is definately what you need. I can't believe how many times I passed over an item with 75hp/mana on it or something, for an item with 15 more ac but like 50 less mana/hp. It took me awhile to realize that it was pretty pointless, and you even see Warriors leaning towards maxing out HP once they hit 1350ac or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finally, someone who looks at it objectively.<br />
<br />
Personally, I go for an AC/WIS balance before anything else.  But you are right.  HPs and MANA are also very important.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have a character that rounds out all stats instead of concentrating on just one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">haha, i love it, it took breaking 1400ac before you realized this?<br />
HP is greater then you will ever be. Rarrrrrr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think part of the AC problem is people don't think before they leap.<br />
<br />
Shaman see some item that has huge AC but neglect to think about what it will do to their other stats, and get the item.<br />
<br />
I have always taken my time with items. I am never in a rush to get anything, and I try to look at what an item will do for my stats across the board. I don;t focus on any one thing.<br />
<br />
My goal is 1200AC with around 2300hp and 3700-3800 mana, while getting my resists to around 140-150 in Magic, Fire, and Cold and 100+ in Disease and Poison.<br />
<br />
At the same time I look to maintain a roughly equivalent equipment level with the other Shaman in our guild. I'm not going to sacrifice guild capabilities for my own benefit.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it will be possible but I am patient enough to wait for items that will help my character. Increase my capabilities and it improves the guilds capabilities.<br />
<br />
I agree on the HP. With Canni V, Canni 4, and Torpor HP will be a greater benefit... as long as you don't sacrifice too much in AC and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*sigh* did the shaman community just avoid the entire ac softcap discussion?<br />
<br />
supossedly <br />
old world 1000 ac<br />
kunark 1100<br />
vellious 1200<br />
luclin 1300<br />
<br />
course this is just guestimation and someones inside source from eq think it was furor that was the one that said this not sure...but there is a point of diminishing returns and its around 1200 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think that most people who discuss the AC issue are debating smaller numbers - 600ish AC/high Wis versus 900ish AC/medium Wis.  Not 1200 AC vs 1400 AC; the soft cap has been mentioned here quite a bit already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bear in mind that some of the people saying AC is important could well be like myself, unbuffed AC 850. So to me, more AC IS important, whether the &quot;soft cap&quot; is 1000 or 1400, more AC will still improve my chances. Of course so will more resists, more HP etc. As has been said, no point working on one stat to the detriment of others.<br />
<br />
As for the varying &quot;soft caps&quot;, my own personal theory is that those figures come from the ATTK ratings of the mobs involved (rather than a coding difference in the zones), but that's only a theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Right, you have to reach the cap before you should really start talking swapping for HP.  No question that HP gear is important though.  <br />
<br />
Obviously with the right gear you can have the best of both worlds.  <br />
<br />
I suppose I should do that shawl quest at some point, but the thought of training tailoring sounds horrible.  I've done plenty with tradeskills, but just not tailoring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thordan,<br />
<br />
I can't disagree with what your saying but you have to remember your part of a rather small percent of the over all population. Most people who play eq will never see places like NToV or alot of the other mobs that drop the gear your wearing let along go there repeatedly to get multiple drops from there. You do have a good point tho it's balance. Anyone who looks purely at ac, or purely at wis or purely at hps in any situation is doing themselves a disservice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, that's why I'm so against my guild going to any kind of award situation on loot...  I have a hard enough time evaluating my own gear, much less any other classes. :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, every time I look at a new piece of gear, I have different values of whats more important (ac/hp/wis/resists), based on what I currently have &amp; will be replacing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&lt;----HP shaman always<br />

but if those darn debate  comes up again, Ill side with AC.<br />
<br />
As Cush said,  it's usually about 650ac vs 850 ac, not those uber number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">depends on the encounter, luclin is all about hp and thats probably why your changing your opinion</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so what should a troll shamy concentrate on?  improving hp and wis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">AC is very important up till you hit the soft cap for your class. After you hit the soft cap, adding more AC gives significantly dimishing returns. The current softcap for warriors appears to be around 1350 ac. For a shaman&gt;? I don't know, but would guess it to be around 1200. If you hit the softcap (maybe someone who has seen someone elses analysis can post the info...I might have seen an analysis done at the AL forums bu not sure) then you are much better off switching over to HP/mana after that. The upside is that it is quite likely that once you reach the soft cap and are concentrating on your HP/Mana after that, the pieces of gear you have will probably be giving you that wisdom and a large portion of any resists that you would be desiring. Anyhow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This really isn't anything new.  Warriors have known for a while that 1350 is the softcap for them, and I highly suspect the softcap for shaman is signifcantly lower.  What you fail to realise though is that it is HARD for most shaman to even come close to their softcap, so in these cases we are struggling to get 1000ac or 1100ac, and dont have the option to drop our AC gear.  <br />
<br />
I hope that you didn't have 1400ac before you realised this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well my goals are about 1100ac  2500hp and 3200+ but i would much rather see 1100ac 2300hp 3000mana and Self Equipment mana Regen of about 20 that would be sweet, (im into mana regen) ;-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">All this talk about a softcap. Any empirical data other than a few Vindicator/Yelinak or mist panther parses? No. Just because AC seems to cap out vs Vindicator the same does not mean it will cap out vs Emperor. Just because a tank seem to notice less damage it doesn't mean AC is capped. There is no evidence, only what people seem to notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yeah and what people &quot;seem to notice&quot; is pure crap 90% of the time.  I mean i've seen people do the most innane and completely non functioning tweaks to their systems.  We're talking stuff that does NOTHING yet they walk around insisting that they gained 20 fps suddenly.<br />
<br />
Same principle holds here, if they think they see somethng they'll convince themselves of it.  Until you do hard testing over a sample of different mobs your pretty much talking out your arse.<br />
<br />
It's all about balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">there's always been a &quot;flavor of the month&quot; stat. first wis, then people were screaming about the benefits of cha on resists or whatever (which turned out to be complete BS), then everyone said how AC was god. it's always been about balance for me, at least after i learned a bit about what was going on. <br />
<br />
actually, the only stat where there are no diminishing returns is HP. for everything else, there's either a definite hard cap (wis, etc at 255) or reasonable speculation (sometimes verified by the powers that be, sometimes not) about soft caps (200 for stats, or the various numbers bandied about for AC).<br />
<br />
people just need to guard against going overboard ... the ac fiends went overboard for awhile (damnit i have 1300 ac and 101 wis and that's the way i likes it!), as did their wis conterparts (look at me, i'm a druid!) during the major part of that argument. i always thought both parties were a bit loony .... likewise, i'd caution people about going overboard about hp for the same reasons. seems to be the newly-emerging flavor of the month, which is bound to be replaced by something else soon. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The &quot;soft cap&quot; isn't something hard coded. It's long been suspected, and now confirmed, that AC's usefulness is relative to the mob's ATK. However, the concept of diminishing returns exist, and hence the soft cap exists, because of a statistical anomoly instead of actual hard code rules.<br />
<br />
Increasing your AC to 1500 from 1200 hardly does anything for, say, frogs in seb, because 1200 is well above it's ATK. However, it does make a difference for Vindi (who's cap was tested at being 1276 by one set of test on the steel warrior), yet at the same time, it could mean nothing to, say, AoW, who's ATK is most probably higher than any AC a player can achieve at this time. <br />
<br />
The theory goes that the higher your AC goes, the less difference it makes because it only is effective against a very small number of mobs. At around 1300 AC you have surpassed the ATK rating of 95% of mobs in game. Therefore, any increase in AC would only make a difference to 5% of mobs in game--if it could make any difference at all, and this is why people experience diminished returns from increasing their AC.<br />
<br />
HP should only become important for a shaman when your desired AC level is reached, since it's the only stat that does not decrease in value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hahaha I am constanly looking for AC gear.<br />
<br />
I am poor and level 42, I have mostly Totemic armor, and my ac is about 648 buffed.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">sure, if you have 1400 ac you should certainly be working toward hps in my opinion.  Especially with Cannibalize 5.  <br />
<br />
The problem is not everyone has 1400, or even 1100 ac.<br />
<br />
I struggle to remain at over 1000ac without going under 1925 hps(needed for cannibalize 5).  Of course I have no Ntov or luclin gear and only partial velious armor.<br />
<br />
In general most of the AC threads on this board are not arguments of AC over HPs at the high level.  It's generally AC/HP over wisdom at the lower/mid and non-uber high level.<br />
<br />
AC is an important stat for shaman.   I would be perfectly happy at 1100ac and putting all efforts into HPs.   It is, as always, a question of balance.  I would argue that 2500hps and 800ac or 1700hps and 1400ac isn't as good as 2200hps and 1200ac. <br />

Now that I can get my wis to 255 I am mostly moving my attention toward hp and mana gear. The more hps a  item has the more I will work toward it. I found slowing the uber big mobs every little bit of ac and hps helps when you get the mobs attention on a slow.<br />
<br />
With the new 200 wis bonus, I would never let my wis fall below that to get higher ac. Easly on a raid I can get my ac to 1100 and that works just fine for me. Hps fully buffed I can only get 3700 and I think that needs more work than raising the ac atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It didn't take me to get 1400ac to realize it. It was something that I had been trying to debate for awhile, but always put off because I had been such an ac freak. Velious was a matter of having good resists for stuff like NToV and right now in Luclin I see little or no need to ever concentrate on keeping resists up. Almost all the mobs that have an ae either have a curse or an ae where you are going to get hit sooner or later and there really isn't anything you can do about it.<br />
<br />
To me HP/Mana mean everything, AC is a distant third when deciding gear. I'd rather have 3200hp and 1050ac than 2600hp and 1250ac but thats just me. Only times I aggro mobs are in exp group settings and replacing hp for ac almost cancel each other out anyway. In raid settings I find my need for ac meaningless. <br />
<br />
You're right though, it is a question of balance but in today's high end items you really can't get just hp without getting some sort of decent ac. Anyway I brought this up only because I see people use some stupid arguements that hint toward ac actually meaning more than it really is. People refusing to wear an extra 50mana/hp item over the fact that they are going to be losing 10ac or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">HP is very nice, 'cause without any you die. AC is nice 'cause without any you take too much damage and end up having no hps. Wisdom is nice and mana is nice cause you can cast a lots. <br />

Also summer is nice 'cause all the birds and bees and you can swim and eat icecream. Just though I'd put this to you all who pay too much attention to things while powergaming.</div></div><hr />

AC is useless unless you are getting hit on while HP is worth something when you are in AoE, Canniballizing or getting hit. HP has more uses than AC and therefore is more important in my eyes. HP is more useful than mana as well since without HP, you can't utilize that mana very well.<br />
<br />
AC - Usefull when getting hit.<br />
<br />
HP - Usefull when getting hit, under AoE, Canniballizing.<br />
<br />
Mana - Usefull when casting lots of spells. Easily recovered with HP.<br />

This point of view has always amused me. All of a sudden they make wisdom more useful from 200-255 and you just have to have 255 wisdom. All that extra wisdom is is another 300 mana. Did you have to have 300 in mana gear before the wis cap was raised? If not why is getting max wis any different. Thats all it provides.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Interesting thread (http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1242.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20) on the warrior boards that started life as a discussion of damage distributions and meandered into an expanation of AC soft caps.<br />
<br />
Relevant snippets:<br />
<br />
The snippet below is taken from the fourth page of the thread, and is a nice summary.  <br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Mobs do damage based on the following formula: (found by Joimster)<br />
<br />
Damage = Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x)<br />
<br />
Where:<br />
Bonus is a number assigned by VI<br />
Damage_Rating is a number assigned by VI<br />
x = integer from 1 to 20<br />
<br />
*Warriors Defensive Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 10.<br />
<br />
*Monks Stonestance Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 2.<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Base damage for Characters is calculated from the weapon:<br />
Damage = round/truncate[Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x)]<br />
<br />
Where:<br />
Bonus is the Damage bonus listed on the weapon<br />
Damage_Rating is the Damage listed on the weapon divide by 10 (result is non-integer)<br />
x = integer from 1 to 20<br />
<br />
*Some irregularities and possible explanations.<br />
<br />
1. Effect of High Strength on damage?<br />
(*Test in extreme strength differences of 75 or less versus 200+ to see more obvious differences)<br />
<br />
Q: Does extra damage from Strength add simply to the damage bonus of a weapon therefore increasing damage bonus and therefore increasing both max and min hit?<br />
A: Easily tested by using a character with Low strength and parsing min and max values and then buffing strength to very high and parsing min and max values.<br />
<br />
Q: Is extra damage from Strength added as an integer?<br />
A: Easily tested by the above method and seeing if the increase to min damage is the same as increase to max damage. If they are the same then damage from high strength is added straight onto the weapon damage bonus. If they are different it is possible that the extra damage from strength is added to the damage rating of the weapon and is therefore multiplied by 20. This would mean that it may add 1 to your min damage and 20 to your max damage although it need not be integer values such as these as they may simply be rounded before damage is displayed on screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Effect of higher level characters on damage?<br />
<br />
Q: Is this phenomena caused by higher ATK ratings, damage tables for higher levels or both?<br />
A: ??? Research and logs at each level required.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Calculation for offhand damage?<br />
<br />
Q: Is the formula the same as the above with the damage bonus simply defaulted to 0?<br />
A: Put a fire beetle eye, lightsone in main hand and weapon in off hand and parse damage. Put same weapon in main hand and the fire beetle eye, etc in off hand and parse damage. What is the difference in min and max values?<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
On the subject of Avoiding and Mitigating damage taken from a mob. (particularly mitigation)<br />
<br />
The raw data listed by Aauminki while tanking Seneschal Aldikar show that hits were indeed mitigated to min damage five times greater than the average and hits were also found at max damage two times greater than average.<br />
<br />
Indeed 37% of all hits that landed fell as either max or min damage. Note that the fact that this is a single set of data makes this unreliable but does point at an avenue of exploration.<br />
<br />
An initial hypothesis is that x (as used above in the damage by mobs formula) is not initially calculated as an integer between 1 and 20 but is truncated and/or rounded to this in the final steps of the algorithm.<br />
<br />
Example: Mobs ATK is compared to your AC and the R.N.G. is also used somewhere and comes up with a number. That number is then truncated/rouded and made to equal 1 for any number lower than 1 (therefore mitigating damage to a min. hit) and made equal to 20 for any number greater than 20(making sure that the damage does not go above max damage).<br />
<br />
*Your AC is much higher than the mob's ATK:<br />
More x values are lower and in quite a few cases are negative values and therefore made into an x value of 1. Comparatively few hits are for max damage.<br />
<br />
*Your AC is much lower than the mob's ATK:<br />
More x values are higher and in quite a few cases above 20 and therefore made into a value of 20. Comparatively few hits are for max damage.<br />
<br />
*Your AC is almost even with the mob's ATK:<br />
The x values have a fairly even spread between most possible values except for the min and max which have more occurences than the others. Reason being that x may still have been in a bigger range than just one to twenty, i.e. -15 to 35.<br />
<br />
This snippet describes how these mechanics explain the &quot;soft AC&quot; cap phenom<br />
<br />
Then we can infer that if your AC is high enough that the non-random part of hits is mostly BELOW N = 1, you will get the largest spike at minimum damage. This represents a ceiling on mitigation AC, since the random component will always put SOME hits over (N = 1) and reducing hits further below (N = 1) doesn't help. If the random component continues to be reduced even when the modal hit is far under (N = 1), this becomes a soft cap.<br />
<br />
Secondly, we can infer that as the modal hit moves through the range (N = 1) to (N = 20), we see the 'sharp dropoff' effect that so many people have reported in the AC 700 to 1200 range.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, we can infer that if the modal hit is often over (N = 20) most times, you see the big spike at max damage. This represents a floor on AC, which has been observed but never really commented on. Since at (N = 20) the random component will ALSO be large, we find that the floor is softer than the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Here are the values from some mobs- pulled from the thread:<br />
<br />
Mob: DB, DI<br />
Cazic Thule: 200, 20<br />
Doomshade: 110, 15.5<br />
Gozzrem: 180, 15<br />
Kromzek Captain: 60, 10<br />
Lcea Katta: 160, 20<br />
Lord Nagafen: 75, 7.5<br />
Vessel Drozlin: 75, 12<br />
Yelinak: 100, 25<br />
Sontalak 125, 15<br />
Avatar of War: 254, 45<br />
Innoruk has: 20, 1<br />
Phin Esprinap: 254, 5.1<br />
Priest of Discord: 254, 5.1<br />
Ssra - Elite Temple Guard: 151, 15<br />
Ssra - Temple Guard: 99, 9<br />
Vorash (LoIO final monk fight):  60, 6<br />
Xenovorash: 70, 7.5<br />
Velks Lab regular spiders: 20, 4<br />
Talendor: 120, 19<br />
Kael - Staff Sargeant Drioc: 45, 4.5<br />
Kael - Dlammaz Stormslayer: 80, 21<br />
Kael - the Sentinels scattered around Tormax's Castle: 80, 10<br />
Kael - Yetarr: 110, 16<br />
Sebilite Juggernaut: 55, 6.1<br />
Froglok Reet (Insert Name Here): 45, 5<br />
Myconoid (Insert Name Here): 45, 5<br />
Trakanon: 120, 25<br />
PoA - Thunder Spirits: 50, 5<br />
PoA - Sirran the Lunatic: 256, 90<br />
PoA - Azaracks: 55, 6<br />
PoA - Gorgalask: 50, 11<br />
PoA - Spirited Harpie: 60, 9.5<br />
PoA - Watchful Guard: 50, 12.5<br />
PoA - Heart Harpie: 75, 15<br />
PoA - Avenging Gazer: 75, 14.25<br />
PoA - Shimmering Meteors: 113, 8-11... depends on which one you fight<br />
PoA - Keeper of Souls: 1, 20 <br />
<br />
So, Cazic Thule can hit for 220, 240, 260, ..., 580, or 600.<br />
It turns out that kick/bash damage is DB + some integer, so CT could kick for 201, 202, 203, ....<br />
<br />
The min hit is therefore DB + DI, and the max hit is DB + 20*DI.<br />
<br />
It becomes apparent that we can derive these numbers from a max and min:<br />
DI = (max hit) - (min hit) / 19<br />
DB = (min hit) - DI<br />
<br />
Good stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I dont understand you ppl.  Isnt it obvious that CHA is the defining stat of an awesome shaman&gt;????????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I think that most people who discuss the AC issue are debating smaller numbers - 600ish AC/high Wis versus 900ish AC/medium Wis. Not 1200 AC vs 1400 AC; the soft cap has been mentioned here quite a bit already.<br />
<br />
Thank you. I'm just trying to get my unbuffed AC to 900. Maybe one day if I'm really lucky I'll break 1000. If your AC is 1400, I think you've probably earned the right to think for yourself and bend the rules as you see fit, but whatever you do really doesn't apply to most of the Shaman out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">there's always been a &quot;flavor of the month&quot; stat. first wis, then people were screaming about the benefits of cha on resists or whatever (which turned out to be complete BS), then everyone said how AC was god. it's always been about balance for me, at least after i learned a bit about what was going on.  <br />
<br />
Not really.<br />
<br />
We  couldnt imagine shaman  having like 1200-1400 AC  before.<br />
Remember that thread about Afterlife's shaman showing off his 1400 ac?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok changed her to his, cut me a slack, it's long ago :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Ok first off, *** said I was a &quot;her&quot;? <br />
<br />
Secondly from my experience on a wide variety of 60+ mobs, AC over the softcap does help. The problem is you have to be well over the cap to see much difference. Basically whats best is to maintain high AC while building HPs. My rule of thumb is to not drop under 1500 ac buffed when upgrading HP gear. Of course when focus items finally go in, we will have to deal with all new choices in what is most important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Acctualey I never did focus on Wis till recently , the items I got all have high wis and if you look at my equipment I am trying to weed most of the Wis items out. But a extra 300 mana is always nice in the end :)<br />
<br />
As far as Ac spending a day in Ntov today I am defintley looking toward more hp gear. The aoe can hurt something fierce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Hmmm dunno about wis really... Usually I have C3 on and when I don't there's always bear form...<br />
<br />
I can agree with the hp&gt;mana&gt;&gt;ac but I really wouldn't put wis anywhere in there. Lots of shaman items have high wis anyway and getting it below the point where C3 and bearform will hardcap you once we're taliking 1100+ ac and 2000+ hp is, well not an easy thing to do.<br />
<br />
I have 230ish and thus hardcapped with C3 and bearform. And I only have two items that have high wis and no HP, PoA shoulders and SS helm, and eventhough I plan on replacing them I'll still get more wis from hp stuff I plan to get from other slots that just happen to have wis on them too. <br />
<br />
I guess you can put it in interwalls. At low level say 10-25 you'll have a hard time with fizzles, mana pool and skill up and getting a bit of wis is nice. 26-53 ac is a good idea to get a bit of ac as most mobs you'll fight will be melee and mobs tanks aren't too skilled. Then once you get Canni3 and start raiding a bit you can start concentrating on HP, more and more as you get better cannis and fight more AE mobs.<br />
<br />
I also have a big problem seeing the point of manaregen. I'd leave that to other classes. With can4, can5, regrowth and torpor FT becomes pathetic in comparison. Innate manaregen is rather hard to obtain past MC3 and how many percent does it really offer a shaman? Can4 takes slightly less than a tick to recast, can5 pops every 30 ticks, this is about a hundred mana per tick, of course some is lost in torpor regen and the cast time of everything you're up to. But in the end you should still outperform arch lich. Say you may end up at 60-70+mc3+potg+C3 ~ 80-90 mana per tick. Now compare that to anyone but a necro and who really needs that innate mana gear, you or the clerics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Simple fact is that gear has been increasing over time.  Pre-Kunark, I think 900AC was an almost unrealistic amount.  Kunark armor added lots of AC, Velious armor added AC &amp; stats, now Luclin armor is adding even more AC &amp; stats.  Within the past month or two, I recall seeing a thread about Flowing Thought 15 being possible.  Who would have ever thought we could focus on mana regen, one expansion ago?  After Planes of Power has been out for a while, it would not surprise me if the top end gear will allow 1500+ AC, 250 Wis, and major resists for Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">mm, dunno about your can5, but mine pops every 3 mins : )<br />
why regen? simple, i dont always have time to c4 all the time, and c5 is still semilimited in when i can use(well, mostly if i xp, in that if i get a good sized train and tank for a good bit i cant use it: ) also, the laziness factor, more manaregen=a good thing, doesnt mean it's the highest priority, but it's good : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">3mins=30ticks :P<br />
<br />
If it's shaman only sure it's nice. But if it isn't a clerics tops out quite a bit below 100mana/tick and is quite likely to need that extra mana more than you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">If you do the high end Luclin encounters, you get Hps/Mana/AC/Wis/FT items all in one neat little package.<br />
Look at the shield off the HPs.  has ac 45 20 wisdom 100 hps/mana and FT 6!! Has other stats to but cant remember.<br />
A back item -Cloak of Mourning  Back <br />
AC 25 Str+15 Wis+20 HP/Mana+75 resists+10  FT 4<br />
Some serious loot! I got a burrower hat last week and LOVE it! 40 ac 20sta 100 hps/mana !! My Wisdom is 254 unbuffed currently but i have exactly 1099 AC. Since i only really raid i dont need 1400+ ac, i dont plan on main tanking. Not saying i dont agro now and then but i dont plan my gear for the extreme circumstances. If i could have the best of every slot i would, who wouldnt, but we have 7 shamans in my guild so we have to spread the wealth. Also, there isnt any shaman only items (aside from weapons) that drop in Luclin/NToV so there is also compettition from other classes as well.</div></div><hr />

I dont have uber stuff. Yet even with NO wisdom on my bp (iskar), leg (heavy dragon), face (shroom veil), one ear (silver gilded skull), one bracer (jbb) and one ring (bandit) I am still over 200 wis unbuffed. Granted the epic is a nice chunk of wisdom.<br />
<br />
And the BBB still has 10 wis to go along with its 25ac, 10str, 55hp and 55 mana.<br />
<br />
Does anyone really find wisdom hard to get in the upper levels?</div></div><hr />

<br />

Food - 5<br />
<br />
Base - 85<br />
<br />
Total - 181<br />
<br />
With bearform, 191. I should also mention that, now with VoB, I have exactly 1k self-buffed AC and ~2026 HP.<br />
<br />
I have far from uber stuff, as you can see. Mana has never been what I would call a problem, but before I got my epic, SoBW, and especially fungi, I could easily run into trouble if I wasn't careful. Now I have to try really hard to run out of mana.<br />
<br />
If I can ever get some damn chain pants to drop in Kael, I'll have 10 WIS from Thurg pants. If I ever get Torpor when I'm 60, I'll have 14 WIS from the Thurg BP. The list goes on. At that point, I would gladly use a BBB, Orb, etc. over the SoBW. But until then, it makes a very good compliment to my gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Eoin we have similar gear and are the same level. Self buffed I have 1020 ac, 2002 hp, and 201 wis (or something close to those numbers). I try to keep wis around 200 while maxing out ac/hp/mana. <br />
<br />
And dont get me started on velious chain drops. Those with velious quest legs should count themselves lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">well when I can get 1000ac-1400ac gear I may change my mind but this is my take on this...<br />
<br />
I can buff str..so I carry a LOT of gear on me..I only visit the bank to change in my gold and silver for pp.<br />
<br />
1.  If I'm in the mood to Tank low-med blues I will throw on all my AC/HP gear and wis will drop to about 130ish.  Then I slow the mob/ haste myself and get to have fun being a tank.<br />
<br />
2.  If I'm in the mood to root and rot mobs that hit me too hard or proc some nasty stuff, I will throw all my Wis and mana gear on and ac will drop to 800ish and wis goes to 200.  Then I slow the mob for annoying root breaks and Root-Rot.<br />
<br />
3. If I'm in a suicidal mood I mix wis and ac gear to get myself at 900ac and wis 170ish and Slow-Slow-dot run like hell while a mob i had no business agroing is getting his ass chewed off by Dog dog.<br />
<br />
Thats what i love about being a shaman...I dont have to use the same spells/ tactics all of the damn time!<br />
