<br />
Just finished a 4-day tour of Air (didn't leave till we had a crown for each of 5 mages plus 1 extra to pay for the trip).<br />
<br />
Everybody was so hysterical about not hailing Sirran, etc.  Well, a few times, once keys were turned in and all, I got permission from our clicky cleric to have a chat with Sirran.  His conversation had some interesting content (ie, references to the Wall, &quot;one is better than none,&quot; giving milk to the deputies).  I've done a quick search of the big EQ sites and haven't found any sites that fully describe the content/lore of Air &amp; document Sirran's ramblings.  Does anyone know of such a site?  Or have any info they'd like to share?<br />
<br />
Thanks, and safe travels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thornwhistler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sirran is a loveable halfling, and it takes some halfling lore to figure out the phrase to spawn the sister of the spires? I think it is.<br />
<br />
I know the rangers glade and safehouse have both published PoA guides and the ramblings are in there somewhere, just keep lookin around for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sirenia Brighteye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">one of his ramblings requires an answer spelled backwards to spawn someone (i forget who)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malvesti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're right, it's &quot;are you one with the wall?&quot; backwards<br />
But that's just a spolier and it doesnt give you all the clues leading up to that &quot;answer.&quot;  I want the full convo thread, for example.<br />
<br />
Also, there seems to be no info as to what you get when you do the turn-in quests.  The female asks for spiroc healer's cloak turn-in (i know this item was replaced by dcos, so may be impossible), and the male asks for Yannikil turn in. (this is in addition to the *giving* of those quests).   Anyone?</div></div><hr />
