<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know what your earning potential is, nor your current budget. Some of the following suggestions are expensive, some are cheap. They are only suggestions - different strokes suit different folks<br />
<br />
Ears - dump the +wisdom earrings and get any of<br />
(a) Earring of purity<br />
(b) Earring of cleansing<br />
(c) Earring of twisted leaves<br />
<br />
Neck - ivory imbued collar<br />
<br />
Face - crystal spider eyes, deathmask of the elysians, golem jawbone<br />
<br />
Helm - Metal linked crown, JB helm<br />
<br />
Fingers - dump the +wis fingers and get either Velium Fire (6AC 65hp) or if you are rich get Shadel Bandit and Circles toe bones<br />
<br />
Wrists - Do the Coldain Military Bracer quest. Get a Jarsarth bracer from KC - they rot all the time. If you are rich get a bracer of Sense or Fortitude. Do the Bracer of Hammerfall Quest<br />
<br />
Arms - JB arms are v cheap. Barbed ringmail sleeves are nice<br />
<br />
Hands - those gloves are ok<br />
<br />
Back - Do totemic quest. Get a wet thorn cloak. Buy a cloak of truth if you are rich.<br />
<br />
Chest - Barbed ringmail is the cheapest of the OK BPs.<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Elder Wolf Hide<br />
<br />
Waist - Chitinous Belt, Girdle of Mithaniel<br />
<br />
Legs - legs are fine<br />
<br />
Feet - feet are fine<br />
<br />
Primary - fine for now - get a REIF, or even a tarnished driveshaft<br />
<br />
Secondary - SBS is fine<br />
<br />
Range - get a gantru charm if you can, or even a Ceremonial Smudging stick, Goranga idol etc. If necesssary put your howling harpoon in range and equip a different weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok here is a silly question. what is a REIF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's pretty much the best weapon you can find before you get epic.  Should run you 5-6K.  That's what it is on my server at least.<br />
<br />
Here's the stats: Rune Etched Icewurm Fang (http://eq.crgaming.com/data/item.asp?Id=2893).  Thing kicks a lot of booty.<br />
<br />
There are no stupid questions... Well, if there are, it's me that's usually asking them.  :confused: Heh</div></div><hr />
