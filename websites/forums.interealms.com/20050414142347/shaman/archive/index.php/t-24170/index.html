<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I now have a pretty decent computer - 3.2 ghz, raptor hd, 1.5gb ram, ati 9800pro video card, etc - but my monitor is a relic.  What's the point of having a really nice computer designed for things like gaming and movies if the monitor you're watching all this on is a gerriatric.<br />
<br />
The room where my computer is is pretty tiny.  And by tiny, I'm really saying that it could be a closet - size matters (we all knew that already).  So, I've been looking for an LCD monitor in the 17&quot;-19&quot; range that's under $500 and will live up to the specs on my computer.  <br />
<br />
Recently read an article on Tom's hardware that said basing your purchase decision on monitor specs is not a good idea because they're misleading.  PC magazine did a recent review (rhttp://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1738,1656115,00.asp) on lcd screens which listed 3 good looking monitors(editors choices), but after doing some more research, it looks like those 3 monitors were rated more on business applications and not on things like gaming.  I'm quite confused then on how to find a good monitor.<br />
<br />
So I guess my question boils down to this:  given the wide variety of 17&quot; &amp; 19&quot; monitors out there, which would you all recommend and why given what I'm looking for?  Thanks in advance for all the great suggestions you have all given on the other computer questions I've had!  They helped tremendously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">19&quot; lcd from CTX (http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=24-103-189&amp;DEPA=0) works out pretty well.  Contrast and color response are pretty good for me.  This is now my backup monitor that I have my laptop plugged into; I dont game on it much anymore, but when I did I was pleased with it.  The Sale on that ends today and then the price goes back up a bit<br />
<br />
Viewsonic 19&quot; (http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=24-116-321&amp;DEPA=1)  Not sure about this one, but it fits the price you asked and Ive had good luck with Viewsonic.<br />
<br />
Personally, Ive always prefered a tube display, but I think thats just cause Im a rellic myself.<br />
<br />
21&quot; CRT (http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=24-116-229&amp;DEPA=0) from Viewsonic is what Im using right now.  THe price was right.  A word of warning though, this thing is HUGE.  I'd guess that it runs about 18 inches deep and it runs about 55 pounds, so card tables are pretty much out.  I do love the 20&quot; field of view though.  Makes OOW look spectacular.<br />
<br />
Only a few options, but Im running late.  Oh, I usually get my stuff through newegg.com, mainly because I love getting my stuff 2 days after I order it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just went through the same dilemma. Decided to stick with CRT over LCD because of known &quot;native resolution&quot; issues most LCD's have with quite a few games.<br />
<br />
If the game will run in the LCD's &quot;native resolution&quot; you won't have any problems. Most NR's are &gt; 1280x1024 on 17&quot; and above. Some older games (like Diablo 2) wouldn't do anything above 800x600, so would look like total crap on LCD's.<br />
<br />
Granted, most games coming out these days support higher res modes, but we still like (and play) some of the older games that don't.<br />
<br />
We went with 19&quot; flatscreen Viewsonic P95F+B (http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductdesc.asp?description=24-116-232&amp;depa=0) from newegg.com for $250 each.<br />
<br />
You'll also get more bang for your buck sticking with CRT's over LCD's.<br />
<br />
G'luck with whatever you decide to purchase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I stuck with CRT for two reasons.<br />
1)Price<br />
2) If one plixes on my lcd blew and glowed blue constantly I would go friggin nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions.  Didn't realize that about native resolutions valgoth.  Is the picture on a CRT the same or better than an LCD?<br />
<br />
And if you all had to pick a great CRT which would you all choose for gaming and what not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For gaming I prefer CRT's. My brother has a 17&quot; LCD and it looks ok, but the imagery just doesn't feel/look as 'warm' as it does on my CRT. For business or otherwise non graphic intensive applications I'd go LCD, which I'll do on my DAW (digital audio workstation...music production machine).<br />
<br />
If I had the room I'd go with a 20&quot;+. Our desks will only accommodate 19's though.<br />
<br />
I love Viewsonic personally, but Mitsubishi makes fantastic CRT's as well.<br />
<br />
Viewsonic G220fb 21&quot; PerfectFlat CRT Monitor  - $438 (you'll pay that much for a 19&quot; LCD, plus get to deal with the NR issues).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">stay the hell away from KDS.<br />
I'm useing a Viewsonic P220f at work right now and it is great but pricey.  Just make sure what ever you buy does at least 1280X1024 @ 85Hz (for a 19&quot;)  This was my pref because I run my at 1280X1024 and I get headaches with anything lower then 85hz...thats just me tho.<br />
Samsung is pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How do ghz play into that equation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol they don't.  Monitors do Hz and MHz...no GHz.  That would be a hot running monitor if they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hertz (Hz) = Refresh Rate. Lower rates have a tendancy to cause 'flicker' that can be very noticeable in some applications (especially high graphics applications). Some people are prone to headaches when exposed to CRT flicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would agree on either ViewSonic or the old standby of Sony Flat Screens.  And also agree to stay away from KDS.   From a price standpoint, if you live in a big city ( I live in Houston) you should be able to pick a nice size 20 inch monitor out of auction type site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hertz (Hz) = Refresh Rate.

Well stated.  <br />
I should also mention that you can see a &quot;flicker&quot; better with your peripheral vision then you can by looking strait at the monitor.  Try it next time you’re somewhere they have all the monitors are lined up beside each other.  It's pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Have a Viewsonic here too, 19&quot; LCD.<br />
Never had a problem with mine in over a year so far, not sure as to how the picture compares to a newer CRT cause mine was several years old.<br />
But I like mine, much better than what i had before and now i have room to stack even more **** on my desk.<br />
<br />
Only thing I've noticed with it is it seems to put off more heat than my old CRT, haven't noticed it causing any problems though, assuming it's normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I do not have much of a clue when it comes to monitors.  What is KDS, what is CRT, I know what LCD is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok no one has mentioned one of the best 19&quot; monitors out there: Nec/Mitsubishi DP930SB($300) and the 22&quot; FE2111SB($550).  Both of these monitors are awesome, i have never read a bed review beside the fact they are both big and heavy.  I own the DP930SB and would recommend it to anyone.  If you are looking into LCDs then just be sure you get one with a refresh rate of 16ms or lower.  Samsung make some really good 17&quot; 12ms LCD for around $400ish 710 or 712 models.  I'm planning on taking one home soon just to try because i have never seen a LCD play FPS or newer games to see if there is ghosting.  <br />
<br />
I have read many time gamers DO NOT let gamers buy LCDs LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">KDS = brand name, IE a low quality manufacturer of various computer components.<br />
<br />
CRT = Cathode Ray Tube, IE the glass part of the older style monitors that contains the RGB &quot;guns&quot; (red, green, blue) that create the image on the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">KDS stands for Korean Data Systems.  The reason I bought them is that they were the only company that Costco sold that did the 1280X1024 @85Hz that I needed and also did advanced warranty replacement (which means they send you a new/refurbished one in your old one becomes defective).  My monitor &quot;poped&quot; one day and they sent me a replacement but it was a lesser model that only did 1280X1024 @ 65Hz and they basically said that is all we are going to do for you unless you get it fixed.  I had my monitor fixed 3 times before KDS told me to take it back to the place I bought it from.  KDS sucks...never buying them again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have read many time gamers DO NOT let gamers buy LCDs LOL<br />
<br />
Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I wont go back to a CRT monitor.. have 3 lcd's and have no problems.. and no headaches..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It depends.  I haven't really looked at a high end LCD for a while now.  I remember trying to watch a DVD on one a while ago and it just didn't work for me.  There was too much &quot;Ghosting&quot;.  The reason there is no headaches with a LCD is because there is no refresh rate.  The whole screen is updated at the same time, where CRTs have to &quot;paint&quot; the image one line at a time.<br />
I guess the best thing for you to do is go take a good look at LCDs...watch a movie...see if they will load up a Doom/HalfLife type game for you and try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">where CRTs have to &quot;paint&quot; the image one line at a time.<br />
Depends. Interlaced vs. non interlaced.<br />
<br />
Always go non interlaced when buying CRT's.<br />
<br />
Do they even still make interlaced? Hmmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">lol damn...I forgot about interlaced...it's been too long since my monitor/tv repair course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">your pixel response rate (if I recall the term correctly) is what matters on a lcd monitor.<br />
<br />
It's hard to find a lcd monitor with a pixel response fast enough for the &quot;hard core&quot; FPS player.<br />
<br />
I'm using a DELL 17&quot; LCD  right now and loving it.  The only time I've had problems with it is when  I've tried spinning in a circle really fast.  There was minor ghosting.  I've watched videos, played games, etc... with no problems.   I haven't done much that I couldn't do at 1280 by 1024 though :-)<br />
<br />
The Dell LCD really is bright by default so you might have to adjust that a bit to find a good comfort level for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">After doing some more searching, what do you all think of this (http://www.benq.com/display/lcd_fp783_specs.html) monitor?<br />
<br />
BenQ<br />
500:1 contrast<br />
300 cd/m^2<br />
12 ms response time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">/shameless bump<br />
<br />
But I do want to thank all of you so far for all the feedback.  You've helped so much.  Just need to know what you all think of this benq monitor.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't know very much about LCDs, can't really help ya...sorry.  Maybe check to see what their return policy is on burnt pixel numbers.  I know a place here has a 25 burnt pixel minimum before replacing or fixing.  That sounds hi to me.  Other then that I am pretty usless on the LCD front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have a 21&quot; KDS monitor that is 5 years old.  At about 4 years and 6 months the screen started widening and shrinking on a whim and I can hear fizzles inside the monitor on occasions.  Yet I can still play and all is well.  So for me the monitor has lived its live but I would of liked to gotten 10 years out of it lol.<br />
