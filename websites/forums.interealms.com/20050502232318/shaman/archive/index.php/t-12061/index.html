Notice the difference in drop locations.  The original Plane of Hate doesn't have a location like that, at least not first floor.   It goes from 400 to -400 in both directions, there is no 656 location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Soooo......<br />
<br />
A Plane of Hate B ?<br />
They could be that Lame.  I do truly believe that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">maybe 3rd floor of PoH ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe they're actually moving the second floor of hate to another location on the same Z axis as the first floor to help correct some of the awful aggro problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It might not be lame if they make Plane of Hate B geared towards the level 60-65 crowd with gear a bit better than ToV/Kael.   Move Innoruuk from the original Hate and beef him up like they did to Cazic, and then put Inny's old drops on the mini boss mobs in old Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They are revamping Hate. This is probly just the file that has all the changes as they make them and will be renamed to replace the current PoH file when the revamp is done.<br />
<br />
Thats my theory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yah its a revamp. Been posted in a few places, ive read it on the Safehouse message board a few weeks ago. Apparently they are considering putting Veksar in too (the underwater zone leading from lake in LOIO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would really like to see veskar put in bet it would be fun to romp around in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats my theory<br />
<br />
That's where I'd put my money, too.  It's unlikely that they'd have two Plane of Hate zones, especially if they were completely different.  Not sure if it's true or not but I thought I read somewhere that the Test people were invited up to the &quot;new&quot; PoH to explore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love PoH and it's dark gothic buildling.<br />
<br />
I will be very glad to see and update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PoH is one of my favorite zones, bar none. Its silly how easy it is nowadays. A revamp would rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yea i heard about veskar too it would be interesting some of my friends said its proablly going to be like PoWater  yet people 60+ can xp there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">heh..In my 55 levels as a shaman, 52 levels as a druid(yeah I know), and 53 levels as a necro, I've never once been to PoH.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to go and see what it's like before they revamp it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Makes sense, I was reading some of the updates on Stormhammer and they're announcing events based on Innoruuk, which would backup the PoH revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heard they're working on pathing issues also.<br />
<br />
*wants to cheer, but remains suspicious*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">From someone on the test server: <br />
<br />
<br />
I was in Hate v2.0 last night doin some pokin around and testing. They are giving the zone a very nice upgrade. So far im impresssed. <br />
The mobs are basically the same, but some have gotten an upgrade. The layuot is competly different, imagine theold city just expanded and made much bigger. Mobs at zonein are a little weaker then regular Hate mobs, light blue and some greens to 65, but the further you go in, the higher level they become. The mobs areound the enterance are a bit more spaced out and more easily single pulled instead of getting massive trains from bad pathing and proximity aggro. Its gonna be a good place for single groups to get xp of all levels. The devs also were definately thinking about an alternate way of getting there other than having a wiz port your group up. One player mentioned that the best way to alienate and under-utilize a zone was to make it a pain to get to, and this zone looks like one where youd want to go to it on a regular basis. <br />
<br />
[deleted stuff about Ranger epic drop from Inny] <br />
<br />
Inny and the Maestro definately got heavy-duty upgrades. We didnt see inny but we did test Maestro extensively. The devs said hes being tuned to a 4-5 group all 65 encounter. They were still tweaking it but its gonna be similar to the Terris Thule encounter with a twist or 2. We had 6 groups avg lvl 63 and we wiped mutiple times trying to get the hang of it, so they have more tweaking to do. <br />
<br />
Do not worry about the Hate revamp. I think youll like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Cool, PoH needed to be a PoP style zone.  So does PoF.  I hope Inny and Cazic get upgraded and moved to &quot;b&quot; versions of their planes that are geared towards the lvl 61-65 player.  Keep the old &quot;a&quot; versions of POH and PoF around for old times sake and so newbs can have newb planes to go to like in the old days.  Moving Cazic would be a good thing for the newbs tho.  Nobody who kills Cazic needs PoF armor, and newb raids are routinely trampled by more powerful guilds looking to whack Cazic.  Moving him to a higher zone would fix this permanently.  <br />
<br />
Inny's loot has sucked so awfully that there's not been a great number of incidents of the CT sort there.  However, PoH could do without Inny as well if he were moved to a higher plane.  <br />
<br />
I would suggest putting Avatars of Inny and CT in the &quot;a&quot; zones that players could kill for the mediocre loot that those gods now drop.  CT loot in its current state wouldn't lure an uberguild to kill him.  50 hps on a mask?  No way, FT1 is teh suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I heard rumors about the Hate ravamp, inclusion of Veksar and Plane of Mischief revamp. I know the next patch was moved to April Fool's Day - it would be a nice &quot;joke&quot; to be able to play around in PoM a bit.<br />
<br />
Probably won't happen but it is nice to wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">no, in the next patch they're making fungis nodrop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">WTB PoF revamp!<br />
<br />
Please make my god whoop ass again :/.<br />
<br />
/excited :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It would be nice to see Veksar finally, since the designers said it was one of the coolest zones they felt they created.<br />
<br />
Fixing pathing and aggro problems in Hate is a good thing also, but Maestro being boosted to require multiple 65 groups is stupid. Not every player is level 65 and in a goddamn uberguild, and some warriors might actually want their epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Steelbear,<br />
<br />
Didn't you know? Level 65 180 AA PoEb-enabled people are the only ones who count. Epics are so newbie.<br />
<br />
*Cough*</div></div><hr />
