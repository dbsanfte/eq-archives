<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hangman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone done any work on increasing there hand to hand combat skill? Just asking because that is the only skill that I have not worked on and I was wondering if there is any advantage in getting it up to speed.<br />
<br />
I'm not to sure if it is called hand to hand (it maybe called unarmed), but you should know which skil I am talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">75 is the cap (unlike our other skills of 200).  Pretty much, you aren't gonna hit anything with it, and you do damage of like 2-4 with it.  A pretty useless thing to have, but that's never stopped people (including myself =P) before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want to max hand to hand just go to your trainer and drop the 70pp or so it will cost to max it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rgol The Greatspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are only 2 reasons to max out h2h imo<br />
<br />
1.) Charms that get better as you max out all your skills or that get better by maxing out you weapons skills. (even this is just about worthless since thenew pop charm which is greater then any cham i know of)<br />
<br />
2.) Just good old fashion FUN!!! thus what the game is about FUN.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This game is about fun?  Who told you that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What is this fun you speak of? Is it something up coming in the new expantion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FuN? What kind of spell is that and how much mana does it cost? :D</div></div><hr />
