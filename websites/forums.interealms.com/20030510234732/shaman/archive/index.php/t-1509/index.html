<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssirul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the last patch, carnage (effect of the 8th cudgel 40% avatar, duration 6min) doesn't stack with harnessing and still not stacks with focus, str buff. this buff is totally useless with these stacking issues, i think that all owner of this weapon should send a feedback to verant to ask them to reajust stackability of carnage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know i can understand and expected hos to not stack with str and dex do to the fact the higher lvl spells of the same nature didnt. But why cant this stack like harness , str and dex used to? Just feel like its a seperate item you have to work to get and should be treated as a bonus to have to a point instead of a stacking nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think since the effect ia a avatar like spell it should stack like avatar would, and even as in the patch message stated HoS and Avatar now stack, but that makes waaaaay to much sense for verant to figure out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We have much to do.  After all that must be survived to attain this Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients, surely it is a balanced game mechanic to have it Stack with stat buffs...this is no (HoS) that any could easily pick up for a small price, its a major investment and the effect should be equally impressive.  Is the duration bugged? Is it only meant to last  3 minutes or so?  If the Duration is going to be so short, then it must be fixed otherwise its nerfed beyond use.  Plus wasnt this a group buff?  Im eager to hear your thoughts on the effect what it was, is and should be. <br />
<br />
I have already petitioned and reported the bug and will continue daily...lets all do the same!<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is pretty typical for VI at this point.  Most &quot;new&quot; things are just shoveled out there untested and if enough response is generated Verant will look into it and make the change.  We just need to be throwing lots of /bugs and /feedbacks their way.  If you have a GM who will listen to you and log the problem that helps too.<br />
<br />
Is pretty amazing that they gimped stacking and the entire bard class in one fell swoop :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Problem not many own the 8th cudgel and in fact no one to my knowledge on my server even has it yet, i will have it done by the end of the weekend and by the latest tuesday. i ask every shaman who wants to see the class get a freaking break to send a /bug and a /feedback on how the effect stacks with nothing that it should. when it takes 55+ lvl groups and shaman to complete this quest you would think that it might stack with some of our lvl 50+ spells. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Avatar only lasts 1 minute? and this lasts 6 minutes? I thought it was 3 minutes..but 3&gt;1 last time I checked.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's not as bad as we thought..though stacking issues being resolved would be nice.  (I already wrote MY emails to Verant..did you?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Avatar lasts 6 minutes<br />
Avatar proc off primal lasts 3 minutes<br />
Carnage lasts 6 minutes, unless they have broken that also....havent used it since it no longer stacks with HoS.<br />
Never heard it was supposed to be a group buff though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does it use an emerald?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No emerald needed with the cudgel.</div></div><hr />
