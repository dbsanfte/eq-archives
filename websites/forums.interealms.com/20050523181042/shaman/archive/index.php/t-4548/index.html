You can see my response there, but basically it was:<br />
<br />
(on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the lowest) <br />
<br />
1) 1 -- &quot;O look another mana sponge.&quot; &quot;U'r not twinked and in an uber guild?1!1 n000000b!11!&quot; Starting from scratch on TM is not a good idea. <br />
<br />
2) 7 -- Mid-level game is actually pretty fun, IMO. It's mostly twinks of upper levels that farm stuff (just more to their level), but since there are far more upper levels, the pickings aren't too slim. <br />
<br />
3) 5 -- Gonna go mid-way here. It's a blessing and a curse to be high level. On one had, it's great to be high level since you have SO many opportunities and avenues of power open to you. And since a majority of the server is high level, also, pick up groups and such are easy to get into. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, you are either a have or have not; you're either in a can do or can't do guild. Very little in-between. We have basically one guild that can go anywhere and do anything, with several slightly smaller guilds nipping at their heels. But that one guild still is leaps and bounds ahead of even their runners up. <br />
<br />
4) 10 -- Despite all its problems, there's no server I'd rather be on. It is and always will be my home. <br />
<br />
5) 1 -- Economy's shot to hell. It's a buyer's market (although the very top-ticket items still sport a heafty price tag). <br />
<br />
6) Ranger community seems pretty nice, actually. Not as close as the shaman community, IMO, but still pretty cool all around I'd say.<br />
<br />
Anyway, switching instances of &quot;ranger&quot; to &quot;shaman,&quot; how would you rate your server as per these guidelines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hiya Rodahn :)<br />
<br />
I love TM as well...I agree with everything you stated...very well put...<br />
<br />
/hug TM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everyone on solusek ro says its the worst server ever.  I don't have any experience with other servers, but I don't really see what's so bad about it.  It is full of jackasses and idiots, but I have yet to find an internet community that wasn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Server: E'Ci<br />
<br />
1 - friendliness to new shaman  - If they know what they're doing they'll do fine.  Paludral Caves is the new Mid-teens to mid-20s playground.  Which is nice imo, good dungeon experience.<br />
<br />
2 - mid level game - The LOIO/Oasis-Otherthere/S.Karana-Dreadlands loop is still very popular.  However; SolB, LGuk, Jagged Pines, Scarlet Desert, Twilight Sea are still pretty reliable for pick up groups.  The LOIO/FM/OT/KC loop is definately populated with idiots.  If you're going to do KC, get a group, get inside and turn off ooc/shout.<br />
<br />
3 - high level game - 50+ Xp; Seb and Velks are very high level weighted.  Almost impossible to get a group under lvl 55 if you're not a cleric.  Fungi shrooms are perma camped after 5pm est.  However, you can usually find a fighting spot in HS, Chardok, Hole, DN, SG and other more out of the way places.  People on E'Ci seem to hate to walk anywhere.<br />
<br />
As for the Raiding game; E'Ci has a strong 'public' raiding force.  Fear, Hate, and PoG have a monthly raid schedule (however, it's common for Uber guilds to jump in to get to the Plane Bosses and Epic mobs).  There are public raids on Chardok Royals, Plane of Air, CoM, Hole, Kael Arena and even HoT.  There is also a public end game raiding group which takes out Kunark dragons, Vindi, Dain, Tormax, VP and Sleepers.<br />
<br />
There are probably 4 large 'Uber guilds' in the EST/PST range.   There are 2 Asian 'Uber Guilds' on JST.  Only one guild that I know of does Vex Thal, though one of the Asian guilds might be as well.<br />
<br />
4 - fun factor - I love E'Ci.  It has it's share of whiners and idiots.  But most of them seem to shake out of it by the time they make it to the high level game.<br />
<br />
5 - economy - Bazaar has killed low/mid item prices on E'Ci.  However, high end items have increased in price.  Hiero cloak goes for 25k, Lodi Shell for 35k, Fungi Tunic 70k+.  Potions have dropped in price.<br />
<br />
6 - are there lots of high level shaman who are nice to us who are still learning?   Hard to tell, having not been a new shaman in a long time.  However, there are plenty of nice shaman on E'Ci.   We'll give you this address. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Solusek Ro is horrible, it's the only server I've ever seen where I was being called names in 4 languages at once :( I found more friendly helpful people on Rallos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, as I said on the The Glade, from some of the responses there, it seems that every server has its problems.<br />
Still no place I'd rather be, tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solusek Ro can be a horrible server with too many people being too full of themselves and stomping over each others corpses and feelings to get what they want.<br />
<br />
I seldom experienced or heard of different behaviour in high-level raidguilds once the competition gets tight, so I always equated that behavour with the raid-level game of Everquest itself.<br />
<br />
If that isnt true maybe I should rather move servers than avoiding raidguilds like the pox :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sol Ro sucked ass!<br />
thats why I went to Ayonae RO<br />
to bad A Ro sucks too :(<br />
<br />
FV was great, but I can't stand only 1 character :( I need to be able to change if I get bored doing 1 thing, and FV isn't a server that allows that (unless you have like 6 accounts)<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway:<br />
<br />
Ayonae Ro:<br />
- newbie lvls, kinda suck for all classes. full of asshat twinks, who put down true newbie's.<br />
<br />
- mid lvl is ok, just stay away from Kunark areas, and you'll do ok<br />
<br />
- high lvl game, from what I've seen its crowded, and sucks... but I haven't done much high end game stuff as my highest is 48<br />
<br />
-its ok in fun factor<br />
<br />
-economy blows on Ayonae Ro<br />
<br />
- high lvl shamen on Ayonae Ro? 1 or 2 helpful, the rest egotistical asshats<br />
<br />
overall Ayonae Ro recieves: [][][][][][][|  6.5 squares of Toilet paper.</div></div><hr />
