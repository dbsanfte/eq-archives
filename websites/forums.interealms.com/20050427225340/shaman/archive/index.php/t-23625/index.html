The pathing and scripting in PoWar was horrid, so bad that they just scrapped it. Originally from how I understand it, Tallon and Vallon Zek were in PoWar. You got access to PoWar by killing MB. PoWar had some large scale events to finish to gain access to Drunder (Tactics), which had its entrance in PoWar at that time. When they canned PoWar they added the two hallways to either side and put Tallon and Vallon in Tactics. They can't really add it back in now as the reason for it is gone (Tallon and Vallon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought It was the other way around, you killed TZ/VZ and fought RZtW in PoWar.<br />
<br />
Either way the zone looks real cool and the music is real neat, the mp3 is in your EQFolder, its a deeper version of the Drunder music IIRC.</div></div><hr />
