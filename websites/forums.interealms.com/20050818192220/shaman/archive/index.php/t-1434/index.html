<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where can a L24 shaman solo? The bandits at the paludal caverns con low blue, and give very little exp at 24. <br />
<br />
also, where can a L32 monk + L24 shaman duo?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At Level 24, I was soloing Forest Giants in Warsliks Woods. That doesn't mean it's where you should go, but at least there are blues there.<br />
<br />
Duoed with the Monk, why not check out an Antonican dungeon with a hefty experience bonus, like Permafrost, Runnyeye, or Najena?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well not for soloing, and it will be crowded, but I had great fun in the Lake of Ill Omen at that level.  You can certainly solo there, but the most fun can be had venturing into the goblin caves or the Sarnak Fortress with a group.  It is like dungeoneering lite, as you can SoW, and generally escape when things go bad. <br />
It is easily the funnest part of the LoIO, OT,DL exp cycle.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">South Karana should be pretty good at 24th.  The centaurs, aviaks, and gnolls all drop pretty reasonable loot and should be high blue - yellow.  My 24Sk solos there fairly easily and his best twink item is a blackened alloy bastard sword.<br />
<br />
If you find SK to be too difficult, then Lake Rathe is a bit easier and is right next door.  NK is also right there with some slightly lower level stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once paludal caverns greens out, there are a number of options in luclin very near by.<br />
<br />
- Neth Lair -- anything blue to your monk friend would be fine (probably Netherbians). I don't really recommend you soloing in there (Trogs/Fungoids) because the regen often keeps pace with our DOTs, meaning you have to mix in some nukes.<br />
<br />
- Marus Seru -- easy soloing for you here on rockhoppers. Would probably be fine to duo as well (on rockhoppers, possibly stonegrabbers).<br />
<br />
- Dawnshroud Peaks -- better when you both get some levels under your belt, but Zelinaks here will be good once your monk friend gets to about 35 I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd check out Neth Lair and Marus Seru, then think about trying old world hunting spots if those don't work out. (Exp at these levels seems insanely fast on Luclin however, even after being spoiled by the exp in Paludal).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I liked hunting in Marus Seru this places seemed crazy xp and me and a friend sk just duo'd there from 25-30..while the xp flies theres no loot what so ever...be carful of those stupid horse thinges...if you can see them then that means you are in aggro range hehe....lightcrawlers are sow speed also...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you, andrewe. Those are excellent suggestions.  I did pop into netherbian lair myself last night, and the low levels there are dark blue to me.  However, your correct.  I managed to kill one at the expense of about 70% mana, which would be painfully slow soloing.  However, if they con to my friend, then we could duo there easily. <br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />
