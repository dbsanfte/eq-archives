<br />
In Flanders Fields the poppies blow<br />
Between the crosses, row on row,<br />
That mark our place; and in the sky<br />
The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br />
Scarce heard amid the guns below.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are the Dead. Short days ago<br />
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br />
Loved, and were loved, and now we lie<br />
In Flanders fields.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take up our quarrel with the foe:<br />
To you from failing hands we throw<br />
The torch, be yours to hold it high.<br />
If ye break faith with us who die<br />
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br />
In Flanders fields<br />
-John McCrae<br />
<br />
This poem was published in 1915 by a Canadian soldier serving in the First World War. On this day Novemeber 11, which marks the anniversary of the end the First World War, I urge you all to remember those who have died throughout the course of history to defend the freedom of those who would come after them.<br />
<br />
On the 11th hour, of the 11th day of the 11th month, the guns fell silent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">November 11 in Australia is called Rememberance Day.  At 11am the nation comes to a halt, and the people of Australia stand still for a minute's silence, where they reflect on the people who went to War for their countries.  In Returned Service Leagues all over the nation a lone bugle will play The Last Post.  We have Rememberance Poppies which can be purchased for the couple of weeks prior, where the proceeds go to the RSL for the ongoing care of families of soldiers, and these are worn proudly on Rememberance Day.<br />
