<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelric Stormwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is getting ready to crawl Kaesora tonight, and I was wondering if anyone had any pointers to share?<br />
<br />
We'll be anywhere from 6-12, levels 35-54 (most in the 35-45 range), all classes (might be missing an enchanter, but at least one bard, probably 2), all pretty used to working together. Is there anything in particular we should do/avoid? Any specific strategies we should employ? Anything unusual we should know?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lemilynia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really enjoy Kaesora, and you should be in pretty good shape for the frenzy room and the library, church might be tough.   When you hit the frenzy room (spiders and an amoeba) you'll want crowd control as the whole room aggros.   After it is cleared out, head through the hidden door and down the hall towards the library.   These you can clear easily.   At the library clear the front area before setting up at the fountain.    Both the spiders and undead include healers, the spiders also have necros.<br />
<br />
Get a good map.   The following I saved from a thread on Kaesora.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you zone in and go down the ramp there is an option to go right left or straight. To your right is where you come when you zone out. Straight ahead is two drops. If you lev down to level 2 there is only one mob there. If you fall all the way down you will be surrounded by about 5 spiders. One possible named spider. My suggestion is to make a left and fall one level. When you hit bottom do not open any doors. You will be standing in a doorway one mob and pit to your left and the frenzy room to your right and a door straight ahead.<br />
Pull the one on your left (watch out for the pit) and then pull the three from the frenzy room. After those 4 are done move into the frenzy room. There will be one closed door and one door way. There will be one you can pull from past the doorway and two that are behind the door.<br />
<br />
Kill the two from behind the door and move into that room. In there will be a false wall that leads to the library. Past the wall is all undead. At the bottom of the first ramp will be three undead mobs. Head past the other ramp and there will be another three mobs. Turn the corner and down the hall is the library. Avoid camping in the library itself. Three good spots to camp is 1. Right at end of hall where only one mobs pops, 2. Pull to the fountain area in front of the library, 3. After you clear library head through the library to the back stairs behind it.<br />
<br />
Try and bring an evacer to get out. If you need to work way out then go back up to the frenzy room and go through the one doorway with the one mob. Make a left and you will see a huge open pit. Drop down to find 2-3 more mobs. If you continue straight, that will be the way out. If you turn around, then you are headed towards the church.</div></div><hr />

Heh, yeah, I found the same thread... we got a bit lost, but had a great time, no deaths! Only came across a Tombcarver out of the &quot;special&quot; loot, but that didn't detract any :)<br />
<br />
We took a couple wrong turns and jumped down the wrong pit, but did finally end up at the Library... where, while fighting on the steps, we managed to aggro everything inside and all the way around! Well, with some awesome teamwork, judicious use of the /assist key, and a refusal to panic, we cleared everything there and survived! Ended up staying through a full repop too (in fact, the entrance to the cave popped twice). Folks had to leave about then, so we gated/ported out.<br />
<br />
Everyone had such a good time, I think we're going back in tonight! :D</div></div><hr />
