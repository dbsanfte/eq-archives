<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HELP! My wife and I just bought 2 new GeForce 6800's and in EQ2 they freeze up for a half second every 5 seconds! We can't play this way!<br />
<br />
I've tried with the 61.xx driver and the latest 66.93 driver running DirectX9.0c..<br />
<br />
We're running Intel Pentium 4HT systems with 865PERLK Intel Motherboards and a Gig of DDR3400 ram.<br />
<br />
This **** should scream, but it just doesn't.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
It worked nicely with my wife's old ATI Radeon 9800 Pro. (But we thought we were &quot;Upgrading&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go the the control panel, then go to display.  From there click on advanced to bring up all the options for the card.  Click on the tab that says GeForce 6800.  In the picture of the nvidia logo or whatever, what does it say for the BIOS version?  If the number ends in a 14, you may have a bad bios.  You can &quot;flash&quot; the card to the right one, but I'm not sure how comfortable you would be doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">go to guru3d.com and download rivatuner.<br />
install it<br />
load it up<br />
click the customize button under your video card.  a few graphic tabs will come up.  click the one that looks like a mini video card.<br />
click the agp tab<br />
turn fastwrite to off.<br />
hit apply.<br />
your set.<br />
<br />
you will need to do this everytime you reboot the system.<br />
<br />
alternetavely you can go right into your bios on boot up and look for agp fastwrite and turn that off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh.  I bought the same card.  However, I was unable to use it, because my system is underpowered, and I wasn't able to upgrade, because my power supply is proprietary, and the case is too small.  I just returned it and got a 9550 ATI.  Seems to run fine now, with p4, 2.0 mhz, 1 gig of ram.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesn’t matter.<br />
<br />
I returned the cards and purchased two ATI Radeon 9800 Pro’s and got much better performance without having to update any BIOS, or download any tweaking software etc.<br />
<br />
I did however flash my motherboard bios and the 6800 card bios’s in my attempts to fix the issue in the 4 hours I spent two nights ago.<br />
<br />
I don’t want a card that wasn’t ready for commercial release and has to be hacked to make work. I want one that’s “Plug and Play”.. which for me (And a vast majority of the users in the forums I studied while trying to solve this) was to buy ATI.<br />
<br />
I’ll be picking up some x800’s after the first of the year.<br />

I hear you there :)  I've gotten to that point too.  All the tinkering and experimenting I used to do with parts and settings at home I've given up because I have enough headaches at work due to computer troubleshooting.  I just buy stuff I know will work well, be compatible, and have a nice warranty.</div></div><hr />

If you think the Radeon 9800 is a better card than a GeForce 6800, you're incredibly behind the times. I'm not arguing ATI vs. NVIDIA, I'm just saying the 9800 is a full generation behind the 6800, and it's no where near as fast.<br />

I'm a Computer and Network Technician for a bank bud.  I do have a &quot;pretty fair&quot; idea of what is what.<br />

I can get a 9800 for less than half of what the newest generations go for and get very acceptable performance.</div></div><hr />

Being a tech for a bank doesn't guarantee you know what you're doing. I've done tech work for a bank and a mortgage compay previously, there are just as many clueless techs in that industry as the others I've worked in (manufacturing and oil &amp; gas).<br />
<br />
In anycase, I'm sorry I misunderstood you. It looked like you were comparing the two. I'll concede that NVIDIA doesn't have any decent solutions at the moment in the sub-$200 range, if that's what you're shooting for.<br />

He said it performs better. Guess what.<br />
<br />
It DOES perform better. I don't care if the 6800 is 9,023,245 generations newer. It's a piece of crap and should have been further bug tested before it was released.<br />
<br />
That's not just my opinion. It's the opinion of thousands of frustrated people that have tried downloading newer Motherboard and Video card BIOS's, downloaded Riva Tuner hacks and shutting off various features to get this card to work right out of the box.<br />
<br />
It's junk.<br />
<br />
I traded it back in and got an ATI 9800 pro for much less money and my frame rates skyrocketted compared to the bugged 6800.<br />
<br />
The 9800's were $250.00-ish cards.. if I want to spend more, I'll get the x800's.</div></div><hr />

No, the NVidia 6800 is not crap, but many of them aren't functioning properly with EQ2.  Hopefully that issue will be resolved soon for all the 6800 owners that barely even get Geforce4 quality in EQ2.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say that NVidia dropped the ball though since the problem with the 6800's really is just EQ2 and the blame hasn't been placed yet.  The 6800's absolutely scream in any other game.<br />
<br />
As for price, nothing new there.  You never get the best bang for the buck with any new piece of computer hardware.  The ATI 9800pro and ATI 9600xt are a GREAT bargain.  NVidia 6600gt's are also very well priced as are  the NVidia 5700 (non LE's).  If you have a PCIE mboard, also make sure to check out ATI X300's and X600's.</div></div><hr />

To that end, NVIDIA did release new drivers mid-last week that were supposed to correct a lot of the issues some 6800 users were having with EQ2. I've got a 6800 myself and hadn't noticed any graphics lag during beta or the first week of release, but I have friends that were having problems that said the new drivers cleaned things up.<br />

It's not Everquest 2. That card can't play most games.<br />
<br />
A quick check on Google shows:<br />
This guy (http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?p=796064#post796064) can't even get Windows to load on it without garbled display.<br />
<br />
 This guy (http://www.videocard-forum.com/nvidia/Geforce_6800_Problems_424321.html) got better performance in Doom3 from his 5600 than his spiffy new 6800.<br />
<br />
This guy (http://www.techimo.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-124277.html) can't play Far Cry on his new 6800 even after updating all his drivers. People even suggested downloading junk and editing INI files and turning down features to get it to run right. (NOT what a new card should require.)<br />
<br />
This guy (http://www.nvmax.com/?action=forum_messages;num=841;upit=1) Runs LINUX and can't run Max Payne or Mafia. So it's not even a Windows specific thing.<br />
<br />
This guy  (http://www.tbreak.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25521) Bought his new card and couldn't get Far Cry to work better than it was on his fx5200 AFTER doing the tweaks that the geeks in the forum mentioned.<br />
<br />
No.. it's not EQ2. In fact, Sony has the NVIDIA logo on the splash screen every time you launch Everquest. You would think the two companies would work together to test their products with each other, if not just for general compatability.<br />
<br />
I run an Intel Motherboard and all name brand gear. There's no reason for the card to not work in my system. Yet it didn't.<br />
<br />
If it worked for you, then you are 1 out of 100 buyers that had such luck.<br />
<br />
The card sucks.<br />
(And this is coming from a person that has been purchasing NVidia products exclusively since the Riva chip was invented.)<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
Did a quick search on Google for ATI 9800 problems as well.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can find problems, but 90% of them end in &quot;Oh, the card was bad and I got a new one and it works great&quot; or &quot;I upgraded from an NVidia card to an ATI card and my computer crashes... oh, I found out that if you don't surgically remove the NVidia drivers it screws up the system.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very few problems beyond previous driver errors, defective part or missing DirectX/Drivers.<br />
<br />
Nobody claiming to have to download tweaking programs to hack it to work properly.<br />
<br />
P.P.S<br />
I tried the Beta drivers from NVidia. It didn't help things for me.<br />
<br />
I'm happy the card works for you. It's just not the case for far too many others, through no fault of their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1/100 buyers that have had their systems work?  I would say for other games more often than not they work.  If the 6800's had serious problems with every game then all the tech forums would be filled with those posts.  My observation has been that the 6800's don't really suffer from any more compatibility issues than previous cards have when they are first released, with the exception of EQ2.  There are a lot of EQ2 players pulling their hair out because of the 6800's they bought for the game.  ATI does have an edge in compatibility and stability it seems though and the 6800 problems don't help, but I just wouldn't call it a crap card.<br />
<br />
Look through those forums you linked for people who don't have 6800's and still have various problems, they are just as numerous.<br />
<br />
As for the logo, that's just advertising.  I think they also advertise Dell.  Was EQ2 designed with Dells specifically in mind?  No.  Hyper-Threading isn't even supported in EQ2 either, which is one of the logos too (either on the box, or website - somewhere I think :)).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine that moves like that will help Intel or NVidia though.<br />
<br />
In case you haven't found the EQ2 tech help forums, check here (http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board?board.id=tech_support&amp;no_redir=true) .  There was just today a response from Sony about the 6800 problems too, stating at least that they have informed NVidia and are awaiting a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you like em, then cool.<br />
<br />
I spent 4 grueling hours of my life pouring through volumes of forums on how to &quot;Fix&quot; the 6800's for games like Far Cry, EQ2, Doom 3 and many many more.<br />
<br />
That's great that they are near a fix for the problem. It still means they wasted my time in a huge way by releasing a product that wasn't ready for market.<br />
<br />
Whether that means it wasn't 100% DirectX 9.0c compatible, or had some OpenGL problems or perhaps had some Direct3D or DirectDraw issues. (I read somewhere that people had really great luck by downloading Rivatuner and turning off Fastwrite on the cards.)<br />
<br />
Whatever the bug.. it means the card wasn't really ready for retail sale, and probably worked on most older things that didn't push the cards advertised capabilities.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it was a desperate move by the part of the NVidia marketing dept to come up with an answer to Radeon beating them a few months prior.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't be surprised if the 6800 was on the verge of being recalled if they didn't come up with a fix quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Maddcovv2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Again, I bet you got an off brand or something.. did you get a BFG? PNY? or what I am curious to know.  Nvidia didnt release a buggy product, the manufacter of your card may have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">PNY was the manufacturer of the card I bought. It was the &quot;Name brand&quot; card that CompUSA was touting as the latest and greatest.<br />
<br />
I plugged it into my Intel D865PERLK Motherboard with my Intel P4HT CPU and my Kingston RAM in my 450 Watt system that have had no trouble running my old GeForce2 4400Ti or my ATI Radeon 9800 Pro.<br />
<br />
While there were plenty of disgruntled PNY users, that wasn't the only brand mentioned in the threads (I'm a little short on time to lookup more things atm.) but a common theme in the threads was that getting another Make/Model/Brand of card fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
My wife and I had two identical computers that were put together within the last 3 months. We bought identical 6800 cards and installed them on the same day. Both exhibited the exact same problem.<br />
<br />
The stuttering and jittering and lagging that even older cards didn't have.<br />
<br />
Is PNY notorious for making crap cards? (I really don't know)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would just like to add.<br />
<br />
I tried every fix in the book. I downloaded tons of drivers and patches and tweaked settings in my Operating system and BIOS. It was far more work than any retail consumer product should require.<br />
<br />
There's no substitute for personal experience, and there's nothing you can say that will give me my 4 hours back. (6 if you count swapping cards 3 times and having to return the bad ones)<br />
<br />
Thus there is nothing that can be done to really sway my soured opinion on that product.<br />
<br />
NVidia released a lot of great products, and I've purchased about 5 generations worth exclusively.<br />
<br />
After this last one though, I won't be giving them any more of my money, unless the competition fails to deliver in an even worse fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kronas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Got a gains 6800 gt golden sample, work fantastic right of the box.  One thing i have noticed is that those that have alot of issues with the 6800 are not looking at the power requirements.  Alot of the newer generation motherboard, processors and video cards suck up power.  250 watt power supplies with 4amps on the 12volt line just dont hack it for cutting edge equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, I bought a new case. <br />
<br />
I don't keep up on the latest and greatest for cases in the world, but I bought it from a local hardcore gaming shop, it's got neon lights and fan ports everywhere and glass panels and according to the clerk, the 450 watt power supply in it was a solid make and model.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is PNY that makes flaky models. In which case they shouldn't be allowed to use the name if they can't make it right.</div></div><hr />

I may try the new drivers though and see how that does.<br />

<br />
Other than that though, I've not had a problem with it.  It's kinda funny reading someone bitch about an Nvidia card for poor compatibility/stability.  That's been the hallmark of ATI for a long while now.  (great hardware, piss poor drivers)  I guess everyone has their screwups from time to time though, except SOE who seems to screw up something every time. :p</div></div><hr />
