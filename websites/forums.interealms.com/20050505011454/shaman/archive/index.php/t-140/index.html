Lol Krakster, just incase you were wondering my nuts are still just as big as ever :D<br />
<br />
Just incase anyone is wondering Krakster said in a similar thread that it makes your nuts shrink :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And at level 48 even!  Gratz!  I didn't get mine till 55.  And yes, you're gonna click a hole in it faster than a fat lady falls from a skyscraper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I spent about 15k on mine...courtesty of the new auction channel. Course it took some time to get to EC from the Grey.<br />
<br />
Works out rather nicely, I'm getting over some of the guild from sinking nearly all my money on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trokus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Got mine for 7kpp on Quellious...no idea how fubared my server is, but this selling was depsparate, trying to scrounge money for Cobalt legs, or maybe just clueless. I was happy either way. Strange thing was, she had been trying to sell it for 2 days straight, and no one took it for 7k. Took me 2 days to sell most of my garbage to be able to afford it. Now I just need to wait till it works :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Taarne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wooot! Grats!<br />
<br />
*Is one damn lucky guy, got one too at lvl 42*<br />
<br />
On Innoruuk, I traded a lammy, lupine dagger, 600pp plus other stuff worth 500-1000pp for one. Damn I'm lucky, woot lol :)<br />
<br />
Somehow got inspiration to play the shaman instead of an alt, and leveled to 44 in two days :) I _will_ hit 45 tomorrow! Yes I will! I will! Muahahahah! :D<br />
<br />
Humm. Anyone know a good place to solo with a bracer at 45? I've been doing the spiders in Nurga, but they are a bit mind numbing and would like to get far far away from that place. Are Bloodgills in LoIo any good, hum? Any suggestions, please?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rotbone Binkbonk, 44th level Shaman<br />
Innoruuk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Bloodgills in LoIO got me a level every 5-6 hours from 45 to 50 with JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tuxman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Grats man the best thing imho you will ever get we Shamen call this a rite of passage your now a real player!!!:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just got one at 43. :D Paid 10kpp for it, which was the second one I've seen for that price in about 3 months (didn't have the cash for the first one). Welded it to my wrist last night.<br />
<br />
On a completely different note, I went home and bought and memmed my 44 spells, then decided to go see if I could kill an ice giant. I attempted tanking for my pet - got it to around 1/3 life before having to run. Tried root rooting it - go it to around 1/3 life before running out of mana. Killed it with some help then.<br />
<br />
At that point I gave up. Anyone managed to kill one of these suckers at 44? I guess I could pet kite, but well, that would take ages, and I don't like running away! Are these guys completely resistant to cold DDs? I didn't try, but that would certainly make it possible if they're not at 45<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
