<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Takiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been in DP seemingly forever and the leveling is getting pretty slow on Zelniaks.  I just want somewhere to go that is FUN!  I don't care about loot and as long as the XP is decent, that's fine.  Maybe a fun quest i could do solo at my level?   A particularly fun zone?  Just getting really bored with EQ and trying to find something to do other than level.  (not interested in tradeskills either)<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I was level 32 when I quit playing the first time. Now my reroll is at 32 again on the FV server it's been great. anyway enough about me.<br />
<br />
Have you started your Ivy Etched Quests yet? Short Sword of Morin quest is soloable for you also. Get in groups as much as possible. Possibly entertain the thought of joining a guild.<br />
<br />
 Do some dungeon crawling also. Just explore as much as you can. You're at the perfect level to see some of the world now with SoW and etc. I'm not sure why you don't like tradeskilling but fletching and bowering is almost required for Rangers.<br />
<br />
Just a few suggestions for you. Good luck.<br />
