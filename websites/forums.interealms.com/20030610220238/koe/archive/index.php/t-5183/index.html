<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not included in the patch message was the change to /who. No longer can you list a guild with &quot;/who all g20&quot;, instead, you must type out the entire name in quotes such as &quot;/who all 'Ring of the Eight Virtues'&quot; for example. I liked being able to list my guild without having to type nearly as mucn. Can this be put back in?<br />
Also about the Velious Scion, I think it's great! But it's confusing the way it works, and if you want to go to odus for example now, you can't just run up to the portals and go grab a beer or whatever until they fire off. Are there any plans to patch the Nexus zone to add another spire room? The zone file is smaller than the eqgame.exe file that is downloaded every patch, so the download size would not be a problem.<br />

Sorry about that.<br />
<br />
This is probably a side effect of some code that we needed to change. There was a conflict with the / all g and the petition system. Too much coder stuff to translate…<br />
<br />
You can still use the command, but you need to type out the 'guild' part in full.<br />
<br />
So in your example you can use:<br />
<br />
/who all guild20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seran Swiftstrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was fiddling with this last night.  You have to put &quot;guild&quot; in all caps, or it won't work.  /who all GUILD63, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">About the /who all g#... I talked to one of the coders about that at the faire, it's a side effect that will be resolved on next patch</div></div><hr />
