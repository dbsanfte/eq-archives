<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a newer player.  I have only been playing EQ for about 10 months and have leveled fast considering I had no clue what I was doing when I started.  I just recently dinged 69 and am now seriously thinking about aa's and the path I want to take.<br />
<br />
I belong to a family type casual raiding guild.  Though recently we've been raiding tier 2 pop and some tier 3 stuff.  We are slowly progressing and if things go the way they have been I'm sure I'll be getting close to elemental access soon.<br />
<br />
I want to focus on raiding with my aa's.  We have a limited number of druids, so I find myself helping out with healing alot.  There are about 5 or 6 other regular raiding shamen in guild, so I am not going it alone in this.  I've asked for advice from my guildies, but I also thought I'd ask here.  Everyone seems so knowledgable, and I value your advice.<br />
<br />
If you could kind of point me in the right direction here.  I currently have 43 aa's.  41 spent and 2 banked.  My first purchase must be pet hold as we've been having issues on raids and they have made it a mandatory aa for all pet classes.  After that I am wide open for everything.  <br />
<br />
These are the aa's I currently have:<br />
<br />
run3<br />
regen3<br />
mc3<br />
canni5<br />
mgb<br />
planar power2<br />
rc1<br />
mnemonic retention (extra spell gem)<br />
<br />
Basically some advice.  I will be back up healing some on raids.  Sometimes I am healer for my group during raids.  Just a little nudge in the right direction is what I'm looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14626</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are a number of threads here on the crucible that detail AAs, and opinions of what AAs are needed...and Samanna has one of the best references available for our class. (1 of 4 websites I keep running in my background for reference, Alla's, EQTraders, Lucy, and Samanna's Reference Desk)<br />
<br />
depending on how seriously you are healing, I'd consider getting quick buff AAs, 1 second of casting time can mean life or death for some. also consider your regular healing AAs (healing gift, healing adept and adv. healing AAs).<br />
<br />
SCR, &amp; SCRM are typical wanted AAs since our class is needed for buffs, longer lasting spells=less recast=more mana saved.<br />
<br />
Natural Durability is another very strong consideration. More HP is something anyone can use, especially a shaman.<br />
<br />
and since you've arleady started radiant cure, I'd go ahead and finish it out, if you're starting to raid in tier 3, you'll need to be able to cure some of the DoTs in future fights.<br />
<br />
these are just options that I see may be vital if I were in your situation. at the moment, I have fewer AA's than you do, but my AA path is simply determined by my perogative of what I believe I need at a given time. I made the decision to grind to 70 before starting AAs again, I'm now 69, and will ding 70 pretty soon. hope my view has helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, thanks. <br />
<br />
Correction, though: I don't believe that the Quickbuff AA will help on any direct heals - only on beneficial spells with a duration (buffs).<br />
<br />
My picks are in bold at http://samanna.net/general/aas.shtml - but that doesn't suggest an order. There have been hundreds of order suggestions, but really, it's not all about perceived efficiency all the time. I suggest you figure out what role you play most of the time - healer, buffer, dotter, nuker... whatever - and work those AAs.<br />
<br />
Caveat: the Archetype AAs give absolutely the best bang for the buck at first level. For 2 AAs each, I'd get the first level of all the ones you want before getting the second level of any of them.<br />
<br />
And yeah, sometimes VP really is teh win. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My advice would be to save your AAs for those that need level 70 - both Call of the Wild and Spiritual Channeling blow everything else you could get now out of the water, with the possible exception of Spellcasting Mastery. You still have time for the healing AAs later (and more mana will also help with the heals).<br />
<br />
Personally I would rather go without dogdog for a while then use 5 AAs on pet hold at your AA count, especially for raids.<br />
<br />
My advice would be:<br />
1. Spellcasting Mastery 3<br />
2. Call of the Wild<br />
3. Spiritual Channeling<br />
4. Group-heal-AA-with-the-name-I-always-forget<br />
5. Healing AAs<br />
6. Tanking AAs<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Quickbuff will indeed only help anything with a buff icon - it pretty much only works on our HoTs (and the buffs, but who cares about cutting off a second's worth of casting time on these?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">4. Group-heal-AA-with-the-name-I-always-forget<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We have a limited number of druids, so I find myself helping out with healing alot. ... I will be back up healing some on raids.  Sometimes I am healer for my group during raids.<br />
<br />
If your role as healer is honestly your primary role in your guild on raids, and in groups, your priorities ought to include the following:<br />
1. Quick Buff 2 (at least)<br />
2. Healing Adept 3<br />
3. Advanced Healing Adept 3<br />
4. Spell Casting Reinforcement<br />
5. Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
6. Radiant Cure 2 (at least)<br />
<br />
Our heals are terrible, but with the above and an Improved Healing 4 focus item or tribute (which can go to IH5 now) you should do just fine.  Pet AA's ... why bother wasting the mana to pull up puppy on a raid? Let the necros/mages/beastlords worry about pet AA's, IMO.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of AA that I would not pass up:<br />
Virulent Paralysis 3<br />
Call of the Wild<br />
Spiritual Channeling<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Spell Casting Mastery<br />
Innate Defense<br />
Lightning Reflexes<br />
etc.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
There are dozens upon dozens of threads on AA's, and a good one in the medicine cabinet, not to mention Samanna's site. Read up!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, as a raid shaman, I value:<br />
<br />
MGB - which you have<br />
SCR/SCRM  - if you're a small guild and you're the only shaman online, you're going to want your buffs to last. Also, if you're helping to heal, SCRM will extend Heals over Time.<br />
RC 1-3  - can be a lifesaver<br />
Quickbuff 2  - If you're the only shaman online, you're going to want fast buffs. It also makes your HOTs cast faster which can help<br />
Ancestral Aid  - If you're in a small raid force, every MGB-able HOT can save the day. Also, extremely useful in exp groups for &quot;oh **** moments&quot;<br />
COTW  - Shaman rez, I love anything that adds to our abilities.<br />
Healing Adept/Healing Gift - I love the heal AAs, shaman heals are better than they used to be, but adding these AAs really makes them shine. Nothing like landing a 5K crit on a tank at the exact right moment<br />
<br />
There are tons and tons of useful AA you're going to want to get, it's just a matter of priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Slightly off topic from AAs, but in keeping with raid healing.<br />
<br />
I see you have Blood of Nadox. Nice<br />
<br />
I shall never stop feeling stupid for waiting so many many months past level 52 for getting that spell.<br />
It is truly a nice spell, and I've had to go eat my hat over how little I thought of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think you guys are right about the pet.  Honestly, when raiding IF I have my pet up, he's usually not buffed anyway.  I tend to be too busy buffing the acutal players and neglect him.  He usually winds up dead from an AE or something anyway.  I don't usually waste the mana to heal him if I am healing my group.<br />
<br />
I may wait a bit to get pet hold, and kill him off if I need to.<br />
<br />
My healing mostly consists of patch heals, keeping the clerics upright etc.  Shamans are usually on rampage duty if there is a CH chain going.  I guess my role changes with each raid.  <br />
<br />
We were backflagging last night and did Behe.  I was in Behe group to slow and debuff, but also threw around some heals when the dps got hit with his AE.  I was the only shaman there and It sucked having to buff the whole raid myself.  Especially with the new buffs.  As much as everyone hated it, I only used the OoW buffs for the 2 Behe groups, as it would have taken me FOREVER to buff each person with Wunshi and Fortitude, then hit all the melee with Might.  Though we have 6 regular shamen over level 65 I was the only one who could make it last night.  Makes me want to get QB very soon.<br />
<br />
Hehe. I just got Blood of Nadox a few weeks ago.  My guild went and killed Murkglider School Leader in NC and you should have seen me running around casting 2x Disinfecting Aura on each person in my group.  I went the next day and did the quest.  When I checked the message boards, the guild leader had posted that Blood of Nadox was now a required spell for all shamen in guild.  It was nice to be able to post that I had just gotten the spell 2 mins after he posted it was required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a serious pet peeve of mine.<br />
<br />
I can't open your magelo here, so I don't know anything by way of your  spells, but here's how it works. When you're the only shaman, you MGB FO7 and group-by-group Talisman of the Boar (if you have Talisman of Fortitude, that's great). Then you go through and hit TANKS with Wunshi and single-target Fortitude (if you don't have group version). If you got the mana (and the spell), hit up Sense on the raid, group-by-group. If you still have some mana and the spell, and are feeling incredibly generous, hit Might on the DPS'ers. That's a lot of buffing, and it will be mana intensive. If it comes down to it, forget about Sense/Might and do FO7/Wunshi/STA. Spiritual Channeling helps with this.<br />
<br />
If anybody bitches, tell them folks have done POP targets with POP buffs for years and been successful. Then put up an AFK message that says something along the lines of: &quot;Unless you've died and want rebuffs, you are raiding with what you got on your body. Live with it.&quot;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well, at one point I was the ONLY shaman in an AD raid, before OoW.<br />
<br />
I still haven't gotten MGB AA because I don't do many raids, but at that time, I really wish I had gotten it, because nearly every person in the raid was anal about having themselves &quot;buffed out&quot;...<br />
<br />
I can't say I've ever had more attention from so many people, three necros trying to twitch me at the same time, couple of bards playing mana song and the clerics healing me everytime my life went down a percent or two from canni4...<br />
<br />
the raid did well for an open raid, but wiped when AD hit 1%...and as the typical open raid fashion, fell apart before a second attempt could be mounted...ah, the memories..lol<br />
<br />
but thats the limit of my hijacking of this thread..<br />
<br />
I've already given my perception of what AA's I'd go for in your situation..QB3 may not effect a direct heal, but having a faster casting Q, or if you will get it soon, Serenity, can make a big difference...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tordail-<br />
thats about what I did.  I eventually had to go &quot;afk: I will be buffing you, please be patient&quot;<br />
<br />
I made sure the MT was fully buffed will OoW buffs and MGB'd Fo7, did Talisman of the Boar on all the groups (we had about 35 peeps in raid), Sense in groups, diaku, wrulan and I even threw Blessing of Replenishment on a few groups with necro's in them.<br />
<br />
After we were done with Behe we went and spanked AD also, but luckily for me another shaman (our class leader) showed up and buffing wasn't nearly as difficult.  <br />
<br />
I'm gonna work on quick buffing and some mana preservation.  After I do that I'm gonna work on some healing aa's.  But once I get 70 I think the first thing I'll get is Call of the Wild.  Last night someone trained us when we were gathering for AD and it would have come in really handy to get a cleric back to us sooner for rezzes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One thing you may want to consider before starting to buy AAs is to check your bottlenecks, i.e. focus on your limits (not weaknesses).<br />
<br />
You say on raids you mainly heal. When you do this do people die because you can not heal fast enough? - Get Ancestral Aid (ha! I remembered), Healing Adept and/or Healing Gift. Do people die because you run out of mana? - Get Spiritual Channeling or Spellcasting Mastery. Or do you die yourself because you get aggro from healing? - Get Spellcasting Subtlety or one of the tanking AAs.<br />
<br />
Likewise for buffs, is the limiting factor your mana, your cast time or your patience? Back when Canna 5 was new many members of this board used to tell freshly-raiding shamans to get canna 5 before MGB - because it helps you buff a raid better then MGB does. Similarly Spiritual Channeling and Spellcasting Mastery will probably help your buffing more then SCR will and at the same time they will help your healing more then the Healing Adept and Healing Gift AAs (albeit in terms of stamina, not speed).<br />
<br />
Or you could take the advice I once got in a different game: &quot;Just use all the broken crap&quot;. For us shamans these gamebreakers are cannibalize 5, spiritual channeling and those AAs that give us abilities we can not get from our spells (group heal, group cure, etc). Only after you got the gamebreakers focus on what you were going to.</div></div><hr />
