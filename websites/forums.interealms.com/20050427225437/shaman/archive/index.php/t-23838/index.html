<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone that was planning to use Vicus Nonad in SQeynos for factioning up for VP quests, be aware that his faction hit has seemingly been modified.  When I did it with my shaman, took me about 6 hours to max ally.  Doing it the last couple of days for my girlfriend's rogue - and we're at 24 hours and still going.  We've checked her faction twice, and it IS progressing faster than an equal number of kills in Mistmoore - but it's not the easy-out like it was.<br />
<br />
Just an FYI.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Agassa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*grumble*Another fast way to get RoS faction &quot;patched&quot;...but anyway, how far did you get in 24? Did you constantly camp the mob?<br />
Did you try Kaladim King kills for RoS faction(&quot;patched&quot; too)?<br />
I just want to know if there is a better way out there  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I needed the faction for my shaman, I just left myself standing within agro range of the guy (yes he will attack you if you're KOS) and let me dog kill him as he repopped.<br />
<br />
When my g/f's rogue needed it, we set her up in the same spot so he would agro her, and then I used the Autofire utility (available at the Ranger's Glade... do a search in their forums) to run a standard hotkey that had:<br />
<br />
/assist Rogue<br />
/pause 5<br />
/pet attack<br />
<br />
That would have my pet assist target the rogue and kill the dude as he popped.<br />
<br />
Using this method, the guy was never up more than 30 seconds before being killed.<br />
<br />
At that rate of kills, it took about 36 hours.  He spawns every ~6 minutes.  That's 10 kills per hour for 36 hours = 360 kills.  Hell of a lot better than killing off Mistmoore over and over - but it's still a lengthy process.  If it weren't for Autofire, I would have shot myself in the head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">would be nice if soe werent so dense to realize that by nerfing this kinda stuff they turn mistmoore into a useless zone for all the lower level characters that would normaly hunt there.</div></div><hr />
