<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
<br />
Thought this might be of interest to all you fellow shaman. I recently did a parse of my log file and thought I would post the results here. <br />
<br />
First, here is a little information that might be useful:<br />
<br />
- the start date on the log file was May 16th, 2002<br />
- the end date was May 17th, 20003<br />
- the log file size is 185mb<br />
- at the start of the log file i was lvl 60, i am currently lvl 65 and have been for a number of months<br />
- i have been in 2 guilds during the log file, both where/are high end content raiding guilds<br />
<br />
Anyway, here are the stats................<br />

35%+ on malosinia and 50%+ on sini?  double yuck =)<br />
<br />
Interesting info, you summon beer more often than you haste people =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What tool did you use to generate this information?  I would like to parse my own log (which is on a smaller scale, since I delete it every few weeks, but the information would still be interesting to me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">why the hell did you cast group cha so damn much? even more then focus?! =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Probably for junk buffs.  He dd mention hes in a raiding guild, and group-cha is one of the best junk buffs available.</div></div><hr />

My guess would be to crap buff its really good on raids with dispelling mobs<br />
<br />
Slain                                                           442<br />
Resurrected                                                 476<br />

You were resurrected more then u were killed? :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can resurrect the same corpse multiple times.  For example:<br />
<br />
Getting out of VP before the gate fix:<br />
<br />
Raid done, die in VP with gear<br />
Run back naked, die outside<br />
Get a rez, leave corpse (used to be annoying when you had to summon something so you could leave a corpse)<br />
Zone in naked, get your corpse with gear summoned to zone/rez/loot<br />
Get your dressed self rezzed back to the corpse outside (2 rezzes for the same corpse)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The tool that i used was EQTools. You can get it here...http://cscott.home.mindspring.com/eqtools/<br />
<br />
I casted group cha so much for 2 reasons, first, like you guys said it is a really good crap buff. Second, there is a fight in ssra where the ae effect will overwrite kei, but if cha is in a slot above kei it will overwrite the cha buff instead leaving you with your kei buff.<br />
<br />
As for having more rez's then deaths it is easy. You die on a raid, cleric #1 casts rez, cleric #2 casts rez on the same corpse and you accept both. I use to do that for a while and accept all rez's cast on me. No idea why really, just did it.</div></div><hr />

Just curious as my small time guild / alliance is about to start hitting SSra.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The fight is Arch-Lich. Before you even enter his room (we usually do it at the top of the tube to his floor), get everybody on raid to remove top buff, then put Charisma in that slot. Then have KEI cast on everybody (when I say everybody, I mean casters--melee don't care either way).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How does a shaman summon ale?<br />
<br />
Probably from the fishing pole from the POK quest.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2236</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How does a shaman summon ale? <br />
<br />
There are a couple items that summon ale if u check my magelo i have a fishermans companion which summon brells fishing rod and the rod summons ale Thats right im the ultimate drunk fisherman :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The resist rate on Malosini/ia is amazing, yet weirdly similar to my anecdotal impressions.  <br />
<br />
It's a bit skewed because you probably are using it on high MR mobs, and maybe not so much on low MR mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There is also a mob in Greig's End that drops Beer Goggles(forget name of mob right now).  Effect is summon ale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">JBB much?<br />
<br />
This log proves a few things: <br />
<br />
<br />
Mobs do NOT resist dots with initial DD's more<br />
<br />
He probably wished he never scribed primal essense<br />
<br />
He gates way way way too much<br />
<br />
<br />
Good info overall, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Mobs do NOT resist dots with initial DD's more&quot;<br />
<br />
Not necessarily.  Those numbers would lead to that, but consider also that he may be casting BoU and BoS on *much* higher level and more resistant mobs than bane and pox.<br />
<br />
Although, for those that insist on using our rains, look at his Tears of Saryn resists :)  That sounds about right, almost 1/3 resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">He gates way way way too much<br />
<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
I gate once every play session.  Im bound to Nexus, and have been for over a year.  When Im done playing for that session, thats where I head.<br />
Im sure if I parsed Id have a lot of gates too, but Ive yet to use gate to get out of any non-solo situation.<br />
<br />
Explain why gating 904 times over the corpse of a year is a bad thing please....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just parsed my logs from 3/8/03 to 4/28/03,  50 days,  just noticed something really sickening, and this is just for the time I was present in the /raid:<br />
<br />
Glyphed Rune Word - Total Looted: 399.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The one thing that really stood out to me was the resist rate on Tears of Saryrn.  614 resists out of 893 casts.  This probably reflects multiple resists on the same cast, but still, the resist rate is ridiculous.  The spell does far less damage than it could, making it a nearly a waste of mana in most situations other than clearing greens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tears of Saryrn is a standard 3 wave rain spell, right?<br />
<br />
If so, 893 casts actually represents 2679 waves, assuming a single mob in all cases. 614 resists equals a resist rate of about 23%.<br />
<br />
However compare this to the resist rate on Bane of Nife, which was 7.6%, or Ice Strike at 5%, and Spear of Torment at 2.7%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If fact we could go into possibly too much detail here, and work out the efficiency of some spells factoring in the resist rates.<br />
<br />
Take Bane of Nife - mana cost 425 but increase that by 7% to account for resists, gives an efficiency calculation of (214*7 + 150) / (425*1.07) = 3.62 hp/mana<br />
<br />
And Torrent of poison, 3 waves gives (540 * 3) / (380 * 1.23) = 3.47 hp / mana<br />
<br />
If you can arrange to hit with 4 waves of ToP (ie 2 mobs, 2 waves each) the efficientcy soars to (540 * 4) / (380 * 1.23) = 4.62 hp / mana<br />
<br />
But given the awkwardness of using the spell (hitting yourself, mezzed mobs, mob moving our of rain etc etc) I think the resist rate or something should really be tweaked with these rains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If fact we could go into possibly too much detail here, and work out the efficiency of some spells factoring in the resist rates.<br />
<br />
But you should really take into account the following as well:<br />
affliction efficency<br />
extended affliction<br />
mana preservation<br />
DD AA skills for crits<br />
<br />
All are obtainable for the average player.  I would be VERY interested to see how close the dots and rains become with the above (anyone got a big log on how often the rains crit  with all the AAs ?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey, <br />
<br />
To answer some of your questions:<br />
<br />
 I summon the Ale with the fishing pole from the POK quest. There are so many because a few months ago i started working on maxing out my drinking skills. :)<br />
<br />
The JBB is something I use alot. (as you all can see) The dmg is crap but any mana free DD to me is a good thing.<br />
<br />
The tolal on the PE casts is a combination of both the spell and the clicky effect from the hammer and trust me when i say, casting the spell version of PE is 1000 times better then having to click that damn hammer.<br />
<br />
As for casting gate....what can i say, i like to run around alot :)<br />
<br />
Just remember, this log contains everything that i have done on my shaman for the past year. That includes things like pl'ing people, soling, raiding, grouping for exp, and just playing EQ in general. I just posted becuse i know many times i have thought..hmmm i wonder how many times i have cast X spell since i have started playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over the corpse of a year? Was it really that bad?  :D<br />
<br />
Shaben</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Your calculations on the DoT resists are useless, if you don't know how many times he debuffed the resists before casting them. <br />
And yes, as i have stated before, our DoTs have the same resist rate with and without the initial DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The calculations are also useless unless you know exactly what mob he was casting it on.  There are mobs in Plane of Earth B that resist dots/slows like mad, same with many others.  Fennin Ro for example just seems to love resisting Blood of Saryrn, doesn't mean its always resisted that much.<br />
<br />
Unless you cast the same spell over and over on the same mob, you can't determine the resist rate of a spell, and even if you do that it's only the resist rate for that mob.</div></div><hr />
