<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so yesterday after zoning a few times i noticed something strange..i changed gender/race. was wondering if anyone else had the problem ..cuase its kinda fun. Oh and most of the time it seems noone else can see the  race/gender change just the player inflicted.<br />
<br />
so far i have been:<br />
Wood Elf Female<br />
Wood Elf Male<br />
Iksar Female<br />
Troll Female<br />
Ogre Male<br />
and dwarf female<br />
<br />
i'm orignaly a barb male<br />
<br />
bugs are fun =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The other day I was in a ldon and I died.  I decided to wait until the adventure was over before I got a rez.  I turned my aa/exp slider to 50/50 to see how much exp I could pick up during the ldon.  After I got the rez my exp bar said 100 percent instead of 99 percent.  Even after patch it still said 100 percent.  Is this a extreme minor bug or just working as intended?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, this is one of the cooler bugs that has been introduced.  Ive been:<br />

Were you casting a spell or using a potion of some kind for this to happen.  I think it would be cool if you could change to a race that doesnt have the class you use and make it permanent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For me it was random.  I zone into PoK and when I looked at myself, I was a different race.</div></div><hr />

You mean 100% at level 65? Heh. I wonder if you'd ding 66 the instant you enable the OoW expansion, without killing any mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking the same thing you are.  I doubt it though.  Anyway I died again later on and went back down to 99 percent.  I imagine I can duplicate it by picking up 1 percent exp and then getting a rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Same is with Canni, try to Canni up to 100% - never goes, always remains at 99%. Canni being manaless spell and all, at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you had zoned while 100% it would have reset back to 99%. You can get close, but can't max the level. Remember the problem back in old EQ, when you would hit 50 and could die a few times without a rezz and never have your xp drop? They worked that one over. Keep folks from leveling up on the new expansion release.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He said it was still 100% when he logged back on the next day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new mana numbers on the inventory window show Cannibalize I, II, III, IV, and Canni V using 1 mana. /bug</div></div><hr />

<br />
comptetely not true currently.<br />
<br />
I was able to grind to 100% reg xp 3-4 days ago.  This was w/o going to 99%, getting killed, grinding mroe then getting the rez.  I was also able to zone and stay at 100% reg xp.  <br />
<br />
Gratned since then i've died a few times and am back down to 97% atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've stayed 100% after quite a few res's up untill reciently.</div></div><hr />
