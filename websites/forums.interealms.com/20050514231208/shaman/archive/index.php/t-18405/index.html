<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wasn't sure if this had been posted before.  I tried searching for it but could not find anything.  I found a map pack here (http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/) that has been very helpful for me.  You just download the zip file with all maps included and extract it into your maps folder in your everquest directory.  <br />
<br />
If you have made or found your own maps, at least this might help fill in the ones you may not have yet.  Hope this is as useful to others as it has been for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yea its been floating around for a while now, but it can never hurt to repost something this useful for people that might not have it yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I really like the updated ones with the Grid lines added with LOC numbers.  It helps a thousand fold for finding things with a loc.  I'm bable to get with in pretty close procimity now with out constantly tapping my loc button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rad100</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How do you find the file to extract it to? i looked but didn't see the maps file, so i tried creating one. obviously, that didn't work out to well. what file am I looking for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The file you download holds a lot of files - about one for each zone in teh game. It should thus not be extracted to one file, but to a lot of files.<br />
<br />
What you do is simply to download the file, ask it to extract, and then specify that it should be extracted to your EverQuest/maps directory. As I do not know where you have installed EverQuest on your PC, I can not say more specific where it is.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm pretty sure the pack at eq-toolbox includes LDON maps.  It is the only pack I have installed and I've not been in an adventure yet that did not have a map.  Some of the maps are incomplete though, so BuzWeaver's LDON maps link may help fill in the gaps :)</div></div><hr />
