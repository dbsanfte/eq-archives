I was talking with a friend of mine here at work and he said that these are a very common drop in the PoP Executioner's Trials, even if you fail. It drops from &quot;A Fierce Nemesis&quot;. I know we've been doing the trials a lot so if everyone who wants one has one and you get extra and it's just gonna get sold, please I'd love it. Heck I'd even be willing to compensate you with fair market value. Anyhow, let me know, will be a nice upgrade for WIS/Mana/SvFire/SvCold, it'll replace my Forest Loop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thrug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You commented on a failed trial there being drops, but here's the problem failure is death or evac. Sooo yah hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True Thrug, true. Just following on something a friend told me who does trials a lot is that these are pretty common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not necessarily true Thrug. The majority of my failed trials did not have any deaths in them, we just did not kill the mobs fast enough. Sometimes only 1 person died from too much aggro or something, not many were wipeouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The earing and other items drop from named mobs in a wave, not the executioner, so these items are obtainable whether or not you win the trial.  The spawning of a named is purely random, and we often see no named during the waves at all however.</div></div><hr />
