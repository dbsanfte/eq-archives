<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>emiral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I just having bad luck, or did the patch from last week totally nerf Velious chain drops?<br />
<br />
Last weekend I spent upwards of 10 to 12 hours in the Kael, splitting the time between the arena and the ramp, and another 3 or 4 in Temple of Veeshan Halls of Testing.<br />
<br />
We had nary a chain drop, despite having more than 20 total armor drops, spread out pretty evenly over the other three categories. I think silk might have dropped the most.<br />
<br />
My guild was in the arena again Wednesday, and again, no chain drops at all. They had five silk drops and one plate drop that evening.<br />
<br />
Anybody seen a Velious chain drop since the patch on the 9th?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">eh.. its all bad luck... i seriously doubt that they are going to change the drop rates of items 2 expansions back... <br />
<br />
the drops are always bad in the arena... the only thing that ever drops is silk bracers...<br />
<br />
<br />
in HoT plate is the most common by far... than usually chain... than silk... and 1 or 2 leather drops (99% of the time boots or bracer) is amazing from my experience<br />
<br />
<br />
you'll have nights where its all plate.... you'll get your chain nights every so often... there has been a few silk nights... and one leather night...  and the nights with no drops at all for 4 hours really stink... but than you get your nights with tons of BP's and legs...<br />
<br />
<br />
and 3-4 hours in tov isn't much... you can go that long with only seeing a drop or 2 easy... let alone it be chain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chain drops have always been rare, although some people can get a lucky run while otehrs like me are unfortunate.  I think I only ever got Thurg boots, SS boots, SS bracer, SS arms and SS gaunts in my many many hours in Kael, HoT, WToV, NToV.  In the end I just bypassed velious armour on the whole and got the next level up which actually seemed easier to get my hands on.<br />
<br />
If you do go to the relavent zones enough and are not just very unlucky, you will eventually get most of the drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its about luck I would say. When we were in Velious we hadnt much chain as well, but silk was RARE for us usually. We had tons of plate :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paedron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We had a very successful night in HoT last night ( the 16th of Jan), and got 4 or 5 chain drops out of a total of I think 10 drops.  Can't comment on the Kael chain, but HoT chain is definitely still dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roydal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Perfectly average I am afraid, for random rare drops on mobs with big loot tables.  When you progress to ToV it becomes slightly better, but not by all that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Someone asking this EVERY patch. NO, they did not nerf Velious drops. Now, go play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dunaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild and friends have been raiding HoT about once a week for the past 5 months.  We've gotten 300+ armor drops.   What we've found is that the drops breaks down to <br />
<br />
47% Plate<br />
20% Chain<br />
19% Silk<br />
14% Leather<br />
<br />
Obviously, it doesn't drop like that each night but overtime that's how it averages out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What I love about the Velious armor, is every guild experiences something comepltely different it seems.  My guild got 0 chain in Kael until it was either not an upgrade for us, or a very minor upgrade.<br />
<br />
In HoT, we are experiencing a plethora of Plate and Leather (Why we get so much leather, I dont know), with usually one or two chain, although one ngiht we got like 5 chain coifs (which noone needed), and we are just really unlucky with the silk :/</div></div><hr />

We see a lot of Plate and Leater in ToV as well.  Silk and chain seem to drop much less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Drop appears to be the same now as it was a few months ago.<br />
Don't think there was a nerf or anything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They nerfed chain drops? Dang. Anyone notice that ensnare seems to last less than it did before too? &lt;g&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cynan Olwydd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After spending about 6 aa points in HoT (mid November to Jan 15.), I can definately say silk was the rarest in my experience.  I was in HoT ~ 6 days a week for 4+ hours at a time usually.  We'd single group it when we didn't have enough for a full raid.  We NEVER saw a silk robe drop.  Until the 14th of Jan. we never saw a silk hat, then we got 3. <br />
<br />
Drops are really random,   We'd go for hours with 1 drop, then kill something and get 2 pairs of legs.  From a guild that has a lot of finger wigglers, it would be nice to have HoT stuff drop more often :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Where's the best place to go?  My guild on the whole is just getting to the point where we need/want to do Kael.....where should we go to get our people better outfitted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm, never seen silk bracers in the arena...<br />
<br />
Honestly, that's the best place to go. Tormax bridge isn't bad, but pulling it is tough due to where the mobs are, so it's easy to get a named you don't want...<br />
<br />
In the arena I've seen 2 drops in 3 hours, and 10 drops in 2 hours. One night we got 3-4 each silk and leather pieces, one night it was only plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I mean the general arena mobs have crappy drop rates... like senior guard so and so... and what not...<br />
<br />
<br />
the guardians of zek seem to have have really good drop rates... but most arena raids i've seen/been to never pull them because they are lvl 66 or 67...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kael drops suck period, its one of those suck it up and curse under your breath situations to be honest...and dont even get me started on the Bp and Legs situations....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dumahim Ashenbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We raid HoT every week and we get a lot of plate, fair amount of silk with chain slightly behind, and maybe one leather every other week.  <br />
We got spoiled a couple weeks ago as we nearly averaged a drop every kill.  it was nuts.</div></div><hr />
