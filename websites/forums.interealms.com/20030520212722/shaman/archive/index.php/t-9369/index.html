<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious if this was removed from HP loot table? On Terris I am 99% certain I am still the only one with one. I looted mine like march or april of 2002 and the many kills following she never dropped one. I checked Triton who monitors the number of loot drops and noticed they also only had one Bone drop. I started looking around elsewhere but didn't find any good info so I figured I would come here and ask. Has anyone else seen this drop more than once or has anyone had it drop recently?</div></div><hr />
