<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So what are the better looking pieces of armor that a Shaman can wear? I'm window shopping, but I can't stand seeing myself with mismatched armor on. <br />
<br />
* Are there full suits of nice looking armor for Shamans?<br />
* Are there some combination of different armor pieces that still look great while worn together?<br />
* Which armor just looks plain awful even though it offers great stats? Do you bite the fashion bullet and wear it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think nekked trolls are the best look.  Bumpy and green are in fashion this year.<br />
<br />
hmmmmm :)  Trolls in loin clothes....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the new models, you pretty much have three kinds of armor:<br />
<br />
leather<br />
chain <br />
plate  <br />
<br />
The variations are caused by different colors of armor.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty biased, but I think the Wolfcaller's armor is pretty good looking:<br />
<br />

<br />
As far as combo armor goes:<br />
<br />
Jarsath/Thurg quest armor + fungi tunic makes a nice, matched banded look.  <br />
<br />
If you want to check out some mismatched armor that looks pretty hideous (but YES I wore!) check out the pics of me getting my Spear of Fate on this page:<br />

POG boots!<br />

<br />
Scaly and green is what's in this season. <br />
Loin cloth is just an added bonus.<br />
Chicks dig the tail (I'll let you guess why) <br />
<br />
Full set of Spirit Weavers looks cool on lizzies, so does Ry'gorr. <br />
Not sure about other races though. <br />

<br />
Once Versaci gets his hands on it expect lots of new designs with other gear built around it. <br />
<br />
Black BP with Tov Armor(green chain shown above)  is pretty nice ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool screen shots Gloriana. The JB Breastplate looks interesting. Do you have any screenshots with somebody with all the JB gear on? What was that Ogre Shaman wearing in one of those screen shots. I loved how the Ogre was mugging for the shot. One day I'll have to get my act together and start getting better looking armor. I'm still running around with the +3 WIS loin cloth dropped from one of the Trogs at the Netherbian Lair. It says it's a loin cloth, but it looks like a mini-skirt. I have chain everywhere but that mini-skirt make it look like I'm wearing leather pants. I'm kinda tired of tanks asking me where my armor is. Thhpt!</div></div><hr />

I'm a VarShir so I can't wear a Fungi Tunic. I think there is a similar regen tunic that the cats can wear. Does it look the same as a Fungi Tunic when worn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the all black look. I only have a vindi BP so far but the full look with vambraces of discontent or onyx sleeves and onyx leggings plus PoM boots or Quest boots looks sweet with new models.   <br />
<br />
If you wanted to go on the cheap for looks hunting in DN chetari side can get you some cool looking resist gear  Flayed paebala leggings , arms , tunic. Theseare also nice high ac armor for necros in addtion to being good DR/PR gear.<br />
<br />
The bp is kind of substandard as are the leggings but a full set of Crystal Chitin armor looks cool on a shaman. That , a REIF and a parrying dagger in secondary, go anon and pretend you are a rogue who can't backstab!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well imo vah shir look lame (no offense, blame the modellers), but I really like old world plate armor, so JBB is cool. also I like wolf caller's, has a very unique blue colour. fungi is def worth breaking fashion for, and so is vindi bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jannia,<br />
<br />
Yes, old world plate looked fabulous on barbies, I still haven't gotten over the fact I never got a RE bp!  I do have a pic of myself in full JB, but I don't have it posted.  On this page, bottom row is a pic of me wearing a jp bp, at level 59 I finally got RE pants!<br />

(I really do miss my beautiful &quot;wonder woman&quot; bp!)<br />
<br />
In the ogre screenshot, Rlaog is wearing:<br />
<br />
Froglock chestplate<br />
Mith bracers<br />
JB arms<br />
GEBs<br />
RE gloves<br />
I'm not sure of the legs! Kromriff, maybe?<br />

As far as people &quot;mugging&quot; for the camera, I love the screenshot of Dambala after getting the mage epic (bottom row, left)<br />

LOL, I can just imagine him saying, &quot;This is MY ugly stick!&quot; Nice screen shots. There are some mobs that I never imagined were in the game. That deepwater predator fish looks pretty scary. So far I've collected a few pieces of the JB gear except for the BP and the legs. From what I've seen so far, those two pieces look pretty expensive to get. Do you know of some replacements armor that I can slip into so I wouldn't look that ugly in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As a Vah Shir I have to agree. We do look lame in some armor. <br />
<br />
About the best I have seen us look is a cat in full Lammey Bard armor. That cat looked sweet in glowing blue.<br />
<br />
Verant screwed up about half the races in armor graphics. What were they thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">im a fan of totemic and rune etched</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jannia, rygorr or totemic shouldn't be too terribly expensive.  As far as fasion goes, well, sure it's important to me, but having the tools to do my job effectively are also important to me.  I have sacrified fashion many many times for utility and so will you :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A set of Jaundiced Bone looks the best to me no ifs ands or buts about it.  With the old or new models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like the look of full totemic/JB (slightly different tint), or full wolf callers.  Right now I've only started HoT and I look like Stevie Wonder dressed me.  Wolf Callers boots, bracer, gloves, JB bracer and arms, Jar Jar pants, Thurg helm (FS look) and RE BP.  Hell, I travel in greater bear form just so no one has to look at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Can magic armor be dyed different colors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dunno about best looking.  I kinda like full RE/CC or spirit callers on the new models best.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, the bone ugliest piece of armor in game is still the Froglok Scale BP, old and new models.  I do a lot of bearform when I am forced to wear mine or just fight in dark places.  (I put the fungi on my monk a lot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To my knowledge, only smithed plate mail (made by players) can be dyed and shaman can't wear it.<br />
<br />
As Tarthug said, bear form is your friend!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>XmaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Perosnally i like the Phase Spider Carapace Look on trolls. Along with gladiator chain leggings and arms. and 1 arctic wyvern bracer and arctic wyvern skullcap for a full brownish shaminator look hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Call me old-fashioned and fashion-challenged, but I always thought Totemic on a Troll or Ogre looked nice.  There's something about a full set the first time you see it that makes you say &quot; whoa&quot; (Think Lambent)<br />
<br />
Rune-Etched also caught my eye.<br />
<br />
But yes, as a newbie 51 Shaman, fashion takes a back seat to Fungal Tunic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like this look very much, all JB except for Fat Man Fungi, and Clicky SoW boots (those two are black).<br />
<br />
Ideally, would like to finish off my gear with some JB pants and something other than my SBS.  SBS has nice stats, but just sort of says &quot;My guild went to Chardok and all I got was this stupid T-Shirt.&quot;<br />

god I want pants so bad.  :(<br />

<br />
Biggest reason I'm wearing heavy dragonleg breeches.  Great ac and stamina, but I can pretend I've gotten wolf callers pants :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think the vah shir look pretty cool in rygorr.<br />
<br />
My rygorr, totemic helm, tribal war boots(looks like crafted) mix doesn't though.  Damn I can't wait till bear form :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">full pom, or however you can get a set of full black chain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'll second Crystal Chitin, it looks awesome, even if the stats are absolutely worthless.<br />
<br />
Paineel steel is quite jazzy as well, if you like the black plate look. <br />
<br />
Currently I wear a mix of onyx chain and other black/grey pieces, which simply look ok. Oh well, function before fashion.<br />

If you're gonna use the new models, might as well /dopropertinting on! It can cure that nasty case of blue-chest that you seem to be suffering from, Ceno. :( <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it also makes chain-graphic bracers look painfully effeminate. Fuggin' VI. I look forward to them fixing the ShowVeliousTexturesOnLuclinModels flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Nerd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">A slight drawback to /dopropertinting on for me is that it turns my char's skin pure black from the neck down.
