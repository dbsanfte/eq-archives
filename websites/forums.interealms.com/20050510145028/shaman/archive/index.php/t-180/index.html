<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... After I dinged 60 and scribed Torpor I have noticed that I dont get much out of free regen anymore. Before 60 I was very happy to have Fungi, but now the regen is kinda meaningless and I find my Ac and Wisdom a bit too low for my taste. Plus the fashion point of wiew, the look of full spirit callers with a chain tunic is awful.<br />
 2 days ago I bought Malo for 20K. That, plus buying Poxx, Torpor, and Group Focus (stupid me, shouldnt have bought it!) and I was a very poor shaman. Actually so poor that merchant told me that I cant afford that stack of icy mushrooms /hangs head.<br />
 So I decided that I got to get some plat out of somewhere, and so I did the thing I am now regretting: sold my fungi away for 40K. <br />
<br />
 As soon as I had clicked trade and received a nice /smile from that beautiful high elf cleric, I came into other thoughts...  Maybe I should have kept it for AoE mobs, or just extra way or making hitpoints in tight spots? Maybe I should have saved it to twink that halfie ranger some day? Damn how much I wanted that shirt for so many levels and now I sold it...<br />
 I know I need something solid for my Bp slot. Something with stats, ac and.. well anything. So far I've had horrible luck with ToV chain Bp drops, and we dont farm ToV like we used to anymore  so I was thinking to buy a JB bp and wear that until I get something better (vindi I hope). <br />
<br />
 Can you guys who have been oracles for a bit longer than 2 weeks tell me if I did awful wrong? Do you guys still use your fungi often? I dont really see so much use for extra regen anymore. I can regrowth myself, and get major regen for 200 mana so hitpoints are already kinda free for me. Still I feel I did wrong. Maybe because getting that fungi was my dream from lvl 1 to 58 when I got it, and I held it as my most valuable and precious posession.<br />
 <br />
 At least now I have about 50K in the bank. I bought myself a Barbed Ringmail tunic for 5k to use until I get a JB bp (or even ToV if fortuna smiles), and I've been drooling over an Orb of infinite Void lately, so I guess I could get one of those too. I know I need a new Belt too, but for that I have something free in my mind. <br />
 So I know I wasnt THAT stupid when I let the fungi go, I get some needed upgrades with the money I got from it, and I will be able to feed myself and gonaner for few weeks at least. Just need some couraging words from oracles who (hopefully) havent used their fungi's in weeks.<br />
<br />
 Good day to you all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That was an extremely silly thing to do. <br />
Fungis sell for 100k now and are the most useful item in the game for any class who can wear them, and would be even more useful to the ones who can not.  <br />
Hope u never get the urge to twink, cause you'll be /auct WTB fungi offering 100k!<br />
<br />
If by some fluke your server is still selling fungis for 40k as common price on that item, by all means buy one back at that price.  Prices rise steadily as time goes on.  It's simple supply/demand.  People tend to put fungis on twinks and then forget about them.  Thus they leave the economy.  Fungis are extremely desirable to many classes, and always will be a hot item.  Fungis now come into the game at a very slow rate, perhaps one per three days . . . it's a talked-about event in /gu when one drops . . everyone knows &quot;oh hey, did u hear a fungi dropped last night?  Yah, and so-and-so won it, haha yah lucky bastage in EC now auctioning for 100k.  I hear he has a buyer.&quot; <br />
<br />
Simple economics.  <br />
Fungis are now up there with manastones for rarity (on servers old enuf to have manastones), and are arguably more useful than a manastone.  <br />
<br />
You have been skooled!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not speaking from an Oracle standpoint, I wouldn't sell a Fungal for two reasons - <br />
<br />
1) &quot;You never know&quot;<br />
<br />
2) What if one day, gasp, horrors, you get burned out (SACRILEGE) playing your Shaman?<br />
<br />
There is no finer twink item in the game (non-zek) than a fungal tunic. :)=<br />
<br />
But Torpor is tough to beat. Still, you didn't get screwed, and you have a nice chunk of change in the bank AND a darn near spellbook from what I gather.<br />
<br />
Don't fret. If it means that much to you - take some guildies back into Seb and go turn the king into soup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/boggle 100k?  Still in the 35-40k range on Brell.   I hardly use the one on my shaman now that I'm 60.  Only use the one on my warrior while I'm leveling him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Antonius Bayle has the most screwed up economy of all servers. You guys would never believe how messed it is... Only items that are worth something are a) more than 50K priced very high end items, or b) are  spells.<br />
 Fungi's sell regularly for 35 to 40K on AB, so I got a fair price out of it. Of course if I had wanted to spend days selling it I might have found someone who'd buy it for 50k or so but then again... I needed money, and I needed a lot of it. I also need a lot of equippment upgrades, as you can see from my profile. Now if you want a real laugh I can tell you that about month ago I sold my second fungi for 20K to buy group Focus, a spell that now sells for 5k and is obtainable by our guild easily. (That's if the guild leadership feels a sting in their hearts for casters and decides to sacrifice 2 hours farming shaezzra...)  Damn I still feel so idiotic about that. It was after the drops rates were nerfed btw...<br />
<br />
 If I burn out with my shaman? heh I'd like to see that coming, especially now that I'm an Oracle. I have played just about every class in game at least too mid levels, but I always keep coming back to Shaman. People laugh at me for because I am unable to play other races without feeling gimped badly:) Being an Oracle is so much fun for me that I never could have believed I'd enjoy playing this much.<br />
<br />
 Anyway, I am sure I didnt do that wise when I sold it, but then again it's only an item. I didnt have much use for it atm, and I really needed plat more. I also need the stats from a &quot;real&quot; Bp badly.<br />
 I could start a small whine about a guild who never kept it's promise to help me getting my 60 spells (Malo was REALLY needed for our guild, only had 1 shaman with it, and she wasnt too active) so I didnt have to buy them and so could afford the item upgrades I need, but I'll rather stay out of that topic now. Isn't it funny how all the guilds are there in seconds if some mob that drops an_uber_melee_item_01 is up, but still getting people to help casters get their most important spells is like pulling teeth from Attila the Hunn...<br />
 I had to buy all my spells, and never got any help getting those (except from outside guild friends who tracked the spells down for me and  helped talking the price down), so now I am suffering from that and got to get used to living without Fungi. But hey, at least I am now able to loyally serve my guild by casting slows and Malo on those melee item dropping mobs (sarcasm here? naah...)<br />
 Maybe I was a bit hasty about selling it, but then again if I ever decide to twink a melee I'll just buy myself a new one and then come here to whine about the price and point to this thread:)  <br />
 I still enjoy being an oracle, and after I get that darn &quot;real&quot; Bp I am very happy with or without fungi.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frehya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I loaned out my fungi to a friend about 4 -5 mos ago.  havent missed it yet.  It just doesnt do the job anymore that I have been able to notice.   Torpor/canna4 or mod rods (a KEI is dessert) and I am always gtg<br />
as for BP's.  I found it easier to get a Thurg quest BP and a Vindi.  I just switch them as needed.  Chain BP drops in ToV or HoT are just too rare to count on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i loaned my fungi to a work friend a couple months ago, and i havent missed it yet.  ever since i got torpor, well over 6 months ago, i havent used a fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Simply isn't that big of a deal.  <br />
<br />
It's only what, 150 hp every minute?  <br />
<br />
It may make a difference for a monk, who has no healing ability, and doesn't have many other chestpieces with higher-AC.<br />
<br />
Without Torpor, it's nice to have, but not as nice as a JBB.  With Torpor, it's a toy at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still use my fungi at 60 in just about every exp situation and while raid buffing, only when resists are called for do i swap it out.<br />
The extra mana gathered over time justify it easily.<br />
I do have Torpor too as info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just hit 60 and I like keeping my fungi on, its nice when mana is full and hps not quite all the way up (not worthy of torpor, and chloroblast too inefficient).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well looks like there's people for and against my desicion to sell Fungi.<br />
 Im quite sure I'll learn to live without fungi, and for those situations mentioned when you're FM but need to top some Hp's off I can use regular regrowth.  I regularly have it on all the time anyway because I'm a fanatic user for the new group regrowth. <br />
 Either it's not a problem for me to cast torpor even if I had to top off my hp's from around 80%hp. I just cast it, click canni a couple of times to negate the mana cost and click off torpor when hp bar is full if snare bothers me.<br />
 <br />
 I'm pretty sure that I'll be more happy with the Jb bp, or whatever Bp I'll ever get (of course still crossing fingers fr ToV chain drop, but were about to reach level where we could do Vindi too so...). <br />
 I would like to get the Wis to 200 just for the heck of it, and because of that  I didnt have to click my canni hotkey THAT often. Also I would feel a lot more confident if I could get my Ac past 1k unbuffed, and that's not going to happen withot a proper chestguard. <br />
 I wonder if there's any other choises available for me as alternative, temporary Bp than the Jaundiced Bone?  Those Dragon Bp's from Ww are quite ok, but I would like to get some wisdom too. And the best part about the JB Bp is definately the extra Ac I'd get from the buff. I got a Barbed ringmail  atm because I got it cheap, and it's not that bad with 30ac and 50hp, but looks fugly and lacks the stats I'm looking for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Getting a SS bp is darn easy.  You will now start to get mad tells from guilds and raids pleading with you to come do HoT for them, cause they can't find a 60 shammy with Malo.  At least I do . . . and it's been that way for months and months.  <br />
<br />
I log on, I fiddle around and sooner or later I get that tell askin me to come to HoT.  It's really predictable.   Just saying some armor is darn easy to get.  Yer guild may not be the best source for upgrades.   Outside raids might be the ticket.  <br />
<br />
I hear you about the spell dropping mobs and general reluctance of guildies to go after them.  It's a common problem.  Just hope yer able to do sontalak and klandicar  . . . those two mobs drop Malo and Torpor sometimes, and yer guild will actually go after them cause they = ST keys = melee upgrades.<br />
<br />
I still say you didn't need the cash, sounds to me like you were just uneasy about having no cash =/= the same thing as needing cash.   <br />
<br />
As for you people who are on servers where the fungi price hasn't gone thru the roof yet . . . . stock  up now.   You couldn't pick a better investment than a fungi.  It's like buying pharmaceutical IPO stock, it's gonna make you wealthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">100k for a fungi??? You can get it for under 40k on my server.

Even though I do know the latest one is limited in who can use it and what level.<br />

But hey if you find a deal on a fungi it is a wise investment. If anything the price isn't going to drop anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fungus Patch Vest isn't even close to a real fungi. <br />
Not only can neither monks nor druids use it, but only large races and iksar can use it, which cuts out the vast majority of the EQ population.  If you look, most people play humans or elves of some sort, and those races aren't included.  <br />
It's basically a Beastlord vest, and it's about as hard to get as a Real Fungi TM.  You need a kick ass group, you need luck, and you need to win the roll.  <br />
<br />
There is only one class right now that prizes fungi over all other (not including epic) gear, and that is monk.  There are a hell of a lotta monks in game, and more being made every day.  <br />
<br />
If you don't believe me about fungis going up in price drastically, go visit monkly-business.com and chek out their fungi price? thread.  <br />
<br />
Supply/demand governs economics, as always.  Those servers that are still fungi-saturated enough to keep prices reasonable will eventually see them rise to pre-velious heights.  Heh, wonder why Berserker hasn't commented on this thread?  he's the EQ economist . . .</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fungus patch vest IS as good as the old fungi for the classes that can wear it. Same regen effect, and regen is what makes the damned thing so desirable in the first place. You really sound like you're trying to talk the price up.<br />
<br />
It's still about 30k on Rallos. About 35k - 40k on Stormhammer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Soupy, you obviously didn't understand the point I was trying to make. <br />
Let me put it another way.  The JBBP is a pretty nice item right?  It has nice wis, nice ac, a nice effect, and even looks nice!  It's droppable too!  So why does the Cobalt bp sell for so much more?  The reason is cause there are a LOT more high level warriors who play EQ than their are high level shamans who play EQ.  <br />
<br />
Same with monks vs. Beastlords.   Lots more monks than beastlords.  My point was not that the fungus patch vest is an inferior item for the classes who can use it . . . cause it's not.  My point was that it's not worth nearly as much as a true fungi for the simple reason that monks and many races can't use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally I still use my fungi when soloing. It's not a matter of being able to heal myself efficiently or not it's a matter of having to stop to take the time heal myself vs always regening. <br />
<br />
As far as the fungi patch vest goes i'd say your both right. It's the exact same stats and effect when you look at the item so it's functionally equivilent for those that can wear it but because of the class restrictions and lvl limitation it's alot less desirable than the original and will sell for alot less.<br />
<br />
If you miss your fungi get a group of friends and do the callers quests for exp till you get the new fungi. That would be my recommendation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I sold my fungi after I hit 60 to fund a MQ of a Thurg BP MQ.<br />

Obviously I would still love to have a fungi (that is, have both), but with torpor it's just not that big a deal I think.<br />
<br />
I sold it pre-nerf however, and probably at the market low.  <br />
<br />
I like the idea of twinks, but I've never able to not be bored playing one.<br />

It becomes even less useful in my opinion when you get the cann skill. Side Note: Patch tunic looks a lot better than the regular fungi. :)</div></div><hr />

The bottom line is, if you're looking for something to benefit your character, theres nothing you can buy for 50k that will benefit you more than a fungi tunic.  If you're not interested in using the money to twink, i'd see if you can buy another one back before it goes up in price anymore (and it will).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Took the words right out of my mouth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I traded my fungi tunic plus 50k to get the torpor spell.  Just my luck -- I pay an insane price for torpor just before it starts dropping like candy, and trade away my fungi before its price shoots the roof!  Yeesh, what a shlamazel.<br />
<br />
Didn't miss the fungi tunic at all once I had torpor -- the stats truly suck, especially when you're already naturally low on agi/dex as an ogre shaman.  The healing part; well, I almost never have any kind of problem with mana, really, so I don't see that the fungi would be terribly useful to me now.  I generally have enough mana to cast torrent of poison, even though it eats at my own hitpoints when I'm in range of it(and I usually am), and even though it fizzles a LOT and costs 380 mana, and to cast torrent multiple times, and still wind up fine on mana and health by the time most experience mobs die.  Or to do whatever I want to do. So mana/HP to me aren't really a concern anymore.<br />
<br />
I also have a CoV breastplate with more than twice the AC of the fungi and lots of positive stats, instead of negative ones, so it generally doesn't appeal to me to wear a fungi now anyway.  It was useless compared to a fungi before I had torpor, but not now.<br />
<br />
On my server, we have tons of fungis, but the price went from 25k to 50k-100k in a week after the drop rate nerf.  Pretty silly really; the fungi was never really &quot;rare.&quot;  It's certainly not four times better one week to the next.  But people with fungis are trying to create a lot of hysteria, I think, so they can sell at top dollar.  It's spilling over to other twinky-items too, like the iksar regen BP, which has doubled in price too.  Strangely enough, it's spilling over into the items for the class that needs a fungi most besides shamans -- monks.  Monk items are starting to rise in price suddenly too.  Silver chittin handwraps went from 3k to sometimes 6 and 7k, and FBSS's have gone up in price a lot too.  There's a fungi/twink item spillover effect going on.<br />
<br />
By the way, no shaman with torpor I know ever wears a fungi or ever bothers trying to buy one.  Some of them have fungis for their twinks and plenty of money to buy another for themselves, but they don't.  My very rich shaman friend has a fungi and fungi staff both, and never bothers using either of them, wherever he fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">At level 60 I still find a fungi tunic useful, especially in exp groups.  Even with torpor, fungi increases your rate of mana regen.  Torpor, as wonderful a spell as it is for mana regen still has its drawbacks, and when I find myself getting LoM, the SS bp goes in the tink bag, and out comes the fungi.<br />
<br />
I also let my twinks use it occasionally.  My monk gained 4 levels in an hour in Kurn's tower fighting yellow and red skellies solo.  I've sold several fungi tunics, but always end up buying them back.<br />
<br />
Fungi tunic is quite possibly the best general purpose item in the game for those races that can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gorilla Troll Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">At 60 I still use my fungi.  There are times when AC or resists are more important and I then use my SS bp.  I have also packed it around and handed it to tanks I know who could then use it to reduce down time between tough fights when no one had mana to heal (e.g., ToV raids).  I thought about selling mine or trading it for spells, however I've decided that I will likely never get rid of it.</div></div><hr />
