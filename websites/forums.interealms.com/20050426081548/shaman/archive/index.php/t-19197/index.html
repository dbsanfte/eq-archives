<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DenonoMonono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all..<br />
<br />
Well I came back to EQ after a year + hiatus.. this time in the form of a shaman and having a good time.. Well my wife came back also in the form of a ranger.. We have been duoing and grouping together since level 1 and now we are both 52.. except she has a 60% lead over me form her grouping with guildies in droga, a mage and an enchanter allow her to group with them and allows her to pluck arrows at the mobs so she doesnt get aggro/hit.. <br />
<br />
Well at 52 we have good gear.. not the uberest twinkest stuff but pretty decent.. We have been given a chance to group with this mage and enchanter sometimes when they are not ldon'ing or uber plane groupings.. and so they allow us to sponge xp from them.. which is really good in fact.. usually we do droga like mentioned above.. <br />
<br />
Well i'm sorry to talk your ear off.. but was curious about those times we cant group with them or find a  group for that matter.. a good nice place to xp duo style.. We have been in and out of dulak harbor since level 43.. good xp there.. but it has slowed down considerably.. we get around 3 kills on dandy or 2.5 approx on oceanscrasher for 1% xp.. THIS IS MY QUESTION HEHE.. Is this relatively normal for xping at level 52? <br />
<br />
I cannot recall how much xp we got before.. because we leveld 51-60 pre-velious so just kunark/old world zones.. I just know it took forever lol.. but I keep hearing ppl say they level 51-60 in a matter of weeks.. but at this rate it seems like a matter of months hehe.. if this is normal then I have to live with it and suck it up in dulak hehe.. because dulak is pretty easy compared to most places.. but was curious of your opinions :)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and I'm sorry for writing a book heh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Got about 1% XP per kill back in the Luggald caves in Dulak.  I dou normally with a paladin, and we both made solid exp (normally about .5-1.0% ever kill).<br />
<br />
Exp really slows done in lvl54, but then CRAWLS in lvls 56-59.  Kinda odd that it's harder to go from lvl55 to lvl60, then it is to go from lvl60 to lvl65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Preecher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get into the Plains, the best exp is here. Also CoM is decent at this lvl, the Stables are fairly easy and decent exp too, pluse you get some decent loot out of CoM, Might want to get a Tank to go with though, just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Havs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, I'd go to Dulak and either grab a boat or just pull misc from the surrounding area.  Drops, cash and gems seem to be pretty evenly spread on all the non-named mobs.<br />
<br />
If you can get a group in the Planes, such as PoJustice, etc GO!, if not, duo/solo in Dulak.</div></div><hr />
