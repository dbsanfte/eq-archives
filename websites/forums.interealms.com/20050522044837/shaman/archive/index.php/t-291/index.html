<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, how hard is this camp?  How rare is the ring?  Every time I went to Fungus group, people dont seem to want to camp them... (super uber rare or something?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, they just give bad faction.  They lower the Haven Smugglers faction which is where some classes have trainers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty common drop on ring, we can usually get 2-4 in a couple hours killing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got mine soon after Luclin, so the drop rate may have been nerfed since then. In about 2 hours we got 3 rings I think. The camp is harder than the other camps in Fungus, cause a 60 puller can't get singles there usually. A group of 3 or more is recommended, all level 60 or near it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Perfect set up for pulling the bandits is you(assuming shaman) and a monk, he pulls gets 2 or 3 and you tag the one off him that stays or warps back to him. =) I used this dual to get my ring, also tagged off a monk to help someone else get thiers.<br />

I've seen multiple times when they &quot;/shout 3 Shadel Bandit Rings rotting at location XXX,YYY&quot;.<br />
They all had their rings already.<br />
They shouted that out about 3 times during a play session.<br />
When 10 bandits die in a pull, it's possible to get a lot of rings.</div></div><hr />
