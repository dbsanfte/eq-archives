<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been attempting to improve my skills in relation to slow speed for high end encounters.  I am refering to perticular slowable mobs with high damage output.  Such encounteres could be labeled as &quot;Must slow&quot; mobs.  Examples can be experienced at all levels of high end play. <br />
<br />
     Ive discussed different techniques with various people.  Ofcourse all stratigies began with the application of the unresistable debuffs tashani and malo.  But after there were two main procedures for slowing.  One, chain malosini until land, then cast turgurs insects until slowed.  The second was to alternate castings of malosini and turgurs, thus maximizing time by overcomming turgurs recast delay.<br />
<br />
     I have never liked malosini, or any other resistable debuffs for mobs that need to be slowed now.  The basic principal is this:<br />
<br />
 If malosini lands, slow would have landed. <br />
<br />
     For this reason I call malosini a waste of time on mobs that need to be slowed immeaditly.  I dont believe stratigy 1 is the best plan for must slow encounters.  After malosini, there is no guarentee your next slow will land, espically on high mr mobs.  And even if it does, that mob could have been slowed sooner, because the malosini that you stuck should have been a slow.<br />
<br />
    Now for the second stratigy.  It would appear to be more viable, because it apperantly doesnt sacrafice slow time to malosini, it just utilizes the time turgurs cannot be recast.  But, according to my statement: If malosini lands, slow would have landed, it would theoraticly always be better to slow than malosini.  Which beings me to the third stratigy.<br />
<br />
     Far less shaman prefer a third stratigy to slowing.  The idea is to memorize two slows, and cast them in sequence, tugurs followed by any other slow during the recast refreshing of turgurs (instead of malosini).  To me this best utilizes our time, and speed by which we slow &quot;must slow&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
   There are two challenges to this theory.  One is that the alternate slow must not have a higher resistance rate than malosini.  The second is aggro.  To an extent, aggro is irrelivant.  For instance, if your raid will have no chance of sucess after 20 seconds of fighting X mob unslowed, it does not matter if you live 21 seconds or 2 minutes, your raid will fail.  So there is clearly a diminishing returns to aggro control.   But it is still important to live for the 20 seconds, or however long your window of oppurtunity to slow is.<br />
<br />
   There are really two options to slows we can sequence with.  Togors deffinatly does not have a higher resistance rate than malosini, however aggro is an issue.  The second is Tigirs.  This spell, in my testing, has significantly less aggro than turgurs and togors (when used against one mob) but has a very high resistance rate.  I have not determined if its resistance rate is higher than malosini.   Also, certain mobs react differently to debuffs, so the spell selection would depend on the encounter.<br />
To be noted, I havent considered any of our other slows.<br />
<br />
     A final option is to incorperate malosini into the slow sequencing, to percisely controll aggro yet at the same time maximize slow effiecncy.<br />
<br />
   So im throwing this out here to see what the general community thinks about the various procedures of slowing &quot;must slow mobs&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I want to stress I am not proposing mindless suicide slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Balance between casting slow too often (splat shaman) and casting malosini during delays between slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I chain cast malosini until it sticks or the mob is very very aggroed.  Trying to slow before then is dumb, b/c if I get killed then the mob will never be slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the point ragnorokk is making has nothing to do with ourselves living or not.  the situation he has set up is simply, the mob must be slowed QUICKLY or the raid WILL lose.  we've spoken about this a little bit and i'm far less experienced than he, but i would like to add that i have found tigirs insects to have less aggro than the normal togors/tugurs line.  the difference in this though, is that tigirs has a 5 second cast time, while tugurs has only 3.  i looked at the cast times and recast delays on castersrealm, and found the following:<br />
<br />
tugurs insects:  3 sec cast time, 6 second recast delay<br />
tigirs insects:  5 sec cast time, 5 second recast delay<br />
<br />
if we were to examine a time from of say 30 seconds, we can see that alternating between tugurs and tigirs would yield many more opportunities to land a slow, yet the problem is, chain casting this many slows is probably going to get you a very, very dead shaman.  during that 3 second recast from tugurs, you could already be seconds into casting a tigirs, so in the situation of MUST SLOW QUICK mobs, where the life of the shaman is inconsequential, and you want to chain cast any form of slow critically needed by your raiding force, alternating spells may not be a bad idea.  <br />
<br />
this also doesn't take into account, if you have multiple shamans or other slowers on the raid, your odds drastically increase by the number of ppl there.  examples include slow procing weapons like willsappers, earthcallers, etc., as well as any enchanters on the raid willing to put their lives on the line.  <br />
<br />
i don't think ragnorokk is talking about hardcore chain slowing and meaning pretty much instant death for the shaman in terms of many mobs in the game, but there are examples (i'm not experienced enough to name any real good ones), where landing a slow within the very early parts of the battle are going to mean the difference between victory and defeat, and i for one find alternating slows as a viable means for this.  although, i do really see myself getting hammered down quick attempting to pull this off, so better have a clicker ready, lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">control your agro is alway #1,  especial you are the only shaman there, it better land malo as soon as tank touch the mob, and repeat malosini untill chanter cats tashed, then can chain cast slow with malosini between it, if slow get more than 2 time, then better keep chain cast malosini few times before cast slow again<br />
<br />
depend on agro, cast more than 2 slow = bad agro; also I think malosini have little bit more resist than slow ? lots of time I can land slow without malosini but malosini resist far more than slow</div></div><hr />

<br />
my thoughts:<br />
<br />
We are talking about &quot;must be slowed&quot; mobs, right? Like Dozekar, RC .. stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Most of the time I alternate Malosini/Turgurs. Sometimes there is a mage with us that helps with Malosini.<br />
<br />
I would never go onto alternating 2 different slows. Why, you might ask. Becasue of the higher aggro a resisted slow is giving me compared to Malosini.<br />
<br />
The other argument was about why try to Malosini in the first place (slow would have stuck). Think about all the other classes trying to cast spells on the mob. They all profit from you sticking Malosini on the mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Against mobs that MUST be slowed asap we just let a Ranger with Weaponshield tank for 18 seconds. A Shaman that's agro after the first or second slow attempt and dies does nothing to the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For me, for must-slow mobs:<br />
<br />
Have a level 60 bard and enc on the raid, no bard and you may as well just tell the rangers to get earthcaller out and go sit in a corner.<br />
<br />
Malosini if turgurs not for landing<br />
<br />
Togors or PoI if malosini and turgurs being a problem (Rarely have room to mem POI tho, it's only gonna be memmed for the total bast slow mobs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If a mob absolutely HAS to have a chunk of its speed removed but its not going to be voided, I'll open with Poi first.  It usually lands first time after Decay/malady go on, and both its supporting ebuffs are incredibly fast to cast, so it generally takes 8 to 9 seconds to stick.  After that, malo, then sini/turgurs alternately.  I absolutely swear by Malosini for regular stuff though, it chaincasts fine with very little agro and with a full good debuff squad it usually goes on with no problems at all, not to mention it seems to have the perfect delay on turgurs to stop me getting chewed alive when slow goes on (Malo/tash/occ/slow on say a flurry drake, I get hammered hard, ususually enough to get killed, malo/tash/ooc/sini/slow, I take 1 round of melee or none at all).</div></div><hr />

Therefore, I direct Bear #2 to stick Insideous Decay and Plague of Insects on the mob.  That gives me the time to stick the malosini and Turgur's on.  If for some reason I'm the only shammy online at that time, then it's the Mages' responsibility to stick the Malosini.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tash is unresistable, malosini is not.  I'd spam malosini after tash lands.   Malosini will overwrite Malo.  <br />
<br />
I seem to remember Turgurs having +15 to land over Togors, but I went to Lucy and now I can't find it.<br />
<br />
I guess my reply would depend on the situation.  If you're a malo-less shaman slowing ToV mobs, I would recommend spamming malosini until it sticks then Turgur's or you'll just get killed or worse -- use up the cleric's mana.<br />
<br />
Guardian Wurms have low MR, so I might spam Turgur's, but after three casts I'm probably going to die.<br />
<br />
For any large mob, I would want a clean debuff chain:<br />
<br />
- Shaman casts Malo (low aggro)<br />
- Bard plays Occlusion of Sound (low aggro)<br />
- Bard also tries for proc an Orb of Tishan (med aggro)<br />
- Enchanted casts Tash (high aggro, hopefully MT has built up enough aggro)<br />
- all Shaman begin chaining Turgur's and Malosini until slow sticks<br />
<br />
It's not the fastest, but if we can't tank it unslowed for this period of time then we probably wont be able to kill it anyway.  Honestly though, it's a bummer how little slows come into play in the high end game anymore as so many bosses are immune.    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We have 5 shamans now typically on raids.  3 are Oracles, the rest are 57+.  Debuff sequence is typically malo-ooc-tash-malosini (from a mage)-and 3 shaman spam slow, 2 remaining change rolls based on the mob.  Usually one out of 3 lands it first shot and we sacrifice the chanter for an early strip and tash.  I have a hotkey for HoT raids to the lead shaman indicating when I've failed 3 slow attempts so we can share aggro.  If the 3 shaman on HoT raids go 0 for 3 each, then someone is sleeping (likely the chanter) and I inform the raid leader to wake the chanter up;) and the mob goes unslowed.  Our system is pretty good, when everyone uses it we get no deaths on a lap and we can do 2.5 laps in 3-4 hours.  The lead shaman is the only 60 shaman on the raid usually and is on lp, once he's done, HoT will be much more difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Malosini is practically non aggro, and therefore never a waste of time. You can spam sini. You can't spam Turgur. Like others, I use a sini between Turgurs to spread out aggro. Plus, when sini lands, your tank has built up aggro and you have improved your chances to slow. Both are good. Both Doze and especially RC hit hard, but it's always best to keep your wits and not die without purpose. If your slow bounces and RC and you take aggro, you are dead for sure, and you've just improved the chances everyone else is too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
you only spam malosini after tash ? there are nothing wrong to try land malosini after malo and before chanter tashed, and it have small chance to land before chanter cast it spell, that is what we need to slow mob as soon as possible<br />
<br />
after chanter tashed, I can stop malosini and cast slow and switch back to malosini<br />
<br />
<br />
- Shaman casts Malo (low aggro) <br />
- Bard plays Occlusion of Sound (low aggro) <br />
- Bard also tries for proc an Orb of Tishan (med aggro) <br />
- Enchanted casts Tash (high aggro, hopefully MT has built up enough aggro) <br />
- all Shaman begin chaining Turgur's and Malosini until slow sticks <br />
<br />
here is small improve order :<br />
<br />
- Shaman casts Malo before MA touch mob and land after MA touch mob(5 second cast time dude)<br />
- all Shamans/mage chain cast malosini, low agro<br />
- Bard plays Occlusion of Sound (low aggro) <br />
- Enchanted casts Tash (high aggro, hopefully MT has built up enough aggro) <br />
- all shamans can start cast first slow, and alternative with malosini between slow to lower agro<br />
- Bard also tries for proc an Orb of Tishan (it is a pro,bard not allow melee untill MA call it, high agro like chanter's tash too)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are few mobs where the clerics can not do a fast CH rotation for 30 - 45 seconds without the raid failing.  Then again we have good clerics.  <br />
<br />
On important mobs: Aary, DtD, Statue, etc  <br />
1) have one shaman cast Insidious Decay fairly early . . it should be 4-5 seconds after the MA engages.  Then I cast PoI and the mob's dmg output is HALVED so far. . .  <br />
Meanwhile the third shaman or the first perhaps has already landed Malo and we're waiting on the chanter to wake the fook up and tash.  <br />
<br />
When tash lands (usually right after Malo or POI or we have the chanter's head on a pole). we start off with everyone who can trying a slow spell.  We're all oracles and have equal chances to land it, and chances are one of us will first round!  Bingo, mob slowed, we can all relax a bit.  If nobody lands slow on the first round, we're ALL casting Malosini while it refreshes.  This includes mages who are spamming sini at this time.  Then we all try a second slow.  If sini has landed by this time, it's usually cake to get the slow slapped on there.  If not, we go to round two of sini and then round three of slows.  All this has taken place in the first 20 seconds of the fight, and round three of everyone attempting to slow is where we start seeing dead bears everywhere.  It's a painful painful round.  <br />
<br />
Honestly tho sometimes we skip round three and do another round or two of sini.  It's better for us to be alive and able to heal our respective groups from AE than to be dead and unable to contribute.  Besides, if our suicide mission to get the mob slowed FAILS and we're all dead . . it's a wipe for SURE.  Meanwhile the clerics are using mana like it's going out of style, but in truth they can do that for a while still and we got necros and mages for modrods and twitches anyway.  <br />
<br />
So yah I choose aggro control over &quot;slow at any cost&quot; in almost every case.  <br />
<br />
 In most situations it's better for the MA to have the aggro than for the mob to get pulled out of position and whack half a dozen people cause the shaman got aggro and died.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hrmm, I was sure PoI was 25%? Isn't it Tigir's thats 50%?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have an additional reason for chaining malosini after malo.  Both are very low aggro.  On highly resistant mobs IE ToV, I normally need to chain malosini a couple times before it sticks.  However, by the time it does land, that also gives the MT time to gain aggro, enough so that when I try slowing the first time, he won't aggro, regardless of resist or not.  So not only will I be decreasing my aggro by giving MT time to increase his, but I'll have a better chance of landing slow afterwards.  <br />
<br />
I personally don't give a rat's (_|_) about losing 800 mana from malosini resists cause after slow landed, my job is done, and assuming 3 groups don't ask for focus at once, my mana is always good by the time the next pull comes around the corner.  On the other hand, if my slow fails, gets me killed, and eventually wipes us out, I get irritated the second I'm rezzed and 40 people are like all begging for khura.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree Landragoran<br />
<br />
and with all those curse/Ae that drop aggro, it's important to die with style where  the MA is <br />
It's always fun to be the only one to resist the FD of the glyphed just after your slow bounced... Or to tank THO 3 min because all melee are slow and afk playing playstation (/hug guild healers)..<br />
<br />
slowing shaman position = MA position</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Insidious decay and necro DR debuff stacked will ease disease based slows.. something a non-60 shm can do. If it sticks then that's 25% less damage - giving the 60 shm slowing group  perhaps one more cast of turgurs before the raid takes a dirtnap.<br />
<br />
I can't remember if the weapons can proc for rangers who have weaponshield running.. if it does, they could break out their slow proccing weapons and tank whilst the first tank gains agro.. sure it's a suicide mission for the ranger but.. again it's an early opportunity for a low level initial slowing.<br />
<br />
But for the usual mobs having a few shaman alternate casting debuffs seems to to be the tried and tested technique.<br />
<br />
I'll aways cast debuffs and slow whilst standing next to the MT - if a mob like this ping-pongs you can start your planned CR..<br />
<br />
I forgot to say - load up malosini and turgurs - then cast turgurs, I noticed that malosini comes back quicker than slow, so shammy 1 doing malo, malosini,turgurs, malosini, turgurs,... and shammy 2 doing malosini, turgurs, malosini, tugurs,... shammy 3 does the ID, &lt;necro DR&gt;, POI route would be something I would look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">25% slow isn't the same as 25% less damage.  After all, does anyone debate anymore that a 75% slow causes the mob to swing 3 times slower?  Apply the principle and you'll figure out how the math works.  <br />
<br />
Actually there used to be threads on this that explained the slow math, but they got wiped with the board.  Anyone care to do the honors?  I quite frankly forget how slow percentage is calculated as it relates to attack delay, except for the fact that it's a very odd method of calculation.  <br />
I've just relied on the old standby of .25 = one time slower.  So 50% slow = 2 times slower.  And 75% makes the mob attack 3 times slower, or more I forget dammit.  <br />
<br />
A little help?  I know I'm at least close to right but I can't remember why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your way to calculate slow is wrong, <br />
- 0% slow mean mob hit 100% or normal damage<br />
- 25% slow mean mob hit only 75% or 3/4 of normal damage output(3 quarter)<br />
- 50% slow mean mob hit 50% or 1/2 of normal damage output(half) <br />
- 75% slow mean mob hit only 25% or 1/4 of normal damage outout(quarter)</div></div><hr />
