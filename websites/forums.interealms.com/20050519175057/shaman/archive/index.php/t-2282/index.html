<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I recently sat in Gfay and stripped my shaman because of all the good deals I saw. I think I sold about 11k worth of items, and somehow ended up with 20k (now how the hell did that happen!). Anyway, here's my magelo profile as it stands now...<br />

I need a mainhand weapon and I recently had a REIF. Now, I'll miss the dmg/dly ratio and all, but I can always grab a cheap wep with good wis/mana on it. Lemme see, I can grab gloves too, if I wait long enough. Now the question is do I:<br />
<br />
A) Upgrade my stuff with the extra money I have.<br />
OR<br />
B) Buy the JBB I recently saw auctioned recently.<br />
<br />
I know most would say buy the JBB. But I'm lvl 52 and I'm in summer guys :). I'm guna get my Seb key and head over soon. Do i upgrade the gear so I look more appealing to groups and hope for a JBB to drop while I'm there? Or do I buy buy the JBB now, and try and raise cash there?<br />
<br />
I'm telling myslf to upgrade slots and wait for the JBB, but from what you all say it's &gt; than all. LOL I'm so confused.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated, and if this qualifies as one of those &quot;plz help me with me equipment cuz im too lazy to look it up&quot; then I apologize in advance :rolleyes:.<br />

Do It , Do it Now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">JBB only goes for 15k in my server so if that's roughly the same with your server, you would still have money to spare. My advise is to buy the JBB and use the leftover to buy a coldain skin glove (3kpp ish) which you will use up to level 60. <br />
<br />
I have similar type of equipment to you at that level and was doing fine in grps or soloing. JBB will make a lot of difference in your dmg output.</div></div><hr />
