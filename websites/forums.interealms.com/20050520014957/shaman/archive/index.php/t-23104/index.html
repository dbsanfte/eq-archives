<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just taking a vote on what you think the best.. or favorite.. 2 box is and if u want, give a reason, sorry of the choices, i only got 10 choices. But for INT and WIS casters, specify, or also berserker which i didnt get a spot to put up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I picked an SK. I think they probably off the best because a lot of their spells are disease based and so are ours. So we can debuff the mobs DR and they can whack it to bits...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ranger, paladin, SK  If I could pick more than one, Id have picked those three.<br />
<br />
Ranger can tank up until about BoT with descent gear and shaman slows/healing, and then its time to root/rot and get the ranger AM3/EQ and let him plink mobs to death.<br />
<br />
Necro desearves Honorable mention, but it would be a totally different play style for me and I'd have to learn to adjust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And people ask me why I retired my 65 warrior.....Cuz they suck is my first responce, sony gave warr that incite crap and made taunt fail more.  As far as keeping aggro if I were to two box, and even if I was in a group I WELCOME pallys and sk's, most of the time I know they will hold aggro even when slow lands....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best class to 2 box?  Beastlord/Necro combo.  SoW/Snare/minor heals/necro can get mad aggro/two good pets for DPS while kiting/haste/slow/buffs<br />
<br />
Grim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">heh should of made it a bit clearer, meant with a shaman. I also should of given the polls a longer time than 2 days, i figured that would get enough votes, but thanks! :)</div></div><hr />
