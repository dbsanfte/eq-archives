<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just reading up on alla about the lodi shell(which i have had for MANY levels) and someone mentioned that buffing charisma will decrease slow resists?  Is this true?? I thought it just checked magic resist.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
I have read this site everyday for months and still haven't read everything, and appreciate all the knowledge all of you fellow shaman have shared.  I  have become the highest leveled shaman on my server, and a lot of it is due to this forum.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">glad to see you decided to look to see that there is a post exactly like this about 10 down. thanks for another post though, people who hadn't noticed the first one would surely see this post. ANYWAY, no, CHA doesn't effect SLOWS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thats the wonderful thing about the search option. if you cant find Charisma, you could try the common abbreviation of it, CHA. anyway, now that the search engine has been reviewed, don't think it was necessary to call me and ass, it's already pretty well known.</div></div><hr />
