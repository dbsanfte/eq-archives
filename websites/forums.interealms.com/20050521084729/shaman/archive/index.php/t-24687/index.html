<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone had some advice of some challenging mobs that drop nice loot to duo with a mage and shaman. Mage is 60 shaman is 65 can lvl the mage up to 65 if needed. Equipment for both is average for non raiders. Quiessence Canni 5, 2.2khps 3.3k mana with 7ft on the shm unbuffed and mage has no ft with 210 int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need a magelo so we can see what &quot;nice loot&quot; means to you. Is bracelet of sense nice loot? etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have killed the Red slime mob in the CT sewers that drops Boots of Flowing Slime (nice FT3 reward for mage) with a 65 mage and 65 shammy.  Mage had ft15, but I was ft4 probably with cani 5, but maybe not Q.  I had to heal her pet after slowing the blobs.<br />
<br />
Kinda gotta use pet pull from a 65 mage to break the camp.  Im not sure if her pet hold was necessary for that or not.  If it wasn't necessary, then dont see why shammy pet wouldnt work.  Cant use a spell to pull since they are in the sewer water and we are not.  We did get 2 of the 3 goos once (and survived) , but she has single pulled it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice loot meaning anything that would sell for 10kpp or more or would be an upgrade for someone in velious quest armor and equivalent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get that mage to 66, and buy a Minor rune or two to get the 66 air pet, it makes a world of difference.  That bugger can stun any mob under 80 as long as its not immune, and they dont tank half bad :P<br />
<br />
  Stun seems to always land if the mob is malosd as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CT does sound like a gold mine, specially with that 66 mage pet. Shield of Striding camp should be doable, and that'll net you 300k ish? Boots of flowing slime as mentioned will get ya 50k ish. You just have to learn how to single pull with pets, how to control your aggro and suspend minion will rock to have a pet on hold and one on ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Me and my mage friend used to duo Spirit of Tawro in Umbral back in the day for challenge and gear. We were similarly equiped as you are now. Don't know how doable this is now though with the swarmcaller being changed but I used to train the swarmcaller and all his see invis buddies out of the tunnel, mage would run all the way to the bend before Tawro and then CotH me in. Kill Tawro, loot cool stuff, gate. Tawro slows full, is tankable by mage's 61 air pet. Fights lasted around 9 mins or so, all in all a good time. Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Those 66 air pets are insane.<br />
<br />
I was grouped with two mages both using those air pets in Noble's Cauesway at the camp with the Aggressive Murkglider and the other named (Dragorn roamer, name starts with an R I think)<br />
<br />
The 3 of us were just tearing it apart. I've been in full groups that couldn't kill and chain pull mobs that quick. I'd only have to hit a pet with Q every couple battles because with slows and stuns they were barely getting hit. Add to that both Mages have a bit of AA&quot;s invested in their nuke crits so the DPS was just through the roof.<br />
<br />
I thought a GM would pop up and tell me that grouping with 2 mages is an exploit and that'd I need to stop, lol.<br />
<br />
The camp could easily be just duoed with one mage and myself. It'd be slower kills but we'd still be able to keep both PH's cleared and take on the named. <br />
<br />
Last night in two hours we got 4 names total, 11% XP at level 69 and loot was 3 decent melee neck items, a fairly nice melee belt, Sodalite (Gemstone -upgradable Augment) and a Lesser rune.</div></div><hr />
