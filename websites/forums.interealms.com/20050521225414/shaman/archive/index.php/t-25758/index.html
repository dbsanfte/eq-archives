<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know any good raid spots that like 14-20 people could do that is either fun or gets some decent gear just want to know some stuff our guild can do we working on Sol Ro atm we all flagged but only taken Xuzl so far and thanks to all that have given advice on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're all level 69+ you can have a mini raid in Riftseekers and try camping some stuff.<br />
<br />
I'd also try Kyvs in RCoD, Lirah the Bridgekeeper (hint: he doesn't summon, figure it out ;P) Murkglider School Leader (free 69 runes! good for chanters who need mez!), Slavedriver Menlo, and the zek twins in PoTactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say you cant mini raid RS since theres not much to mini raid with 14 people besides the groupable named. do WoS discordian warfiend and Shadow hunter , or any of the others grizlor mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's what Grizlor meant, Shlob.<br />
<br />
If you're bored, head to BOT and try your luck with the wing bosses (Chaos and Hail might be too problematic, but Thunder and Ice should be easy enough). Coupla decent drops, I only just replaced my Cap of Drowned Souls yesterday after having had it for a LONG time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont forget Ssra.  The loot may not be up to par but there are certain skills learned there that will help you in the long run.<br />
<br />
OoW has a tremendous amount of mini raid material that would suit you guys.  Dont forget WoS mobs like Velit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seconding a few oow mobs. Blind Hunter &amp; Murglider School Leader would be great targets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BH is a 1grp, xp mob...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Velitorkin in WoS and Bone Cracker in NC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Murkglider School Leader, easy 2-ish group mob. NC regular spawn/shaman epic spawn.<br />
<br />
Shadowhunter, easy if you are well-organized. regular spawn on south side of WoS<br />
<br />
Discordling Warfiend, about the same as SH, but seemed to be slightly easier to me. regular spawn on the north side of WoS.<br />
<br />
Bridgekeeper Lirah is a fun script. he's in RCoD, past the murkglider halls on the bridge that is otw to Rhorius (keep maps updated and you'll know where I'm talking about)<br />
<br />
BoT any of the names are pretty fun.<br />
<br />
fake Inny in Nadox...not great drops, but still, killing a god w/ 2 groups or less is funny.<br />
<br />
Luclin bosses....Velious Bosses...pretty much all of them are 1-2 groupable now. plenty of targets :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Blind Hunter = Shadow Hunter. My bad.</div></div><hr />

You do those with 2 groups of non-elemental geared people? Man you're good.<br />
I'd say that riftseeker (what most would consider one group camps) would be a good target to work on raid stuff for people at that level. With a non-elemental tank that buffs to 10k you probably want more than one group anyway.</div></div><hr />
