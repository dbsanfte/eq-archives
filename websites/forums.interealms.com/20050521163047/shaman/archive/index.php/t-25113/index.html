<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the things that annoys me now - especially with everyone and his dog :) having proc weapons - is that procs break root.<br />
<br />
It gets so annoying to root a mob safely then see the mage pet go to whack it and it runs straight for the cleric ....... aaargh.<br />
<br />
Thye need to stop procs breaking root :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh,, that would be nice.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, it wouldn't be too abusive, as long as the player castable spells still broke root.<br />
<br />
Will it ever be seen?<br />
pffft,, not in our time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That would be a great idea but I doubt it will ever happen.<br />
<br />
I stopped buying the summoned weapons for soloing when I realized that puppy kept breaking my roots in Dulak.  <br />
<br />
Maybe we can get some help with this from mages since they are losing a ton of money on it.  If enchanters can get pets to stop breaking mez maybe getting pets to not break root might not be out of the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They half way thought bout it, it costs some aa's, but they were mainly thinking bout the mage pets and beastlord pets.</div></div><hr />

Well, any sort of direct damage, be it from a nuke, a DoT with a &quot;nuke&quot; componant and any sort of melee damage has a chance to break root. Granted nukes have a higer rate of breaking root, but still...one would think that pet classes would have a bit more sense :-/<br />
Edit: Oh yeah, forgot that thrown weapons and arrow damage have a next to no if not no chance to break root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">heheheh,, always wondered why the HELL the beserker throughing a freaking 25 pound object at a mob did not break root. Letalone ruin a perfectly good ribcage</div></div><hr />
