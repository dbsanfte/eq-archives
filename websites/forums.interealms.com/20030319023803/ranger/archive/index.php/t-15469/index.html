Anyway, far and away its a nice bow!  Agnarr dropped two of em. Tallons bow is nice, but I have a feeling they are going to have much better ones later on in the game, too many teasers now in the lower tiers!!!</div></div><hr />

Nice bow, Sheesh I'm going to need a bigger bank if I want to collect all the bows that have been found lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cal the Dude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is it just me, or are a LOT of bows coming out in PoP?  For you guys with AM3/EQ, are you bows really staying well ahead of your melee damage even with Ferocity and all that good stuff?  I know that PoP zones at least have enough room to shoot bows, so that's sweet.</div></div><hr />

am having problems thinking about replacing mine. avatar proc is just too nize to give up if your not at or near the atk cap. shure, could swap stuff out when it procs, but swapping stuff out is a pain to me. am not a bard :p</div></div><hr />

You think? It worked in the reverse for us, we have like 6 bows from Tallon but haven't yet killed Agnarr, only tired 2x actually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just basing that on how many more people are in BoT in comparison to Drunder.  We killed Tallon on Saturday and that S.O.B. dropped 2 viels and 5 mithril arrows.  I felt like whoever put that drop table together was flipping me the bird.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">agnarr 12 kills - 2 bows<br />
tallon zek 8 kills - 3 bows<br />
mith marr 3 kills - 1 bow!!!!<br />
<br />
i think they are pretty much equal in ratios, one is faster one hits harder but both are good bows.  just because you can get into bot does not mean you can kill agnarr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Galdraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The proc on Tallon's bow seems to be working fine.  Also, the bow now has +15 Wisdom.  :)</div></div><hr />
