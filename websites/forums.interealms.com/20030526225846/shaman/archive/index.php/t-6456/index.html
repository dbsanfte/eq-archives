<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
    Logged onto Casters Realm this morning and saw a few changes. I was annoyed to say the least. Here's the break down;<br />
<br />
PoP Shaman DoT Spells:<br />
<br />
-Breath of Ultor<br />
Level: 64<br />
Mana: 550<br />
Damage: 3354<br />
Duration: 2 minutes, 36 seconds<br />
<br />
-Blood of Saryn<br />
Level: 65<br />
Mana: 535<br />
Damage: 2275<br />
Duration: 42 seconds<br />
<br />
PoP Necro DoT Spells:<br />
-Blood of Thule<br />
Level: 61<br />
Mana: 500<br />
Damage: 2163 - 2275<br />
Duration: 42 seconds<br />
<br />
-Saryns Kiss<br />
Level: 62<br />
Mana: 550<br />
Damage: 1850 - 1910<br />
Duration: 60 seconds<br />
<br />
-Embracing Darkness<br />
Level: 63<br />
Mana: 200<br />

Duration: 90 seconds<br />
<br />
-Dark Plauge<br />
Level: 65<br />
Mana: 425<br />
Damage: 2420 - 2620<br />
Duration: 2 minutes<br />
<br />
        Alright, now that we have that out of the way, let's compare. IMO, Shamans have always had fewer, slightly more powerful DoTs than a necro, but a necro makes up for this fact with their superior pet and numerous, nearly as powerful DoTs. However, in comparing our level 65 spell (Blood of Saryn) with their level 61 spell (Blood of Thule), I am throughly disgusted. Not only does the necro get a DoT that costs less mana to do the same amount of damage in the same amount of time, but he/she would get it four levels earlier. &quot;Oh, 4 levels isin't all that much.&quot; Bah. These levels are proabably going to be just as hard as 51-60, if not harder. Imagine that necro getting Pyre at 51 when you get Pox or Bane at 60. Not exactaly my idea of balance. <br />
      Granted, the necro DoTs did need a bit of boosting, but not this kind of boost. I do not agree with giving them DoTs of this power and magnitude, not just compareable, but better than our own. I'm looking forward to about 4 spells in this expansion; the 2 new DoTs, the new pet, and the new Torpor. While necros already have 4 new decent spells covered, and even more to boot. <br />
      Lastly, what I can't stand are the necros going onto the shaman spells section of Casters Realm and saying things like &quot;ahahahaha my dots r better than urs now u suc shaman hahaha i solo u&quot; ...perhaps not in those exact words, but you would get the idea of some 15 year old trying to post something intelligent on the boards if you read them.<br />
      My appologies if I seem long winded and full of class envy, but perhaps just this once I am-it should be quantity or quality, not both. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dupis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So you're upset because necros can actually do something better then another class for the first time since pre-kunark?<br />
<br />
Well I guess you're forgeting that you're actually wanted in groups (have you ever heard &quot;OUR GROUP NEEDS A NECRO&quot;....no) You're probably not forced into a life of exile due to most of the population of servers disliking your class because it's just not as good as other ones.<br />
<br />
Personally I think shaman's dots are fine.  Who cares if necros are better, they don't really have anything else.  Superior pets right?  Can't even use em on raids, they die too fast to AE's and their dps is pathetic...20dps or so if they live.<br />
<br />
So why do necros do more with dots?  Possibly because you can heal effectively, buff the piss out of people, wear chain, have high ac to take hits, have high hp to take more hits then say a caster, have dd's that do more then necros, have a more effective pet due to your own buffs, slows, hastes....I'm pretty sure you know what your class can do other then cast 2 dots.<br />
<br />
Necros were better at dots before shamans were then they got overtaken at 39.  Necros belong at the top of it anyways since thats all they have...dots, taps, pets.  Sure we can do other things, just not as good as other classes.<br />
<br />
You should be happy that we won't be inferior and laughed at.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And from your posting here Im pretty sure you have no clue about your own Class and dont know what your class can do beside casting dots - either that or you are deliberately lying, dupis!<br />
<br />
Go to the Necro boards, learn about your class.<br />
<br />
Edit: I dont care much about the dot changes, but I care about stupid people playing their class one dimensional and then saying they are weak. You being a bad player does not equal you being a bad class. And thats true for all classes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dupis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;And from your posting here Im pretty sure you have no clue about your own Class and dont know what your class can do beside casting dots - either that or you are deliberately lying, dupis!&quot; from some guy<br />
<br />
i said this in the post also &quot;Sure we can do other things, just not as good as other classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
before your insult me, at least read what i said.  i never said all we can do is cast dots, its just what we do best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Necros cast dots better before this.  <br />
<br />
You have more dots that stack better then shaman's do.  Shaman's dots had the most damage and fewer to stack, that get resisted a hell of a lot more then Necros dots did.  <br />
<br />
So even before this 'fix' you were better at dots then Shaman were.  There was a balance of our few dots being able to do the most damage with a single dot however.  <br />
<br />
So what are they going to compensate shaman with?  Nothing as usual I am sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dupis, my friend-after examining your post, I find your logic to be flawed. The first topic I would like to address is my wonderment with your fascination with reading other classes message boards, and flaming them for their concerns that are valid in the context of their view point. Secondly, I do not think that you, as a part of the necromancer community, have ANY room to tell someone NOT to complain. The only reason why your PoP DoTs have been significantly altered was because of your brethren screaming and whining the bleak night away. Now, to my credit, I would like to thank the previous poster for actually reading what I had said, unlike yourself that seemed to see the heading of my post and started typing away like a philosophical well of knowledge. My points were never to suggest that necromancers should not have good dots, my points were that in comparison between the two classes, Shamans generally have fewer, more powerful DoTs as opposed to multiple, nearly as powerful necromancer DoTs. Another comment of mine was that while the necromancer 61 DoT is just as powerful the Shaman 65 DoT, another point you failed to address in your response. <br />
   Now, since you obviously know so much about my class, and start spouting off knowledge about us that you have obviously gained through your many years as a necromancer (oddly enough I can't support that statement as you left no indication of level in your post-a very important factor in many class balance opinion issues) of our shamanly spells and abilities. <br />
   The first point I would like to address-why did you chose a necromancer? For the grouping ability? Doubtful. For their prowess in a raid team? Unlikely. Yet, you use both these examples to attempt to augment your argument in a rather ineffective fashion. Necromancers are a soloing class, both from a role playing and balance viewpoint. <br />
   Now, to address your other points. Your pet-if I remember correctly (and please correct me if I am wrong) is much better than our own. And for raids, was there not a patch a while back that gave the pet the resistances of the owner, making it an invalid point to express how quickly a pet would die to AoEs if you have sufficient resistances?<br />
  Another point with your &quot;why shamans are better&quot; post (which sounded more like a &quot;Necromancers need to be shamans&quot; statement) pertains to the ability of Direct Damage, another point addressed by the new necromancer spells in PoP. Last I checked, there will be a 900ish shaman nuke for about 300 mana, and a 1.2k necro nuke for about 425 mana. We out nuke you, you say?<br />
  In closing, all I would like to say is that people need to look at their class a bit more before leveling them to the higher tiers. Necromancers are a very self-defeating class. Always have been, and I do not see it changing any time in the future. I had picked the shaman class for three reasons; the role playing value, their prowess alone in battle, and the general group's desire to have one in their group. So why did you choose to be a necromancer?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kylemall Inthensom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">'Bout time Necro's became empowered again.  Dupis is correct...Necro's used to own this game when it came to soloing before Kunark came out....They've taken quite a backseat since.  I for one am happy to see VI do something to keep our resident necros happy.  Not like they've done much for quite some time now.  We,  as shaman have not a thing to complain about.<br />
<br />
Kudos to new DoT's for the necros...shaman still come out on top :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kylemall, I fear that you have missed something. &quot;Necro's used to own this game when it came to soloing before Kunark came out&quot; is a valid statement, but then again-they were doing things like sitting in fear, feigned, letting their pet rake in exp while they slept. Also, pre Kunark is one &quot;era,&quot; while Kunark, Velious and Luclin are all also different eras. The game changes, and with the past three expansions, necros have been given more DoTs, while we have been given less, generaly more powerful DoTs. You, just as Dupis did, missed my point. I had never said that Necros should not get good dots, I never said that they should be thrown in the backseat. All I said is that historicaly, (for the past 3 expansions) the balance has been in such that Shamans have 2 extremely powerful DoTs, while Necros more, slightly weaker DoTs. Tell me how you will feel at 61, seeing a necro throwing a DoT on his mobs that you will have to wait till 65 to see?  Personaly I would be one unhappy troll. And who knows-ours might be as rare as Torpor or Malo are.<br />
   To any future posters-I would encourage you to read the body of my post as opposed to reading the title and posting-because I'm getting the feeling that that is what has been happening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can't base balancing issues just by saying, &quot;Because they have it, we need it or better,&quot; even when comparin shamans and Necros.  I had this discussion with Lyndro, Valdelmar, and Rytan, all at the same time, before PoP Beta, before we knew about the DoTs in it.<br />
<br />
I say, let them have their glory.  We're overpowered as it is, and unfortunatly, with Cann5, we wont get as many improvements, and as much as it isn't fair for them to get 4 dots to our two, it's just the way it'll be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Akaylas, while you have a valid point, your logic is self defeating. Was it not the very same logic that the necromancers used to get their way when they saw that their PoP DoTs were under par with ours?<br />
Historicaly, which seems to be the point that most people opposed to this post try to make, Shamans have had a few stronger, less numorous DoTs than the Necromancer's arsenal. Necromancers were the &quot;king&quot; of DoTs in old world (and still are in the new world), yet in the previous three expansions, the shaman necromancer relationship stayed fairly constant as I had mentioned earlier in this paragraph. Yet, in light of this, I ask you when was the last time we, as shamans got a new high level DoT? Kunark. <br />
Honestly, I would prefer a few more utility spells, in addition to the four spells I'm looking forward to PoP. But to all these people screaming, &quot;this is how it should be because the past says this!&quot; the past says this: Shamans have a few, powerful dots. Necros have lots of slightly less powerful DoTs. Kunark, Velious and Luclin have shown this with the spells we had gotten from the first expansion.  <br />
Now, in closing-I ask you to look at the smiliarities between this situation and the Shaman/Druid CH debate ( /duck ). Both classes regard to the spell are similiar, yet one class gets for the same mana and casting time, something slightly worse. Here we see Shamans getting a level 65 spell with longer casting time and more mana, and the Necromancers getting a similar spell at 61, less mana/casting time. Deje vu, hm? And also, I wonder how long we'll have to wait to grind from 60 to 65, while a necro simply has to ding 61, and has the ability to scribe that spell. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kylemall Inthensom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ooga...One point to make..what makes a shaman a shaman? What are the spells that set us aside from most other classes for the most part?  A shaman in essence was not created to be the top damage dealer.  We slow, we buff, we malo, we toss some nice DoT's on mobs with what's left.  When desired, we can also solo stuff that most others would never have a shot at.  It's not our DoT's that make that possible..it's our turgurs.  Shaman kick ass.....period.  I still fail to see the problem with  necro's getting a DoT more powerful that ours.  Why not praise what makes us such a powerful class instead of harping on why we don't have the most powerful DoT or can't heal as well as a cleric.  Neither makes us any less of a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kylemall, the same thing that bothers me with this is the same thing that bothers me with the Druid and Shaman CH situation. If I'm going to get a spell that a class with similar abilities gets, why am I getting this toned down, restrained, less useful verson? How much more time and effort will it take for us to use nearly the same DoT? <br />
I had never said that a shaman was supposed to be the top damage dealer either. Is a necromancer? No, not really if you're looking at them in the light you're suggesting.<br />
And I don't exactaly agree with your opinion about me either. &quot;Harping?&quot; I have an opinion and I'm defending it. It's better than the crap I've seen over on some board by some classes. And if I were to simply praise that which we are, no one would care. <br />
In refrence to your suggestion that slow is our class defining ability; it is not. We do it best, with enchanters in second. They, however, have more utility spells than us. How would we feel if we suddenly got more utility spells and they got a slow better than our Turgurs? Pretty darn upset, I'd assume.<br />
Lastly, again-I ask you to look at past instances of Necromancer vs. Shaman DoTs. Lots of high powered DoTs Vsa few more powerful DoTs. I had never said that I do not want necromancers to have good spells, or good DoTs. I also ask you to rethink your logic when saying, &quot;When desired, we can also solo stuff that most others would never have a shot at. It's not our DoT's that make that possible..it's our turgurs&quot; because from what I have seen, our ability to big game hunt relies a fair bit on our ability to some pretty mean DoTs on those mobs. I couldn't imagine how long it would take to solo a dragon in Western Wastes if all we were using would be our epic, melee and pet for damage output. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sheesh Kylemall, this is so pathetically funny when someone tells - ANOTHER SHAMAN AT THAT - that we shamans are so &quot;powerful already and do not deserve any upgrades&quot;. Well, that you, probably because of such statements and shamans like you, we get shafted now for the 3rd expansion. Yet another one comes out, and yet another one has spells and upgrades which are pathetic to say the least. Complete **** to say it moderately. But no, a shaman like you tells &quot;we're OK, we have our frikkin' Canni V and Torpor, so we're good, no improvements needed here&quot;. *spits on ground*<br />
<br />
We're indeed so &quot;good&quot;, that on the raid situations it was never needed really to have more then 2 shamans max. More shamans then that is a &quot;waste of a group spot&quot;. Buffs? What buffs, the higher the people get, the better gear they aquire - the less they need our buffs. Slow? Sure, just that chanters slow quite good as well, and due to some weird thing (coincidence or nerf), somehow the chanter slow lands much better then shaman slow. So there's your shaman slow. It's quite weird to see a chanter slap a slow on, same lvl or even lower then me, and then I get resisted. Even after slapping Malosi on, I get resisted. By the time it finally sticks on, the mob is dead. Another mob, same case - chanter slow lands on the first try without debuffs, I spend most time getting resists even on debuffed mobs. And same reports from people all across the whole game. In many places people even don't seek shaman as a hunting partner, because chanter does the job too.<br />
<br />
As said above, your buffs? Who wants your buffs anyway at higher levels? Chanter spells add ATK to melee people and stack also with cleric ones, your buffs are inferior  - little HP bonus, stacking issue with chanter spell, stats matter not anyway. Not to mention new PoP buffs, which cost more mana, add VERY LITTLE and last up to 50% less time? Which is of course OK with you. Even the some new frikkin' paladin buffs cost about 7+ times LESS mana and last about 50% more, then &quot;new and improved&quot; shaman buffs. Which is again good, according to you. Our new spells bring ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW TO THE TABLE, the same old watered spells as we have had for some time, and at the same time the other classes get nice &quot;new&quot; spells, with new and indeed improved effects. Our &quot;new and improved&quot; AA suck so bad, that it's not even worth to think about it, but it's also OK with you. I mean, we have Canni V and Torpor, *** more do we need anyway, right? I mean, by you, it's indeed no biggie as we are literally outclasses in every area by others, when PoP is out. <br />
<br />
But sure, we still will have our Canni V + Torpor (a spell, what most of the shamans can never afford, btw), so where's the problem. Darn, did you check your glasses lately? As I get the feeling that they are cracked beyond belief, and you're looking through them and see different world then the rest of the people live in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Apparently being satisfied and complacent is en vogue.   All I hear is that we have Turgurs and Canni 5 so we are the kings of the world.  No other abilities are as useful as those.  Every class has cool stuff.  What the disgruntled shaman are saying is that our cool stuff is not as cool as their cool stuff.  I think that is valid.  I have canni 5 and I got to tell you that with the high mana cost and short durations of my spells, I need it.  I'm paying the price for getting it already.  How about giving me something interesting in PoP.  What spell is our illusion froglock?</div></div><hr />

Self-defeating, eh?  Fine then, I'll stick to the Cann5 arguement.  We're completely broken because of it and Quiescence/Torpor.  That's why we've gotten &quot;shafted 3 expansions in a row.&quot;  And that's not even mentioning how broken slow is on any slowable mob.  Talk about trivialization.<br />
<br />
From the looks of it, we're getting a new hp buff, 2 dots, a new disease based slow, 2 new malos, and a new disease debuffer.  I'm quite content with the spell lineup.  Necros, on the other hand, are either getting a nuke of somekind that wont see much use, a tap, a DoT, or a gimpy self buff.  Or a pet.  I don't know about you, but it looks a lot better for us in terms of &quot;Stuff we can do now as opposed to stuff we could do then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Banadan,<br />
I don't think that at level 55 you have either the right or the experience to criteque spells that you wont see for 6 levels.  In any event, everyone here is judging these spells simply on speculation.  You say that they are complete ****, however, you, or anyone else here, has never even cast Tears of Saryn, or Blood of Saryn, or Breath of Ultor.<br />
<br />
And if I'm one of -those- shaman that you think have kept us from getting spells you haven't seen yet for the past 3 expansions, then please, refer to me as one of -those- shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Akaylas, broken? Hardly. Extremely nice for those that have, oh...30k-70k+ to buy this miracle spell you're speaking of? Do you have Torpor? If so, how much did you pay for it, or how much have you seen it going for? It's rare for a reason. <br />
Slow broken? Again, you're overstating things. One could to the conclusion that the normal grind should not have to be any amazing endever to partake in.  Pardon me if you want more challenge in your grind group-if you don't want trivial, then go try and 3 man CT or something. Possible, and not trivial.<br />
Adressing your count of necromancer spells, I had counted more spells than those you mentioned. Concerning your jubilant additude towards the spells we are getting, the HP buff is nice. The two DoTs are nice. New malos? Are you kidding me? Those are nothing to get exited over for 5 points more than our current debuffs, unless they start dropping a lot more commonly than (at least one) their Kunark counterparts. The new disease based slow and debuff? Something for VI to throw out to use in specialized situations to shut us up.<br />
Do not get me wrong. I love our class, and I do enjoy the spells we will be getting. But I also do like to share my opinions, especialy my hostility to the &quot;lets whine whine whine till we get our way&quot; mentality. Now before anyone acuses me of whining-I haven't, nor do I intend to start sending my thoughts to VI about the matter. I do, however, have an opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Alright, now that we have that out of the way, let's compare. IMO, Shamans have always had fewer, slightly more powerful DoTs than a necro, but a necro makes up for this fact with their superior pet and numerous, nearly as powerful DoTs. However, in comparing our level 65 spell (Blood of Saryn) with their level 61 spell (Blood of Thule), I am throughly disgusted. Not only does the necro get a DoT that costs less mana to do the same amount of damage in the same amount of time, but he/she would get it four levels earlier. &quot;Oh, 4 levels isin't all that much.&quot; Bah. These levels are proabably going to be just as hard as 51-60, if not harder. Imagine that necro getting Pyre at 51 when you get Pox or Bane at 60. Not exactaly my idea of balance. <br />
Granted, the necro DoTs did need a bit of boosting, but not this kind of boost. I do not agree with giving them DoTs of this power and magnitude, not just compareable, but better than our own. I'm looking forward to about 4 spells in this expansion; the 2 new DoTs, the new pet, and the new Torpor. While necros already have 4 new decent spells covered, and even more to boot. <br />
Lastly, what I can't stand are the necros going onto the shaman spells section of Casters Realm and saying things like &quot;ahahahaha my dots r better than urs now u suc shaman hahaha i solo u&quot; ...perhaps not in those exact words, but you would get the idea of some 15 year old trying to post something intelligent on the boards if you read them. <br />
My appologies if I seem long winded and full of class envy, but perhaps just this once I am-it should be quantity or quality, not both. <br />
<br />
<br />
Where is the worthwhile reason?  You're comparing apples and oranges. A shaman has his/her role, and a necro has his/her role - they aren't the same. Accept that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm sorry, but it's about time I go off on someone for not reading correctly, if at all. In the context of my post, I had said that: <br />
<br />
*Shamans generaly have fewer, more powerful DoTs, while Necromancers have had a larger number of slightly less powerful, more versitile DoTs *<br />
<br />
Your logic is flawed, my friend-because evidently you do not know your fruit very well. I am comparing the DoTing capabilities of two classes over a period of 3 expansions, and the continuity of such a trend. I had never brought up a &quot;role&quot; in my post, all I had reffered to was my distaste for how the new DoTs are being handled. My friend, learn to read, and please, learn to think before posting. Accept that.</div></div><hr />

However, in comparing our level 65 spell (Blood of Saryn) with their level 61 spell (Blood of Thule), I am thoroughly disgusted. Not only does the necro get a DoT that costs less mana to do the same amount of damage in the same amount of time, but he/she would get it four levels earlier <br />
<br />
To me, it looks like the Necro Spell -Blood of Thule- does 2163 damage at level 61 and scales up to 2275 damage at level 65. (please correct me if I am wrong here) The Shaman spell cost 35 mana more than the Necro spell and does the full 2275 damage at level 65. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't see anything wrong with this.<br />

Granted, the necro DoTs did need a bit of boosting, but not this kind of boost. I do not agree with giving them DoTs of this power and magnitude <br />
<br />
And why not? <br />
<br />
While necromancers have in the past had more dot's that do less damage, why should they not receive some kind of an upgrade? <br />
<br />
Are these spells going to somehow effect the way you or I or anyone else for that matter plays the shaman class? <br />
 <br />
I will be the first to admit, I am just begining to understand the Shaman class, but I do tend to read this message board alot. From what I have read and from the knowledge I have gained from this message board I don't think these spells will effect the shaman class, in fact I think they will be very beneficial to any raiding guild by adding more DPS to kill mobs faster and more efficiently. That is if they aren't resisted like crazy.  :p <br />

Lastly, what I can't stand are the necros going onto the shaman spells section of Casters Realm and saying things like &quot;ahahahaha my dots r better than urs now u suc shaman hahaha i solo u&quot; ...perhaps not in those exact words, but you would get the idea of some 15 year old trying to post something intelligent on the boards if you read them. <br />
<br />
I am sure that there are shaman out there who would do this exact same thing, so really who cares? I know I don't. :)<br />

Well I guess you're forgetting that you're actually wanted in groups (have you ever heard &quot;OUR GROUP NEEDS A NECRO&quot;....no) You're probably not forced into a life of exile due to most of the population of servers disliking your class because it's just not as good as other ones.  <br />
<br />
Actually, I would rather have a Necromancer in the group over any other pet caster. A well played Necro is capable of many things, I know because I used to play one and I have seen some of the best necromancers on Fennin Ro in action. If you are having a hard time getting into a group then maybe you should either look at the way you are playing your necro or try to educate other people on how well a necro can do in a group.<br />

Magelo shows me plain gibberish and I can't update it, however, funny how some base their assumptions based on Magelo profile.<br />
<br />
Other then that, I don't mean JUST the DoT's of shamans. I mean all the data we have on the spells for the PoP expansion now. Take our spells and look what NEW things we get. Oh, did you notice it too? Nothing. We get the same spells, which have their manacost almost doubled, if not more, in many cases, their duration cut in half, and added bonuses are mininal - few tenths of HP, few more points to stats. That may be fine for you, but it is not fine for me.<br />
<br />
At least with some other classes Verant showed some creativity and added some new, or combined spells. In shaman case, Verant has total lack of brain activity. And worse is that some higher level shamans from shaman community support them. I can understand these &quot;oldies&quot; somewhat, I mean, they levelled up when these other classes did not yet have their new and better spell &quot;selection&quot;, so they did not have the 'competition' the younger shamans now have. You got up there easy and now think that everything is as easy to &quot;youngsters&quot; - shamans below your level - as well. &quot;Was easy for me, so must be easy for you too&quot; kind of thinking.<br />
<br />
What can I say here? WAKE UP old farts! If you are too blind and comfortable at your high levels, that you fail to see what losses the shamans are taking, then listen to those 'younger' ones who are already affected by these changes. This is the 3rd expansion in the row, where shamans literally get nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you're seeing w/ PoP is a return to some of the older ways now that The Vision (TM) is dead. All I've seen in upgrades to necro's was Pet, DoT &amp; shielding upgrades - the core of the necro class - nothing seems out of line in that regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Banadan, no one is getting really new and radical things.  No matter what fluffy curls they put on a spell, it either buffs, damages, debuffs, or heals, or has some kind of altrenate affect (Ports?).  And what are these losses that you speak of?  By not getting a spell, you aren't -loosing- anything.  But please, elaborate. <br />
<br />
Oogaschaka,<br />
You're right, the Malos/inia do appear to be kind of weak.  I didn't have to buy my Torpor, it was given to me by a good friend, but took about 3 months of constant VP/Juggs farming to get it, and 7 for Malo.  As for slow being broken?  Why then do they need to make mobs immune to slow, or only affected by disease resist slow?<br />
<br />
And who knows, mabey they'll throw us another DoT or two after the expansion (Hello Ancient: Bane of Nife!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Akaylas,<br />
<br />
Your post proves my point about the Malo/Torpor advantage shamans have. Again-it's rare for a reason. <br />
Concerning slow being broken and trivializing encounters-slow makes things easier, not trivial. If you're doing any high end encounter that can be slowed, yet still has monsterous damage output (IE: Statue in Kael), you've done your part. Your healers still have to do theirs, and if something goes wrong, like your CH chain messing up by a few seconds, it dosn't matter if the MoB is slowed or not, your raid party is going to be hurting at that point. In conclusion, slow makes things easier (as I had said earlier) but not trivial.<br />
As for your suggestion about new DoTs being added me, and alluding to the ancient spells...pardon me? These spells drop off of only the higher end monsters, and they are like the &quot;new&quot; Torpor/Malo. Most shamans would hardly consider them part of a feasbile spell list because of their rarity.</div></div><hr />

Just because I tend to ignore your repeatance of the same arguments now doesnt mean I think you are right all of a sudden, Kylemall!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I guess you didn't get what I was saying, Kylemall. When I said people were not reading what I posted, it was fairly obvious that they would try and make a point on something I had already covered. <br />
For example-someone discussed a role, and I never reffered to the role of either class in my post. It was about DoTs.<br />
Someone also posted about other abilities making us &quot;broken.&quot;<br />
My view has been stated several times, and it's never been directly addressed-the historical progression of necromancer and shaman DoTs in relation to one another. The problem with this is that people are trying to combat my argument with another (dead) historial reason; necros being the &quot;king&quot; of DoTs (gone since Kunark).<br />
As for not agreeing with me, let's take a lession in polls and statistics. Say you have an activity, and two groups of people. People who enjoy that activity, and people that don't. If you were to hold an open poll, who would you get more results from? Most likely the people that do not enjoy it, and would like to dispute and/or have that activity removed. That's why polls and statistics are so skewed. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gaeadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You can't look at one part of a much bigger picture and make a judgement call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Gaeadas-what are you talking about? Of course you can :P It just makes for a possibly inaccurate judgment. <br />
But in regard to what you are saying, how am I not looking at the whole picture? I've already said that I do not want Necromancers to have nothing to look forward to, but I would also like to retain my position as a class with the heaviest DoTs out there. <br />
Your post is much too open ended to be effective-you didn't site anything wrong with my argument, didn't say what you found wrong, and you repeatedly post these little jabs at me that show no effectiveness at all. :P First you call me a whiner, then you say I'm comparing apples to oranges, and now you say that I'm not looking at the whole picture. How are you to judge ME of not looking at the whole picture when you obviously can't read my mind. Would you like me to post my doctoral thesis as well as everything I've posted here? Some things are a given when people speak. Having played this game and this class for a rather significant amount of time, some of these, it's nearly a given that I have taken into consideration these things you judge me of overlooking. <br />
Hypocrite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gaeadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The problem is looking at just DoT's.<br />
<br />
What are the two classes roles on raids?<br />
What do the two classes do in groups?<br />
<br />
If everyone solo'd, I'd agree that something seems out of whack. However, at 60 - 65, people do a LOT of raiding. <br />
<br />
At the raids I goto, I don't see shamans worrying about Bane or Pox... I seem them worrying about getting the mob slowed.  Necro's? DoTs are what they do on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Oogaschaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Last time I checked, necros twitched more than they DoT'ed...and we slow more than we DoT as well. I would be fairly sure that if a Necro stacked all of their new PoP DoTs onto a mob, it would generate a fairly large amount of aggro, possibly killing him and even throwing a wrench in the raid.<br />
<br />
Also, you make a statement that shows an absolute, when you don't even know how 60-65 works. There are rumors that 60-65 will be a lot of raiding, but the only concrete thing I've seen VI saying is that leveling 60-65 will be a lot more natural. That, however is up to interpretation.<br />
<br />
And &quot;just looking at DoTs&quot; -the DoTs are the concern here. I have already taken into consideration other abilities of both classes. Necromancers are the most efficient killers, while shamans are the ones that can outlast uber_mob_00. I bet if we got as many DoTs as the necromancers did for PoP, we'd lay them all on that WW dragon and be a happy monkey until Canni5 recycled. Shamans have 1 or 2 DoTs for that reason-if we could just lay all our DoTs onto a mob after the slow, the encounter would end much faster. However, we only have two main DoT lines that stack with eachother, which in contrast to having multipule, nearly as powerful DoTs, should be more powerful and less numerous.</div></div><hr />
