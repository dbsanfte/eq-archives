<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saytok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the last patch I have noticed that my little dog dog can't seem to hit the broad side of a building.I have primarily been soloing in PoM since i hit 61 so i am not sure if maybe they just boosted up the mobs in the zones AC or if they did somethin to the pet melee table .I ussually feed him a slasher and a piercer for weaps.By missing alot i mean up to 12 missed swings in a row .Didn't see anything posted here so i was wonderin if anyone else had noticed this or if it was just me.</div></div><hr />

It has been observed that misses can be seen from farther away than hits. Make sure you are close enough to see both hits and misses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, there's a dog issue happening.  I saw this yesterday, and a guildie noticed it with his as well.  I was ripping for a while, then I noticed something else...<br />
<br />
It SAYS he misses, but he doesn't.  I tested with a couple light blues...pulled with turgurs and sent in dog and cast nothing else, only sat and watched.  I got dozens of 'miss' messages, yet the mobs hps steadily decreased, and it died.<br />
<br />
Was thinking maybe its a display bug.  Seems once I got real close to the fight, I was seeing dog do damage again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen this and been within range of hits and misses...  Have not parsed any logs so only have the hits and misses messages but it appears that Dog Dog misses a lot more now..  Will get off my lazy behind after work and look into it more (if I have time)...</div></div><hr />

Sure have noticed this and what I found was that all that I was seeing were the &quot;miss&quot; messages.  I was in OOT soloing Seafuries and noticed that the &quot;miss&quot; messages can be seen from further away than the hit messages.<br />
<br />
I thought this was odd too but when I got closer to the seafury to see what was happening, I started to see the hit messages as well.  Real odd.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's odd, because I swear doggie has become much more powerful since the patch. Fighting the same mobs, he seems to chew through them a hell of a lot faster than before. I also noticed a 6 attack round, and I never seem him attack that many times in a round before (all weapon attacks, no bashes or anything).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been seeing oddity no doubt with the hits and misses with dog dog. It seems that he will either be on (hit fast and land them all) or whiff them all. I'll try to do some parsing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Noticed a bugged pet hits mob for xx amount dam message that pops up now since last patch just after the mob dies. I have pet atk messages filtered off so I should not be seeing this. It pops up in chat right after the mob dies and is last line in the thread where mob says his last words and you are told you got exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is a definate problem with our pets.  I have noticed it mostly in Sebilis since the patch.  The mobs are light blue to me at 65 and with all spirit call pets and regular dog dog you can see the misses.  It is horrible every other line is a miss.  There should be no problem if the dog is in fact a level 60 pet with misses.  The light blue cons mitigating the hits is ridiculous.   It took me about seriously 5 minutes to kill a single spawn in seb one knight.  I even had SLW on the pet and it didn't seem to matter.  Complete gheyness with this latest update.</div></div><hr />

 They show you the hit if your pet deals the death blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well,<br />
<br />
I had a friend parse my dog a while back on some mobs in Sol C.  After the patch and I started seeing a ton of misses, I had her parse him again (same mobs, same buffs, same weapons) and his DPS was the same.<br />
<br />
Could it just be that they are not reporting what he's been doing all along?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Since they added the pet message filter we are seeing &quot;miss&quot; now, where we werent before.<br />
<br />
At least thats how I see it... I think its annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I turned off dogdog attack messages as soon as it went live and he seems to have not changed a bit :)  Funny how perspective changes things that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe it is either a text bug or a distance issue.  I was testing a new spell combination in PoN last night.  With the pet parked I rooted several spiders and root/rotted them.  It required 3 refreshes on the dot I was testing.  I repeated the same thing again but sent pet in from the start.  With the pet involved it only required one refresh on the dot.  Looking back at the pet messages it looked like my dog couldn't hit the ground with all four feet but the results said otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Saytok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did another round in PoM tonight and it seems that it may just be the text.The archer's are on a table and dog dog fights from underthe table after i get summoned on to the table and thats pretty fair distance.But still a little unnervin when your fightin the puppets up there and you don't get a single konarn hits for XXdmg the entire fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I noticed something I thought was strange.  I equiped my pet with a 1hb and 1hs weapon, but was only getting messages from the one in the primary hand (can't remember which it was).  This may have also been a distance problem, I'm not sure, because I wasn't really paying attention.  However, since its come up here, I'll go back and try to do some parses to find out what's going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Funny how suddenly our pets are &quot;missing more&quot; now that we're forced to see all of our pet's attack outcomes hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've noticed an innordinate amount of misses as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Quote from Rascalan:<br />
&quot;There should be no problem if the dog is in fact a level 60 pet with misses.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Dog Dog is level 58th...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pretty sure they never showed pet misses before, and now they do.  Also if you are out of range, you won't see his &quot;hit&quot; messages, but you can be a mile away and still the &quot;miss&quot; messages.<br />
<br />
Nothing is wrong with dogdog, he's always missed a lot --- the bad implementation is in the new pet messages filter.  They fooked it up bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Okay I verified this as bug last night guys. Took the 49 Dog down to crytal caverns for some kael farming and to check it out to be sure. I had fights where I saw the dog do nothing but miss the mob (orcs in CC) but the mobs life was still rapidly decreasing. No dots or DDs or help from me, just dog versus mob.<br />
<br />
Kinda sucks cause I wanted to do some dog DPS parsing, but it will have to wait.</div></div><hr />
