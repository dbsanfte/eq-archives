<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyzzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a lot of conjecture about how to get spells.  Has anyone actually gotten a 61+ Shaman spell?  Have they found a quest that is shaman specific?<br />
<br />
There are two quests of Sages about breaking down spells and bringing items that have charges of spells to get turned into spells, but have anything been actually accomplished.  Please post any successes.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know of a friend a 60 shaman on T Marr who handed in an etheral parchment for Plane of Innovation and received a 62 spell.<br />
<br />
As far as other details sorry I do not have it as the farking server went down in the middle of finding out more. GRRRR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here is what I found out.  I was looking on Allakhazams today and noticed a quest they had added for PoP Enchanter spells.  I figured if they are going to make enchanters quest for these all classes will have to.  Here is the text from Mystic Abomin.  He is an otter shaman in the Library in the plane of knowlegde.<br />
<br />
&quot;The mystics of New Tanaan embrace your presence amongst us most kindly, regard us as friend and mentor, should you need our guidance.  We have offered our services to the shamans of Norath that venture into our city.  Though our guidance is that of spells native to your world, the mystics scribes in this city may hold some conviance for we do not hold the prejudices of the material world's citizens.  Beyond these familar scrolls, I may be able to aid you further should you bring me a fledgling arcane item from the planes.  You will know which I speak if and when you stumble upon such a rare and seemingly mindane item.  Do not be fooled by its plain apperamce - the primordial essence of pure magic resides in these arcance relics and I can be the key to unlock them to the shamanistic powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fairly cryptic.  The enchanter quest says it gives you a randome 61-62 spell, so I will assume this is the same.  I noticed the vendor spells were no drop, I only hope these quested spells will not be the same.  I did some hunting in Nightmare plane today, I did not find anything that would be accepted.  I tried handing him everything I had looted.  Please post any additional information you may get on this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how do you get an etheral parchment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best place I've heard to find them yet is in Plane of Justice in the KoS areas. Turning them in, depending on what parchment, will yeild a random 61-62 or a 63-64 spell. From what I can tell, they should be able to drop in any zone, just PoJ happens to have the highest drop rate of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rolano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Parchments are random drops off of any mob in any plane.  There are 2 types that I know of.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ethereal Parchment&quot; for random level 61, 62 spells. <br />
&quot;Spectral Parchment&quot; for random level 63, 64 spells. <br />
<br />
Turn these into the otter vendor in PoK and recieve a random spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This was tested by myself with the Ethereal Parchment and I recieved a shiny new copy of ----<br />
<br />
Greater Immobilize<br />
<br />
Spent about 5 hours lastnight in PoJ and PoN and 2 Ethereal Parchments droped. I only got one Parchment myself.  The other went to a cleric.  I believe that she confirmed the same for clerics.</div></div><hr />

Also, the otter is now selling Replenishment (level 61) for about 255 plat. (With your own charisma buff)<br />
<br />
I bought it just in case it gets nerfed and turned into a turn-in spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off the random dark blue stuff in most zones. Its rare and not off easy stuff. And didnt see any off zone in mobs... was always deeper in the zone, the spider/ratman caves in pod, past the guard booth in inno, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, in case anyone was wondering, I was able to confirm something tonight.

No grummus spell off of him. Oh well hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Groggog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well I got my first parchment, and turned it in for Greater Immobolize!  ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yuegou Windwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Btw the spells I got from turning in were: Agility of the Wrulan x2, Cloud of Grummus, True Spirit, Endurance of the Boar, Focus of Soul, Greater Immobolize, &amp; Talisman of the Tribunal.<br />
<br />
True Spirit is the new pet and it cons dark blue to me at 61, which means its 53+. I havent bothered to turn on the others hits to see what its max is, but it does make a difference and can take a pretty good amount of abuse!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">are those spell all no drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So, for when people start getting duplicates on the turn-ins...  are the rewarded spells No Drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Groggog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No they are all tradeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So, when in groups, the caster's should loot the parchments or can anyone turn them into the quest givers?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Since they now have the ability to &quot;flag&quot; your character, why don't they give you the turn-in spells in order?  Make them no-drop and get the 61 spells, then 62, then 63, etc.  It forces you to go to the planes to get your spells (no-drop), but eliminates some of the tedious spell hunting due to duplicate or over-level spells.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oops, forgot to update my sig :)  It's been so long since I've leveled :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Wow - IF new pet cons dark blue to 61 ... is it for sure 53+?<br />
<br />
What's going to be interesting is to see if has any of the 53 warrior skills.    <br />
<br />
So if you ding into 65 and cast a lvl 55 pet ... can you tell it to go defensive ... ;) <br />
<br />
Anyone with max hit and est on hps ... post away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Something else I can confirm. If you are in a group and kill something that drops parchments, but you die, and all casters die and all that is left is like a monk or something, they can loot the pages and turn them in for you. Getting spells back is not tied to who turns them in, but rather who you turn them in to. Had a couple people worried about that, but after being forced to do that last night, a monk was able to turn in a parchment for a brand new talisman of the wrulan (gah). Suxxor spell. Was soooooooo hoping for grummus :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Wow - IF new pet cons dark blue to 61 ... is it for sure 53+?<br />
<br />
Pet is light blue at 61 and is level 42. This I know for fact.</div></div><hr />

Any info on the stategy used to take this guy out? We attempted him last night and had our respective arses handed to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Yuegou Windwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Kytra, you say the new True Spirit pet is 42? I read that the cons at 60+ are now dark blue at -8 levels. That would mean the pet is 53 or larger if it cons dark blue to 61st level people. I can post a screenshot of a con on the new pet at 61st level as being blue. Furthermore, the 59th level necro pet is light blue at 61st level to me, where as the new shaman wolf is dark blue. What level is the necro pet? Two necros both say the spectre pets are 46-48... once again leading me to believe that the new shaman pet is no where close to 42nd level, since the necro pet cons light blue to the shaman pets dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well, I don't think it really falls into this topic, but one thing I will say is I recommend that horses be banned from your raid on him. We had a crapload of adds come rushing in that laid down some smack. I am personally convinced that it is because of people on horses since there is that whole horse bug like what people see in VT where horses on upper levels can lead to some pretty spectactular trains of death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If you are looking for the new imbue spells, if you hail Noirin Khalen (one of the tradeskill vendors) she talks about imbuing planar gems. If you say &quot;imbue planar gems&quot; she tells you that she can translate any ethereal parchment into a type of imbue spell. Haven't tried it yet since I have yet to see any parchments drop =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zyzzx <br />
<br />
This is false.  Anyone can loot the parchments and turn in to any spell quest guys.  My guildleader is a bard, he looted all parchments, whee all 3.  Turned in 1 to bard quest guy, got bard vendor spell, grats.   Turned in 1 to wizard quest guy, got wizard spell draught of ro.  <br />
<br />
The pessimist in me says, expect to roll against melees who want spells for friends, alts, selling etc.  <br />
<br />
The optimist in me says, yay, this makes looting so much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Demanocus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Thanks Aktunka. Your right..wrong forum but I had to ask. :)<br />
<br />
We will be trying him again soon with a different pull stategy. It was the adds that killed us as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zyzzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">WOW, very kewl that it doesn't matter who does the turn in!  I did not know that and stand corrected. :D<br />
<br />
In raid situations having melee want to loot is never an issue, for guild leaders wont have any of that.  In mixed XP groups, you had best just ask what are looting rules for Parchments before you start just to be clear if you want to stay with that group.<br />
<br />
Zyzzx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Good for the melees, why should they be left out of the loot that drops just because you feel your more deserving!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">fook melees =p 90% of the rest of the game is centered around them. When I can get an item upgrade that is as game changing as a primal warsword or a cloak of flames, then melees can get parchment drops =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">As if all other shaman spells weren't bad enough, the bidding wars in the 61+ shaman spells have already started in the bazaar.  Saw Greater Imobilize for 60k on Tarew Marr today. :(<br />
<br />
So far I haven't seen any of the parchments drop, but a druid in my guild already has 4 of his 61+ spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">There was a shaman on Innoruuk who got a spare copy of True Spirit and sold it for 60k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was rather disappointed to get a vendor spell (level 49 enchanter) on my spectral parchment, but what can you do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Where do spectral parchments drop?  I have only gotten 4 ethereal parchments to get Focus of soul, the 62 heal, 61 nuke, and agility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It amazes me that people have so much cash in this game that they can just throw it away like that. Expansion has only been out a week!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I realize you need parchments etc to get the new 61-65 spells. What parchments do you need for what spells and who do you turn them into to get the spells.<br />
<br />
Can these parchments also be used by other classes for their spells? If so that reduces your chances of getting any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I can see other classes doing quick loots on scrolls and the same people winning rolls on the parchments. This is going to end up being a big problem in my opinion as everyone will want them and melle/tanks will want the PP that these can generate.<br />
<br />
I would rather see the spells just be sold at vendors</div></div><hr />
