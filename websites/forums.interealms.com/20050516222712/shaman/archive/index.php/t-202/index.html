<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if you go Vah Shir like I did then you pretty much have no choice since cats cant pick Gods.(I sooo have a feeling this is going to bite me in the @#$ when PoP comes out)<br />
<br />
Inno folowers get to quest for a Snare necklace and Cazic folowers can quest for a piece that can cast fear I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the exception of Vah Shir, who are all agnostic, you must have a deity. Remember, the shaman is a PRIEST class. The reason Vah Shir don't have a deity is because they worship nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vanbarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That totally depends on the race you have chosen.  I think the only racial choices that matter is with Trolls, since Inny lovers get the snare necklace.  Otherwise, I think all the races don't have but one god and agnostic as a choice.  I'd go with whatever god is available to your race though since almost all of them have some sort of religion related item they can use. (Tribunal armor for barbs, regent/initiate symbols for Rallos, Cazic and Inny and such)<br />
<br />
Of course if you pick a kitty, then you don't have much of a choice at all =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not correct.  <br />
<br />
For shaman:<br />
<br />
Barbs can only worship The Tribunal.  Can not be agnostic.<br />
Ogres can only worship Rallos Zek.  Can not be agnostic.<br />
Iksars can only worship Cazic Thule.  Can not be agnostic.<br />
Vah Shir can only be agnostic.<br />
Trolls are the only ones with a choice.  They can worship Cazic or Inny.  Can not be agnostic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vah Shir worship and honor their ancestors, not nature :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where can I find info on Barbarian Tribunal armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a Tribunal prison plane set for release , Im so excited that I'll have another quest zone and my Tribunal religiion will be some use other than RPing<br />
<br />
As for Tribunal armor the closest I can think of is Totemic , although its not actually Tribunal. You can talk to the Barbarians in Lake Rathe for info on that.</div></div><hr />

- The only plane with religion being useful so far is PoG. Don't count on VI monkey coders making Plane of Justice (or whatever) useful for Tribunal follwers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey, I know I'm agnostic as a shaman kitty, but did not know all kitties agnostics, no matter what class.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm, I hope Verant does something about that in upcoming expansion, there are a lot of cats out there these days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">being agnostic is kinda cool actually if you rp alot.  Either way, at the end of the day, a pusseh is still a pusseh =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
VI will probably find some solution to the Vha Shir deity issue.  They will probably have some kind of hybrid God that was long lost to the Vha Shir but has now come into being or some kind of something along those lines.<br />
<br />
As far as Tribunal Armor, there is Racial armor. I’ve not looked up the Stats on http://www.eqtraders.com yet, because I’m for focused on Alchemy.</div></div><hr />
