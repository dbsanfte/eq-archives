<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 60 and was going to be doing AA when I cannot find a tier 2 group.<br />
<br />
I have 2 AAs in innate regen at the moment because I have Pack Shrew and didn't feel like getting run just yet.<br />
<br />
What I was wondering as I have levelled up I am starting to consider not even thinking about run 3 til after I have Cann V and spend my first 6 AAs on regen 3 and metabolism 3(for Planes on the Drog).<br />
<br />
I know the pros and cons on this for the most part where shrew takes up a buff slot and that if it drops I could be in trouble while indoors.  Normally I keep acumen running all the time and if I am indoors say in LDoN I drop it when I cast shrew and keep ultravision that way.  In outdoor zones I would never need run 3 as I see it with clicky sow booties.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to get some other opinions on this I know it seems like I have made up my mind already but I am just crious to see that maybe I missed something that someone may point out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shrew expires, it takes a buff slot, and it can be dispelled.  Run3 doesn't take a buff slot, it never expires, it cannot be dispelled.<br />
<br />
Run3 is still an excellent AA and I'd choose it over regen3 any day of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stop with the Regen AA and get Run 3 ASAP. AA Regen is worthless in my opinion. Then go straight for Can 5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">unless you are using stats food, there is no real reason to get meta3 as your first AA instead of run3.<br />
<br />
and thartug gave you the best advises on why getting run3 is better than meta3.<br />
<br />
there is not a lot more to say :)<br />
<br />
however there is no real path for the AAs : you can choose to get wichever you want first as long as you get regen3 in the 6 first ones (then MC3 in the 12 next, then canni5 for the next 5 if you want to get canni5 asap).<br />
<br />
a wise shaman will choose run3 instead of meta3 because it is likely to save more his butt while getting all the 23 AA needed for canni5 if his exp time is average, than meta3 will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still remember my first AA point. I was fighting in Torg Mines just killing the trolls and miners by the bridge with my brother. Relatively safe. I dinged the AA and figured I'll go for regen 1 first before run.<br />
<br />
Well I kid ya not, next pull I got one of those resitant buggers. Resists slow, I get aggro. Try slow again, resist... I'm getting beat on pretty good. Try rooting, resists and by this time my health is pretty low. I figure my brother is using his earth pet I can just kite it till the pet roots it. Well, that didn't work either. Mob kept up with me and got in a few more swings and I had a long run back from PoK. :(<br />
<br />
Run 1 would have saved me. I learned my lesson very quick. Go for Run 3 first then go with whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are an iskar or troll I feel regen is definately worth it.  Being a troll myself my regen is 21/27 with no regen items, but regen3.  I am wonder what it will be when GoD comes out with improved regen. Item cap on regen is 35 i believe so 50-60 hp a tick is very doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm in the same position, I decided to go for Regen 3 first as I've got the Shrew spells and our great black booties.<br />
<br />
I still trying to decided whether to get Run 3, I don't find I spend enough time in Dungeons where running is an option to justify getting it and basically am looking at which will improve my enjoyment of the game. <br />
<br />
I used stat food so Metab would help and also enjoy tradeskills but am not too close to 200 on any yet.<br />
<br />
Currently I have decided to level abit more before AA'ing much and what with the new Run AA's in GoD I thnk I will wait to see what they do since if they increase how fast you run further, it will surpases Shrew speed and become worth getting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Run3 is the best 3 points i have spent on any of my characters.  Remember one thing you only have to be faster then the slowest guy when running from the train that is cpming or that ugly pull.  If you do not have run3 odds are u will be the slowest guy =).  Honestly my mage wioth run3/Jboots seems to run faster then my shaman with sow, i might just be crazy.  I'm not planning on getting regen i'm going iwth meta3 because with my orge i go through food like crazy on my horse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dont have Run3. Lived this long with my normal speed, don't see what difference it makes now.<br />
I'm not arguing that a faster movement rate isn't necessary, but with other stuff on the horizon, it's been on the back burner.<br />
I got the added wis (I made this char when the game was released, back then no one knew much about stats) as I wasn't max wis yet, then got MC3, and went straight for CanV. Next up was SCM3 and then MGB. Now I'm going for SCR3.<br />
I seldom find myself in dire need of a faster movement rate, the only time I've noticed the drawback to not having it, is keeping up with the rest of the party who does when we're all running out of an ldon dungeon at the end of the adventure.<br />
I'll probably get it eventually, though regen will be first. Personally, as a Shaman, I'm almost more concerned with regen than I am with FT, my mana is my health, the faster its back the more mana I can get out of. Don't get me wrong, I love the FT items, but if I can stack some regen in there, then I'm all for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Run3 is one of the best AAs you cant get. Hell the reason I started Shaman was for SOW. Regen is essentially meaningless once you get Torpor/Q, maybe even before that with that new fangled Stocism spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This post is a joke right?<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, your not serious.<br />
<br />
it's 3 measly aa<br />
<br />
to always have near sow like speed up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Regen is nice, it is one of those things you don't really notice, but still helps. Although, honestly go run3 everyone else is gonna have it. Your gonna be holding everyone back when your shrew wears off. I of course went to meta3. Horse eats like a.... horse, it's just one of those things that is suuuch a nice luxary. oh yea don't do any aa yet at least go to 61, you lose alot of exp when you die at 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think with the advent of Pack Shrew RUN3 isn't as compelling as it once was, but it's still the best of the first tier of AA's you can get.<br />
<br />
Personally I have had all my 51's get RUN3 after getting 20% into 51 and I know it's saved them more times than I can count.  I must say, though, That I'm a believer that Level &gt; AA and didn't get any AA's for any of my chars until they dinged 65 (except the ones for completing planes bosses, trial of execution, etc...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">run 3 is not &quot;near sow like spead&quot; unless you are in the habbit of having level 9 players cast sow on you.<br />
<br />
I don't run away very often in dugeons, last time I did it was loooooong before run3 even existed.  Wish I had spent it on metabolism.  <br />
<br />
Although run3 is good for pulling, so if you are the type of shaman that wants to pull alot, get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There was a time when iksar and trolls got twice the aa regen than other classes.  Some of you may remember.  That was the only time I would have suggest going for AA regen first.  My 3 aa regen was actually 6.  However, too many people cried and Sony pulled the double aa regen.  Never mind that Iksar actually felt like they got a good bonus for their serious racial exp penalty.  Some of you probably say it didnt make that much of a difference.  I guess you never knew then because I noticed a huge difference between 3 and 6 aa regen.   Go run 3 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is no reason not to get run 3, its still my first 3 aa's on every character I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">ummm yes run 3 is near like sow speed.<br />
<br />
I have done time trials with sow and without.<br />
<br />
and sow on top of run 3 makes a little bit of a difference but not much.<br />
<br />
I stand by what I said. Run 3 is easy to get and worth it in almost any situation I can think of, to imply otherwise is simply mind boggling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can't see how one could percieve slower food consumption as more valuable than permanent run speed increase.  When you run out of food, you mana and hp regen drop slightly until you splurge 10pp and buy more.  Whupteedoo.  When you get run down by a mob that hits for 1000 because your shrew wore off, you die.  <br />
<br />
Plus in PoP, people will make fun of you for casting shrew :P.  <br />
<br />
Run3 is still the best bang for the buck AA around.  Nothing else will do so much for 3 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">a wise shaman will choose run3 instead of meta3 because it is likely to save more his butt while getting all the 23 AA needed for canni5 if his exp time is average, than meta3 will.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm probably not wise...But why get Regen3?  why not met3 and run3 first? <br />
I mean.. 3 hp a tick? Shaman have regen spells... why do people really need this?<br />
<br />
What I mean to say is... I see this arguement that RUN3&gt;MET3<br />
<br />
I see it as RUN3&gt;MET3&gt;REG3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">usually shaman want to get Canni 5 asap, not wasting any AA before getting it.<br />
<br />
to get Canni 5 (class AA), you need MC3 (archetype AA)<br />
to get MC3, you need Regen3 (general AA).<br />
<br />
but there is also some requirement to be able to get archetype and class AA:<br />
<br />
General: These may be purchased starting at level 51.<br />
<br />
Archetype: These may be purchased starting at level 55 AND after you have spent 6 points in the General catagory. <br />
<br />
Class: These may be purchased starting at level 59 AND after you have spent 12 points in the Archetype catagory. <br />
<br />
( http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14626 )<br />
<br />
so you need 6 general AA before starting MC3.. hence the common choice for the first 3 AA = run3, and the next 3 AA = regen 3 if you choose the fastest path.<br />
<br />
but you are also facing the &quot;level&quot; limit, most will get Run3 at 51, then level to 59/60/61 (or even 65) and get the next AAs untill Canni 5, then done.<br />
<br />
but some might want to spend more time doing others AA before ding 59. all in all, it really depends on the amount of time you need to get 1 AA. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Screw shrew, I'll never buy that crap. Get run 3, seriously how often do you cast pack shrew in a LDoN dungeon? SoW or Bi Lih drops everybody has same run speed so you won't be leaving anyone behind. How often do you run away to zone? Total waste of points IMHO. Sorta like getting the check treasure chest for trap spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I got Run3 and Metab3 and have never been sorry.<br />
<br />
I'll probably do Regen just before Innate Cha/Int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">To the person that said their mages JBoots seemed as fast as their Shaman's SoW..<br />
<br />
That's probably a perspective thing based on the height of your character's respective races. SoW seems way faster on a Halfling Druid than a Barbarian Shaman watching the ground move<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Run 3 were my first 3 AA at level 51. Always on runspeed &gt; any spell runspeed if it's all hit the fan enough to warrant running.</div></div><hr />
