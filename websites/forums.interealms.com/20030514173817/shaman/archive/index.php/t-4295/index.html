<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Knowsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I need help.<br />
I've done a lot of my epic (everything from starting to killing Lord Ghiosk, so I only need the epic lvl fights...), but the one part neither me, or any of the un-epiced shammys in my guild can find is where the Spectral Courier Spawns?? We sat and cleared the stables (both sides) and he didn't spawn once =\<br />
Any helpull tips?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gronk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">he can be a very rare spawn, I have seen him spawn 3 times in a row then had shaman friends of mine camp him for hours upon hours and not see him, just gottaa keep at it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've actually seen the Spectral Courier once in about 24 hours of play time. Not sure about his timer or anything. We didn't do anything special to spawn him, either. At least, not as far as we know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only place ive ever seen the courier is in the stable area.  west of the #6 on the map at eqatlas.com..  near /loc  -250, -450.   <br />
<br />
camped him for around 16hrs till i got the student log. :(    hes kinda rare, only seen him about 1 out of 4 pops.. his place holder can be just about any golem, or undead type.   killed him about 5 times before he dropped the log,  Respawn time is 25 or 26 mins.  most thing in here are light blue at 51.. sometimes greens and darkblues.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It might be just me, but the spectral courier spawns very often for me, got the students log right away when i wanted it, then when i had to camp courier again on my monk for illegible scrolls he spawned quite a bite, just clear both sides of stables, he can spawn in 5 diff spots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just keep clearing the stables area and he should spawn. I don't know of any timer for him, but he didn't seem THAT rare, but I could've been lucky. It took me three attempts to get the student's log. Also, while in CoM, /ooc that you're looking for him. If the people who kill him don't need the log, they'll most likely let you have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Numrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The spectral courier spawns in the stables area in one of three locations.  One is in one of the houses to the east.  Two mobs spawn in each house, and the spectral courier can spawn in the southern one.<br />
<br />
The other two are in the houses to the west.  The southern one has a main room and a back room.  Two mobs spawn in the main room and two in the back room.  The courier could spawn in the farthest spawn point in the back room.  <br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm not sure about the other spawn point because those are the only two places I've seen him.  My monk friend who was pulling said he spawned one other place.<br />
<br />
Just keep clearing out the houses and eventually he'll spawn.  Usually in a 4 hour night I see him spawn twice or so.  About 1 in 5 he has the book we need, the other times he has the scrolls that monks and sks need.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent 14 hours total camping the stables for me and others and saw the courier 5 times.  He dropped the log 3 of those 5 times.  My experience is not typical, some people spend a LOT more time there.<br />
<br />
I was clearing everything on both sides of thes tables.  If you're not clearing everything your chances will go down accordingly.</div></div><hr />
