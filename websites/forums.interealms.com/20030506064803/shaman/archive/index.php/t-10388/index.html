<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently I am using cog encrusted epaulets from PoI.  I was wondering if anyone could offer their advice as to which piece they would wear.  I have not started the quests yet, but I assume they wouldn't be horribly difficult except for tailoring.  Also, if anyone could offer  a better earring I would appreciate it, magelo should work(I hope).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you like to do trade skills and think the quest is fun, then it is worth the time.  I am working on it but my gear is not even close to yours.<br />
<br />
If you don't love trade skills then I would skip it.<br />
<br />
Tailoring is hard,  but smithing is also quite a chalange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes, and you can MQ the smithing part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">with my just finishing mine.  I would say it a great item.  worth the time for it, that up to you.  Just be warned how much effort it is to do.  If you have one group that willing to help you with most of the pieces. then it not bad.  another option is just buying most of the pieces.<br />
<br />
But the quest is more then just getting trade skills up<br />
<br />
Shawl 1 - head.  that semi eazy. Should take about an hour or 2 I think<br />
<br />
Shawl 2 - Toes - If your lucky you got these with the heads.<br />
<br />
Shawl 3 - Baking - not bad, can solo eazy most of it, I would say duo just cause u will want a tracker.  You only need skill of 135 or so which is eazy to get.<br />
<br />
Shawl 4 - pottery(gate potion) again pretty eazy<br />
<br />
Shawl 5 - Tailoring - This is where camping junk get annoying.  Skill of 135 or so needed.  Camping the silk in Velks will take you about 3 hours in an average group.  but this was pre PoP.  If you get people to hunt with you there I bet it wll take an hour in the right camps.  You also need to get 5 biles from GW.  THESE ARE A MAJOR PAIN<br />
<br />
Shawl 6 - Once u get this far, you sunk your time in.  You gotta finish it. Well that how I saw it at least.  Shawl 6 was quite eazy any way.  about 4 hours of hunting should get your everything.<br />
<br />
Shawl 7 - OYE this one is a pain. Where to start.  I guess knowing that you will need fleching, brewing, JC, pottery, tailoring all around 160.<br />
Things you need to gather.<br />
EB item from Sirens in SG - MAJOR PAIN.  not soloable at 61, haven't tried after but it was very hard then.  they charm and I had 170 MR. couldn't single pull, and they like to mezz and nuke<br />
need to fish in IC, that not bad, just a time sink.<br />
Blood of some giant in kael - He kinda far in.  Unless you know some people Ally to giants who will pull him to zone for you, it quite a crawl in.  <br />
some tooth off the fish in SG - Eazy, soloable too<br />
<br />
Shawl 8 - since it MQable I guess it not bad, if you gonna try it your self.  umm SMITHING SUCKS. took me months to get it up.  <br />
Expect to spend a few hours in WL hunting gems for the armor you need to make.  Oh lets not forget u gotta hunt in WW for velium hound furs, which is killed pretty quick on my server for the fur tailors seem to like.  took me about a month to get mine.  hard to find those hounds up.  and the War.  the war is pretty eazy, one soild group can do it.<br />
<br />
well you can come to your own thoughts on how bad it is to do.  But don't expect to get your shawl in a week.  you have to understand the time sink it is.  and Plat sink.  Getting your skills up will take quite some time.  Buying some of the items will speed up the process but wil be quite costly.  I would say I spent about 20k working on my shawl but that with buying the kael blood and the EB item from Sg.  Tradeskill work, bought silk and velium.  there are other things like coldain tempers that are costly.  <br />
<br />
Judging from your gear you in a pretty good guild and look like you would have a few people will to hand some help, lucky you.  I only had a druid willing to help me for most of it till the war.  So the quest was a bit harder for me then normal people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lovisla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You suck ..we would have helped you at any point along the way ...you never asked! The day you asked about helping with the war we started lining up!<br />
Kong the ever knowing ever wise  ...your awesome hun. And this is a great post.<br />
