Headlines <br />

DirectX 9 is now REQUIRED to play on all SOE EverQuest servers and Venril Sathir! <br />
Stormhammer received a new adventure zone. <br />
Another story for you to peruse in your storybook. <br />
Screenshots in .JPG? What will they think of next! <br />
More Grammar changes (no not Grandma, Grammar) <br />
<br />
<br />
DirectX 9 <br />
------------------------- <br />
-We have added more detail to the gamma correction slider, which means you may need to adjust your gamma settings which are located under video options <br />
-All zones will temporarily have the same sky while we refine DirectX 9 functionality. <br />
-Corpses should now be easier to target. <br />
-We have added a new command, /rewind, which should free your character if they become stuck in geometry. <br />
-There are now independent window resolutions for full screen and windowed mode. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormhammer <br />
-------------------------- <br />
If you are a Legends subscriber you can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr. This midlevel adventure zone will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish Hiz! <br />
<br />
Now you must find what was left beneath the sands. Good luck. <br />
<br />
<br />
Screenshots <br />
-------------------------- <br />
-Screenshots will now save to a &quot;Screenshot&quot; folder in your EQ directory <br />
-You can now change the format your screenshots are saved in by adding the &quot;ScreenshotType=&quot; line in your eqclient.ini file, which is in your EverQuest directory. To save in jpg format you would change or add the line to read &quot;ScreenshotType=jpg&quot;. Supported formats are bmp, jpg, tga, dds and png. Screenshots will continue to save in bmp format unless this line is added. <br />

Actually I do not think this is the new grafics engine they were planning but just an update of the DX version the old game engine uses. At least did expect more of an effect and I am sure they would have announced  it if this was really a new 3d engine. But of course with SOE anything is possible. Some people have problems using ladders or getting out of water...</div></div><hr />
