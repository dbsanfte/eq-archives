<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just  another torporless shammy whining 8(<br />
<br />
Camped Seb crypt for ~40 hours over 2.5 days (I know, sick) with me (61 shammy), my boyfriend (65 cleric) and a friend (58 rogue).<br />
<br />
I got:<br />
<br />
1 Yak club  (uber pet toy)<br />
1 silken whip of ensaring (another uber pet toy)<br />
2 DW helms<br />
1 DW arms<br />
1 cane of harmony<br />
Some tolans stuff<br />
1 blood ember bracer<br />
10 or so cones of the mystic (or whatever that grape ice cream cone is called)<br />
1 ods<br />
3 od mantles<br />
tash stick (pet toy?)<br />
1 box of nil space<br />
3 Heirophant cloaks<br />
2 JBBs (never noticed they aren't lore)<br />
Countless necro, cleric, druid, beastlord, wizzy and chanter spells.<br />
<br />
........and Canni 3.<br />
<br />
I would trade it ALL for torpor/malo.  One shammy spell in 40 hours is just nasty.  <br />
<br />
Being the generous person I am, most of it was given away to friends/guildies (hoping karma works), so I don't have the *money* to buy the spell either.<br />
<br />
Nasty SOE!! We hates it! We wants it dead! It's trixies us!<br />

<br />
You set up camp just up the hill from the VP zone in building and pull everything to there.  If you have a tracker, you can pull an extra guradian worm while you wait for the wyyrvens / guardian worms to spawn again in the enterance.<br />

<br />
I think I'll trade the 50ish rogue for a 65 monk.<br />
<br />
Think we can do the Gwurms the 3 of us? (65 cleric 65 monk, 61 shammy)<br />
<br />
/looks excited</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya very easy with such group, u can even duo them, or solo them with full buffs (torpor recommanded)<br />
<br />
Even if you get unlucky on shm spells, you may have some other 60 spells that you can sell easely and for a fair price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stop giving sh1t away and start selling stuff OMG. :)<br />
<br />
Heiro Cloaks (30kpp) + JBB's(15kpp to 20kpp) sell for quite a bit still (server dependant of course).<br />
<br />
I admire your dedication to camping for them though.<br />
<br />
/shiver<br />
<br />
p.s. yes I give away too much gear to friends too.... but draw the line somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with selling the stuff and bazaaring it.  I spent hours and hours killing GWs, camped various locations and basically pulled my hair out.   Finally, I left a bunch of money on an alt in the bazaar and told some friends to call me if they saw it.<br />
<br />
I got a call from a buddy yesterday that it was for sale.  Logged on and bought it for 50k.  Thats about 30k less than I had anticipated.<br />
<br />
Anyways thats what worked for me.  And BTW I'm on xev too.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I feel your pain, Stewardx oracle of xev:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I think your camping the wrong spot.  At your levels and maybe pick up another mellee or other class, I would do tolamjump or the other named in traks lair.  That is if trak is not up.  Very high chance to get malo and torpor there of of them.  I had tolamjump drop both malo and torpor at seperate times for me.  At your levels he would be easy. And i would say in 40 hours you would have no problem picking one up  or something else to trade for it.  Tolamjump is 2 hour spawn i think.  Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tell ubber guild banker( and search them they're not well know) ,they often have a copy of torpor in bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, make friends or at least chat to the spell banker of the top level guilds on your server.<br />
<br />
That is how I got Torpor and Malo.<br />
<br />
If they don't have a spare, ask them to hold one for you (at an agreed price) and then check with them once a week. <br />
Don't nag though :) They are doing you a HUGE favour so don't piss them off :)<br />
<br />
This approach may take weeks or months still..... but be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't get your hopes high with Jumpy or Trak... Have had a day when smacked, in a row: Trak (real one), Jumpy, Prot, Gore and Tale - 0, ZERO, shaman spells. Plenty of other trash I care not to remember. Mala, the bloody trash spell, dropped like rain. Sucks how mages can buy their spell for 25pp on Bazaar, while shamans have to slap out big bucks if they plan to buy it. Wish I could kill them vendors in Bazaar, I'd smack them just for fun and a lesson....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After 7 months of being 60 and 61 without torpor, my day finally arrived.  Killed Gore, and she dropped not one but two copies of torpor.  Since our next shaman in line was only 56, she's got it made, will never have to go a day without it.  Even though the dragons can be stingy, they still seem to be the best bet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
rofl...i'm killing them cuz I *need* torpor<br />
<br />
And thanks for more tips.  The uber guild bank idea is taken care of (said 65 cleric/boyfriend is in #2 guild on the server). Problem is, the majority of uberguilds have long moved on from kunark stuff, and only go for those particular mobs if they're in the way (ie...AoW raid....oops Wuoshi's up smacking people...keeeeeeel!!)<br />
<br />
Another thing holding me back....the only person willing to help me so dilligently (it's up to 50 hours now) is my boyfriend. We can easily duo Emp, but jumpy, etc...too hard to get people for.<br />
<br />
Hehe anyone ever see how hard it is to pull people from XPing in PoP to do a guild pick up raid? let alone spell farming :/<br />
<br />
A glimmer of hope though:  Emp dropped Pox for me the other night.  It was a nice lil encouragement, enough to keep me going a little more.<br />
<br />
I have a lil date with some friends to start up GWurm farming. I'm crypted out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good luck at this f... camp. And i said torpor recommanded for solo, wich is not efficient farming but just for fun and adrenaline ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">try to get some friends to WW and kill some dragons...<br />
<br />
Harla dar dropped 1 torpor and 3 malo 2 days ago...<br />
<br />
this is probably very very very very very rare, but it is at least a proof it can drop (6 spells dropped)...<br />
<br />
we were 3 groups and it was a huge overkill...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sadly, outside of VP these spells are very rare.  Camp emporer, camp jumpy, camp kunark dargons... still rare.  Go to VP and you will get them.<br />
<br />
I was very unhappy when my guild told us all to get vp keys.  Its a lot of running around and camping a few dumb mobs, but once we keyed up we hit VP a couple times and every shaman in my guild has torpor and malo.  We got multiple copies per trip -and we werent able to clear the zone, not even close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have been in the Bazaar a lot recently, I do regualar searches of the spells to keep a look out for another Shaman that I know who could use it ( I am to low ). But I have never seen it for sell on Povar. Torpor that is, but I have seen Malo for sell once... I will not comment on the price... it was on the low side though... so low in fact that I got beat to it....<br />
<br />
<br />
foo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Must be nice that your guild WANTS to go to VP. I am literally begging, pleading, giving money to guildies so I can get ONE group in VP to farm spells.<br />
<br />
The current guild answers:<br />
&quot;VP is an outdated zone and is not worth our time.&quot; -We arent going there for loot you dolt. It is for spells!<br />
<br />
&quot;But it is too hard to get the key.&quot; -Even though I know of 12 people that have the fang. That is the hardest part.<br />
<br />
&quot;We dont have the time. ST is better for us.&quot; -It is better for the melees, but for us casters we need our spells. For once I wish VI would make a zone melee invulnerable then maybe we would get our due respect. Now it is all about dps.  /sigh<br />
<br />
&quot;Go camp Jumpy, Protector, Emp, GW.....&quot; -I wish melees had to camp these guys for their disciplines and the like. Then maybe they might notice how much of a pain it is.<br />
<br />
I am just upset about the lack of help I get to get 2 spells that make me an xp machine. I guess I will only be at top priority if we lose the 4 or 5 other shaman with these spells. Such a bunch of crap.<br />
<br />
Even though I have dinged 60 and am almost 61 I will never consider myself an Oracle until I have these 2 spells. My silent protest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Farina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Guardian Wurms outside VP are really disappointing.  I have spent over 70 hours here only to get 3 shammy spells tigir's insects, voice of the berserker and talisman of the brute.  I also got several copies of banishment, mask of the hunter, and sunstrike.  I sold sunstrike for 50k which is really good only to get countless wizzies b*$@h at me for the price.  Like i told them i didn't want that stupid spell i wanted torpor and malo.  50k is nothing compared to what i am going to have to dish out for malo and torpor.  so take it or leave it.  i say go with the dragons and don't waste your time outside vp. maybe inside would be much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I spent a lot of Time at the VP entrance and it is frustrating. There where times where i couldnt get a GW to spawn for hours let alone dropping torpor.<br />
<br />
We started killing the chardok king and queen and kunark dragons whenever one spawned. We where able to get 2 torpors and 2 malo's within a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
King - torpor<br />
Talendor - 2 malo's in 1 kill<br />
Talendor - 1 torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well last night my BF (the 65 cleric/tank) and I duo-ed some Gwurms.  Didn't get any good spells, but it's good to know it can be done.  Only shammy spell that dropped was talisman of the cat.<br />
<br />
Our next goal is Talendor.  We have a 65 monk friend and between our buffs can get him upwards of 7k hp.  I'm thinking if we round out the group some more we can take him.<br />
<br />
Any comments/tips?<br />
<br />
This is really becoming a crusade for me.  I need all the input I can get :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">my best advice is farm 80-100k and buy quiessence instead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you have a small dedicated crew of people you might consider farming money to buy torpor (or maybe even quinn) instead of going straight for the spell.  The group you have could easily farm cazic thule and make some serious cash.  Also, go whack the kunark dragons whenever you find them up (patch day is the best time.  quite common for one group to get almost all of the dragons).  They're your best bet at getting the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, my exhausting crusade has ended. After camping and killing 30+ Gwurms, my BF and I got  a copy of Pox, EoT and sunstrike (i realize we're very lucky).<br />
<br />
I planned on selling EoT and SS to place in my torpor/malo fund.  There they saw in my bags until John Woo night was called in guild chat.<br />
<br />
John Woo Night: Guild gathers in a sentral spot (nexus, pok, Gfay, whatever) and scouts are sent out to check any and all spawns. In the mean time the guild is buffing up, getting ready for any kills that may come along.  <br />
Turns out everything is up in WW, and we just happened to be done farming ToV...<br />
<br />
Bam, Harla Daar down.  I win the roll for Malo!! I r teh win!<br />
<br />
Later that day I found Torpor for sale for 50k!  Managed to scrape it up and buy the spell before it was ganked.<br />
<br />
I am so relived it's not even funny.  I can get back to my normal EQ life...getting XP! <br />
<br />
I'd like to thank you all for the tips and things on this board, even though they didn't directly get me my spells.  It still kept me sane (and OMG out of seb!)<br />
<br />
WoOoooOOo! I am a real oracle now :)</div></div><hr />
