 come on take a guess nobody has a clue on what the bow will be like and posting a guess on sean's thread about making the bow/ will only clog up the thread so in all good fun take a guess.</div></div><hr />

DD procs are really annoying to say the least. Everyone jump up and down when bow shots break root yet DD on bow will break root 90% of the time and everyone wants one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aside from that no idea, might as well be 1/40 + 40 fire damage :p<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Taluven , Bow Procs kinda happen once in a year at night only when the planets are in the perfect constellation.... lol bow procs breaking root is (almost) a non-isisue, due to the frequency (or lack of rather) of the procs:)</div></div><hr />

If you want to be off service to your fellow Rangers, do not come here with speculation.<br />

I use the forums in an effort to educate myself and see no reason why I should have to deal with you wasting my time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah, thats a mean thing to say, but its equally mean to deride folks for speculation, which is harmless.<br />
I doubt anyone seriously uses the glade forums as an educational resource, i mean, its for a GAME. You know, a GAME where we have fun.  Oddly enough, to some of us, speculating about unknown/incomplete gear is fun. <br />
Way to bring down the glade Treece. As we say in Ohio, DINGUS.</div></div><hr />

As we say in ENGLAND... nah I am not going there.<br />

I mean, really, how many quests and fletching combines have been solved here thru &quot; speculation&quot; ?  <br />
Me? I figure the bow will probably be a couple points higher damage, with  +fire damage, than the nightmare bow, maybe mid 60's required level.  It'll prolly have a DD proc, but I'd like to see a stackable fire resistance buff that procs on the user. That'd be nice.</div></div><hr />

Takes one glance at a topic to see if it interests you, if it doesn't, then use the &quot;Back&quot; button and let others enjoy the topic who are interested in a little speculation.

I would like to see an effect on the bow, or proc. That would be cool =)</div></div><hr />

thats the nightmare bow, if VI holds true to the way they do trade skills (which almost in every single case in the game, a crafted item is inferior to the majority of droped items), it wont be much better, probably something like<br />

Then don't read here, my that was simple. I equate the above statement to you getting in a car accident where it was your fault, but you blame the other person because they were driving on the same road as you.</div></div><hr />

Who cares, don't respond then or even read the post. I read maybe 15 words before I decided I didn't care about it and went off to find another thread to read but I'm not about to sit here and call Lowi a idiot because I didn't like her post however I will call you an idiot because your so full of your self to think a post that took maybe less then 2min to read has &quot;wasted your time&quot; even though you chose to read it, guess that means your wasting your own time? dur</div></div><hr />

I see nothing wrong in this, i think its more like<br />

plus 32 fire damage<br />
range 1<br />

you know it'll be bugged</div></div><hr />
