<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Biggut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SO I am canabalizing cause I am main healer casting that god awful spell every 3 seconds. I got chloro on the tanks to help with heals and they dont sit down between fights to help me out I hate that shyt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hate it when you ride to the train station every day for 2 years then go on holiday for 3 weeks and your bum goes all soft, then you go back to work and because you haven't ridden your bike for a while you get a really sore ass for a week. I mean what was god thinking of when he made bicycles?<br />
<br />
And don't get me started about when you're brushing your teeth and the phone rings and you answer it and toothpaste and spit are flying all over the phone and the wall and you sound like a 10 year alcoholic with a speech impediment...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Biggut<br />
<br />
I cringe at the very thought of having to play main healer. I don't really mind all that much, but it does suck when you put a regen spell on someone to heal and they won't sit or worse, immediately pull something. *grrrr* Thank goodness for the slow spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh.  What level are you, Biggut?  Shaman are effective main healers...  well, for quite some time.  I was 53 before they changed Superior Heal down to 51, so my effectiveness really dropped from about 50-53.  Especially in Velious, where the mobs hit so hard &amp; have so many hp's.  That's probably still a bit of a dry run until 55 - Chloroblast does less healing, but it's a faster cast time and better mana usage.  And then once you hit 60 and get Torpor, you're very effective.<br />
<br />
It also depends what buffs you are casting - when I'm main healer, I'd only worry about hp buffs, regen, and heals.  If they want stat buffs, too bad - JB armor buffs would suffice, if I had them at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Acting as the main healer with chloroblast or sup healing does suck, I had always hated it.  <br />
<br />
However, it gets MUCH easier, and much more viable with torpor and group regrowth/buffs.  I actually find it much more fun and exciting in most places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want to feel like a 'main healer', get to level 60 and cast torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When your a high level tank you have so many HP's that sitting for 2 minutes aint gonna matter much. they need to be healed and and have regen on. Well, that's how I always look at it when I see them standing ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Clerics hate us.  Druids hate us.  At 60, we are just that good, as main maintenance healers anyway.<br />
<br />
If there is a large pull, and the Enchanter is getting whooped, the group is in trouble.  We are chain casting our mana away, and the mobs aren't being slowed.  Time for a CR.<br />
<br />
Oh .. Almost forgot.  I HATE it when I see tanks sitting.  If they're sitting, that means they aren't pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hate it when you eat cheesies and your mouth turns orange and you get bits stuck in your teeth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I hate people who drive really slow in the parking garage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate when people throw a cigerette out of the window of their car and it lights the rag on fire that is hanging out of your gas tank because you lost you gas tank cap and you have to either drive faster to try and put it out or pull over and pour water on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hate it when I get this little itch on my cornhole and it starts to turn red and then I have to pick it and then my finger starts to smell bad.  I really really really hate that =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Biggut, I can understand your frustration. Last night my Level 57 Shaman was in a group with 3 melees and two pet classes. Nobody else could heal, other than lifetaps and Bind Wound (which only the Monk ever used). Also, nobody could mez, forcing me to root park (which meant I was getting hit a lot, and missing out on med ticks). I had to repeatedly tell them to slow down on the pulls, as my mana regeneration could not keep up with the pace of the damage that was being done to the Warrior (Chloroblast was healing less than half a bubble on him, and he was only Level 52) and, to a lesser extent, everyone else in the party. Of course it ended badly, with deaths all around. Group Regrowth might very well have taken care of the problem, but I probably won't see that until I'm well into Level 60, and I'm never going to get Torpor.<br />
<br />
There's nothing better than duoing with a melee character,and even two melee characters are fine. But get too big a group and it's just not feasible (at my level, anyway) to have a Shaman as the only healer. At one point last night, I had to leave the group for a minute, to invis someone that was joining us, and someone said &quot;Don't pull - healer is gone!&quot; to which I replied &quot;We have a healer? I think you mean the slower is gone.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well first, only 1 melee should be getting hit. Now if they don't understand the concept of  mana management  then perhaps you can find a group that does.<br />
<br />
Shaman  CAN make pretty effective healers when regen is combined with slow.  But it's tough on a Shaman to be expected to parcel out buffs, haste, slow the MOBs, regen, root park AND heal.<br />
<br />
Hey I love pushing the envelope as much as the next Shaman. But there comes a time when you have to be honest and tell the knuckleheads:<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys this is taxing on my mana. We're about 1 add away from doing CR.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again - if they don't like it - leave em and solo or find another group. You play a shaman, not like either option is impossible.</div></div><hr />
