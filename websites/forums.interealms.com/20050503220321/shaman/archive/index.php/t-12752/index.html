<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hettar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, its been a looooong time since I've posted here, but this board is a ton of help for me whenever im stumped so I consult it quite often. Here is my question. <br />
<br />
At lvl 65 and in a high end guild, what kind of AA should a shaman pursue once they have mgb/can5 done? I am torn between scm, the defensive ones (including ca, lr, cs, id, nd) or the really fun looking offensive ones like virulent paralysis, spirit call and rabid bear. <br />
<br />
It would be nice to get my new AA title, but I don't really see myself using alchemy, quickbuff or the pet discipine anytime soon. I would rather go the route of practicality.<br />
<br />
Anyways, please post any feedback that you can, I have 10aa points saved up because i just didnt know what to go with and i didnt want to waste any on a hasty decision. If this has already been discussed then please direct me to the thread and I'll take it from there.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ND is very nice, being able to canni5 and not worry about low hp aggro is sweet.<br />
<br />
SCM is also nice, save mana every time you cast.<br />
<br />
SCR/SCRM are very powerful as well. 20 points to make Torpor/Quiescence heal 50% more is a very good bargain. Longer lasting buffs reduce buffing tedium as well.<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure is a bargain at 2aa, Spirit Call is a parlor trick I don't use much anymore, and Virulent Paralysis is nice to add to your bag of tricks. I'd get RC before getting any other of these.<br />
<br />
If I were you I'd get ND3, then RC1, then either SCR/SCRM or SCM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im currently working on Spell Casting Reinforcement (about to finish 3rd level) and SCRM simply for the fact that I do so much buffing and I hate it so much with the really nice added bonus that it increases the duration of our HoT spells.  SCM would be another good choice since it is used on every spell we cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends a bit on your role in the guild. If you are one of the main shaman and slow a lot, and hence get aggro, then the defensive abilities would probably suit you well. ND3 first, then the others like CA3, LR5 etc.<br />
<br />
RC is very useful, I only have RC1 though, I think RC2 is a notable improvement to the number of things it will cure.<br />
<br />
If you are often buffing people on raids, then SCR/SCRM is useful. Similarly, if you use torpor/quiesence a lot, its great and really increases its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Spirit call is more a fun AA, not much use on a raid. VP, again not much use on raids but great for soloing and sometimes in XP groups.<br />
<br />
Quickbuff is not just a gimic, faster torpor and patch heals can be really useful. Don't knock it. Again, depends on your role, I don't find myself healing much beyond trying to keep myself alive if I get slow aggro.<br />
<br />
So in summary:<br />
Debuffing shammy - ND3, CA3...other defensive AA<br />
Buffing/Healing shammy - SCR/SCRM, Quickbuff<br />
<br />
Go for RC when you get bored and want some quick gratification, I think you will like it.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion, as I'm not an uber shammy in a top-end guild :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have Quiescence or raid a lot as only shaman (AND HATE BUFFING~), get SCRM before anything else.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, Rc1 SCM3 are both very nice choices.<br />
<br />
Spirit call is useful for many reasons, I usually use it to manipulate events than for the actual damage it does, makes a handy ~4500hp rune too in some situations ;)<br />
<br />
Probably going to bite down ca3/lr5 next, then mess about with healing crits/adept/SCF at some point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All handy aa's.<br />
<br />
Depending on your current hps ND3 can be very nice. If you gear already has you over 3k unbuffed tho it's probably not a big deal other than bragging rights. If you want survivability CA/LR would be better.<br />
<br />
Like some people have said if you do a large amount of the slowing and get the aggro from it. CA/LR would be a good idea and eventual CS/ID.<br />
<br />
SCRM is wonderful. With a crown of abivolence if your lucky enough to pick one up it makes torpor/q last for what seems like forever. Longer lasting buffs goes well with MGB. Sure focus lasts long enough base for mgb to refresh but since mine lasts 70% longer (scrm and 8th shawl) I can wait for mgb to refresh and not have to reuse it shortly after and can save it for wipe outs, dispellers, what ever. Very handy if your the only shaman around or only with mgb/7th.<br />
<br />
Quick buff is nice. It definitely cuts down on the hastle of buffing if you can cast them faster. This was especially true with 60 group focus. 7th is already alot faster casting base. It's also really nice on torpor/q. Personally I stoped at qb2 and use a spell haste item to get me close to 50% cast time and hit it with cleric buff if i bother to get it.<br />
<br />
Radiant cure is a steal at 2 points for the first level. It's a must get IMO. The later levels cost more and don't add as much imo but still nice to have but can wait.<br />
<br />
SCM is good too. Less mana spent has the same effect as increasing mana pool and mana regen at the same time. Yeah shaman can make mana back at high rates but we have to actively make it meaning we aren't doing anything else.<br />
<br />
The healing aa's or nuke aa's aren't bad depending on what you typically do.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there isn't as clear an answer once you get past cann v. I'm sure you would even see some arguements about the mgb that you already got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">taraddar gave a lot of solid advice.<br />
<br />
I also have QB2 and a spell hast item so torpor takes only 3.2 seconds instead of 6.  Having a fast casting torpor/Q is huge when solo and also very nice in group to top up the support people when things get out of hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm still a newbie prophet but I don't think you can ever have too much hps.. nd is the way to go</div></div><hr />
