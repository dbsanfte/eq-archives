Air tower, every mob sees invis. Best way is to harmony/pacify your way up to Auliffe. Levitate is required for the named. He hits for 800 I believe, and casts an AE gflux stun(long stun, like 6 secs) 2 clerics doing a CH line and other classes on quick heals is what I use every time I do him. Auliffe is not slowable, and fairly resistant to all types of spells. Be careful of push, try to keep him in the center of the platform.<br />
<br />
Water tower - This mob casts AE mana drain rain/dd. Positioning is the key to him, if his mana drain hits the clerics, they go oom fast. You can be in CH range of the tank without being in range of the AE, just be at max range. This one is slowable. Somewhat resistant to disease, so if you land a disease slow ahead of turgur's, the better for you. I don't know how hard he hits, I've never been hit by him.<br />
<br />
Fire(lightning) tower - I've never done him, but i hear he casts AE dispell. I also hear the hard part is clearing to him, as mobs agro through walls.<br />
<br />
Earth - possibly the hardest tower. Mobs here called &quot;skygge&quot; proc an AE 1500 DD, you can wipe on these easy. When you get to where you want to pull the named, he has 3 &quot;pets&quot; with him. All lvl 65, and only 2 mezzable. I can't remember which 2 are mezzable and which 1 isn't. Not sure of his special moves, although since gaukr in earth wing procs a 1500dd, I would suspect this one does too. Tactics on the adds for him is to have a chanter mez each of the mezzable adds and to have a bard sing Song of the High Suns to send the other one back to it's bind point(if bard is the puller, he can sing it and Fading Memories to lose agro on it also), this way you have only 2 adds to deal with, both of which can be mezzed. Earth is immune to disease, and is highly MR. He is slowable, but GL getting it to land ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Earth is not that hard to slow once Malos/Tash is on.<br />
<br />
Fire boss procs a single target 1000DD. Dispell I think is just cos hes a wizard. <br />
<br />
Air boss: useful to levitate right at the start, because if you fall off you will die without it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice guide.  We did all 4 pretty reguarly some time ago with ~15 toons (3 of them bots) and the only differences I see are:<br />
<br />
Thunderclap doesnt need to be a 'get lucky and pray' pull.  We pacify our way to the middle of the big room he is in.  If your puller knows how, he can get Thunderclap down to the center by being in the right spot and working his movements (took an amount of playing with it to learn it).  Keep him relatively centered and none of the fast pops on the edge will ever agro.<br />
<br />
We fight Hailstorm in the room before the table and we dont snare kite the adds, just have the bard oos/highsun them all back, he will get resists but should be able to get them back without too much of an issue.  On a couple of occasions, we were able to split him without any of the bees adding, and several tries we had just one bee add (makes it easier on the bard).</div></div><hr />

Agree, this is a much easier way.  We have always done it that way.<br />

<br />
We actually have a bard pull him all the way back to the first room where you enter the tower.  1 bard pulls, 1 helps paci, then the bards highsun the guards back.  Once we figured this out, it went from being the hardest tower to the easiest and fastest...can be looting in 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />
