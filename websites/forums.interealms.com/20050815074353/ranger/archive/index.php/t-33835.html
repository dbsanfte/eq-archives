<br />
We are currently considering moving to a points-based loot system.  One detail that is clear is we will most likely want a way to assign point values to items.<br />
<br />
I've seen a few systems where items are &quot;scored&quot; based on their stats, similar to the spreadsheets we see in the Equipment forum for the Best of the Best armor and bow posts. <br />
<br />
What I am interested in is hearing about/seeing what rules system or formulas are in use by folks, what you are using for your own dkp system.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharidann</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, lemme try to give you a short overview of what we do. :)<br />
<br />
- Each slot has, for each class, a BASIC item. Ideally an item any recruit coming to your guild should have. This basic item may vary, depending where your guild is at, of course. :)<br />
- All items better are priced using this item as reference value. <br />
- We set a Maximum price for stats only. <br />
- We price the effects and add them to stats price.<br />
- Stats considered for item pricing are : HP Mana AC Resists Stamina Wisdom Intelligence.<br />
- Price of the same item for different classes can value. :)<br />
<br />
We have &quot;softened&quot; the curve of price progression to ensure that the progression is not linear, hence making items not top notch still worth considering without blasting away too many points at once. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rynar</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best systems are 0% inflation systems.  What this means is you hand out roughly the same amount of DKP per raid as you take out of the system in loot costs.  IE.  If you have a 40 man raid force for a mob that drops 2 loots, and you decide that mob is worth 20 DKP you are putting 800 DKP into the system.  Therefore the cost of the 2 loots should come to a total of that same amount.<br />
<br />
Not doing this will result in a % of inflation that will lead to a smaller % of your power raiders earning a larger % of the DKP than they are entitled.<br />
  <br />
No system will be a perfect one, but the closer you can keep it to 0% inflation, the more fair it will be to all your raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharidann</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">inflation only means that newcomers will be at a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ginlaan</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a open bid system with items that have no set value. Recruits get penelized -75 when they become a recruit. Recruits Earn DKP at the same rate as the rest of the guild. It usually averages about 5 to 6 dkp a nite with bonus dkp giving for low turnout nights and some reflags.<br />
<br />
There is no inflation or deflation penalty's giving. Yea it sucks when someone hords the DKP then vanish's and comes back when your farming quarm to spend there DKP but really those people are far and few between in our guild. Power raiders get the loot simple as that. You raid and earn the DKP your going get what you want when you want more or less. You dont raid you are not going get much loot so dont cry us a river about it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically it boils down to support your guild and get rewarded for it. Show up only partial and your upgrades are going take some time to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedChief</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best systems (IMHO) do to things.  <br />
<br />
They do not allow open bidding where one malicious player can jack the bid of a item up while they have zero intention of getting it (has happened to me personally).  <br />
<br />
And they do allow a method for items to eventually go for lower value as there worth decreases.  For example, I did some checking of my guilds Emp kills history.  In over 12 months  we have gotten 40 emp kills.  Ites such as AHBs which used to go for 20 points now go for rot (1/10th of a point).  Similarly Emp 2handers used to go for 20 points now go for 3.  Why?  because we have gotten alot.  But items such of the ring off Emp still retain there 6-20 point value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">beware of variable points for an item based on who is online or how long it has been dropping. <br />
<br />
Variable or lower pricing over time for items can encourage point hoarding and can also mean that the folks who rarely play actually end up ahead (if they spent 20% of the dkp for the same gear, but only played 50% as much they end up ahead).<br />
<br />
The 1-hander from emp is a great example.  If the first 10 people paid say 20 points, why should the 11th get the same item for free?  If an item is no longer worth spending the points for, let it rot, and let rot help the guild learn to stop doing the target.<br />
<br />
In a variable system the person who always passes on the item til 3-6 months from the time it started dropping could end up with such a point advantage that they could possibly pick their favorite items from end game mobs and get them all.<br />
<br />
Variable systems or systems where the price of an item goes down over time bother me since they can easily encourage behavior that is contrary to the guild's goals.  It can also mean that the person who plays rarely and is patient on upgrades ends up with better gear than the hard core every day folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedChief</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sabine, I see where your coming from and forgot to mention about the port hording situation.  <br />
<br />
With our system you bid 1 of 4 categories.  Uber, Good, Decent, and rot.  Rot is 1/10th a point, decent is 3 points,  good is 6 points and uber is 20+.  When you bid for a uber item, you will be charged at least 20 points (can go neg) and normally will be charged ALL your points (unless you have a LOT points, which doesnt happen).  <br />
<br />
Now you could be the person passing on a item for months on end, but when that one uber item comes, thats all your getting.  The system is designed to encourage people to spend points now and not save them for later.  <br />
<br />
As to the part-time player, they get points at a lower rate then full time raiders.  Again, another safeguard to make sure people get the points they earn.<br />
<br />
As to letting stuff rot.  There is absolutly no reason a item should rot.  Although my guild just got in time (need another fish kill for rotation<br />
though), we still do more minor targets then most guilds.  In the past three patches, we have a full raid force clearing 10+ elem mobs a night.  But after that, there are still 30-40 on that want to raid.  So thats when stuff like Emp, Cursed and even AoW is done.  Why should we stop doing a target when the only loot to truly rot from those 3 targets are the Mace of blood and the Bows off AoW?  Not even apps/trials needed that loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked out your system at http://www.thewarcouncil.com/viewtopic.php4?t=6175 and it is an interesting system.  I like the idea that how much an item is desired by an individual factors into play often, and that hoarding is almost impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedChief</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres also a running joke that system is more complicated then the US tax code.<br />
<br />
And you hit the nail on the head by saying individual desires.  There are a few Unique items in Vex Thal (the monk fire illusion mask, the clciky orb for cry of sky) that always go for a lot.  They dont have anything worth the points stat wise, but are still a unique item that is very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread has definitely caught my interest.  For kicks I ran a few statistics on our dkp database.  <br />
<br />
We have killed Quarm 23 times, and have seen 75 drops from the beast.<br />
<br />
I sorted the 105 members by total points ever accumulated and then counted the items from Quarm awarded to them.<br />
<br />
30 items (40%) went to the top 10 people<br />
18 items (24%) went to ranks 11-20<br />
16 items (21%) went to ranks 21-30<br />
3 items (4%) went to ranks 31-40<br />
5 items (7%) went to ranks 41-50<br />
1 item (1%) went to ranks 51-60<br />
2 items (2%) went to ranks 61-70<br />
<br />
Two items of the 75 went to people who have been in the guild less than a year (both joined when I did, 10.5 months ago).  <br />
<br />
Those who received Quarm items who were not in the top 30 did so (for the most part) by wearing Luclin-era items as they saved points for the desired Quarm item in that slot.  A few exceptions would be that we see lots of plate breastplates (15 from RZ, 3 from Quarm) so those are trickling down to the middle of the pack.<br />
<br />
I am about six weeks away from my 1-year anniversary with the guild. I am ranked #37 in that sorted list of points earned, and am #54 in current balance.  I spent points heavily to gear up from the mostly velious gear I wore when I joined.  Of the 1054 points I have spent, 220 of those were on items now in my bank, and 27 on my bard (couldn't resist the ft5 cloak).  If I ever have to hit my bank for a CR in Fear or something, I will be very well dressed.  I have great gear, and stand a decent chance of a bracer from Quarm (need 2 more to drop before we stop doing Time). 15 of the 20 items I wear are from Time.<br />
<br />
The system we use is very fair and very carefully watches for inflation.  We have changed the dkp awards for plane of time a few times to reflect the increased rate of rot that we see.  <br />
<br />
Our system rewards those who hoard points.  If you want to get the best items in a given expansion, you save your points til the best of the best is dropping, then spend those points.  We have 9 active Rangers at the moment, and 2/3 of us are at or well below 0 point balances since most of us spend heavily.  The anti-hoarders will snag lots of the otherwise rotting items and often end up with much better gear overall - but fewer &quot;dream&quot; items.<br />
<br />
Redchief's system is very different than the one we have.   You wouldn't see people with 6 or 7 items from Quarm while more than half the guild had none.  On the flip side it may be harder to plan your upgrade path with the wild variance in point costs.  The anti-hoard aspect of Redchief's system seems like a great thing.   Rangers in our guild got tired of healing the paladins and rogues in our raid groups who had horrible resists from hoarding, and an anti-hoard system would make it more likely that folks had similar levels of gear and were ready to do their jobs on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedChief</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a follow up, I'm positive that Elemental chain drops have been adjusted quite a bit (went from 15% overall drop rate to 50+% post-GoD patch).  We have rogues who are now upgrading there Aten arms (Armguard of Shadows) to Elemental.  I have been in TWC as a perm member for about 3 months now and have been able to acquire a number of elemental items.  Our system does have some negatives.  For one, it took us much longer to get a 10k warrior becuase the loot gets spread around more. But we have several 9k+ paladins and a 7.5k cleric (full Elemental w/ fully Auged LDON bp). <br />
<br />
Either way, a guild needs to decide the principles of its DKP system before deciding on the actual system.  Do you want point hoarding or not?  Open bidding or not?  How do you want to handle item devaluation?  How about point devaluation for those who go AFK for weeks or months on end.  What about hydras?  All something to take into consederation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Droth</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, all of those systems are way complicated.  We just have closed bidding on items.  Every Raid or actually every loot dropping mob is a source of DKP.  We get from 1 to 5 points for every raid mob we kill depending on difficulty.  Loot is then auctioned in a closed auction, an Officer takes bids and anounced the high bid and it goes from there.<br />
<br />
Items tend to go cheaper after the first few drops as the people who wanted them the most paid the most.  I paid 100 points for my Mail of Storms a couple nights ago.  Our first Mail of Storms to drop.  I remember paying 131 points for my Cloak of Thorns way back, one of the first in the guild.  after we had more then 10, they were going for around 15.<br />
<br />
I've never understood fixing prices on gear.  Should the 10th person to get a cloak of thorns pay 131 too? What if they cant afford that? what if no one can afford that?  does it then rot?<br />
<br />
Items reducing in price as they become more common is a great way for new players in the guild to gear up quicker.  Its also a great way to tell when you might be done farming such a mob.<br />
<br />
I know for instance in Water, most of the guild doesnt like doing Wise, but is ok doing the mold droppers.  Last time we killed wise, he dropped 2 rings.  They went for more then 60 each.  Hydro was killed next and dropped 2 arms, and they went for like 15 and 16 each.  Wise is still a viable target I'd say!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most systems let people go negative.  The fixed cost makes it so the go-getters who pay 110 for an item are not left behind the patient people who get the same gear a few months later at a fraction of the cost.  If you routinely pay 3x for an item that will only cost x points 12 weeks later, and only raid twice as much as the lowest attendance person, you will routinely lose to that person later.<br />
<br />
If items keep getting cheaper and cheaper, the point hoarders who wait and wait for that one dream item spend even fewer of their points as they go on their post dream item spending spree, and are even more able to hoard again in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Pretend you earn 1000 points a year.  If you get the good stuff whenever you can, you spend heavily and likely spend all 1000.  If the patient person next to you also earns 1000 a year, and is happy to wait to be near the end of the pack for those same items, they get the items almost for free, and probably end up with the same gear and at least 500 more points than you at the end of the year.  The system Redchief mentions lets people do that, but the variable cost means if you hoard, you may only get 1-2 items tops before you are beaten down to a zero balance again, so you may as well not bother.<br />
<br />
Rot only happens when no one bids on the item.  You can be at negative 1400 and still win any item that no one else with more than -1400 points wanted.  Having a huge negative balance just means it will take longer before you win an item that several folks wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedChief</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I havnt mentioned about our system which makes it really complicated is although you have only 1 pool of point of which points are deducted from, you have 4 seperate scores, 1 for each item rating (uber, good, decent, rot).  When you have 2 people bid good on a item, there good score decides who wins, not there main point score (the uber score).  What the effect here is those who always wait and bid good/decent will have more points for uber item, but may not get the good item (clear???).  Like I said, complicated like the US tax code.  <br />
<br />
Having people save there points and skip a expansion or two gear wise does nothing but hurt the guild.  Yes, its there points, but make them spend them on upgrades in the here and now, not later.  By doing this across the guild, they will get endgame loot/next expansion loot just as fast as the rest of the guild.<br />
<br />
As a side note, my old guild had a open bid/ points based on raid time (1 hour per point) system.  I paid about 110 for my cloak of thorns (1st in guild, warrior was next highest at 109 points) while the next ranger had to pay 170 points.</div></div><hr />

The best loot strategy I've ever seen was a combination of a discussion between those who can use the loot and merit from an officer.<br />
<br />
You make a channel, everyone that can use goes in there and links what they have, and you discuss it and when you last looted something.  Finally based on viewing this chat an officer makes the decision.</div></div><hr />

We're working on creating a DKP system now because it seemed pretty unfair to everyone that only certain people got the good to decent loot while everyone else was being awarded the crap loot.</div></div><hr />

In that time there I saw the officers go more loot then the rest of the guild.  There may be exceptions, but for the most part the merit/officer decisions guilds that I've seen have been unfair.  Also, this guild went to DKP shortly before they hit VT and Elem.<br />
<br />
In general, the only fair system is one that is analytical (point) in nature, not judgemental (human decision).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DKP vs Merit (Officer Vote/Decision) is always a pro-con system.<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to:<br />
Point System vs Human judgement system<br />
<br />
Human judgement will always have human fallibility in it.  Such things as biases, lack of understanding the value of an item, etc.<br />
Even the best officers are still human, so will be fallible.  There is also a problem in that it allows 2nd guessing/perception of favoritism.   Also gets into issues on Class based favoritism.  in thas case the perception is often as bad or worse than any reality.<br />
<br />
Human judgement's pro is that it can put the gear to better use.<br />
Take the time ring with 50AC buff that's all/all.  Is that ring better in a tank's fingers than a casters.  Sure it is.  If your cleric chain is failing from lack of mana pool/ft you can fix it.  etc etcetc<br />
<br />
thing I like about point systems is it allows people to take responsibility for thier own upgrades and choices.  You want item X, save for item X.  Period.  Gets rid of complaints.<br />
<br />
Personally, you would think a point system would be most valuable only based on peoples own intelligence on whats a &quot;good item&quot; for them.  But people don't really pass on items that are better suited elsewhere.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the whole inflation vs deflation aspect.   Personally I've always assumed items should lower in cost over time.  Reason is that usually a guild progresses over time.   So what was say a top expensive loot like say FT6 Shield from Ssra is not as valuable compared to FT6 Shield/Torch from VT.    If I could design a dream system I'd likely just categorize loots.<br />
<br />
Top Tier Loot (Would be subject to posting) <br />
2nd Tier Loot (Very Good level)<br />
3rd Tier Loot (Okay mild upgrades)<br />
4th Tier Loot (basics)<br />
5th Tier Loot (toys)<br />
<br />
as a generalization as a time Guild.<br />
Top Tier Loot now (Quarm/Tier5)<br />
2nd Tier Loot (Tier3/4)<br />
3rd Tier Loot (Tier2)<br />
4th Tier Loot (Tier1/Elemental)<br />
5th Tier Loot (rot tells)<br />
<br />
now obviously while a guild is learning time.  Top Tier might well be Tier3/4.  etc.  if you want the first Bow of Tempest, you are going to pay more than if you want the 10th.  The other key would be once an item stops getting tells at the level its classified at.  It's time to drop it down.</div></div><hr />
