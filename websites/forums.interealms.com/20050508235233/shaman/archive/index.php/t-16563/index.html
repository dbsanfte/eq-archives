<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read somewhere that it is possible to buy a charm from an adventure vendor for 1 to 6 AP. You can then of course augment this charm in combination with your adventure stone.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an idea on which different types of charms are available and which ones would be best for shamans ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe there are several cheap choices for charms, ranging from 2 to 6 points.  I bought a 6 point charm so I would have something to put my adventuring stone in.  The charms I looked at all added to our main stats.  If there were some that added to our saves I didn&#8217;t see them.  I debated between stamina and wisdom but eventually decided on wisdom.  These charms only work while in a LDoN adventure and my 6 point charm gives me +5 to my wisdom.  It&#8217;s not a huge boost, but it was only 6 points.  For those lucky enough to already have a decent charm, this would be a waste of points.  But for teaming masses that have never even seen a charm, this isn&#8217;t a bad deal.  <br />
<br />
I would recommend placing your adventuring stone in this cheap charm.  That way, if you get a better charm you can destroy this one and do the mini quest again to get another adventuring stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Far as I know if you lose your adventure stone you just hail one of the &quot;quiz guys&quot; and they automatically give you a new one (at least they did while I was on a CR)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's correct Caanus, just hail any of the guys that you took the test from and they will hand you a new stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are eight types of charm, and five of each type. You can buy one that adds to any single stat, or one that adds AC. They all only give their bonus while you are in a lost dungeon. For example, Crimson charm/talisman/amulet etc grants strength, whereas the Rustic charm/talisman/amulet etc grants stamina. They cost 1,2,3,4, or 6 adventure points and are sold by any adventure merchant. The 6 point charm adds 8 to it's stat I believe, but I keep forgetting to check when my warrior is in a dungeon.<br />
<br />
My shaman has the PoP charm, but if he had no charm I would probably go with wisdom, stamina, or armor class charm. It's not terribly important because the adventure stone eventually will become 10 AC, 10 to all stats and resists, 100 hps/mana. So whichever cheapo charm you pick it's just going to be a little extra bonus on top of a real nice augment.</div></div><hr />
