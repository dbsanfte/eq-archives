<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the NDA has been lifted I was wondering if someone can give us specific zones to hunt in for the runes for 66-68 spells.  The rune names would also be helpful.<br />
<br />
I was also wondering if again someone from Beta could clue us in on zones for shaman to hunt in both in group and solo.  As well as good OoW spots for exp. When parsing how long does it take to gain levels?  1 blue per hour?  etc..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any information.</div></div><hr />

I saw a 66 &quot;rune&quot; in one of the instanced zones which was farther in, but don't recall seeing any others.<br />
<br />
As for exp rates, I remember Wall of Slaughter being a pain in the neck with BoT-like exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, there wasn't any ZEM modifiers in beta so it's hard to say exactly what zones will be the best to exp in.  When beta was introduced most people spent most of their time in Walls of Slaughter.  I personally wouldn't suggest going there if you are somone that has to fight near a zoneline.. although they removed a good % of the mobs around there (used to see trains of about 100 mobs it seems).<br />
<br />
Alas, the spells will be available through spell tokens.  As far as I could tell, any named past the first zone can drop a token.  Spells 66 - 68 will be available through these tokens, which are not lore, and they aren't no drop (hello farmers).  Spells 69 - 70 are no drop.. not sure if they are no lore though.<br />
<br />
And.. as always usually the best place to go exp is a place where you see a higher percentage of equal con mobs and above.  I'm expecting the proving grounds to be good exp (although a bit hard to sit down and exp there I think).  The mobs to me while soloing in Walls of Slaughter seemed to have far more hps than they do in places like Qvic... where I've been soloing a lot at.</div></div><hr />
