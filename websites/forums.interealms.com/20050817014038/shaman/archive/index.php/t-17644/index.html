<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) To effect Velium Strike?  <br />
<br />
Velium strike is more efficent/dps to cast then spear of torment with all the toys and AA's. <br />
<br />
SCM3 <br />
Damage Focus above (25%) (There is cold, fire, ice, but no poison, unlesss I'm wring) <br />
FOM3<br />
Mana Preserve item 15%+ <br />
<br />
<br />
2) Introduce an upgraded version of the posion nuke at 64 for around 1100 dmg and 350 mana. <br />
<br />
Should be no reason it's on a lesser nuke.. Other casters have it on there level 64/65 nukes.  Why do we have it on a 61 nuke?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you wish to address SOE or representatives of SOE, the best way to do that is to /feedback in game, or use the feedback form (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp) on the eqlive website.  <br />
<br />
Discussions suggesting players use the EQlive form or the mechanisms provided in game to try to have changes made, or to discuss possible changes to items or abilities are welcome and encouraged here.  <br />
<br />
I seem to remember when the main Everquest boards that were run by SOE were shut down.  The SOE rep (Absor, or was it still Abashi back then?) has commented specifically that he would be less inclined to visit class boards that were filled with SOE PLEASE READ style posts, so it may actually be counterproductive.  <br />
<br />
Please consider this when posting other threads asking for changes.  I'm going to modify the title of this post.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rogue ornate gaunts:<br />
30% clicky haste (useless effect)<br />
<br />
Rogue elemental gaunts:<br />
atk/regen (useful effect)<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman ornate gaunts:<br />
25% spear of torment mana pres (useless effect; should be on velium strike)<br />
<br />
Shaman elemental gaunts:<br />
same useless effect<br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly there is a precedent here.<br />
<br />
Shamans really have no useful nukes, period.  If anything the gauntlet effect should be burning affliction or 25% mana pres on malos =)<br />
<br />
There may be more important things to fix, but this is really trivial.  Change the effect on one item, 5 minutes work tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like the idea of burning affliction.<br />
<br />
Reason for it being spear of torment instead of velium strike is for burst dmg?  Not sure, guess I should do a search and see what others have said and discussed instead of bringing up an old argument.  But I'm lazy.<br />
<br />
A mana pres for detrimental's over time in general maybe?  Or that might be too much to ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">look at all caster's glove, they all have similar effect :<br />
<br />
- cleric :  lv62 nuke &lt;- best nuke<br />
- druid : lvl64 fire nuke(best fire nuke, their lvl65 cold nuke is similar)<br />
- mage : lvl65 nuke &lt;- best nuke<br />
- necro : lvl61 nuke &lt;-- their best nuke, 1200dd!!<br />
- chanter : lvl64 nuke &lt;- best nuke<br />
- wizard : lvl65 nuke &lt;- best nuke<br />
<br />
- shaman : lvl61 nuke &lt;- fastest nuke, 2nd big nuke, it is our best nuke ?<br />
<br />
Now, hope you see the fact before ask for something too much; better look more closer in necro/chanter/cleric's case if want dot focus/detrimental focus<br />
<br />
now the problem is :Velium strike Vs Spear of Torment which is best nuke ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think we need a sticky thread &quot;Shaman class bitchfest&quot;  That way we don't get 100's of threads of complaints :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love the idea of Burning Affliction IV on the elemental gauntlets.  It would fit the shaman class SO nicely, dontcha think?  And would add to the WOEFULLY tiny amount of BAIV items in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The other bitch about the focus affecting our PR nuke is that it's MUCH more likely that you'll find a focus effect for your ice nuke than your PR nuke since there is no DD focus for PR based spells.  IMO, our best nuke is certainly Velium Strike.  With ele boots 18% mana pres and any one of a number of easily attainable 25-30% Ice DD focus items (bear in mind I'm talking about elemental+ characters, I realize the situation may not be the same for everyone)... Velium Strike is most certainly our best nuke and should be the one affected by our Ele gloves.  Spear of Torment has it's limited uses, but it's just that... A situationally useful nuke.  I'd say wizards would be a bit pissed if their gloves focused some nuke like a lure that's only situationally useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh yeah, and have to agree with Henora... I make a point to ignore any post that attempts to scream directly at SoE in the title or mentions any sort of petition.  This isn't an SoE forum.  This is where WE talk about stuff and occasionally Absor or someone may stop by and check things out to get a feel for what's up with the Shaman on EQ, hopefully at least heh.<br />
<br />
The big caps titles essentially screaming for attn. is more counterproductive than anything IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like our posion nukes because it will land BEFORE the mob is dead. And that's why I like my gauntlets the way they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">- shaman : lvl61 nuke &lt;- fastest nuke, 2nd big nuke, it is our best nuke ?<br />
<br />
Actually, Spear of Torment is our 3rd or 4th best nuke, and it isnt our fastest cast either.<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment does 675 (level 61 - 275 mana - 4.2 sec)<br />
<br />
Blast of Venom does 680 (level 54 - 340 mana, 3.9 sec)<br />
Velium Strike does 925 (level 64 - 300 mana - 7.8 sec)<br />
Ice Strike does 645 (level 54 - 250 mana, 7.0 sec)<br />
<br />
Blast of Venom, which is the lower level version of Spear, casts faster and does more damage for 65 more mana. Ice Strike does 30 less damage for 25 less mana. And Velium Strike leaves Torment in the dust, doing 250 more damage for 25 more mana.<br />
<br />
Or you could do Tears of Saryrn for 1950 (or 2600 with 4 waves) for 450 mana, providing no waves are resisted. <br />
<br />
I have the ornate gloves, but I dont use Spear of Torment because it just doesnt compare to any of our other nukes at that level. IMO, I'd like to see it changed to a focus effect that helped Tears of Saryrn (either reduced mana or improved damage).</div></div><hr />
