<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering what path i should take next for AA...my current AAs are:<br />
<br />
--General--<br />
Run Speed 3<br />
Innate Regeneration 3<br />
--Archtype--<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
--Class--<br />
Mass Group Buff<br />
Cannibilization<br />
Quick Buff 1<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
--PoP Advance--<br />
None<br />
--PoP Ability--<br />
Spirit Call 3<br />
<br />
I was just wondering what you guys would get next if you were in my position. I was thinking of getting Combat Agility and then Lightning Reflexes. Your opinions please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">RC1 is very good for 2aa.  I've had it for a while, and today at trak was the first time I've actually had to mem DA since getting RC1.<br />
<br />
QB2?  Do you have a haste of mithaniel item?<br />
<br />
Healing Adept and Advanced Healing Adept would probably go very well with SCRM to let you be sole healer in a group with greater efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hows about Innate Charisma? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spell Casting Mastery is very important.  I would get SCM 3, then for Combat Agility 3, then push towards LR 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Improved lung capacity. No question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Off of the set up you show I would finnish out QB. Then get VP1,RC1 (RC oppional) CA. Then eather max LR and then get CS. Or get CS then max LR. It also dosent hurt to get the first lv of suspend minions which can be tossed in there anyplace the same with RC. SM is usefull for when you have to invis to move, or to have an extra pet hanging has an ace in the hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CA3, and LR5.  Seriously.  Get nothing else before these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for all the feedback i think i am going to get CA3 and LR5 like most peeps said. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">CA3 and LR5 are very good, working on them atm.  but 2 points for RC1 is a bargain and i would consider ithighly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definitely put 2 points in Radiant Cure.  Best 2 points I've ever spent and plan on maxing as soon as I get SCRM and Quick Buff 1 (have to get that class title :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Radiant Cure is a great aa for two points, especially if you are doing tier2 bosses/tier3 xp in PoP etc<br />
<br />
Also useful for stuff like SSra curses (AL/HP 'zoo' etc etc)<br />
<br />
The best thing is it doesn't use a spell slot ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">radiant cure, scm3, advanced healing adept3, advanced healing gift3.<br />
<br />
lr is useless because it's a whole lot less avoidance than ca, considering the cost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another vote for Radiant Cure.  <br />
<br />
Surprisingly handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">anyone got a progression chart they would like to share with why they did the choices they made (I.E what the AA do and why they did do it at that time ) ? <br />
would appreciate ,<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would spend the quick 2 on RC before going on to CA3 and LR5.</div></div><hr />
