<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well it seems to me that i am not alone when i think about BoN and simply do not get exciited. So i think to myself... Self, what would get you excited?  Well ill leave out the swedish twins and the nubien princess but in relation to BoN i was thinking that a small adjustment to this spell would have me frothing at the mouth for it.<br />
<br />
Now its obvious, atleast to me that we arent getting it changed to 75% slow, even though it should be. I do however not see why we couldnt change the resist modifier to a debuff. I mean think about it, if your really doing your job right then even if you have this your still casting malos cause if your not the wizzies arent landing nukes too well nor are most of the other nukers and procs usualy dont land well either.<br />
<br />
So why not..<br />
<br />
<br />
65% slow <br />
-40 to all resist relivant to the malo line, not a check, but a debuff.<br />
1.5 min duration<br />
mana 225<br />
recast 6<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean the idea i feel behind this was to make exp groups less tedious with our debuffing in a exp enviroment and i actualy feel it was a step in the right direction. I do however feel that this spell if it was slightly refined would make a wonderful yet none overpower tool in our arsenal. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What ya think. Oh and obviously the numbers arent set in stone, but it was just to get theidea across. Im sure someone can break it down mathmaticaly better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might want to also add the -40 to the resist check as the -40 debuff will not be applied until the spell sticks.<br />
<br />
And unless it stacks with malos malos will block it and both malos and malosinia will overwrite it.<br />
<br />
the idea itself is nice though - stacking issues make designing any spell like this problematic though unless it slows at least as well as turgur's and debuffs at least as well as malosinia. Not that I would mind such a spell . . I just do not see it happening. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I like it. :)  If they could work out all the stacking issues, I think it could be a nice boon to the shaman in that level of content.  Being able to toss this one spell on mobs that were fairly resistant would be great.  Having to cast malos and then slow ties up a lot of time in such a short fight.<br />
<br />
I do agree though, I still think the slow % should be 75.  I mean, we've had a 75% slow since level 51.  What's wrong with getting an upgrade 14 levels and several expansions later?  Leave the 75%, give it the -40 or -50 resist check, and give it the -40 debuff.  Now you're talking about a spell every shaman would keep memmed once they got it.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like it...  I actually use the spell quite a bit even as it is, but I also have to keep turgurs memmed at the same time, which is annoying.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it's not impossible for the average shaman to get.  I'm about as average as you get, and I have it. ;)</div></div><hr />

i'm assuming you are saying this cause you haven't tried to get it yet, cause well, it's pretty damn easy for any two people to get alone.  Hell, shaman are soloing to get it right now.  It's very easy to get unless you just haven't tried to do it, for which I'm assuming this is what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey, do you think you could post some information regarding where to go and what to do to get it?  I'd greatly appreciate it :)  I always thought you needed a well-geared group at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just level one of the  sewer adventure, you dont need a UBER group, but a decent one is a must. This spell isnt that hard to get, just takes time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How about an &quot;overslow&quot;? Add enough % to slow so that minor mitigation means nothing (giving us a 75% slow, hur hur), while progressively tougher mitigation drops us down to Enchanter, then Beastlord, and finally bard-strength slows?<br />
<br />
As a caveat, give it no resist adjustment, and make it only work on mobs flagged to mitigate.</div></div><hr />

I do not want to unmitigate slow on raid encounters myself. All I want is to slow for a big enough amount in single group encounters to be a better choice then a second cleric or druid when the group does not already have slow.<br />
<br />
The obvious solution is not to play around with our slow percentage, but to not make MOBs mitigate so much and/or change resists or fight duration.</div></div><hr />

Ok this isn't particularly directed at you but just a general response to this type of idea. ANYTHING THAT REDUCES MOB DPS LIKE SLOW WILL NOT HAPPEN AS A DEBUFF OR BUFF. I mean come on people stop and think about it for a second. Over slow, deceasing double attack/duel wield, castable defensive, what ever the hell you want to come up with isn't gonna happen. If they wanted us to be able to decease the mobs dps lower than it already is they would just let us frigging slow it more in the first place. They put slow mitigation in specifically to decease the amount we could decrease a mobs dps by they aren't gonna come up with some new complicated way of letting us decease it's dps further espeically when some are significantly better than slow.<br />
<br />
As to the idea I'm sure I'd love balance of Nihil to be a combo slow/malos but i don't think it will happen. (btw don't use BoN please cause thats still Bane of nife when i see that =). For what ever reason verant seems to think that balance is good where it's at. <br />
<br />
As far as the legistics of actually implimenting it IF they did choose to that would be fairly complicated. Stacking issues up the wazoo I see coming. On the one hand a malsoini(a) or even malos spell overwriting the combo spell and removing the slow would be REALLY REALLY BAD. On the other hand being stuck with a weaker resist buff on the mob wouldn't really be much better. I also wouldn't want to loose the resist mod either because one of the advantages of the spell is the resist mod. Giving it a better chance to land and not needing to cast malo(s) before hand. Take away the resist mod and you loose that.<br />
<br />
On the one hand pegging it at neg 40 resist mods might be a bit more realistic to actually getting but it really doesn't make sense. Malos is neg 55 to everything but disease and is unresistable. Why should a resistable spell be less effective? It shouldn't. Going for the full neg 70 might be a bit much to ask since the spell does have a better chance of landing than malosinia. neg 65 would put it in the middle of the 2 and close enough that I wouldn't mind not being able to upgrade to malosinia.<br />
<br />
So I guess that leaves us with<br />
Balance of nihil<br />
75% slow<br />
neg 40 resist mod to land<br />
neg 65 to MR FR PR CR<br />
1.5 sec cast time, 6 second recast time<br />
6 minute duration and 600 mana<br />
<br />
Yeah the mana is high but thats because it completely replaces both malos and turgurs which together total 650 mana. I don't think it should cost more because it isn't unresistable like malos so it isn't as good in that respect. Turgurs and malosinia would total 550 mana.  So mana wise that puts it inbetween a turgurs + malos combo and a turgurs + malosinia combo which fits since the resist debuff and resist mod are between both spells too. Too bad i don't ever see us getting that spell.</div></div><hr />
