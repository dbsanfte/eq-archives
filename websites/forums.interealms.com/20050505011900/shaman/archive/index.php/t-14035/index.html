<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well friends, it's that time again, time to pay the coffers of my provider and keep this site going for another 6 months. This is our 5th donation drive and with a little time, we've always managed to raise the money needed to keep the servers going. I always hate making these posts <br />
<br />
because I feel like I'm begging, but bills are bills and they are due. You always make it easy on me though in the end, so let's keep that tradition alive :)<br />
<br />
I've been playing EQ for over four years now (hell, I just hit 65 yesterday!) and I'm still as happy with this game as the first day I logged on so long ago. I've been running this site for about three and a half years now... the last two years fully funded by contributions from you all. We all have a lot to look forward to, another expansion seems to be in the works, a whole continuance in Everquest 2 and even Everquest in its current state shows no signs of letting up.<br />
<br />
This community has long been a wonderful resource, where people from all classes, SOE representatives, other gaming companies and people that don't even play EQ anymore come to share stories, experiences and help each other figure out this huge universe. We've consistently maintained a great environment in which to do all of this... and it's really just me behind the scenes. I have the maturity of you all to thank for keeping this place so awesome throughout the years.<br />
<br />
Lately, I've been beta testing the newest version of vBulletin and everyone seems to like it a lot. I'm trying to work on some new technologies that will interface the boards with the static site for guides, comments on guides and spell discussions. Hopefully, when vBulletin goes final, I'll have more details on that.<br />
<br />
So, I ask again of you, please help keep this place going. As many of you may know, I've never earned a dime from this site (well, a few of you helped me on my ring purchase ;)) during my donation drives. It all goes to keep the servers paid for and the massive bandwidth we all <br />
consume (close to half a terabyte!) each month. It helped when I moved servers as I only have to pay $1800 per six months as opposed to $1950. However, both sites have yearly leased licenses that run $70 bucks that are both due. So, the total for this next 6 month period will be $1940.<br />
<br />
As usual, I'll keep everyone informed as to how much money we have received so far, and provide updates when I can to how the drive is going. I still have most donor information from the previous 4 drives and will add anyone from this drive to the list as well. I still have a sort of &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; list I keep that I can smile over and hopefully in the future provide a permanent home and some added perks to the site. I even have this GREAT group of Japanese rangers that help a lot each time! (*waves*)<br />
<br />
Every little bit helps.. out of about 11,000 Rangers and 10,000 shaman last time.. yes, 21,000 people, I received a grand total of just over 200 donations... yes, if you do the math, you'll see that only ONE to TWO percent of everyone on this site donates :( Each drive, I see many of the same names, all doing their best to help the site. If even 10% of the people on the site donated, I'd probably never have to ask for donations again!<br />
<br />
Just some stats for you. Last donation drive, the numbers were as follows:<br />
<br />
Total raised: $2024.78<br />
Ranger donors: 172 ($1640)<br />
Shaman donors:  30 ($250)<br />
Other  donors:  18 ($130)<br />
<br />
I haven't been feeling the love from the shaman lately.. not sure why they aren't helping. Maybe you shaman don't want a site anymore? :) I had to drop the SK's awhile back because they were eating up too much bandwidth and not helping defray the costs. Hopefully, shaman will balance it out more this time :)<br />
<br />
As usual, you can donate via PayPal, or you can send me a PM, or email at sunmoon@interealms.com and I'll send you my address if you want to donate via check or money order. Thank you everyone that can help keep this site going. I can't thank you all enough for the years of enjoyment I have had running these sites!!<br />
<br />
Please include your board name and class when donating so I can give you credit!<br />

Just an update, thus far, we've raised approximately $720 dollars, so we're about a third of the way. That's not too bad for only 4 days thus far.. hopefully we can get the rest soon and shut this one down early</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Actus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">because I feel like I'm begging<br />
<br />
Hahaha. I don't think the feeling that you're begging is a deterrent, Sunmoon. <br />
<br />
I've never earned a dime from this site (well, a few of you helped me on my ring purchase )<br />
<br />
Yes, quite a big exception. I don't know why you feel you are entitled to earn from this site. Exactly zero EQ mods earn anything from the sites they run. You HAVE been paid; you begged for substantial cash which you used to buy your fiancee a bigger diamond ring. You also alluded in other threads that you used some of the leftover contributions to buy beer. <br />
<br />
Maybe you shaman don't want a site anymore?<br />
<br />
Maybe they are just uncomfortable donating to someone who apparently feels entitled to be paid for what he does, and has no reservations about using funds for his own personal use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ass (hmm, need 10 characters for post...hole)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actus, ok, I'll bite.<br />
<br />
No mods earn money from running sites? I beg to differ. I know Baelish does as CastersRealm, EQVault does.. Allkahazams does and I'm sure there are others. However, that isn't an issue here since I don't earn money from this site.<br />
<br />
As far as leftover contributions, yea, in three years of running these sites, I may have had some last minute donations come in, 75 dollars over the last time as a matter-of-fact. Most of the time, I apply it to the next drive as it just sits in my PayPal account. I even have a few cards with &quot;Buy a few beers with this!&quot; written in them. Your point?<br />
<br />
And to your last unsubstantiated point, I have never feel entitled to make money from this site and never really have.<br />
<br />
Really, the ring thing is old and I had 99% more support than I did the one or two of you that said otherwise. These boards represent a valuable addition to Everquest and gaining enjoyment out of them. You, and the miniscule minority you are with can try all you want to make me feel bad for asking for donations to only cover the costs of the boards. Too bad it won't affect me. Achieving the amount required to run the boards is met each time and often with very encouraging notes from people who help. I guess we're all just a bunch of idiots throwing money around...<br />
<br />
Now back under your little rock, I'm sure you're much cozier there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Actus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I made my points, I don't expect a response from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually, I just looked up all of your existing posts and noticed you really don't have anything better to do than try to make me out to be some bad person.<br />
<br />
You also seem to have registered right about the time another person on this board was banned. So, until you have something to actually contribute to this board, welcome to the ban list.<br />
<br />
If you have any problems with me, take it up with me at sunmoon@interealms.com and stop trying to smear me.</div></div><hr />

Rep bump for Chulain for making me laugh so loudly my co-worker thumped on the wall!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">done.  glad to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't think some people understand the amount of work it takes to run a site, on top of the money cost.  If he receives 75 bucks over the cost of running the site, so what?  Enjoy, you earned it :)<br />
<br />
Also, after almost 2 years of reading this site and the ranger site, I put my butt in gear to donate also :)<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work Sunmoon!</div></div><hr />

Am also a bit baffled about difference between rangers and shammies, though rangers waste err spend double the bandwith with posts and are as far as i can see from random lurking the bigger and more outspread community.<br />
