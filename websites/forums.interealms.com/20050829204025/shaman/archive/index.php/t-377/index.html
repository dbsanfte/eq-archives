<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dawnshroud Peaks on Luclin. EXCELLENT experience solo or grouped, but no loot (none at all). Been soloing here since 32, and made 34 in about 7 and a half hours of play time. Never seen anyplace with as good experience as this. At 35, I'd recommend fighting Zelniaks (some may be light blue, but most should still be blue), large Zelniaks, and Shrooms. AVOID the wolves, as they are MAJOR undercons and will eat you alive. Also, try to use the third person view so you can watch out for wandering Lightcrawlers. They are aggressive, and they BLIND, which is annoying as $#!*. Other than that, it's a great zone to level in, and I've heard there's mobs which will take you all the way into the mid 40's and higher, if you don't mind not getting any loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At level 35 I started hunting in FV, in the NE corner, past mini Giant Fort, pulling near zone to Swamp of No Hope.<br />
<br />
The exp. here is excellent either solo, with a partner, or a group.<br />
<br />
The mobs:  Drolvargs (lv. 26-36 or so) and Frogluks (lv. 26-36 or so).  There are TONS of them there in the NE corner, and unlike the shoreline, no butterflies to KS you.  Loot is decent, nothing spectacular, but better than OT I believe.<br />
<br />
Even better is the fact that after where the ground changes color as you enter canyon leading to Swamp zone, there ARE NO WANDERING MOBS!!!!!  Yuppers, you can single pull back here and root rot or kite and med in total saftey.  You can park your doggie and pull back to him.  No worries that he will aggro any adds and such.<br />
<br />
I went from lv. 35-39 in about 2 weeks of lazy playing (maybe 15 hours a weeks play time) and had not a single death.<br />
<br />
And for you good-aligned folk, no wandering DE guards to pulverize you.  You can bank and sell in zone.<br />
<br />
Do it, you will not regret it!!!!<br />
