<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fattor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So everyone is always telling me I need to wait till 60 to solo in PoV, just wanted people to know if your carefull at 59 its not that tough...I buff up and have a kei/virt if I can find, summon pet and cast stoici on myself. Right after stoici I pull with 49th lvl pet, he dies like instantly.. just for carefull pulling. I slow the mob when hes inc and root, i back off and land my debuffs. Then i cast stoici on myself again and start to DoT, I use pox, plauge, and bane of knife.Dont have the others.. :( if root brakes i finish the 3 and re root. if not i eat off the stoici. When mana gets below 50 I only use pox and plauge and worry about eating for mana. Usualy only have to re slow once so its not really THAT long of a fight. Ive only had to run once out of about 5 hrs of constant fighting, didnt really parse the xp was having to much fun. The but cheeks pucker up a bit at that lvl with the 500+ hitters lol. When I dance for mana I use stoici at like 80% health and dance, if you get caught at 60sih health you could easily take a bad round and die. Have fun !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kargren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At your level do you find it possible to main slow and heal for a group in POV? I am hopeing to get my shammy into valor soon and want to see how bad it is for a young shammy in valor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea you can but sometimes it gets kinda hairy if you miss a slow or 2. I didnt bother with anything other than sini and slow and heals when I did it though, need alot of mana for 2 pulls or if you miss a couple slows. Alot of this will depend on the tank, his hps and ac.<br />
<br />
 as far as resists go... I get resisted   5x more in GE than I do in Pov at the same lvl its wierd but..hey im not complaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cunoblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I managed to kill a couple of mobs in PoV at 57.  It's possible, aslong as I can land malosini, and keep it rooted.. maxing out hp and kei are a must.<br />
<br />
would have stayed there but guild needed a slower and I booked it out, probbly a good idea because I probbly would have died eventually.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zilaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm... well... As far as solo PoV at 59 i was able to do it, trying to keep a good 1.5k hp on all the time... With canni 4 being MH and main slower is easy in PoV... just keep jammin the canni and tossing stoic on self around 50%.... I usually have enough manna to toss in a bane of nife... <br />
<br />
As for solo... Had a V and c3.. but c3 wore after first two min.....  Pulled an outer mob... was red to me. (^.^) and had it slowed before it hit me (pulled it w/malo, ran back, rooted, tossed slow)<br />
<br />
Once it was slowed sent in dog to take initial hits, ran in myself and tossed a few dots and melee'd to save dog, rerooted, backed off, toss stoic... Other then that i would send in dog till about 30% then back him off.... Root would break let it run to me, reroot and dot, then back off and heal up... whole fight took 15 min... but got half a blue of XP. ^.^</div></div><hr />
