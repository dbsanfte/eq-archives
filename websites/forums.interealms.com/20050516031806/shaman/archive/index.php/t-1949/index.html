<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well, when i originally rolled up my shaman, i wanted to name her Hentaii...but it was rejected, someone apparently had it.  Now, it has become available, i checked last night on a whim.  sooo...do i try to get my name changed or stay Mojokyn?   ive gotten so used to the name, and its what everyone knows my by...i'm kinda torn.  moving to stormhammer for a month would kinda suck though.  what would you do if you were me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would keep the name.  By this time, I'm sure Mojo (as you MUST be called, and it's SO cute!) has her own personality and reputation linked with the name, so I think that changing it would probably feel really weird to you and the ppl you know.  <br />
<br />
If you're into playing alts maybe start one with the name Hentaii -- a vamppy little elf with pigtails and a short skirt or something... <br />
<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont switch, too much hassle for too little gain. Would be sorta bad if a gm decided that &quot;hentaii&quot; violated the naming policy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i dunno, i think you should stick with your name... you will feel weird when your name is not Mokojyn anymore and everyone starts calling you Hentaii and it will feel like nobody knows who Mokojyn is :x<br />
<br />
it's almost like losing that character x_x\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few people got name changes for no good reason early on in stormhammer but that isnt the case anymore. Anyone I've talked to recently has been flat out refused. The GMs now say that the name policy on Legends is the same as other servers even though this wasnt the case at first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Err Mojo Isn't Hentaii rude manga cartoons? :eek:  If so then that would violate the VI naming convention, and you'd soon find yourself having to change your name again. :(<br />
<br />
If you do a search for Hentaii in google you'll see what I mean. This would not be a good idea if you are at work... ;)<br />
<br />
Why did you choose the name in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You are Mojokyn - it's your identity - unless you wanted to change your name to John Wayne or some other movie star name to have more fan appeal.  In that case it's perfectly acceptable. :D<br />
<br />
Krup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whats this about Stormhammer? Are you moving Mojo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When i first saw your name, i thought of the song by Mojo called &quot;Lady&quot;.   Keep your name  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you're thinking about moving to SH to get a name change, forget about it.  They dont do it.  They will change names that violate naming policy just like any other server.  Only difference is instead of taking a week to happen only takes an hour or so for a GM to get to you and do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Guys, she's not saying move to SH to change her name.  To change your name on your current server you first transfer to SH.  Then create a character with your name on your old server.  Then asked to be switched back to the old server.  When you switch back your name will be &quot;taken&quot;, so gm's will put an x on the end of your name.  Then you have to petition and get it changed, which is why she said &quot;moving to stormhammer for a month would kinda suck though&quot;.  This is the &quot;guide&quot; people are also selling on playerauctions from time to time on how to change your name.<br />
<br />
As for the first question.  No, I wouldn't change names.  You've been around too long with that name to get a name change now.  What if some old friends who don't play much happen to come on and not find mojo?  Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The GM's won't change your name even if you ask, like everyone said.  They're extremely strict about changing first names unless it's a violation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">thats a good point Oishii...never really thought of it that way.  and yah...Anamolas is right on what the scheme is (no way im leaving quellious for good).  I talked to a couple friends about it, and one pointed out that people would probably call me Hen, which would invariably lead to chicken head jokes.  no thanks!!</div></div><hr />

Read the post above yours, Morbad.   People change their name by moving to Stormhammer for a month, then while their character is gone... make a mule with the same name.  When you move back your name gets an &quot;x&quot; at the end and you can petition a GM to change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You have a reputation built around your name, whether good or bad, among those you know and others you may not realize. To change your name is to rebuild your reputation unless its among guildmates and close friends. Even they will be confused a while though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Keep your name. Mojo is much cooler than a word that means Japaneese cartoon porn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally, I really like your current name.  I suggest that you stay with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Do you really want a name that most people associate with japanese animated tentacle rape sex?<br />
<br />
keep the old name =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think you should change your name to Borgaxslave. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i got my name changed from blacklace ages ago :) (just after kunark release i think)<br />
<br />
i still regret it, and people still call me blackie :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">oi i didnt realize it was a referral to pornography :p.  i just thought it meant 'naughty' or something like that rofl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One of my best friends in the game's original char was a barbarian warrior and his name was Hung.  Well it took them a good year and a half, but they finally made him change it (he was level 45 or so at the time too).<br />
<br />
He now plays a necro mostly, but whenever he logs on the warrior, only people that don't know him from that time call him by anything other than Hung.<br />
<br />
I'd call you Mojo even if you renamed to Nomojo. ;)<br />
<br />
Try looking at some different sites than what's bookmarked and see if you can't come up with a more decent name, eh? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Read the post above yours, Morbad.

<br />
This doesn't work. GMs will simply gank the name on the level 1 character. It will NOT work. And if you try to level the character to 6, or even 20, chances are the GMs willl ask the lower-level toon to change his/her name. It's too easily manipulable any other way.<br />
<br />
Nice try. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If I did this, I prolly wouldn't leave it at as a level 1 char, and I likely would ask a friend to make some class on their account that I could power level past at least 6.<br />
<br />
There'd be hell to pay if my level 6 (hell any of my chars, level 1s included, I'd be pissed) was ganked simpy because he had a name wanted by someone else.<br />
<br />
But maybe this still doesn't work.  I don't know. :)  I don't see how it could be a big deal, unless they're still worried about stopping griefers and people with bad reps from skipping out on being accountable for their actions with a new identity.</div></div><hr />

I did read it, and I know about it.  My point still stands.</div></div><hr />
