<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to ask a silly question, but I didn't see the answer anywhere and I would like to know as I try to plan where to spend my AA.  Does every level of QB cost 3 points, or does the cost increase each level like MC or ND?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3-6-9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">QB1 - 3 pts<br />
QB2 - 6 pts<br />
QB3 - 9 pts, many don't bother with this one since spell haste caps at 50% and you won't get any benefit from spell haste items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought QB2 was a good investment, and it made my soloing power grow a lot just right there.  QB3 would still be a decent investment if you didn't have any nifty focus items for improving spell haste.  And perhaps even if you do.  Still, it's 9 points . . . harsh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the responses :)  Aye, 9 points is rough, I was hoping to never do 9 points again after MGB! :(  That's why i was kinda hoping it wasn't 9 points, but I thought it would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just did 2 back to back 9 point skills (QB3 and then MGB). Quick buff 3 is very worthwhile, especially if you have Quiescence, and no spell haste 4 or similar focus item. I definetely would not refund my 9 points in QB3 given the chance.</div></div><hr />
