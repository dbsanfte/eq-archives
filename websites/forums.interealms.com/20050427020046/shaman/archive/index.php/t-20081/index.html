<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanna find a mob to camp while I read a book. IM a 65 shaman with 100+ AA and decent mid level gear, but nothing elemental or anything. Im a pretty skilled shaman though and getting to a nice camp shouldnt be a issue for me.<br />
<br />
Frankly i want something to do to generate cash to fund my tradeskills and various alt projects and stuff of my own ofcourse. If possible i wont want to be stuck watching the screen every single second, i would like to atleast kick my feet up and read and occasionaly check the spawn, you know like NG camp or something, just alot higher level and with much greater yields for my efforts.<br />
<br />
If you dont wanna share your spot with the world just PM me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow that thread gave me some good ideas and answers thnx.  Ill be trying droga again too, someone sent me a nice PM with some good info on something i think i screwing up on a spawn.<br />
<br />
Thnx again and if you got a few more keep them coming. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm enjoying tactics at the moment. The 2 corners of the room just outside the pens, where no static mob spawns, are 100% safe and so ok to read a book whilst sitting there. <br />

You can then wait for the piglet stampede and nab the piglet when he appears. There are a few things to note about this though:<br />
<br />
1) There's one roamer, respawn is 24 mins and you'd have to keep him down if you want to nab the piglet safely. Yes, you can handle 2 at once but it can get hairy.<br />
<br />
2) Piglet spawn is random, and gives you maybe 30 seconds warning or so, thus you could miss it if stuck in a book. However, the stampede of pigs is very noticeable on your screen, even out the corner of your eye.<br />
<br />
3) You can roam around the pit invis (just avoid the wraiths) and look out for any mini named such as enraged war boar. Chance of ornate patterns, battle drummer's main gauche (sold one for 9k on AB, sold within 24 hours), SP drops and a few other bits and bobs.<br />
<br />
4) If you want more action you can just kill the trash for 5% aa per kill, and hope that spawns some more minis.<br />
<br />
I don't think its ideal for your purpose, but perhaps worth considering. I use it as a spot to get a little xp, some nice loot that sells easily and for potentially large amounts if I can get lucky on an ornate pattern, whilst still being able to go afk indefinitely. There are other threads here with specifics of how to actually go about getting the littly piggy to market.</div></div><hr />
