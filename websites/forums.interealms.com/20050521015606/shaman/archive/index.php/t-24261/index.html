<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have I switched to an alt?  Yes..and no, and not because of anything SOE has done to the class..  I've always been prone to playing alts, hell, I have 2 accounts with only one empty character slot on each on my main server.  I go through cycles..I'll play hardcore on my shaman for a few months, then I'll burn out and do serious alt rotations for a while.  So far this has gotten me a not quite 66 shaman, 58 rogue, 57 beast, 53 paladin, 51 druid, and a ton of sub-50's.<br />
<br />
Until recently I was part of a small non-raiding guild, and was probably one of the best ghetto/bazaar geared shamans on my server.  Now I'm working on getting into the big leagues (elemental guild) and have been back in the saddle on my shaman for a few weeks now, kicking arse and taking nameds.  Will I switch back to playing alts more than my main again at some point?  Definitely.  Will have anything to do with shamans being broken/nerfed/etc?  Nope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's great stuff, but if you were trying to answer voices in your head you didn't need to post..... although if you were trying to respond to another post you would have been better off using &quot;reply&quot; instead of &quot;new thread&quot;.......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Usually a hard core raiding guild won't take too kindly to ppl switching to other toons and not playing their main.  In our guild, when a player receives a nice piece of phat lute, it's considered an investment by the guild as a whole to better the guild, not just the one toon.  If you disappear for a while to play an alt, and the loot has not been utilized for the betterment of the guild during that time, then the investment has been wasted, and you are not likely to receive much in the way of loot any time soon.<br />
<br />
Just one perspective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to agree with Karshak in not understanding why this was a separate post.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Otani - I agree with you that this is the reality, and it makes sense in a 'progress of the guild' kind of way.  It's also one of the big problems with EQ.  If someone stops having fun and a new toon is going to fix that, well, the guild loses the toon but not the player.<br />
<br />
Another way of thinking about it would say that the big investment a guild puts into a player is less significant in terms of loot and more vital in regards to the raid skills and esprit de corps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">reguardless of how unbalanced shamans have become and we are not anywhere as powerful as we used ot be, i dont have anywhere near as much fun playing any other class than a shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with the above poster :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bleh, I posted this while half asleep this morning after working all night.  I *MEANT* to post it in response to the poll about people switching classes.  <br />
<br />
Oh, well, not the first time I've mucked up a post..and probably won't be the last.<br />
<br />
Otani - I can definitely see your point.  Let me answer by clarifying, I'm still going to play my main to raid and help the guild I'm applying too, even during my burn-out on shaman phases.  I just will only play him during raids during those phases.  There's also the fact that I've never been a raiding shaman before, so it could well be that it'll be interesting enough to occupy me indefinitely, it's just hard to say  ;)   Believe me, I consider getting into a good raiding guild a big investment, and it's not one I plan to abandon any time soon.</div></div><hr />
