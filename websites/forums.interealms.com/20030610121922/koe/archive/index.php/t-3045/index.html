<br />
         Dear John:<br />
<br />
         You've got the grades. You've certainly got the PSAT scores. And now you've got a letter<br />
         from MIT. Maybe you're surprised. Most students would be.<br />
<br />
         But you're not most students. And that's exactly why I urge you to consider carefully one of<br />
         the most selective universities in America.<br />
<br />
         The level of potential reflected in your performance is a powerful indicator that you might<br />
         well be an excellent candidate for MIT. It certainly got my attention!<br />
<br />
         Engineering's not for you? No problem. It may surprise you to learn we offer more than 40<br />
         major fields of study, from architecture to brain and cognitive sciences, from economics<br />
         (perhaps the best program in the country) to writing.<br />
<br />
         What? Of course, you don't want to be bored. Who does? Life here is tough and demanding,<br />
         but it's also fun. MIT students are imaginative and creative - inside and outside the<br />
         classroom.<br />
<br />
         You're interested in athletics? Great! MIT has more varsity teams - 39 - than almost any<br />
         other university, and a tremendous intramural program so everybody can participate.<br />
<br />
         You think we're too expensive? Don't be too sure. We've got surprises for you there, too.<br />
<br />
         Why not send the enclosed Information Request to find out more about this unique<br />
         institution? Why not do it right now?<br />
<br />
         Sincerely,<br />
<br />
         Michael C. Benhke Director of Admissions<br />
<br />

         &quot;MIT Application Response&quot;<br />
<br />
         Michael C. Behnke<br />
         MIT Director of Admissions<br />
         Office of Admissions, Room 3-108<br />
         Cambridge MA 02139-4307<br />
<br />
         Dear Michael:<br />
<br />
         You've got the reputation. You've certainly got the pomposity. And now you've got a letter<br />
         from John Mongan. Maybe you're surprised. Most universities would be.<br />
<br />
         But you're not most universities. And that's exactly why I urge you to carefully consider one<br />
         of the most selective students in America, so selective that he will choose only one of the<br />
         thousands of accredited universities in the country.<br />
<br />
         The level of pomposity and lack of tact reflected in your letter is a powerful indicator that<br />
         your august institution might well be a possibility for John Mongan's future education. It<br />
         certainly got my attention!<br />
<br />
         Don't want Bio-Chem students? No problem. It may surprise you to learn that my interests<br />
         cover over 400 fields of study, from semantics to limnology, from object-oriented<br />
         programming (perhaps one of the youngest professions in the country) to classical piano.<br />
<br />
         What? Of course you don't want egotistical jerks. Who does? I am self indulgent and over<br />
         confident, but I'm also amusing. John Mongan is funny and amusing - whether you're<br />
         laughing with him or at him.<br />
<br />
         You're interested in athletes? Great! John Mongan has played more sports - 47 - than almost<br />
         any other student, including oddball favorites such as Orienteering.<br />
<br />
         You think I can pay for your school? Don't be too sure. I've got surprises for you there, too.<br />
<br />
         Why not send a guaranteed admission and full scholarship to increase your chance of being<br />
         selected by John Mongan? Why not do it right now?<br />
<br />
         Sincerely,<br />
<br />
         John Mongan<br />
<br />

         just ask.</div></div><hr />
