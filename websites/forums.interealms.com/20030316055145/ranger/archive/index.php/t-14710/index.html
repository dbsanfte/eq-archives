<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was talking with a friend the other day on this subject and we could not come up with an answer. I was curious if any of you knew.<br />
<br />
The Ancient spells for casters were put in the high end game so they could have something that made them stand out above other casters, like a warrior might get a sword from a dragon kill or something of the like.<br />
<br />
However now that you are able to go all the way to Lvl 65 you get much better spells.<br />
<br />
Basically my question is, are Ancient spells still viable at lvl 65 or do the quested ones from the parchments out do them. <br />
<br />
Granted that Rangers do not get any Ancient spells, I still am curious. Thanks for any insight into the matter.</div></div><hr />
