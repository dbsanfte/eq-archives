<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the introduction of foraging yew leaves in WL, I will be able to begin working on this armor. It is not nearly as expensive to make the velium bonings for this as the velium studs for artic wyvern.<br />
<br />
My skill is at 160. It will still be a long time before I can really make anything, but while practicing my skill I have a choice in black panther. The bracer, mask, and gorget each only take one boning. Are any of these any good for monks? If not then I'll just do whatever. If one of these is any good then I will only make that one just in case I can make one every 40 attempts or so. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">None of those 3 items are really that great for a monk compared to other items much easier to attain.  The bracer is decent and for a low lvl monk it would be a better choice to Permafrost lewtz heh.  Sarnak Hide Mask is easily better than the Pantherskin.  The gorget not great either, Dragon Tooth Choker (MUCH better) is probly easier to get lol, or even a Runed Lava Pendant is at least on par or better than that gorget (SolA Phat Lewtz lol).  <br />
<br />
After looking thro a lot of the high end tailoring recipes I can honestly say I'm very disappointed in most of it.  The items you are able to make are too hard to create, cost to much money and time to make it worth the while.  I can honestly say, at least from a monk or meleer standpoint the AC on these items is not worth what it costs to make.  Many pieces of Black Panther or Haze Panther armor have very nice stats, but lack in AC so much it's rather sad.  If in my monk viewpoint I consider the AC sad, then for plate/chain classes it is just pathetic.  Nice stats on Panther Skin Chest, but it has 2 pt higher AC than a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic...ummm yeah sad.  Many monks consider AC not needed, but those are the retards that die when pulling the uber mobs or get aggroed when fighting, so even for a monk: AC &gt; Stats.  In another monk view, some of it is quite heavy as well.  <br />
<br />
Ok, nuff ranting on the pathetic overall items VI has allowed tradespeople create with this unbelieveably difficult tradeskill. =b</div></div><hr />

There are many pieces of velious armor that are very nice and in demand. I just needed to know if those particular ones were any better than the others. I will only make the ones that require one stud or boning due to expense. If they aren't then I'll just do them randomly.<br />

Evidently these are the pieces that are in demand and the prices they have been going for on one server:<br />

If Verant will ever come out with another step to go between 158 and 200, then we'll see more tailors, competitive pricing, and an alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll second Fanadile's opinion and say that the black panther stuff is not that great for a monk.   The only real selling point I have heard for the black panther stuff for monks is that some like the way it looks.<br />
<br />
A general rule of thumb for non-weapon equipment is (there are of course exceptions) if something is monk only then chances are it isn't that great of an item for monks.  Sad but true.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On the other hand the Ice Burrower silk stuff looks very good !<br />
<br />
<br />
What is involved in making it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Like most of the other stuff, it trivials above 250. You need ice burrower silk made into swatches, platinum thread, pattern, and a vial of purified mana (which takes a poison vial and 4 rubies). So this won't even be attempted until the high 200's. Much like blue diamond jewelry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am a tailor too (163).  I created a ranger and got him to 19 and he is sitting at the zone to SS and WL.  When I am watching TV or Cleaning house I go on as him and press the forage key in order to gather materials.  I heard about the foraging of Yew leaves but after 3 hours I did not manage to get one.  HOWEVER, the drake eggs have become MUCH easier to forage.  I used to average 1 egg an hour - now I average closer to 3 or 4.<br />
<br />
Still a pain in the butt - but easier.  I am going to stick with trying to make cobalt belts.  still have not made one but those look great and the drake eggs are easier to come by.  BTW, wtf is a wurm egg for?<br />
<br />
One last thing - apparently what verant did was make the old world forages much more rare in Vel.  Meaning more rare forages = more drake eggs.<br />
<br />
If I were you I would wait for luclin and the tailoring bridge.  I personaly wish they did not bridge tailoring... but if they are going to I am going to take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />

OMG <br />
Did you see the name of the Monks Guild....Thats it I am quiteing Veeshan so I can move to Solusk Ro and join The Bunnies of Chaos.:D :D :D :D :D <br />

Just kidding but could not stop laughing</div></div><hr />
