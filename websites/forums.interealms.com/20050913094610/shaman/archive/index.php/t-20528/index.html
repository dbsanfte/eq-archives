<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I was, having trouble not only dialing in to my ISP (Earthsuck - DON'T ASK) but staying on the Internet for more than about 2 minutes.  Called said crappy ISP and both numbers were &quot;good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally got ahold of Sprint and they advised me to unplug the phone jack, the computer, anything attached to computer (like my answering machine which I think was the culprit) and let it all sit for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
So with much trepidation and derision (&quot;Unplug everything? C'mon&quot; /snort) I did.<br />
<br />
And lo and behold it worked.  Their diagnosis was &quot;static buildup in the line&quot; and apparently this cleared it up.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always thought that, &quot;static buildup in the line&quot; was a myth. Have you had and storms or lightening in your area?</div></div><hr />

Hey, we have a saying in the Army, &quot;If it's stupid and it works - it isn't stupid.&quot;</div></div><hr />
