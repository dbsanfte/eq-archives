<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meiyo Shiryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">But, your not getting rid of me.:D<br />
 <br />
This note it to inform you of family situations making it difficult (but not impossible) to raid as regularly as I want, and I may have to bail at times.<br />
 <br />
1) Momma Meiyo (the wife) is now in full time nursing school (2nd 2 years) so Daddy Meiyo must be Mr MOM. Ive taken over all the cooking cleaning and child rearing.<br />
 <br />
2) eldest daughter has an illness that requires me to do regular hospital visits.<br />
 <br />
So between the 2, I will raid as much as I can, but may have to leave.<br />
My apologies up front. :rolleyes:<br />
 <br />
