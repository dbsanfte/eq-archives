<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmmm...I wonder how much Verant got from computer manufacturers to make alot of people upgrade computers?<br />
Anyhoo,<br />
I've decided that I'm gonna need to buy a new computer.  What would be the perfect setup?  What video/sound cards, what processor, what type of RAM (SDRAM vs. RDRAM), or any other suggestions for making the perfect gaming (EQ) computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on your budget of course.<br />
<br />
I'm on a tight budge but don't want something I'm going to have to throw away in 18 months time.  I'm upgrading my motherboard and also getting an ahtlon 1.6 gig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is what I want to build over the next few months:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.5 gig Athlon or better<br />
1g PC2100 RAM<br />
40 gig HD, fastest I can find ( whoever at VI decided to cache models on the HD is a dufus)<br />
Geoforce 64 MB vid card, likely the MX400 series<br />
17&quot; monitor ( still squinting at a 15&quot; )<br />
2 auxilary case fans, front and back<br />
<br />
Parts should come up to about $700.  I intend to reuse my seriously battered case ( unless I can find one with a better power supply cheap ), my floppy drive, and my CD-ROM drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Did some price checking this morning, and the MX400 Geoforce is down to $64 US, shipping included at www.pricewatch.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Absolutely depends on your budget restraints.  If money is no object and you don't want to build it yourself, I recommend www.alienware.com.  They build some AMAZING high end systems that'll be solid for a long time.<br />
<br />
If money is an object and you are going to build it yourself, www.computershopper.com is an excellent link as well as www.tomshardware.com -- Tom's is an evaluation and information site.  You can find out basically anything you want from it.<br />
<br />
To give you an example, due to my recent PC demise (which at this point is still an elusive issue), I'm in the midst of building a new machine.  This is the basic configuration I'm looking at:<br />
<br />
an ATX case from www.colorcases.com (not sure which one)<br />
EPOX 8KTA3 VIA motherboard ($125 ish)<br />
Palomino XP 1.7PR AMD Socket A ($175 ish) -- about 1.4 GHz<br />
Thermal Dragon Cooling Fan ($25 ish)<br />
2x SD PC100/133 512 MB RAM sticks ($65 each)<br />
PC GeForce 3  (not the Titanium version) ($275 ish)<br />
floppy drive, mouse and keyboard ($50 total)<br />
2x 20GB Western Digital 7200 RPM HDs ($90 ish each)<br />
3COM 3C905C-TX NIC card ($50)<br />
Soundblaster 5.1 ($50)<br />
CDRW 24/10/40 ($100)<br />
300Watt Power supply ($50)<br />
<br />
Basically, I went with the lesser known EPOX motherboard because a friend uses it and it runs amazingly well.  The weakness of the motherboard is that it only has two RAM slots.  Hence the reason, I went out and bought 2 512MB sticks.  <br />
<br />
I avoided the Titanium version of the Geforce 3 card because of the benchmarks Tom's Hardware has done with it and the original version.  They were unimpressed and, based on the results of those tests, so was I.  It's a personal preference on the chip; but, the case I'm buying from www.colorcases.com will be an overclockers case in the event I decide to &quot;dial-up&quot; the Palomino chip.  Supposedly the Palomino can get to 2GHz.  Always thought a machine running that fast would be fun to play with.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just wanted to give you an example of what I'm building.  It may or may not fit your needs or desires; but, hopefully it'll help a bit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys, much useful info.<br />
One last question--is the Athlon chip much better than the P4?  Or will I be ok with the P4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For my money, the P4 over the Athlon is a waste.  Performance is dang near undistinguishable, and Intel has this nasty habit of demanding you work only with Intel components when using one of their P series chips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Fallanthas.<br />
<br />
I have yet to find a convincing reason to buy a P4 chip.  It simply limits what you can do more than it helps.  Especially since the prices are so low right now for everything and the performance is so similar.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the problem is that you have to buy a P4 board for the intel chip and those are usually $30-40 more than a similar non-intel board.<br />
<br />
-Q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OK, so basically if you build your own system, get Athalon.  If you buy a pre-made system, P4 or Athalon doesn't matter then, if I understand correctly.<br />
Also, Quinnell, (or anyone else who knows)--is this alienware a reliable manufacturer?  Some of those systems are pretty sweet (and expensive:eek: )  But I've never heard of them before and am apprehensive about buying something that costs so much from a company I know little about.</div></div><hr />

One last question--is the Athlon chip much better than the P4?  Or will I be ok with the P4?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Athlon XP outperforms the P4 on almost every test and costs about 1/3 as much.  Athlon also uses DDR SDRAM which is about ½ the price of RDRAM that most P4 systems use.  I currently have an Asus A7M266 motherboard with 256MB (upgrading RAM this weekend thank to VI) with a 1.4GHz Athlon and it rocks.<br />
<br />
If Price is not an issue I would go with this config.<br />
<br />
Case from colorcase.com with 300w Powersupply<br />
Asus A7M266 Motherboard<br />
Athlon XP 1900+ Retail processor<br />
1 gig of PC-2100 DDR SDRAM (2 512 mb Micron lifetime warranty modules) (to be ready for Verant's next upgrade that will start at 512mb Ram LOL)<br />
IBM deskstar 40gb or larger DMA 100 ATA Hard drive<br />
SoundBlaster audigy 5.1 sound card<br />
Klipsch promedia 5.1 speakers from www.klipsch.com (I have the 4.1's and they ROCK!) lots o'cash but worth it, and TXH certified too. <br />
Nv 25 geforce 4 video card.  Coming out in a month or so.  Gona have a lot of VooDoo tech in it from what I hear.<br />
SMC or linksys 10/100 fast Ethernet Network card for connection to DLS or Cable modem<br />
US Robtics /3com V.90 modem if you have dialup.<br />
NEC MultiSync LCD1830 (Black Cabinet) Flat panel monitor.  If you don't like flat panels or don't want to spend the $1200 for one, go with a nice NEC, ViewSonic, Sony or other high quality CRT monitor.<br />
Plextor 12/10/32 CD-RW drive<br />
Toshiba DVD Drive<br />
LS-120 drive (reads LS 120 (120 mb disks) and floppy disks.<br />
<br />
Total cost, around $3,000<br />
<br />
You can find the best prices at www.pricewatch.com.  I have had good luck with www.tufshop.com and www.atacom.com.  They usually have stuff on price watch, but their normal prices are pretty good too.<br />
<br />
www.Alienware.com or www.xdream-machines.com both have sweet systems you can configure.  They use retail parts for most of their stuff and optimize them for gamers so I would go with one of them.  I personally REALLY like the cube case from xdream machines and will be buying a case like that for my main system once I get some extra money. hehe<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fazz - Alienware is pretty good company.  Everyone I know who's bought systems from them has had nothing but good things to say.  In fact, I have one friend who has bought 3 different systems from them and swears he'll never buy from anyone else.<br />
<br />
That said, I personally haven't bought a system from them.  I usually like to build my own so that I have a little more control over it.   I do know they've been around since 1996 and are a major high-profile company regarding video game companies and building machines for their development and production staffs.<br />
<br />
All-in-all I'd have to say that they're a safe bet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well if you want to get a pretty good system for a good price any processor 800mhz + will do good job.  The big thing is the ram and vid card.  For 399 you can get a Duron 800 with 256M of ram, CD, 32M Vid Card(TNT2), Mouse, Keyboard(both PS2), 3D sound Card, Speakers, all in a mid ATX 300W tower.  If you want a monitor 17&quot; run anywhere from 165 to 180.  Ram is so cheap now you could get 798M of ram for less than 100 bucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh I have 2 Alienware Machines...They have never had issue one, period.  If someone other than me is going to build a machine for me to use it will be Alienware.  Their attention to detail and sweating the little stuff make every difference...I highly recommend them.<br />
<br />
The machine I play on most of the time now I put together piece by piece...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tannin Steelblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well here is what i am using and besides from only having a phone line connection.. (looking into DSL)  it works like a dream<br />
<br />
P4 1.8ghz<br />
512 RD Ram<br />
64 meg Nvidea x4 AGP Gforce 3<br />
80 gb HD with 7200rpm  (very important with 7200rpm )<br />
21inch .24dpi flat screen monitor<br />
<br />
I use the 1200 x 768 reso in game play and i am just awestruck by the smoothness of everything looks like a cartoon  no jitters etc in full screen mode and no screen lag what so ever  i payed just under 3k for this system but lots of extras so .. just throwing in my specs.. in total.. perfect EQ system in my book..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fazzar, here's the PC I ordered at Dell.com four hours ago.<br />
<br />
Dimension 8200:<br />
Intel P4 @ 1.7 GHz<br />
512 MB PC800 RDRAM<br />
64MB NVIDIA GeForce2 MX<br />
40GB Ultra ATA/100 Hard Drive (7200 RPM)<br />
<br />
The selling point for me was the 400MHz bus.  I could have dropped the price to just over $1000 by going with the 4200 line and getting the 133MHz bus and a 1.4 GHz processor, but tripling the bus speed was worth it for me.<br />
<br />
Without monitor, came to just over $1300 with free shipping.  There's also a $100 mail-in rebate, which will be a nice kick once those XMas credit card bills start coming due.  Net, with tax, it should come in around $1250.  I was unable to configure anything at Alienware or Gateway that offered comparable features at a comparable price.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good choice, Timbo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a better manufacturer at the moment that Dell.  I've switched to using there machines exclusively for our office.  Servie is very good, and the machines run smoothly and fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grats on the new computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree<br />
<br />
I'm only buying Dell workstations for my office at this point.  They make an incredibly solid line of machines that are relatively cheap.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anyone else in the workstation market who is really competing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When my machine crashed and burned upgrading drivers last week I looked around Dell Gateway etc, and wasnt real impressed.<br />
I thought they would be a bit lower.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when I fry a comp, I tend to want one tommorow and usually buy off the shelf. ( I can't really afford now but charged one)<br />
<br />
So I checked on web for comp usa and circuit city.<br />
<br />
While I don't really like compact I found<br />
<br />
Intel P4 @ 1.7 GHz <br />
512 MB  SDRAM ( 400 bus)<br />
64MB NVIDIA GeForce2 MX <br />
80GB Ultra ATA/100 Hard Drive (7200 RPM) <br />
CD/DVD drice<br />
CD/CDR drive<br />
<br />
1149 and tax.<br />
<br />
I was online 90min after deciding to buy one.<br />
<br />
( then installed zone-alarm firewall, It has serious issues with winXP, and somehow I lost internet all together. Adelphia tech support after 3 hours decided my eithernet card was scrambled and needed reseting but can't be done in winXP and I should talk to comp vender. After calling them all kinds of names for a BS non fix of connection, I figured I would try a recovery from CD( Had to do total.) All I had to lose was EQ install. Damb if that didnt fix it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hope it works out, Knarlz.  I am definitely not a Compac fan.  Not nearly enough customer service, and way too much dinking around with proprietary programs running the OS for my tastes.  They can be beasts to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you know how to put a machine together save yourself some cash and spend an hour or 2 setting one up takes no time at all in terms of construction most time I ever spent assembling a machine was 2 hours and that's because of win98 taking so long to finish installing :).  I look at how much systems are going for and how much it costs to build one and I have to say Dell is the best and cheapest.  Not too much above buying all the parts and putting it together for wholesale.  They charge a little much for ram upgrades.  I should start building/buying a fleet of machines soon if I want to start doing the type of 3D animation I like.  My dream system would be a dual 1.5G with a gig of ram an elsa erazor x2 vid card with 256ddr, a dvd burner and dual 21&quot; monitors.  But that's just me :)</div></div><hr />
