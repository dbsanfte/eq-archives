<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akinwande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if it would be possible to start a forum for Shaman &lt; level 55+ to discuss stratagy, and games changes, as they affect them.<br />
<br />
I am a regular board walker, as I subscribe to MANY different class boards and troll the discussions.  Some of them have such a forum, and it really helps lower level characters to have a place for advice.  My highest level character is my Shammy (35), and it seems that for most classes EQ changes significantly post 55.<br />
<br />
Most of the advice and discussions that I see pertain mainly to the 55+ crowd.  It is sometimes hard to figure out how a lot of the discussions in the General form &quot;translate&quot; to the &lt;55 game, and more than half of the time, they don't translate at all, as they are only issues in the &quot;end game&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion.  Take it with the grain of salt it's offered with.  Not looking to cause anyone any more work, but most of the times adding a forum to discussion boards is only a few minutes worth of work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">quite the equipment you have for a highest level character of 35...... did you spend the last 4 years farming spidersilks or something? I am intrigued how much you can farm to buy all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A newbie type forum might not be a bad thing, but a very large majority of everquest HAS played at least one class beyond that point.  Even the genuinely new people out there have often joined because of friends and such.<br />
After 4 years of everquest, pretty much every lowbie question has been answered, many times.  Its really hard for the older gurus (I'm NOT one) to keep answering the same question over and over.<br />
But, yes, the game changes considerably after 50-55, and the shaman class changes enormously after 60.  This is what much of the discussion is about, simply because gain so little in comparison after 60.  With most peoples' shaman 60+, naturally this is what is discussed most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't see the need myself.  Honestly, a good majority of the under 55 questions are where to hunt, and there is the hunting ground forum for that.  Most of the other questions i can see being asked also have a forum (equipment/spells/quests).  There is also the medicine cabinet which has more general information that covers all levels of play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was just wondering if it would be possible to start a forum for Shaman &lt; level 55+ to discuss stratagy, and games changes, as they affect them.<br />
<br />
Its not a bad idea, but I don't think it would get used much.<br />
<br />
Most true newbies (e.g. main under 55) don't read messageboards anyway, or really even know of their existence, in my experience.  I have told many 60+ shamans about the crucible and have often found that they had never heard of it or the serverwide channel.<br />
<br />
Also, to get better, you really need to be reading about stuff before you get to it.  In the 50s, I was regularly reviewing posts from the 60-65 hunting grounds, for instance.  Right now, I am reading up on VT, even though I am not keyed yet.<br />
<br />
Finally, to be useful, higher level players would have to read and respond to posts from lower level players, and I doubt that many would.  When all the posts are mixed together, you at least have a chance that everyone will read it, but I think a lot of older players would just ignore a lowbie section.  When was the last time you scoured the 'hunting grounds, level 1-20' forum to offer advice?<br />
<br />
Its good to have (and post about) these ideas, I just don't think this one would work out.  As Linus Pauling said: &quot;the secret to having good ideas is to have lots of ideas and throw out the bad ones.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The great thing about the crucible has always been the incredible range of people and the way all subjects got answered, for whatever level.  <br />
Three years ago when I started people were discussing Sleepers Tomb, and still giving hints how to maximize experience in LOIO.<br />
And this helpfull attitude has prevailed ever since.  And looking at the lack of traffic in the other forums it will probably not much of a success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a levelling guide divided by levels, this is of use to you,  as I believe the traffic to create another forum for pre 55 players is both unjustifed and too little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Akinwande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">quite the equipment you have for a highest level character of 35...... did you spend the last 4 years farming spidersilks or something? I am intrigued how much you can farm to buy all that.  <br />
<br />
I will admit to being a fair twink.  Luckily, I had a few RL friends who got me off to a pretty strong start with equipment.  After that, I spent quite a LONG time farming Aqua Gobs in ButcherBlock before their drops were nerfed.  Along with farming just about every newbie item worth anything.  Since I have a hard time deciding which class I want to stick with as my main, I have leveled just about every race/class combination to around 25-30 at least twice.  It's amazing how many spider silks, bear hides, and bone chips you can collect when your so indecisive  :confused: .<br />
<br />
I guess the benefit to this is...I am somewhat of an expert on leveling 1-25.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm sure my pre level 55 experience is going to be much different from a lot of other players, due to my equip.  My main point about a non end-game forum is more to discuss how the changes that are occuring affects the pre level 55 group.  All of the discussions that I see are from the 55+ standpoint.<br />
<br />
Now I know quite a few, if not the majority, of the changes are geared more towards the 50+ world, but quite a few of them do affect the lower level players too.  As with every expansion, there are lower level spells added as well as higher.  Also, things like the 5% Warrior mitigation bonus, definatly affected the low end game too.  I notice a difference in my SK tanking now as compared to my Warrior, and they are both wearing almost the exact same equip (thanks to the shared bank slots  :p ).<br />
<br />
Everyone is probably right about the traffic through the forum being somewhat low, but even low traffic is more helpful than no forum what-so-ever.  If one doesn't happen, I'll just have to keep reading the general forums and &quot;translating&quot; what I read as best I can  ;) .</div></div><hr />

Sure, you could figure it out on your own, but you're gonna scare the **** out your passengers and everyone else on the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that newbie answers have always been pretty well received on the general forum, provided that the question can't be answered easily by visiting the Medicine Cabinet or doing a search. If it's a fairly complex or situational question, it will get answered. By keeping most questions being posted in General, they are more likely to get more answers and more quality answers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Akinwande,<br />
<br />
As shamuofxev pointed out there are a lot of friendly people at the crucible who will answer questions related to your levels. I think that an extra forum wouldn't be that popular, and the people who have been through 55+ who are most likely the people who the questions will be aimed at will not read that forum.<br />
<br />
I would post any questions into the main general forum, sure you may get a few trolls responding with stupid comments, but you are much more likely to get the information that you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just as a point regarding the &quot;reputation system&quot; I received the following negative rep post:<br />
<br />
&quot;Like he has to explain himself to you Officer Korshak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Given the amount of argumentative posts flying around here, I found this amusing on two levels. Firstly the poster in question didn't take offense to the question (which I am glad about because it wasn't meant offensively), and secondly, unless I am missing the joke in Korshak is it really that difficult to spell a name correctly?<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually use the reputation system for it's real reason?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Having also received a less than stellar comment at one time should the reputation remarks be anonymous?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barelini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Finally, to be useful, higher level players would have to read and respond to posts from lower level players,  <br />
<br />
While, in general, this is probably true, for the specific purposes of the request in this topic having higher level (end-game oriented) players answer the questions almost defeats the purpose.<br />
<br />
In browsing many boards over the years, it is amazing how many times a level 65 player will answer a question about level 35ish play and be totally off-base.  This is due to 1) they haven't played in that level for a long time and have no clue how any changes have affected gameplay; 2) even if they have an alt it is usually being PL'd or twinked to the point that their advice is close to worthless to an untwinked character;  3) they assume that &quot;the majority of players are 65&quot; and the player asking the question is therefore an idiot for not having a high level character and knowing the answer.<br />
<br />
That last one really bugs me personally.  I've played EQ since August 1999 and my highest level character is a level 55 warrior.  I have several characters in the 50s but none playing in the end-game.  I also have a slew of characters in the 30-40s, including my shaman (lvl 42).  I know a LOT about the game from lvl 1-55 and almost nothing of the end-game.  If you are in an end-game type guild, it is natural to assume that &quot;the majority&quot; are also there, since all your friends and guildmates are there too.  It's possible that it is a truism but I honestly do not believe so nor have I seen any statistics to validate this statement.  My belief is that &quot;most&quot; players do not play in the end-game and do not read message boards.  Again, no statistics to prove it, just a feeling based on my own personal experience in my guild and the alliance it belongs to.<br />
<br />
I do agree that an additional forum probably wouldn't get used too much and that most questions are answered in the existing forums, more than adequately.  Sometimes a lowbie just has to wade through a lot of useless drivel from high-level players to get to the answers that are actually useful at their level though.<br />
<br />
All of that said, there are some truly knowledgeable players at the highest level who give really good advice and actually target the information to the question asked.  These folks are priceless to a class board and are generally recognized and appreciated, especially by the folks asking the questions.</div></div><hr />

So true. I remember repeatedly dying at level 4~ trying to loot my corpse in the middle of a bunch of orcs before some kind bard took pity on me and told me about /corpse and hotkeys. Heck, I don't think I had Lay Hands on a hotkey until level 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I think most of the questions such a forum would pose would either fall into the hunting grounds section or be covered in the medicine cabinet.</div></div><hr />
