<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a young Dwarven Priest ('Dauk,' last name woulda been Holliday or a variant), and I am wondering what I should be focusing on vis-a-vis secondary stat.<br />
<br />
Now I'll tell ya, I'm of the mind it's Stamina. As somebody wiser n me posted here, 1000 hit points or FT 25...not a hard decision.<br />
<br />
FWIW he's Shadow Specced and I am focusing on &quot;Eagle&quot; gear (INT + STA) whenever I can.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spirit is pretty much useless Faern, the regen it gives is small compared to what more hps will give you. Not to mention you do not use that regen power in combat.<br />

<br />
MillYa know, this is the second time I've seen you mention this, and I also read it somewhere on the official forums back in beta, but I don't think it's 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
It may be different for me as a Hunter since my normal &quot;autoshots&quot; don't require mana, but while I'm &quot;in combat&quot;, plinking from a distance, my mana most definitely regens, and at a much higher rate when I have high +SPI gear on. I've watched my mana tick up at a considerable rate while plinking away, even after using ranged attacks that use mana.<br />
<br />
Bug, or is the current belief that mana doesn't regen during combat incorrect?<br />
<br />
And FWIW, I've recently started switching over to more gear &quot;...of the Monkey&quot; that has both +AGI and +STA thus reducing my SPI considerably over what it use to be. I definitely notice the difference (negatively) in that I can sometimes run out of mana (low INT as well, in favor of high AGI) where I use to regen it fast enough to not worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what I remember reading mana will regen apart from when casting or for a few seconds after casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mana has an intresting regeneration plan.<br />
<br />
You will start mana regen 5 seconds after casting your last spell.<br />
<br />
Spirit is nice to have some of. But to go for it alone is a very very bad idea. <br />
<br />
Much gear you get as a caster will have incidental spirit attached to it. so that you should be fine. Get the hit points. Because when the adds hit the fan and the warrior is muttering hold on one second taunt is almost up and you are casting constantly Spirit will be the last thing on your mind as your hit points are at 15 and the power word sheild is getting wailed upon. <br />
<br />
The only really important thing spirit does when an item has alot of it. is lower its value in the Auction house..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play a 54 priest and am going with Int/Spirit rather than Stam.  I say this from my viewpoint/perspective and observations.<br />
<br />
I think the pros of +spirit outweigh the cons for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  Spirit Tap.  I labored for a long time under the misconception that there was a soft cap on spirit at 300.  This was true in beta, where the spirit/mana regen ratio was calculated at spirit/3.  It was soft capped to stem off hyper mana regen.   However, it is now 13+spirit/4, and there is no cap.  With Spirit Tap at 5/5, there is a 100% chance that I'll gain 100% bonus to spirit after a kill (including pvp kills within level limits).  My spirit is at about 280 right now.  If I'm spirit-tapping, I push 560.  The mana regen while soloing is significant and noticeable.<br />
<br />
2.  Grouping.  I'm not taking as many hits as I used to.  Plus, with Inner Fire going, even if I'm soloing, they aren't hitting as hard.  Fire off a Renew (Imp. Renew 5/5, Spiritual Healing 5/5) along with Inner Fire and my hps just aren't going down at a rate that I'm concerned.  If they do, I just heal.  (Imp. Flash Heal 2/2, Inner Focus for those oom times).<br />
<br />
If you're a smart priest, you'll fire off your instant spells in groups, so that you can overcome the 5 second mana regen rule.  Don't space out the renews.  This lets your high spirit kick in.<br />
<br />
If the mobs are all on me, an extra 200 hp (one hit, maybe?) isn't going to save me, but that extra mana may keep a melee up that could save me.  For me, my mana is more important than my hps.  If I can refill my water gun quicker, having a huge watergun isn't as helpful.  (Int at 240, Spirit 280 atm).<br />
<br />
3.  You already have stamina!  You get Imp. PWF at 2/2 at you're getting a big stam buff already.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line for me: the amount of mana regen is too hard to ignore for what I perceive to be marginal benefits of stamina.  If I'm getting beat on, I'll be saved through Fade, Shield, or a Flash Heal.  Not the sheer numbers of my hps.<br />
<br />
1 vote for spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Int/sta is what my priest had too.  I dont know what the purpose of spirit is when drink is so easy and quick to use when you need to regen mana.  The only benefit I could see is in long drawn out battles, but if you are casting, your spirit regen doesn't kick in right away anyhow so...<br />
<br />
Upper end of the game you'll be using moon cloth armor or better and the whole debate becomes pointless anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the quick replies. I think I'm gonna &quot;dance with what brung ye,&quot; and go with INT + STA for the moment.<br />
<br />
Valgoth - higher AGI means you are critting a LOT more. (Found this out on my Paladin when his AGI &gt; 100).  The only problem you have is it becomes harder for your pet to keep aggro if his level difference is significant from the MOB you are shooting at.<br />
<br />
My Hunter is only 48 and he crits a LOT. (175 AGI or so). Monkey gear &gt; * for a Hunter. No doubt in my mind on that one. You don't melee enough to warrant sacrificing AGI or STA for STR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Valgoth - higher AGI means you are critting a LOT more. This I know, this I live by. I'm an AGI whore. Sitting at 248 at the moment with 5 points in both Lethal and Mortal. I'm a crit'ing machine! :)<br />
<br />
My order of priority is AGI &gt; (STA/SPI tossup) &gt; INT.<br />
<br />
I'm a ranged fighter, no doubt about it. My pet will lose agro occasionally, but nothing that a Disengage normally doesn't take care of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My hunter is Agi&gt;Sta&gt;Armor&gt;Int&gt;Spi  Spirit just doesn't do much for me.  Only mana regens during combat and the 5 second rule is not kind to hunters.  That and 50 spirit is what 5 extra mana a tick?  I prefer to have a lil extra in the mana pool for emergency pet heals etc.  Spirit was nice up to level 45-50 when the regen rate became too small for the size of the hp and mana pools.<br />
<br />
Priests on the other hand, probably would get more benefit from spirit.<br />
<br />
If there were no such thing as food and drink in WoW, spirit would be the best stat, but there are too many other better options for downtime reduction to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1000 hit points or FT 25...not a hard decision<br />
Exactly.  So why are you going with sta over spirit?  When you have enough HP to survive, mana regen is far better.<br />
<br />
I dont know what the purpose of spirit is when drink is so easy and quick to use when you need to regen mana<br />
How well does that drink work in combat?  It doesn't.<br />
<br />
*Health* regen doesn't work well in combat because of spirit.  Mana regen most certainly does work in combat.  It just won't work until you have gone without casting for 5 seconds or so.  To deal with this, don't space out your spells if you can help it.  Drop a few spells (like shield, regen) and stop casting spells so your mana regen starts kicking in.  When I play my shaman, I rely on this fact.  I pull a mob, drop 3-4 totems, and melee the mob until it's dead, making sure not to cast any more spells than necessary.  I drop down to about 50% health, but end the fight FM usually.  1 heal and I'm ready to go into my next fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, this is seconda-hand info, but my girlfriend plays a priest, and she's putting far more focus on spirit than sta.  Sta is definately not something to neglect, but, for the reasons posted by Serepi, mana regen is more important. <br />
<br />
Her priest build is very much more int/spi than int/sta. Whenver she goes 'shopping', sta ranks third on her list of stats to look for. Mana begins to regen 5 seconds after a spell is cast, even in battle. With 5/5 spirit tap, if she gets a kill shot on a mob, her mana regen is just phenomenal, and in a bad situation it can suddenly makes things a heck of a lot brighter. Int is her primary focus, as it's hard ot beat a huge mana pool as a priest, with spirit a secondary. As at lvl 51, her priest is around 230int/230spi, and she gets a *lot* of people amazed at how much mana she still has after crazy fighting. Her sta is around 160-170 I think. (these are all unbuffed figures, of course) so she can still survive a bit of a beating in those 'bad cases'.<br />
<br />
So just adding my vote to try a more spirit-based build than it sounds like you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Everyone puts down spirit on the WoW boards but it helps a lot in soloing in reducing the downtime between fights and the need for food/drink consumption. Stamina is good too but so is spirit, all the stats are very useful I find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My priest has around 190 spirit and the mana regen is noticable.

<br />
This was the exact point I used as an example to another one of our guild Hunters when explaining why AGI should be the primary stat focus for us. AGI + AC = higher mitigation and lesser need for ultra high STA/HP. Not saying STA is completely useless, but it's just not a primary attribute for non melee classes. And any Hunter that tries to be a melee should have  his bow/gun turned on himself. :) The Survival talent pool is a joke. Having to engage in melee occasionally to give the pet some relief or due to gaining agro from high damage is one thing, but to actively play a Hunter who focuses on melee as primary means of combat? Good luck with that, lemme know how it goes for ya. Just don't get upset with all of the CR's and repair costs you'll endure vs. what a ranged Hunter contends with. :)<br />
<br />
...spirit doesn't help you when you are a spirit.Pun intended? :)<br />

<br />
I've only played a priest to 15 and have not played a druid so I won't debate whether spirit is more important than stamina for those two classes.  However, I do play a warlock and my girlfriend plays a mage.  Warlocks do have the ability to cannibalize with the spell life tap and we never go more than 5 seconds without casting during combat.  Mages do not have the ability to turn hitpoints into mana but again they generally do not stop casting in combat.  Not to say that spirit is useless for mages but it certainly isn't more useful than stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thank you Serepi - for very well presented and persuasive points.  I think you've changed the direction of my priest's build (assuming I ever get around to playing her again).<br />
<br />
It struck me, while reading this thread, that one of wow's great strengths is the flexibility in builds.  So far, at least, I'm seeing a lot of convincing reasons to go in different directions based on situation and talent choices.<br />
<br />
If our tank were a more experienced mmorpg player, or if we had a bigger group, this thread just might have seen me switch to spirit secondary with my shaman - as it is, I spend far too much time tanking for that.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, I vaguely remember something about hunter shooting-spells not counting as spells toward halting mana regen - but I'll be damned if I can remember anything specific (could've been a bug).<br />
<br />
To make a short comment long, I think the spirit/stamina debate boils down to how much you get hit and/or your usual group makeup.  When it hits the fan, I'm saved by a lotta hp and a deep mana pool.  I'm casting too much in those situations to get any real spirit benefit.<br />
<br />
Oh, and when I DO run out of mana?  I tell my group to drink a heal while I catch some z's with a dreamless sleep potion.  Yep, you CAN drink up to full (well, okay, half anymore) in the middle of combat.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hunter special shots are definitely subject to the 5 second rule.  Not that it matters much, as an OOM hunter doesn't really lose all that much dps.  Not being able to trap, disengage or pet heal are about the only really painful things about being OOM.  <br />
<br />
Even at low spirit, soloing 2 mobs or so without using mana shots will get you back up close to full.<br />
<br />
Btw ding 60 :P</div></div><hr />

Oh and dueling? LMAO. Had a 23 Mage challenge me. Ok, first duel. She insta-sheeps me then blasts me. Eventually I get near her, fear her and start dropping my Shadow DOT.  She nukes a couple of times, I keep throwing up my absorbing shield.<br />
<br />
Eventually she is dead with no mana and I have 75% health and 40% mana.  This was without the mana drain spell Priests get. (24th level).<br />

On a PvP server, these are very wise words.   :cool: <br />
<br />
On a PvE server, reconsider the spirit.  My level 50 shaman has 198 spirit.  That means I can go from 0 mana to casting a lesser healing wave (+500 health) every seven seconds (5 of that is the no regen penalty) and repeat as long as the fight lasts.  It also means I sit and drink about half the time most of the other casters do since I can regen on the run between fights.  My three primary attributes are AC, STA and SPI in that order (notice INT is not there - I buff if I need more), but the SPI should be even more valuable to a &quot;second row&quot; priest.  ;) <br />
<br />
Something to think about.</div></div><hr />

Priests have pretty much nailed Spirit regen at 13 + SPI/4, which would put 200 Spirit at about 63 mana a tick (a tick is 2 seconds).  <br />
<br />
Maybe shamans regen mana at different rates (wouldn't surprise me in this game).</div></div><hr />
