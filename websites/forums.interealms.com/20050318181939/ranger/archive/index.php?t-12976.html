The BFT has +wis, more hp, and more resists.<br />
What do you all think?<br />

Both increase DPS.  The proc is great too - even though it doesn't last long, it stacks with every Ranger buff that I've tried so far.  Great +MR gear as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cymrich</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">me like the bft alot more..<br />
<br />
more hp, more resists. resists are getting more and more important, having a specific set of resist gear might not be as useful as having main gear with good resists against everything. me think so, anyway :)<br />
<br />
also, the debuff is a BIG taunt. a few procs and you could easily pull aggro off the tank, and maybe wipe out a raid (pulling big mean things with bad aoe onto casters = problems).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemminkainen</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the proc is no taunt at all.<br />
<br />
At least according to all my shadowknight friends.</div></div><hr />

I did not get aggro from the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cymrich</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">last night my enc friend and me were keeling stuff near the zone in to pon. me was rooting them, and she would tash/slow/cripple them. was playing with the nightmare bow (had just made my 1st one!) to see if me liked it, so was shooting arrows at wotever it is that was rooted (was mostly doing trees and spiders).<br />
<br />
if it proced, the target would always come to me (before cinder jolt), even after her debuffs. if no proc, it would go after her (she wasn't using mind wipe so we could do a weird reverse kiting thing we do sometimes). <br />
<br />
it seems kind of like a big taunt to me, but thats my only experience with shadow vortex ;) haven't had the chance to use it on a raid yet. it might be okee, but it's something to keep in mind. <br />
<br />
so far, the nightmare bow just feels like a sk bow more than a ranger bow. my advice, use both :) if you don't need resists, wis, or hp from the bft, and are trying to make your dps from trueshot perfect, use the nightmare. but if you can use a bft, me would simply because the stats fit rangers better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shhhhhh!  Don't let the SKs hear anyone say that before all us Karana rangers have our bows!<br />
<br />
Then they can bug the guild fletchers for the extras :D</div></div><hr />

Better dex, nice proc, better ratio.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zolina</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep both.  BFT has longer range, better resists, and more hp, a good pulling and raiding bow.  Nightmare has better DPS, MR, Dex, and a nice proc, good for soloing and Trueshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alinor</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a BFT at the moment, and working on getting the components for the Nightmarewood. I expect I'll use it situationally, as Zolina said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splunge</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah, i agreee, both bows are usable in their own situations. Ill use BFT in places like HoT where i need the FR/CR/HP and Nighty where its just pure melee and i can get away with maximum dps and less hp/resists (like PoI/PoN etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greym</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Must be a nice problem to have, which bow to use BFT or NM heh.<br />
I have been saving up for the blue diamonds for the bft for a while now. But i am more likley to get the nightmare first. Several reasons for that, as a HE ranger i cannnot make the BFT myself. I can make the NM. Two, the cost of componets is wayyy cheaper and a lot more likley to be found on venders. Three its a heak of a lot easier to find a high level tinker than a wood elf with both high smithing and high fletching that does not want your first born for a combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varrak</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night made a batch of each (heheh, my guild and allie guild are fully equippped with Nightmares):<br />
<br />
Both require farming parts, BFT parts other than BDs are easier to get (for upper level).<br />
<br />
Both require another skll: BFTs enchant Mithril, NM tinker cams<br />
<br />
Buying most parts: NM silks 500pp, BD 1k hehehe about the same on CT...<br />
Which is better?<br />
<br />
Twisted Longbow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanashi</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seeing how BFT is hard as hell and expensive as hell to make and Nightmare bow isn't, It's a solid choice for any ranger that can get one. I for one was glad to make mine and right now I'm not even worrying about going after BFT.<br />
<br />
Not to mention there is nothing remotely as cool looking as Nightmare bow :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally seeing as I only use a bow to pull/trueshot at the moment, and meele in most exp groups Im going to go with the nightmare.<br />
<br />
Better damage, better dex, has Ac, and has an ac sieve proc.<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talvaryen</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to Vlad and Mianu, I have both Bows and have used them both for the last few days. Overall, I think that BFT is a bit better, but then again the Nightmarewood Bow is only 27/36 to me now at 55. I'll hang on to it until at least 61st if only to use it at its full potential...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giladen</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks redfoot !!! Info much appreciated, looking to take a group there this week. My tinker was able to make 8 cams last night... now just need the silks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raltar</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd use the BFT over the NM bow because the BFT is Tunare only.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snakeater</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have both and typicly use the Nightmare over the BFT for the increase in Dex and DPS I will hovever keep the BFT in reserve for long range sniping when having to deal with AoE encounters.</div></div><hr />
