<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My crew just beat the Stockades last night, we're about average L26.  I'm trying to plan out our weekly progression but not sure where to go next.  I've never been to Razorfen Kraul or Gnomeregan so don't know if those would be next or not.  Is there a comprehensive list anywhere that lists all the instanced dungeons and suggested level ranges?  We outleveled Wailing Caverns and Shadowfang Keep without even realizing it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure about the list...<br />
<br />
Our crew did Ragefire, Pyrewood (not an instance, but all elite mobs), Wailing Caverns, Shadowfang (seems about the same as WC), and then Razorfen Kraul was the next one we did.  So the progression seems about right to me.<br />
<br />
Razorfen is at the south edge of the Barrens, near the Great Lift to Thousand Needles.  Was very very fun.  Mobs range from upper 20's to mid-30's.  Be sure to stop in Ratchet and pick up the Blue Tubers quest.  One of the more unique quests I've seen in a MMORPG to date.<br />
<br />
It does suck not knowing if you should be hitting an instance.  Doing them when green or grey is just no fun :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The &quot;official&quot; list is at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/worlddungeons.html , but I wouldn't hesitate to do WC at 26. I understand that it is barely duo-able at 27 by a Hunter/Druid team, so a party of level ~26s wouldn't find it much of a challenge, but still a worthwhile experience.</div></div><hr />
