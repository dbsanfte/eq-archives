<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I don't understand the free weight reduction bag thing.<br />
<br />
Do they reward you if you purchase the &quot;boxed&quot; version of the expansion or do they reward you for downloading it?<br />
<br />
I don't understand why they wouldn't reward those who save them money and time by ordering through the patcher rather than a box.<br />
<br />
Unless I just read it wrong.  Comprehension has lost a level (3)<br />
<br />
It seems azzbackwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it is SOE, they also rewarded people the pre-ordered by removing 15 levels and stripping AAs too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They said that this expansion is going to be much larger than Ykesha.  So maybe they are trying to not congest the patcher so much or trying to save money on bandwidth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im not sure that buying online actually saves SOE money.  <br />
<br />
Production/design costs Im not going to think about.  SOE makes that money when they take the 13+ bucks from you every month. <br />
<br />
How much do the CD's cost that they write the expansion to?  Pennies each.<br />
<br />
Shipping costs?  Im sure its pretty low.  In my job I ship hundreds of packages a day via UPS. FedEx, and LTL (land transfer lines aka 18 wheelers).  On the average day I ship somewhere around 13 to 15 thousand pounds of product.  My average daily shipping bill for the combined weight is about four thousand dollars.  The cost to the consumer of the product I ship is about 25 thousand dollars.<br />
<br />
So thats an average of about 20 to 21 thousand dollars profit (before overhead is taken out of course) in an 8 hour period.<br />
<br />
I personally think that SOE makes MORE money shipping product to stores than it does through an electronic download.  Also, only those that currently play EQ will see and have access to the DL.  What about all those blue haired grannies out there that know that thier grandkids play some ever something game and picks one up off the shelf for the lucky bugger?  Or the dads that are searching wildly for something for Juniors birthday party that starts in about 20 minutes?  He knows the name of the game because he sees it on his credit statement every month.  All he needs to see is the NEW sticker and SOE just made aobut 20 bucks.<br />
<br />
Personally Im gonna buy the CD for one account and DL the other.  The one problem that I had with LOY was that I never got a 'hardcopy' of the software.  The bag is nice, but it's certainly not what is encouraging me to buy the boxed set.  My own paranoia about losing my HD does that already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But Sony doesn't necessarily make all the money on the shipping.  They pay someone else to print the cd's.  They pay someone else to make the boxes.  They pay someone else to combine the 2 together, and seal them.  They pay someone else to ship it all.  Then there's the markup best buy, wal-mart, etc all put on it.<br />
<br />
Each of those costs money, and they probably send a lot of out to be done outside their business (which adds more overhead I'd assume).  Obviously none of us know the overall costs / process, but they do not get the full $22.99 from a boxed copy, while they do for a downloaded copy (minus bandwidth/storage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Obviously they make more money doing one over the other, or they would only go with one of the options.. <br />
<br />
My GUESS is that stores want to carry SOE products like eq expansions because they know 400,000 people or whatever the number is will come and buy em.. what store wants to carry loy? when most people preordered and downloaded it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The bag is stupid, 25%?<br />
<br />
Gimps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, lemme delete one of my 8 tink bags and replace it with a 25% 8 slot &quot;bonus.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I took it to mean that in the boxed version you would get the bag as a real world collectable type of item. <br />
<br />
Not an in-game item. Tho i could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You mean a real world weight reduction bag? COOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The bag is in-game 8-slot 25% weight reduction, large item only bag.  They hint that there is a quest in the game to turn it into a 10-slot 50% giant item wieght reduction bag.  <br />
<br />
Still kinda lame if you ask me.  A bit insulting to me, but whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You mean a real world weight reduction bag? COOL!<br />

Yeah, I'm gonna throw my wife in there!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The weight reduction bag would be ideal at Ralphs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey, there's room for the wife AND girlfriend.  After all - 8 slots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok.. what is the full scoop on this, you get a 8 slot 25 weight reduction bag if you pre order LD?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I want to know the price difference between the retail and download versions - they seem to be hiding that info. I will not pay extra real world money just to get an in-game bag. The final quested bag would be worth maybe 500 pp if droppable -- less than a Rallic Pack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">OMG...well, you guys finally did it!<br />
I had to register just to reply to this thread.<br />
Boss wants me to explain to him why there are tears<br />
in my eyes and he can hear me laughing/crying even with door shut!<br />
Bastages:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The &quot;problem&quot; with the download option is that for all expansions I've bought I could get them on sale for much less then the official retail price.  So if you're a downloader you most likey pay extra for not having a CD.  And since this expansion is not one of the &quot;must have&quot; ones (aka no new levels, no new bazaar/port system feature) waiting a day or two until it's available at your local store for $19.95 or less isn't going to be too hard.</div></div><hr />
