<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have you cancelled your EQ account to play WoW or EQ2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just wondering what everyone else has been doing with eq 1 since wow came out. Personally, after a few days in beta my whole family had no inclination to log into eq at all (part of this was also most of my guild leaving for EQ2 and all activites ceasing for the most part). In all we closed 8 accounts between 4 people. <br />
<br />
The more I play WoW the less I see myself going back to eq at all, even though I'm the first to admit this could change in a few months as well. I have tried other new mmrpg's though and just never had the feeling they were better then eq at all and none of them lasted past the free month. WoW just feels different in a really fun way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've selected &quot;Yes, multiple accounts&quot; but I've not done it yet as I'm still waiting for the WoW beta final beta to start ove here in Europe.<br />
<br />
I played the US open beta and really enjoyed it. I only play EQ at the moment to pass the time with my friends waiting for wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5 EQ accounts cancelled (again). Though this time I don't foresee ever going back for any reason. WoW fills the &quot;fantasy D&amp;D&quot; type void that EQ left. I'll go back to CoH before EQ, but I don't see that happening for a long, long time (if ever).<br />
<br />
WoW &gt; all! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I selected multiple accounts.<br />
<br />
I cancelled my bard's account after getting into WoW open beta.  I have not cancelled my Shaman's account reason for the sole reason that I plan to give away my excess plat before closing the account.<br />
<br />
I have played other MMORPGs in the past, but have eventually returned to EQ after a few days, weeks, or a month at most.  This time feels different.  I don't think I will be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eq clean 1 year 6 months and 2 days .... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just cancelled both my EQ accounts - should have done it earlier since I havent played since I got into WoW beta. But now one of my very good friends I made in EQ bought WoW and prepaid for 6 months of playtime on the US WoW so no reason to keep paying SOE for doing absolutely nothing for me.<br />
<br />
If any of you have a good idea how I get money transferred safely from Europe to US then please let me know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My saga is a mess. I currently have 9 EQ accounts (3 canceled) in the house and 2 WoW accounts (6 months ea). I normally 6box myself (why the 6 left) but other than the fact that I have so much invested in EQ I struggle to figure out why I should keep playing (and paying).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interesting that botters make up allmost half the respondents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I cancelled both mine, despite not having access to WoW yet, but as I tried the US open Beta I saw myself rapidly losing interest in EQ, and thus I cancelled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know I thought that was too. I almost had to play multiple characters in EQ to have fun and feel like I was doing something all the time. In WoW, there is so little down time and the fights more interactive that I actually don't like to bot my wifes character and prefer playing only one at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Botters leaving makes sense. People bot so they can solo more effectively and in WoW everyone can solo, so it's a dream for that sort of player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Interesting that botters make up allmost half the respondents.<br />
<br />
Don't assume that &quot;multiple accounts&quot; means solely botters.  I checked &quot;multiple accounts&quot; because I canceled both mine and my wife's account - she has moved over to WoW as well.</div></div><hr />

A-FVCKING-MEN !<br />
<br />
i don't have to give myself arthritis or capeltunnel just to have fun, this game has revolutionized the way i see mmo's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I created my bard when I was lvl 65 with 300+ AAs and had been farming PoTime for quite a few months already.  What else is there to do when you've reached the end game?  I initially started my bard alt in the same account as my shaman and eventually bought another account and had him moved so I didn't have to pick which character to play.  I could play both!<br />
<br />
Right now, I am having to much fun in WoW to even consider starting another character.  I have my one main shaman and no plans to start another.  I may start another after reaching end game and getting bored, but that time has not come yet.<br />
<br />
I didn't find it surprising that half of the EQ Shaman players had multiple accounts.</div></div><hr />

You can use either paypal or western Union. Both work well, but will have a small cost overhead.<br />
<br />
Paypal is probably the easiest but with WU your friend can get cash from his local WU office.</div></div><hr />

Your wife plays? You dog! /jealous<br />
<br />
And most of my crew botted in EQ- only way to advance w/o raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My 2 accounts are payed for until April, but I can't play 80% of the zones due to the fact that I only have my laptop on the road, and it's 2 years old. It plays WoW OK. Not great, but it gets the job done as opposed to getting stuck in PoT for 2 minutes just trying to turn.<br />
<br />
If I could play either game, I would be playing primarily WoW, in part because it's new and, so far, a lot of fun, and in part because most of my EQ friends have left for EQ2 or WoW. I still have a few things left undone in EQ that I am sure I will get to at some point, though. Will probably do them on the rare weekends when I am at home.</div></div><hr />

Yah, we have a tauren druid/shaman combo, but she likes playing this little gnome mage with pink pigtails - you know, the ones that every female gnome model has...<br />
<br />
Playing an undead priest on PvP now.  :)  She's taking a little break from both games.  But she doesn't mind that I play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're both WoW addicts now, wondering why we played EQ so long *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tombfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I cancelled my 5 accounts about 2 months ago when I started playing CoH. 5 boxing was fun and all, but it got old after awhile. Now, WoW is putting a dent into my CoH time. =P</div></div><hr />

Ditto, once again Tugela assumes to know the story behind everyone's opinion and actions.  Nice.<br />
<br />
I cancelled my wife's and my account, ergo, multiple accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again Macheras assumes to know what he is talking about. Nice. If the second account was his wife's, one would hope it was cancelled with her consent, in which case he cancelled one and his wife the other. If someone cancells multiple accounts, the multiple accounts are theirs, not someone elses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I put down multiple accounts, but I don't bot (much).  Between my wife and I we have three accounts, one of which we inherited from a friend who quit the game.  We cancelled all three of them in favor of two WoW accounts.<br />
<br />
Two of my three kids are getting their own WoW accounts from their grandfather for Christmas (it's what they asked for) so we will have a little group of four :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I cancelled two accounts, the second belonging to my wife.  I tried botting an SK on it last year but just couldn't get into it.</div></div><hr />
