<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lucor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I know there is a complete walkthru below, but I have been killing Dire wolves for 4 hours yesterday close to the Iceclad ring and one of the block with half a dragon head on it, but no stalker.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong ? He is the last part I need and I get frustrated,Ii have been killing those green wolves 3 or 4 times for a total of 8 hours and still no stalker.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any suggestion for me ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think there's any big trick to getting the wolf to spawn, he can spawn randomly in place of any dire wolf, and there's no particular place that's better than any other.  It took me less than an hour to get that piece of the map, killing near the dragon ring, so I doubt there is anything you are doing wrong.  Probably just a case of bad luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Start from the bottom of your tracking list and kill wolves until they all respawn up on the top of your tracking window.  Then just repeat the process until the stalker spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mikkyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep.. I just finished this part myself...<br />
<br />
I only had an hour or so to play over the last 3 days.. each..<br />
and took me 3 1 hour blocks, and today for an hour or so... finally got the stalker to spawn :)<br />
<br />
I had gotten a tell from friend and gotten 4 adds.. and was running for zone, rooting and killing one-by-one.. i finally finished em all off, and decided to give it a rest for the day... i checked track one more time.... :p<br />
<br />
you can guess the rest.. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cymrich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wow, must be bad luck :( have always, always seen him up every time am around there. maybe try checking after patch one day, that seems to help when looking for velious and older mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lucor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Woot finally got him after more than 10 hours of caming, I was killing Dire wolves on the side of the Island close to the Druid ring opposite the block with the half dragon head, when he spawned close to the block which is close to the bridge.<br />
<br />
By the way was just after a patch<br />
<br />
So i got my Eyepatch</div></div><hr />
