<br />
<br />
We are going to stick a password on it to:<br />
1. Make it a semi-perminate channel<br />
2. Keep out unsavory types that who would use it as a platform to promote anti-ranger propganda.<br />
<br />
<br />
General Rules:<br />
1. All rangers are welcome regardless of race, starting city, level or primary/alt status.<br />
2. Trolling, whining, begging or gloating is not permitted.<br />
3. The only dumb question is the one you don't ask.<br />
4. Rangers of all guilds are welcome, but guild politics are not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Drop me a tell or an email for the access info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started &quot;TheGlade&quot; on Innoruuk and for the first couple of weeks we had as many as 16 rangers in the chat at one time.  Time progressed I guess and ppl dropped out and never came back.<br />
<br />
We didn't have a password and we didn't need to worry about players entering and complaining.  Frankly, it wasn't up to anyone on the server to tell anyone else what is whinning and what isn't so we left it at that.  No one came in and bemoaned anything.  Maybe we are lucky.  I just don't think it is up to anyone anywhere to tell anyone what they can or can't say.  I'm sure that if someone were to get out of hand the rest of those in the chat would have asked them to leave.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the chat still exists but few come to it.  Most of the time we are all so busy doing what we do that there's not much chat that generally goes on to keep ppl interested in coming back.<br />
<br />
I did remind many that they could /autojoin the channel and I'm sure that was part of the reason we had so many come back initially.  Maybe alot forgot it.<br />
<br />
How I got people involved initially was to /tell each ranger the name and how to get in and then remind them about /autojoin.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
