<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well from what I hear from the other boards they whack this camp with the nerf stick, can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
Luckily I got 2 but was hoping to get more for friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slaiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Friend of mine just told me that he went to the camp and there are no mobs there anymore.  Ruins are there but the skeletons are not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have yet to confirm it on Povar, but I knew it was gonna happen.<br />
Just pissed I didn't get all my alts suited up before it was too late.<br />
<br />
Maybe it'll pop in occasionally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Definately not on Povar any more.<br />
Grumble grumble grumble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i lucked out.  got a second ring last night.  <br />
<br />
it was too good to last anyway.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
too bad verant still hasn't pulled their heads out of their collective asses and made loot like this the norm - or at least easier to obtain for people that don't have forty 24/7 playing friends to get.</div></div><hr />
