<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes Im nuts, I know, but I want a new pair of boots and have been looking at the ones that come from the quest in PoM, but I can't find a decent description on how do get them. I've seen the shamanistic shennigan doll in the bazaar a few times. Is that worth dropping plat on to buy or is that &quot;relatively&quot; easy to get.<br />
<br />
   Most the of the walk throughs end with this...<br />
<br />
When this Doll is combined with the 5 main Armor of Distraction types (Gloves, Breastplate, Legs, Arms, Feet) you get the Class Specific Doll Quest Armor specific. <br />
<br />
  Is this saying that I have to do all of this just to find out what I need to get the boots... do I have to do this or using prior knowledge can I skip parts.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I'm confused now... and I think thats what VI intended.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First of all - if you see the doll for sale, by all means, BUY IT IMMEDIATLY. Imo that is the hardest part.<br />
<br />
Being a shaman you have the ability to solo mobs that will drop the cards you need to make the boots of distraction. (assuming you are 60+ and have torpor) Its all about time and effort. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the quick reply Krak. I had checked out the link before that you posted and it still leaves me confused. I looked at the phat lewtz link and then clicked on the link for the shaman boots. And it tells everything up to the doll and the distraction armour.... what do I need after that. I know mobs in PoM drop things like crowns, thrones, knights and whatnot. Do they fit in to this somehow?<br />
<br />
  From reading your post all I need is the doll and the boots of distraction. Can someone enlighten me a bit more.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rezipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">your just not seeing it... hehe<br />
<br />
before you look at the link to the boots of distraction read that page, look at what it takes to make the boots. the answer is on that page.<br />
<br />
white crown + blue knight = boots of distraction<br />
white knight + blue crown = bracelet of the twisted mind<br />
<br />
Now do you see it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So if Im reading this right... I need a white crown and a blue knight like you said and also a blue throne and a white throne.<br />
<br />
   I think I've been looking at my text books too long :mad:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zuksharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only thing you can do to make getting the boots a bit easier would be to buy the cards and doll from someone.<br />
<br />
Assuming you do this you'll only need to get a deck of spontaneous generation, book of mischief and pot of gold all of which are quested containers in PoM.  All this information is on the PoM website but admittedly it's a bit tricky to understand at first.  I'll skip some of the logistics and locations of needed NPC's... you'll find them after some time exploring the place.<br />
<br />
First off you'll need to get the Deck of Spontaneous Generation from Ferjeneror.  Give him a King Cod Card for it, or alternatively you can fish in the moat outside for the 4 different colored cod cards... giving him those 4 will get you the deck also.  Ferjeneror is a sphinx in the center of the hedge maze.  Combine the blue throne, white throne, white crown and white knight in the deck to get the boots of distraction.<br />
<br />
Next you'll need to get a Book of Mischief.  Kill any of the gorilla mobs for a chance at getting a library card and give the card to Posie the Librarian.  She's a flower looking enchanter mob.  In the book you'll need to combine the top right, top left, bottom right and bottom left pieces of the Words of Wealth.  The page parts can drop off any mob in the zone really but the left sides seem to be more rare.<br />
<br />
Combining the corners will get you a completed Words of Wealth.  Give that to Bob the Painter and he'll give you an Empty Pot of Gold.  Combine your shaman doll and the boots of distraction in the pot of gold and you'll have the new boots.<br />
<br />
It's only this &quot;easy&quot; if you buy the cards and doll.  If you are unable to do this you'll need to farm the cards plus a ton more words of wealth page parts which will take a lot of time and dedication.  To get a chance at getting the shaman gift box (which produces the doll) you'll need to make a total of 4 additional completed words of wealth and 4 additional top left pieces.  Combining a completed words of weath with a top left piece will result in a Funny Money.  Give 4 funny moneys to Peaches at the entrance to the castle and she will give you back a random gift box... you have a 1 in 8 shot of it being a shaman box.  The box has 5 charges.  Each charge one will give you a doll.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't end up with a shaman box you can sell off the dolls you do get for the cards you need for the boots... it's a good way to do it.<br />
<br />
Best of luck!<br />
