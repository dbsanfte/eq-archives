<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I'm omw to Ssra for HP \ AL \ bunch of other stuff, HP first...when a few other people + me get there and get CoH'd \ buffed we going for it and about ready, I'm nearing the zone to the Grey when some GM broadcasts...All servers will be comming down in 15 mins. Estimated downtime is 1 hour.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  /sigh, why cant they give like an hour or 2 warning always?  If it had just been in an hour then we coulda hit HP up twice :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yah no **** . . we had just killed a NTOV dragon and didn't get a chance to loot it . . . or get out. <br />
<br />
**** GMs in the goat ass ok?  They said 15 minutes and then cut off the servers RIGHT after they say Five minutes left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep.  I'm currently running through ME with 3/4 a bub of health.  Probably log in smack in the middle of the 4 arm village, or maybe a pile of gorangas.  The last line of text on my screen, right before I saw &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED&quot; is &quot;Servers coming down in 5 minutes...&quot;   <br />
<br />
/petition Where should I wait for my rez?<br />
<br />
I enjoy having things to bitch about as much as the next curmudgeon, but this game is starting to genuinely piss me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">we've been camping ragefire for one of my friends on our server for the last few days. i am so SICK if seeing 'The servers will be coming down...'<br />
<br />
if they would just take it down and do everything at once.... <br />
<br />
rage would have popped by now if all these server downtime wasn't going on. if i never see SF again, it'll be ok <br />
<br />
*weep*<br />
<br />
well back to SF =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same, we just pulled a named spiritcaller in CT, as they announced &quot;5 minutes left&quot;.  Wham, disconnected.  Now 6 of us stuck in the middle of 4c, doubt we'll be lucky enough to log on at the same time =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Smack in the middle of a cr in Hate (3 spites and 11 random mobs came flowing in from second floor, chanter didn't have a chance) when they announced 5 minutes. What makes it better is that some mobs just hit camp when they pulled the plug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild was in the middle of pulling Statue in Kael when the servers went down, luckily we all logged in at the same time, due to everyone being on the website.</div></div><hr />
