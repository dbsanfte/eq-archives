<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I picked up one of these things thinking it was a no brainer for the haste (Affliction Haste IV.)  Of course, my impression was that it helped with DoT's AND slows, but so far it only seems to be helping with DoT's.  I know that I read on the chanter boards that it helped with slow.  Did they change it?  Does it work with just certain slows i.e. Disease checks vs Magic checks?  When I get my 51 slow will it start working?<br />
<br />
As it stands right now, I like the DoT hasting, but it's the slows that I really wanted to speed up.  So I'm debating on picking up a stat booster for range or keeping this thing.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts and/or pointers?  Sorry if this has been addressed, I did do a search, but didn't find anything definitive while sifting thru.</div></div><hr />
