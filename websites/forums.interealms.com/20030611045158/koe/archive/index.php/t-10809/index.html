<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lewz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im not a great speaker or anything so im gonna make this pretty short....<br />
<br />
Ever since my oldest EQ frin Tannin left this game ive been thinking alot about my future in EQ and in RL...<br />
<br />
EQ wise all ive been doing lately is to think about how great i used to think this game was... when traveling through norrath was actually a dangerous thing and entering a dungeon had a feeling of adventure over it... these days sadly i find everyday XP groups and such to be boring and raids start at about 2 in the morning and end 7 maybe 8 in the morning and i cant make that sacrifice anymore since it is killing my RL<br />
<br />
My RL has been suffering pretty badly over the last year or so... my results in school hasnt been as good as they should be and im nowhere near the physical shape i would like to be in..<br />
<br />
So after considering these things ive decided to quit EQ for good this time.. I will miss you all very much and it was a true honor to be able to play this game as a Keeper.. you guys are the best :)<br />
<br />
I have given Aliera all of my droppable items to be distributed according to my wishes... im sure you will put it all to good use.<br />
Lewz`s corpse will rot outside the Freeport gates.. where i once started this great adventure.<br />
<br />
Farewell my friends<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, take care Lewz.  I hope this turns out to be a good decision for you.  And an interesting, touching choice to let your corpse rot outside of FP.  That place is a ghost town now, so it gives me a bit of a creepy feeling imagining it.<br />
<br />
Good luck out there.</div></div><hr />
