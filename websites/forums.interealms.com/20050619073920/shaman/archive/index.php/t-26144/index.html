<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, my guild has just broken into Time! :cool: We've killed Quarm several times now, and the zone is officially on farm status. <br />
<br />
Items Picked Up:<br />
1. Bloodlink Chestmail<br />
2. Bracer of the Inferno<br />
3. Pulsing Onyx Ring<br />
4. Leggings of Furious Might<br />
5. Earring of Celestial Energy<br />
6. Shawl of Eternal Forces<br />
7. Earhoop of the Eighteen Eyes<br />
<br />
Other Items I'd Like:<br />
1. Feratha Hide Belt (Feratha)<br />
2. Facade of Fright (MPG)<br />
3. Buckled Leather Collar (Volklana)<br />
4. Chain Wraps of the Dark Master (Txevu)<br />
<br />
After that, it's Qvic armor. Still waiting on my helm, and have picked up all other pieces. The Time's Antithesis is still on the list!  :cool: Also in the market for a shield upgrade. Considering  Bane of the Stonegazer, but I also like Lana's Crystal Shield from the Queen in RSS and the Barrier of Serenity from Txevu.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Edited for personal reference!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2. Earring of Unseen Horrors<br />
3. Veil of the Inferno<br />
4. Pulsing Onyx Ring<br />
7. Leggings of Furious Might<br />
11. Bloodlink Chestmail<br />
<br />
all seem right on, to me.  The others I wouldn't be 100% on.  Very very good shoulders, back, and waist are available from MPG single group trials that your guildies should be ready to knock out of the park once they start looting Time.<br />
<br />
Specifically, the shoulders Tri-Spined Spaulders of Destruction have bene range on them, and the belt Girdle of Efficiency has the quarm shoulder click.  Those two specifically address two of the loots you have there, range shoulders from primals and click cloak from time.  For detrimental range, go with phase1 Wristguard of Keen Vision.  The focus is hardly different, and should be immensely cheaper.  <br />
<br />
For detrimental haste, hold out for Quarm bracer.  You have the PoEb hat/neck thing, that'll hold you more than fine.  Quarm bracer is high quality all the way up into Anguish.  The click earring is a matter of taste, but if you have a shot at the quarm Prismatic Ring of Resistance that it won't stack with, by saving, then save.  I think 45ac is well worth 5sva.<br />
<br />
Oh, shield get from MPG, too.  You won't need the ft, stats and +% mods on Bane of the Stonegazer are super (and dkp-free)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shale Shoulderpads from Ikkinz 2. Onyx Ring of Prayer from Ikkinz 1. I'm not sure the Pulsing Onyx Ring is worth it.<br />
<br />
Your back piece is good enough to wait for the Uqua back piece (Lavender Cloak of Destruction). I don't think the Celestial Cloak is THAT good.<br />
<br />
Also, most of your gear is in the 140 hp range, which is approximately EP quality. Many of those upgrades that you are suggesting are about 180 hp. That's only a 40 hp upgrade. I totally agree that the earrings have to go but you may find it to your advantage to hold out for some Quarm loot (Ring, Bracer) or Ikkinz loot, which weigh in at around 220 hp. Items that are 220 hp will last you quite awhile so it'd be DKP well spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You win dkp by holding out for the best.  Screw the people that are saying you won't kill Quarm, they're just trying to get you to spend your precious points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ikkinz shoulders are redundant with quarm bracer.  <br />
<br />
edit: nvm the cloak comment, was thinking of the Koadic's click one.  the Eternal Ward click is very good.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz shoulders still aren't good though, if you have the much better bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like the Ikkinz shoulders for the focus as well as the stun resist. However, I also like it because it's somewhat common (if you farm Ikkinz). Quarm Bracer is really nice, but you only get time once every week and a half depending on server, but Ikkinz you get once every three days. Ikkinz 2 is also much easier to master than getting all the way to Quarm, and you have 4 chances for the shoulderpads to drop intead of 1. Also, the bracer slot is very easy to fill with quality gear, such as Kanleku's, Tacvi first boss bracer, MPG raid trial bracer.<br />
<br />
However, I personally have not found a better beneficial haste effect item myself =) At the risk of derail, could someone suggest a 220 hp+ beneficial haste focus for me? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow, thanks for all the responses, guys. Back to the drawing board!  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korabor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good luck to you guys Tordail, shoot me a tell in game if you have any questions also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't know how often you guys will be attempting time. P1 resets every 18 hours, and is farmable with a couple of groups of the right people.<br />
<br />
my wishlist in time was not big. there are upgrades to be had in GoD+ that seem to be easier to get. (i.e. bloodlink in Ikkinz)<br />
<br />
if you're looking to save points, go in on the P1 drops that are the largest upgrades for you and don't spend anything else until P4.<br />
<br />
you never know when a TA is going to drop, and most people I know do Saryrn first when they hit P4. after Saryrn is dead, I tend to relax a little and consider some of the next god drops, (winged storm boots, hammer of hours, Coif of Flowing Time) until we hit P5. TA and Symbol of the Planesmasters were my top two choices from P4, and both drop from Saryrn.<br />
<br />
P5, hold out on CT, and wait for Bert, cross your fingers for a ring.<br />
the focus on the ring is Chrononostrum. it is not to be shrugged off. it IS the best beneficial spell extension focus until Txevu/Anguish.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty happy with Inny shoulders, and with their focus, I don't need to get a Quarm shield to get the healing focus.<br />
<br />
basically I'm saying, screw P1 unless you need it. you should hold out on the good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd put bloodlink chestmail, pulsing onyx ring and shale shoulderpads on my &quot;get asap&quot; list.<br />
And yes, it's much easier to master ikkinz 2 than figuring out time all the way.<br />
  Elemental legs in P3 are very common, I'd wait a couple month and they should drop in dkp price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">However, I personally have not found a better beneficial haste effect item myself =) At the risk of derail, could someone suggest a 220 hp+ beneficial haste focus for me? :)<br />
<br />
Been looking for one myself. My Fennin belt is getting a bit old.<br />
<br />
Cryston, Staff of the Rift from king in Rift seekers is an option.<br />
<br />
Aegis of the Amber Moon seems to be from one of the DoN dragons most likely. <br />
Both are only 25% but do work on up to level 70 spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armguards of Envy from Txevu are an option but will probably require getting a new Healing focus item. (assuming your using qvic arms).<br />
<br />
Loop of Entropic Hues from Tacvi is nice too.<br />
Both are 30% spell hast but are capped at level 67 spells. Because it's only 5% per level they still end up being 25.5% on a level 70 spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wristband of Chaotic Warfare from txevu again is another option. Only 23% spell haste capped at 67 but covers benificial and detrimental spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Will do, Korabor. :)<br />
<br />
... basically I'm saying, screw P1 unless you need it. you should hold out on the good stuff.<br />
<br />
Yeah. My earrings make me cry. Seriously. :( I was going to grab at least a Pulsing Emerald Earring, since it'd be a pretty big upgrade. Then I would have only one pathetic earring! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">However, I personally have not found a better beneficial haste effect item myself =) At the risk of derail, could someone suggest a 220 hp+ beneficial haste focus for me? :)<br />
<br />
hahahaha<br />
<br />
Bene haste outside PoP:<br />
<br />
Nightcaller Leggings (Vex Thal), capped at 60<br />
<br />
Aneuk Contemplation Skull (Pixtt Suir Mindrider, rare as balls)<br />
Choker of Centaur Slaying (Riwwi, quest mob is never up)<br />
Armguards of Envy (Tacvi, and random like Time drops are.  my guild has 0 of these)<br />
<br />
Those three are capped at 67, they have the same focus as PoTime.<br />
<br />
The one and only level 70 bene haste focus for shaman is from DoN, Necklace of Grimspirit Beads.  There's none for us, apparently, in all of OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The p1 and P2 earrings are both very nice. And your scheme seems to be very reasonable for them DKP wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That earring is a 40hp upgrade, that's not worth spending on when such stellar stuff is becoming available to you.  You can get Icedrop Pearl and Bauble of Premonitions from RSS/MPG with more hp than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, we beat Ikkinz 1 tonight, and I picked up a Bloodlink Chestmail. :cool: Revamping the wish list!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">let me know how you do on keeper in ikk4 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow, grats.<br />
<br />
/drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">get a friend or two and kill in yxtta for an attuned discord earring, it isn't too shabby...and should still be an upgrade...<br />
<br />
you could also take the same group to RCoD for an Earring of Ethical Uncertainty.<br />
<br />
I try to solo yxtta when I can. if I can't get root to hold well enough, I'm dead. even at 8k buffed HP, 2-3 rounds from a mob and I'm toast.<br />
<br />
hynids don't like to stay rooted. VP is the best option for them. the cragbeasts seem to stay rooted, but hynids are MUCH more common.<br />
<br />
just root, and pile EVERY DoT you can on them....they'll die slightly faster than OoW mobs, but they hit MUCH harder and faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would not hold out for a Bracer of the Inferno unless you are willing to wait a long time.  Depending on what loot table your guild gets, you could get several bracers over the course of a year, or none at all.  We have killed ~30 Quarms and had a single bracer drop about a year ago.<br />
<br />
Shale Shoulderpads are far more common and are a really solid bit if you are looking for det haste.  I would not even consider the Cord of Potential because you would just be doubling up on focus effects with the shoulders/bracer and the belt has low resists and no mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Maiviaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">not sure if this is a concern of yours, but the clickies on veil of the inferno and earring of celestial energy do not stack with one another</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks for all the feedback! <br />
<br />
Tonight we cleared phases 1, 2, and 3 and managed to also kill Saryrn (mage veil and two girdles, pah!) and Terris Thule before everybody fell over from exhaustion. This is kinda fun! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">P3 becomes distinctly &quot;unfun&quot; all too fast. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">everything before P4 is just routine....its the Gods you're after.<br />
<br />
eventually you'll move up to 1 night clearings of time. which can be done in a few hours. you just need to get a rhythm down and make it a point to be there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">5.5hr Time clears are the juiciest time ever spent in EQ, loot-wise.  You can do a tiny bit better on Qvic Mshas if you have a hot-stuff bard puller, but it's not nearly as exciting.</div></div><hr />
