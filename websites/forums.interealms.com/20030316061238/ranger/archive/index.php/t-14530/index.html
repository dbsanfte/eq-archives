<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kundow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day, kiting around Sgt. Slate, about half my arrows were poofing. Even when he was rooted, and I was just far enough away to use my bow, and on flat ground.<br />
<br />
Also, pulling Shardwurms from the cave in GD last night, half my shots were blanks.  I know that has some freaky turns and such, but it was rediculous.<br />
<br />
I have noticed all this after the running patches from the 19th-22nd.<br />
<br />
I am currently using cheap crappy 1/25 arrows, and a Bow of the Huntsman.  Archery skill is 175 at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.<br />
<br />
I'm also fizzling spells more often, and my SoWed speed is much slower than it was pre-patch.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, almost forgot...the MOBs are hitting for a lot more too.<br />
<br />
/em runs away very fast, tongue firmly planted in cheek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You know, *someday* arrows really are going to poof more, or SoWed speed WILL be slower, etc etc, and none of us will believe reports because we will INSTANTLY think they are false upon reporting :)  <br />
<br />
GASP!  Secret Plot to deaden our senses to nerfs!<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I have had times like that, where I am convinced something was changed and it wasn't. It sure is frustrating.  :D<br />
<br />
~Jalim~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pindail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have alson seen a reduction in the number of poofed arrows as well :D But did not want to post....see above as my reasons why.<br />
<br />
I used 7 stacks of arrows on a rooted mob over flat ground and had 10-15 hits. I did not log it but I will try to log it and post for the disbelivers...<br />
<br />
GL all and keep an open mind<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brannuer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A lot more people are experiencing some nasty lag/data spikes since the PoP set of patches. Since archery shooting is client side, perhaps that's what happened to you. <br />
<br />
Btw, with PoP they changed their network code, and packets are now compressed and the whole session is encrypted with PKI, mainly, it appears to combat ShowEQ. While it appeared to sorta help in that regard, what it definitely seemed to do was introduce (more) network bugs/lag into the game (ie.- people losing 10 lvls on death because the game couldn't connect to the registration server to validate their expansions, xp bars frozen for similar reasons). Also /serverfilter appearing not to work I think is connected in here somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pindail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seems to be solid logic to me...I hope they get it fixed soon as I miss plinking wit my bow :cool: <br />
<br />
<br />
/wonder will EQ2 be better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wonder when they'll change SoW to the way they said they originally intended the spell to be like - To break when ever you attacked, cast, got hit, etc (like invis and Scale of the Wolf).<br />
<br />
I'm sure the majority of druids and rangers will really really cancel their accounts in screaming horror then.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer - I'm aware of how half the things I've encountered in Planes of Power run as fast as or faster than my Innate Run Speed 3 (like Hobgoblins)... it hurts when I forget. O.o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kundow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well....I seem to have stuck my foot firmly in my mouth.  I shot around 1800 arrows at Zelniaks in Dawnshroud last night without a single poof.  Quite a few misses, but no poofs.<br />
<br />
Finally got my archery up to 200 as well. :D  And made level 46. :D :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the info.  Didn't know what was going on the other night.</div></div><hr />
