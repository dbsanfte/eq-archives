<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pleides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in a smallish guild,there are only a few of us (6) over lvl 50.As we have just started to group and hunt together it was suggested we all have a crack at farming this dude for the sword. I know he is a 24hr spawn so a few runs and all the melee's in the guild would be able to obtain one.<br />
There would be me 62 ranger<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might want someone to heal, since he hits hard and fast, and IIRC is unslowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely you're going to need a healer.  You may also have problems pulling without a monk or SK.  Might be possible to pull using CoTH, though.  Either way, learning how to work the pull is, in my experience, a big pain involving many hours and many many deaths.   But it's a nice little sword and well worth it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kinladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best puller for this is a Ranger Hands down.<br />
<br />
Sow in the nexus, then zone into Echo. Levitate, then invis yourself. The general can see invis but has a fairly small aggro range.<br />
<br />
There is a sweet spot on the stairs that lead up to him that you snare the first assassin, then boogie outside, and make sure the second assasin and the general are following. Get enough room to snare assasin number 2. Then again make sure the general is close enough that you won;t loose aggro,and pull him past the raid force. Keep running for the Fungus grove zone. WHen you pass your raid force, have someone tag the general, and pull him into the tunnel leading to SH.<br />
<br />
This is where your main force should be. They can then dispose of the general, while you zone and loose the aggro of the casting masters. That's the reason you have to zone out. The evil casting guild masters will eat you otherwise.<br />
<br />
it;s a risky, adventurous pull, and not for the light of heart, but what a rush.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Acrux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heyas Pleides, I got a better idea. Come along with us and the borrowed enchanter when we drop this guy. We have this pull down to an artform and its quite an event. We are short some people during the week and Im sure we could make an arraingement for you to recieve this fine piece of metal. Talk it over with the &quot;enchantress&quot; and Im sure she will bring it up with all of us. I dont see any problem in helping you get ahold of this item. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rashgaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just got this today on brell.  Let me tell you it was a giant pain in the butt.  First the chanter we had, lvl 64, didnt have pacify which greatly complicated it.  The guild masters will assist if you hit the general and they are all level 61.  You cant stop them with hails when theyre running like i read some one did.  If you have pacify then it might be easier.<br />
<br />
First i should note that it was everyones first time at this.  We had 64 warrior, 65 warrior, 65 druid, 61 druid, 60wiz, 62 mage, 64 chanter, 55 ranger.  They all had uber gear (cept me) as in way better then the sword this guy drops, i.e. primal weapons and kael armor and NToV items.  Had to get chanter to drag the masters to FG because he was the only one who could agro them without agroing the general.  65 druid pulled general and assassins.  We lost the 64 warrior, 60 wiz 62 mag and 61 druid.  So the fight is quite hard.<br />
<br />
Yes had we waited for a FD puller and a cleric probably no casualties, none were on at the time though.  And they do summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recommend 2 groups for this guy. He's a pain, and even a lvl65 tank can get owned really fast.<br />
<br />
Again, I've pulled this guy a few times, and the strategy I laid out works well. You just need to make sure that you snare the two assasins, and as you are running you get out of aggro range.<br />
<br />
I forgot to add, that I usually have a Chanter throw a rune on me. Makes the pull a bit easier, for a few seconds anyhow. (The main tank in our group last time said I was crazy, maybe I am hehe)<br />
<br />
This one is a serious underconn, keep that in mind, a Dark Blue con to me at 57, but will own a 65 tank real fast if not carefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>legalil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmmm... i seem to have a problem of getting the master guys adding when i try to pull.  any tips on how to get the general and his assasins without the masters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aanlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HEHE,  we took a shot at killing one of the masters last time we did the general.  After about 3 or 4 min of beating on him with 3 grps and the master's hit point bar not moving, we decided zoning might be a good idea.  After that attempt, and a couple rezzes, we just pulled the general to the FG zone and tagged him to SH tunnel when he was clear of the masters.</div></div><hr />
