<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I see a few threads on Focus Items and their effects, but how and where do we get some of these Focus Items? I'm presently camped at Katta Castellum and wondering where to start looking/buying of these items. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm at a loss for how to answer this.  Have you seen the list of focus items that's been posted everywhere?  It's mainly old world and Kunark gear that's been upgraded.  If you don't know where these drop, nor how to find out where they drop, there's not much more I can do to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly?  Do nothing right now.  Just wait.  This is the first round of focus items, and they are starting at the bottom (or so I hope).  Serious, most of the items they buffed up are pretty bad, all things considered.  I'd recommend you give them 2-3 more patches, see what's out there, and THEN start looking for items.  They've already changed stuff around once and probably cost some people a boatload of cash when they jumped early.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess I'll just wait then start worring about focus items. I'm having enough fun with the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am of a similar opinion to Chutoi. Wait and See.<br />
<br />
If you gained something usefull on one of your existing pieces of equipment, be happy about it. Otherwise, don't really wory to much about it for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im not saying you shouldnt wait but applying logic to what VI will do in the future is dangerous.<br />
<br />
Cases where waiting for something in the past was not a good idea:<br />
<br />
- Manastones<br />
- DE mask<br />
- Cultist ring<br />
- ST warder drops<br />
- Vulak drops<br />
<br />
And there are probably many more.</div></div><hr />
