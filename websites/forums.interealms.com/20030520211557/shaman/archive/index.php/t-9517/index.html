<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently I play a 54 warrior and a 53 shaman. They both have exceptional gear and I like just duoing, although I will start pop grouping soon. I have been thinking about adding another class to my team and I would like some insight as to what to add. I dont know if I will raid with all the characters, or just 1/2, or whatever is necessary at the time. I am looking for a good addition to my team, maybe letting me just play the 3 characters in pop and not adding any other pcs(sometimes it is nice to not have to group with others) <br />
<br />
I have been thinking about rogue, or ranger for dps. Rogue is nice because I dont have to med or cast, just hit backstab and worry about position. Ranger adds snare and atk buffs. I could also add a cleric, or even an enchanter if need be. I dont know how good I will be at playing 3 characters but I imagine I can get used to is as long as it isn't too difficult. I think an enchanter would be too difficult for me so I probably wont do that. A cleric might be the way to go, but would take a lot longer to level up.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of rogue as I have wanted to play one but haven't managed to get one past 33 yet. I think the cleric will be more usefull, but wont help kill much faster. Will a shammy be able to keep up a rogue and war in pop grouping so that we can get decent exp?<br />
<br />
I dont have much experience in pop yet, as I restarted from a 61 wiz right after pop came out.<br />
<br />
For refrence:<br />
warrior gear<br />

shammy gear<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=443593<br />
<br />
I would expect fairly ghetto gear for the rogue, but I would probably be able to get epic and a nice offhand weapon so the dps should be ok.<br />
For a cleric, I would be able to get decent wis, a horse, and an ods but not many hps and not an overly large manapool for a while.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help that you can offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya gotta decide whats gonna help the group the most. Cleric isn't gonna neccessarily help out much, at least as far as how fast a mob dies. Rogues will, as will rangers. If your not totally dead set against ranger thats what i would add, they have some nice abilities (track, utility spells, archery at higher levels) and dps wise aren't far behind rogues.<br />
And the haste epic blade for them might be even easier than the rogue epic is, with exception of hole raid. Rangers can help the shammy convert mana by spam healing as you canni, can add attack buffs and even add a regen buff that stacks with all others at 49. Get an assling ranger, they have nice stats and also get the racial xp bonus and your shammy can probably pl him to 50 in under 5 days played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, I definately like the abilities of a ranger, and ranger is another class that I have wanted to play. <br />
<br />
I realize that cleric doesn't add dps, but I am concerned that having only the 3 classes that I will play will not allow us to group for exp at 65. I guess my main question is, can a group of War/shammy/ranger or rogue succede in pop exping at 65, or will we need to add a cleric?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen a pair of 60's dou in tier one pop zones no problem (shammy and pally dou) and personally haven't made it to tier 2 with any toons. I've heard of 65 solo classes being able to solo still so I would assume that a well played trio would be able to thrive in PoP up to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">maybe a pally would be the answer to your dilema? They arent big dmg dealers, but they would certainly do more than a cleric, and also get some decent heals and LoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have to say I would go with a ranger. The trio you have will not be hard to 3 box, or rather easier than most 3boxing. I would also suggest putting a 2hs in the hands of the ranger cause it will be less aggro and, with the new easily attainable PoP weapons, same damage. The ranger accidently grabbing aggro could be a problem, but a quick jolt would fix it. As said above, rangers can add a lot, snares, pulling, atk buffs, and other things. One reason i would NOT pick a rogue: unless you plan on spending the entire fight on the rogue screen you will not get to backstab. This makes the rogues dps closer to warrior and less than ranger's. I would suggest makeing a wood elf becuase, even though halflings have better stats, woodies just look bangin.<br />
<br />
As to the trio succeding in above tier 1 zones, I would have to say not likely, though in PoN or PoD you would rock.</div></div><hr />
