<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ruparin01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am thinking about what my guild can possibly raid at our current level. <br />
<br />
What is the &quot;path&quot; a guild would take raiding more and more difficult targets. <br />
<br />
I'm guessing that major raids would start with somewhere like Hate, and move up from there, finally to VT and PoP stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Havent really paid attention to the raid scene, I would like to know the answer to this too.<br />
<br />
I think it goes something like Hate, Fear, Kael, ToV, Ssra, ST, some planes, VT, some more planes.<br />
<br />
Am I right? Am I close? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, pre-50 most guild just raid smaller dungeons like Kaesora (XP), SolB (all but giants and naggy)(XP+loot) and LGuk (XP+Loot).<br />
<br />
Once the guild is in the 47-55 range plane raids, epic raids, and most of Kunark opens up to them, cant forget Kael ethier<br />
<br />
55-60 is when guilds can really attempt all Old World, Kunark and most of Veliousous content to some extent, also epics should be finished now<br />
<br />
60+ is when you can go anywhere and do anything limited only by numbers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruparin01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is the level 52 (or whatever) limit still in place for Vox/Naggy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes.. the level limit still exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulamwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The biggest question is what is your current guild level and what have you raided to date?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruparin01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Right now, I don't think we can take any of the big guys by ourselves. <br />
<br />
We can probably put up 2-3 groups of 50+, and some individuals have been on plane/dragon raids, but nothing like that as a guild.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for something realistic to work towards.</div></div><hr />

It is all about <br />
1.  What size your guild is (peak population at a particular time is a good rule of thumb) <br />
2.  What level is the bulk of your guild at, and what is your Main Tank level<br />
3.  Then the equipment level for your bulk of your people<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, I saw one of the servers put out their tier system.  It basically outlines &quot;groups&quot; of mobs that are in generally the same catagory of difficulty to take down<br />
<br />
http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/eventview.jsp?o=52963<br />
<br />
This is one example.  You can then determine where you are on the chart by the types of mobs you can kill.  For example on our server, one guild is clearly a tier 9 with a pair of guilds at tier8 (who work together very very closely)  Then Drinal drops off rapidly --there are a couple guilds at the  6-7 level, fourish at the level 5 and then a host of them who are just emerging at the tier 1.<br />
<br />
Personally I think there is a Level 0 raiding guild, not listed in the other tier system.  The level 0 raiding guild is working to complete their epic weapons, and just learning how to raid.  They are leveling to 60 and working their AA points.  They are raiding Hate, Fear, and Air.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you have already completed a good portion of your epics, you have a solid MA tank, several post 56 clerics with epics, a level 60 chanter (KEI), and a good crew of DPS people then you are ready to see just where you are on the charts.<br />
<br />
Test out your raiding ability in Kael areana and work on your Thurg armour sets.  Once most of your people are outfitted with Thurg equivl armour move on.<br />
<br />
Lets assume that you have 30 people, and the average level is 58 and that you have just started working your velious armours.  Your MA, chanter, cleric are level 61, you have several 56 clerics to help with CH rotation, and 20 good damage dealers level 58-62.  Then, more than likely, you are just about a tier 1 guild -- the first step in a raiding guild.  <br />
<br />
A good test of your skill then would be to conduct a raid on Velks the Sorc and see if you have the skill to take him out.   Clear out the upper dogs and work your way back.  pull the guards.  Then buff and pull VtS (personally I liked fighting him in his room)<br />
<br />
If you have mastered aggromanagement, def disc for your MA, and your CH rotation then you can begin to work your way up the ladder.  If not, work on getting more levels, better armours, and more people.<br />
<br />
Often the next set of tasks for a guild is the Halls of Testing in ToV.  Since you have been killing giants, your CoV faction should be good, and you can begin aquiring CoV armours for your guildmates, and completing / rounding out thurg sets for people who did not finish up before you made the transition.<br />
<br />
At some point, your guild will be strong enough to start taking out Sleeper key &quot;First Tier&quot; Dragons.  This is critical in guild development as Sleeper's Tomb affords you the opportunity to get your Primal/Primalistic weapons that will DRAMATICALLY increase your guild DPS.  As soon as you can take out VtS, Zlandicar, Klandicar, and the statue you need to make a collective effort to collect the keys.  Once you have a set of 30 people equipped then you can begin your raids into ST.  <br />
<br />
Once you equip your guild's damage dealers with primals, you can easily jump up the &quot;chart&quot; progressively taking out more difficult mobs.  At some point you will most likely become velious faction indifferent, taking out all 3 of the various velious kings at about the same time that you start hitting Umbral Plains for Doom and RC, and hitting up Ak Ruins for the rock chap :-)<br />
<br />
This is by all means not a firm and hard thing.  Your guild may benifit by setting out goals and guidelines and how you want to achieve those goals.  You may want to be a pro-dorf faction guild and never hunt Dain.  <br />
<br />
The choices are yours dear and the sky is the limit<br />
<br />
Happy hunting</div></div><hr />

Depending on the makeup of those 12-18 players, I don't see why you couldn't set Hate as a reasonable goal for the near future.  I would do some &quot;test runs&quot; in some more CR friendly zones just to get used to working together as a guild, making sure that everyone knows their jobs, getting people to assist the MT, etc...   Even taking 2 groups into Chardok and killing the stuff at the front fort would allow you to work on the things you would need to be successful in Hate.</div></div><hr />
