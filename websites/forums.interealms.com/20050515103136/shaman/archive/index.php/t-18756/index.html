<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
Quick opinionated question and has this ever happened to you.<br />
<br />
I am in the middle of a petition that started at 8pm on Dec 30 2003 regarding the loss of 2- 10 slot bags in the shared bank.<br />
<br />
Background:<br />
<br />
Been on eq for over 2 years now and like to twink a character on a whim.  Decided to make a cleric but then didnt want him.  So I put all the items on him into 2 bags and put them into the 2 shared bank slots.  Camped to char select screen and deleted him.  Upon logging back on to get the 2 bags my shared bank was empty.<br />
<br />
That lead me to a petition and no response from a Guide the first day so I sent a complete list of all items via contact your GM.  Got response on 31 Dec JST froma guide who said he is escalating it to a GM.  It is now Jan 3 and nothing else received so I am still awaiting patiently a email or reply from a GM.<br />
<br />
I am pretty confident that I will get the items back because either:<br />
<br />
1. Shared banking is not working as it is suppost to and Sony wants to fix it.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2.  Shared banking is not working as is is suppost to and Sony doesnt care.<br />
<br />
Either way my understanding of Shared banking is that say Char X is on HardDrive X and Char Y is on Hardrive Y and there is a shared HardDrive Z in between.  <br />
<br />
If I put items into HD Z then it should not matter if I delete either character.<br />
<br />
Weather or not this is how the shared banking works is beyond me or if its just my flaw but just wanted to see if this has happened to anyone else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck on the return of your items from shared bank slot.  On my home server Quellious, someone had thier account jacked (trusted someone they shouldnt of with p-word), and was able to get everything restored BUT the shared banking.   The person this happened to, had the whole conversation with the GM screenshoted and logged, and the GM specifically said they were unable to restore items from shared bank slot, because it's not logged/ saved (scary eh?)  This was a couple months ago, so it may have changed.  But in all sincerity, best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I always have hope.  I did get a refund of a bag I dropped on the ground about 1.5 years ago on an old char so I just hope heehe.<br />
<br />
Guess it depends on how the GM is feeling :)</div></div><hr />

Maybe the GMs just laughed at your petition.  Since shared banks were added in June 2003. Your fiasco happened six months before that game feature was added to everquest?  You have been waiting 11 months and your confident youll get your stuff back? Anyone else smell that ?</div></div><hr />

I've been waiting awhile for a reply to my e-mail also.  Probably just because of the holidays :)<br />

He probably meant dec 30, thats just my guess though hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I lost half my gear looting in Plane of Water when the server crashed, came back and the half I hadn't looted yet was gone.<br />
<br />
It took over a week to get a GM response, SOE customer support is slow and it being the holiday season probably doesn't help matters much.<br />
<br />
But I eventually got everything back except for my charm, and the guy in PoK was happy enough to give me another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It really depends on whether the GM is a p*tz or not. I've seen GMs break into LDoN instances to give someone their loot back. Perhaps it depends on whether they have enough donuts at their desk. Otherwise your petition is wasting precious Krispy Kreme time!</div></div><hr />
