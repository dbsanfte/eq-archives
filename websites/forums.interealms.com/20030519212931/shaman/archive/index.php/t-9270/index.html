<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently got my dogdog and i am confused as to what it can do. I see people talk about it dual wielding and some double attacking etc.<br />
<br />
So does dogdog dual wield? and is so from what level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if your dog does or not.. easiest thing would be to grab both a 1hb and 1hs fine steel weapon and give him both (each separately).  You should be able to see crush/slash messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, i'm going to give him a dagger of dropping and a gnoll hide lariat tonite nehooo so thats a slash and a pierce and both should proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm guessing that since you just got dogdog you're level 34. I didn't really know about giving weapons at that level either, but give it a try. You don't have to look for a proc message though, just to see if there are two different types of damage being done. Dogdog unarmed will bite, bash and kick depending on level. When you arm him, the bites turn to slashes, pierces and crushes. He may not dual wield at your level though. I seem to remember him not doing it at first. And I give my dog both weapons at the same time and he uses both no problem.<br />

Good hunting to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you search the archives, you'll find that our pet being able to wield weapons is a fairly recent addition, try searching for Project Alpha for some of the early threads.<br />
<br />
No one has definitively nailed down when our dog can duel wield, anyone bored enough to summon old pets &amp; give him some rusties to see when he starts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Take a look here:http://www.eqshaman.com/<br />
<br />
Click on the spells tab, and scroll down to your pet. Under the effect, you can see what your pet hits for, double attacks, kicks or bashes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />
