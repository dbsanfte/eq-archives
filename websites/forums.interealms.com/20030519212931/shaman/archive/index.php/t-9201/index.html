<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which focus effects are the most important for shamans? Might be a matter of opinion, but I would like to know what people think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the Affliction focus items are pretty darned spiffy.  Faster casting, lower mana, longer lasting slows, dots, roots, malo line...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO, you want spell haste, affliction haste, and a buff extension due to the lack of duration with the PoP buff line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally I think affliction efficiency is the most important focus effect for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Personally on my regular gear I've got affliction efficiency, buff extension, buff haste and improved healing. The only one I took specifically for the focus effect is the affliction efficiency and it's also the only one that was worse stats than what it was previously wearing. I do have a coldain bracer for extend affliction but i don't wear it all the time. Usually just swap it in when soloing or fighting a boss i know take a while to kill especially when i want to avoid ae like Aaryonar in Ntov.<br />
<br />
I initially asked for my neck with mainly soloing in mind but after playing around with it the effect of affliction efficiency is really substantial. Our main job on most fights is to debuff saving mana on debuffing ends up helping out alot in tough situations. I'd love to get a good affliction efficiency item so i could ditch the necklace but till then i'm not taking it off.<br />
<br />
Buff extension and haste have been nice but for the most part thats all they are is nice. Buffing rarely is an issue with the mana regen skills we have with cann v and torpor. Idealy i'd like to pick up a haste of mithaniel item or comparable item from vt so i can get my haste back on 61+ spells and on non buff benificial spells. You still need 2 points in aa skills to hit min cast time with the best haste items so no reason not to invest in them too.<br />
<br />
I don't think affliction haste is too important altho it would be nice since aggro is usually still a factor when casting debuffs so you may not be able to land the spell any sooner anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only ones I use (and find useful) are Haste of Mithanael and Extended Affliction 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mith cuts torpor down to 4.8 seconds and tnargs to 3. Love it.<br />
<br />
<br />
EA makes bane last longer, and love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fico</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a buffer, debuffer you should have.<br />
Extended Enhancement.<br />
Extended Affliction.<br />
Affliction Haste.<br />
Spell haste is nice to have too but not really that important. <br />
here's my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=269403 . <br />
<br />
All these focus items are really easy drop/questable.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
