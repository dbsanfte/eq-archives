<p>Legends is retarded, there isnt anything on it that you cant do yourself by building an EQ homepage or joining a website or whatever.  Except of course for costomer service at the level I expected it to be at when I bought the original game, that might be harder to simulate.  (Of course my guildmates are usually happy to help in most situations....)</p>

But if evil is so lame and stupid as you say it is, why is good so preoccupied with us?  Could it be perhaps that good has a crush on evil? :P</font></p>

Sorry I dont know how to do the fancey quotes thing.. But honestly.. I am getting sick of comments like this. When you say this stuff, you end up insulting people and not really being aware of it. The pic is one thing cause it's funny, but things like this just become irratating. <br />
<br />
I have contraibuted alot to this board over the past couple years, so I would hope people here won't think less of me because I am moving to the legends server to try to enjoy new content. <br />

<p>No where in that statement did it say I think less of a person if they go to legends server (Read the other post regarding that I actually said if you want to go to legends then more power to you) What I say is my opinion and despite what anyone says its still my opinion, doesn't mean I scowl ready to attack anyone with a legends server underneath there signature.  To think I was starting to look up to you, always nice to get misunderstood <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Its no problem, the overall reaction to it has been very negative, on the boards and my server at least.  I can't blame people, besides all the arguments I've already went over, the fact that the game gets things added onto it that should have been there in the first place years later bothers people.  I don't expect perfection, but think about it this way...<br />
<br />
Imagine a platform game on say playstation that is as popular as final fantasy.  Then a year later they realease an add on pack to that same game opening up more options and worlds, then they do it again a year later, then again a year later with a graphics update that you have to upgrade your playstation with 100's of dollars worth of stuff, then they open up a legends type deal enabling real customer support etc.  I do commend Verant for testing new things, but the way I heard it, eq 2 is out by this christmas, don't know what'll happen to this eq but even if I had 400 bucks to burn until then I wouldn't take my chances.  Someday this will all come to an end and we'll have to move on, when that day comes I hope each of you can say you represented the sk class proudly.  OMG I'm getting emotional....must stop <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
