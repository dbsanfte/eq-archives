<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dinged 60 yesterday... It took me a little more than 2 years, with my first and main char.<br />
<br />
Now trying to find spells 59 and 60, I got only one not very interesting, Malo, a downgrade from a previous spell Malosinia, but as it was a gift from guild leader I accepted...<br />
<br />
BTW any advice on equipment is welcome (I wait for trial and hope to get a Silver Hammer Earring).<br />
I think I should upgrade ear, arms, girdle and back, but I used all my PP to buy a Death Mask of the Elysians and a Circled Toe Bones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">malo is a very important if uninteresting spell for the raiding shaman. unlike malosinia it is unresistable. makes many encounters go from very difficult to easier and some arent really possible at all for some guilds without malo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dohrian...please tell me you were kidding here.  If not, I suggest checking out the resist factor on Malo vs. Malosinia.  I do believe you'll change your mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats on 60 Dohrian :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not sure about Ayonae Ro's econmy, in TP Exe veil from trial cost like 1k only, which is somehow better(or equal actually) to Death Mask of the Elysians, so if u paied more than 1k, u probably got ripped.<br />
<br />
Well first I would like to grats you on 60, but I am surprised to hear you not excited about getting malo for free, perhaps u dont chat with other shm often.<br />
<br />
Since u didnt mention how much u wanna spend on upgrade, I estimated u dont really have much, I would say skull charm earring is good replacement; black sapphire velium necklace is good; spider fur belt is good, too.<br />
nothing else really need to upgrade until u got some major plat or guild given no drop gear, and while u at HoT, get a leggin u will be set without costing an arm and a leg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dohrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was JK, I read a lot of shamy forum, and I know fairly well what luck I had with Malo. Thanks for advices fellow shamy.<br />
<br />
BTW I paid 2k for my death mask of the Elysians...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well to REAL ULTIMITE POWAH !!!<br />
<br />
60 is still a huge level for a shaman , so gratz on your accomplishment. Good luck finding the spells, its a real challange but once you find them , its all worth it.</div></div><hr />
