<br />
I've recently returned to EQ after some time off and downloaded LDoN since I heard about all the great experience gain with it. Well after two adventures I am not happy with the experiance gained. Both times I only gained about two blue bubbles (8 percent) of experience. Is this normal for some of you or is it just me?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's about what I was getting as well.  The &quot;great experience gain&quot; was probably from the level 65s working on AA :)<br />
I do love my LDoN though.  I've always been a &quot;twitch&quot; action gamer, and FINALLY EQ has caught up to my need to run-n-gun :)<br />
Honestly, if you have a JBB and are willing to grab a C3 and temperance depending on gear, Katta guards will go just about as fast exp wise.  Cash will be a little better since it's all solo and you're not having to split.  The drops suck though.  Nothing good, all vendor loot. Got me to 59 though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The XP is much different depending on whether you are the lowest member of your group or the highest memeber. I went through a couple times at 56 with a 63 cleric. The AA XP was great, half an AA for just one mission. Running full XP would still have been nice for the amount of time spent. The usual group I go through with are all lower level than myself, sometimes several levels lower. I am on full XP now, and typically get about a half yellow for every 2 missions. It also depends on how quick you get your missions done, and if you stay the extra half hour or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I group with players of a very similar level, I get about half a gold per adventure.  Its not great XP but its enjoyable XP and I find that to be the more important.  (I get tired of sitting in a camp and pulling the same mob over and over again.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Quiinn.  Logging on for an hour and a half of nonstop crawling for my nightly EQ entertainment is just about the only thing that'll get me into the game anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thRover hit it on the head. If your lvl 56 and say ur at the top of the group and the lowest in your group is lvl 50 ... your exp will suck. at 56 i would try to get two 60s in your group and the exp will be awesome... if your group has very high dps, a cleric that can keep up, a puller who knows his stuff, and a good parker... give hard a chance. I have gotten whole AAs on hard.<br />
<br />
Really pick up groups can work but generally you have to put it together yourself for the great exp.<br />
<br />
That being said outside of PoP... LDoN is the closest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went through an ldon with my ranger 58 and the next lowest in group at 61, everyone else was 63-65. Got 12% xp in like 45 minutes. DId another adventure with same crew on hard and we didn't win, and i only got 12% in an hour and a half. I took the same ranger in last night where I was the only 60 and everyone else was 54-59. Got 18% in an hour and a half. when my ranger was 59 however took him on one with a bunch of lower levels and only got like 7% in an hour and a half(they wanted to stay for bonus time since the xp was&quot;so damn good&quot;. Also did an adventure at 60 where I was middle of the pack and got 19% in like an hour. So basically ya wanna be the lowest level to get te best xp, unless everyone is 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do people actually still look at their exp bar ... man sounds like this game is so boring for ya.<br />
<br />
If you recently returned .. dont you remember how bad the exp was before?<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is any exp is good exp as long as its fun getting the exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>pewter22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well i found that if you stray more than a couple levels difference in the group,the exps start to really suck in ldon. the nice thing is they have kinda put the fun back in lvling imho</div></div><hr />

One thing I love about LDoN vs. PoP grouping.  There is none of this random &quot;I have to go, my blah blah needs me! kk.. thx for grp.&quot; or AFK for 5 hours crap.  Then you have to sit there and wait for a replacement.  <br />
<br />
In LDON, everyone zones in and tries to go thru it as fast as possible.  A good group is just like a well oiled machine, slicing and dicing thru mobs to get the job done.<br />
<br />
The exp in PoP is still better once you have a good group going, but the fun factor for LDoN is alot better.  <br />
<br />
In PoP</div></div><hr />

Amen.<br />
<br />
I still love LDoN after 60+ completed adventures for many reasons, and the fact that everybody is committed to attempting to be a good group for 1-2 hours is one of those reasons.<br />
<br />
I've had great success with LDoN (only 4 or 5 fails out of 61+ adventures and one of those was due to server crash) and nearly all of my LDoN runs are from pickup groups.  Of course, I like to think it's because the *cough* shammy *cough* me *cough* makes sure everyone knows the attack plan, knows their role, is a great MLer, buffs people into submission, slows everything we fight, and fills in all over the place with all my groovy shammy spells.<br />
<br />
La di da...<br />
<br />
Anyways...I'm still getting nice xps, loot, meeting cool people, and most of all having fun from LDoN.  The xp in LDoN is slowing a bit but the fun is not (and more adventures per level equals more loot and adventure points per level).<br />
 <br />
I'm only 51 and I've only visited PoN a few times but I've already had several occasions where someone would join the group and bail out after a short time for some lame reason.  In my experience it's not always easy to get a non-LDoN group going and when people flake it's really annoying.<br />
<br />
One time the a cleric joined (our strong group of semi-regulars, we group up when we can) to replace our regular cleric, kept doing camp check /oocs, dinged 50 after about 20 minutes, and promptly left to &quot;join a guild raid to start his epic.&quot;  Why on earth would he join a PoN group for his last sliver of xp instead of having his guild get it for him if they were about to do epic stuff is beyond me - but of course idiot cleric was back in PoN about half an hour later spamming /ooc camp checks every 5 minutes about half an hour later - I guess killing red cons for 1+% per kill wasn't good enough for his uber self.  Everybody in the group was hazing him when he left the group for not giving notice and ding-and-run and we all blacklisted his lame arse.<br />
<br />
Pickup groups work great for LDoN where you're locked in...but I think I'll stick to grouping with friends outside of LDoN.  :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have seen both the highest guy in group and lowest guy in group exp, u want to be the lowest guy in the group for sure.  My level 57 mage is doing some LDoN for focus item for pets summoning he has done 4 group pickup groups outside the guild.  One i was low man at 57 and i recieve 14% and 16% on 2 missions for about 3 hrs work getting missions to finishing up.  The  second group i was high man at 57 with lowest being 50.  I got 6% and 7% with that taking well over 4 hours from start to finish.    I can live with 30% for 3 hours but 13% for 4 hours just sucks.  i can make 10% per hour solo easy.  My thinking is the first dungeons were level 60 and the later were 50 or 55.  SO a word of advice stay real close to levels in a group or be the low man.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jumgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Would agree with most of the other posts that you don't want to be high man on the totem pole. Also, and this just might be me, but it seems that the EXP is better on collections, rescues, and assassinations than it is on mass kill missions.<br />
<br />
Either way I like the LDoN expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My understanding was the the xp division in a group is based on levels...so if you are the high man you should be getting a larger share.  Then it would be more a factor of the adventure difficulty based on the average group level and the only way your xp would be significantly better or worse would be if you're outside the average group level range for the adventure difficulty.  If that made any sense...  So if you're high 50's and everyone else is low 50's then yes, your xp is not gonna be great while if you're low 50's and everyone else is high 50's you'll get awesome xp.  But, if the group is a tight range like 51-54 and you're at either end of that range you probably wouldn't notice any change in xp.<br />
<br />
In my experience this is how it seems to be working but maybe I'm just not paying attention that much since the only time I really watch my bar that closely is when I'm close to advancing.  If I do watch my bar closely it's depressing regardless of the quality of xp lately.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You all need to find life beyond the exp bar ... your making this game so one sided ... Join a guild and do something that has nothing to do with exp .. adventure in LDoN or other places you have never been.  No amount of watching your bar will make it move faster .. all these percentages are so pointless .. with racial/class/zone/AA modifiers no one will get the same exp from the same encounter .. It's amazing how much fun this game is once you over come the exp fixation.<br />
<br />
As the Nike people say JUST DO IT!</div></div><hr />

While I somewhat agree with you on this, it is much easier for someone such as yourself who already has a character at lvl 65 to say it. Those of us who don't may not hold the same view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Get 65 and life will be good =)  No more spazing about weither ya got 15% vs 16% because I was the lowest toon in the group ... When ys get 65 its such a sigh of relief .. <br />
<br />
Have fun .. play hard .. JUST DO IT!</div></div><hr />
