We sent in a designated toon to set off the nasty AE, well I guess I was sitting to close, I take 1900 or so damage and poor doggy poofs.  I just thought to myself HAHAHA thanks SoE!</div></div><hr />

The funniest thing about our sad dogdog is that it contributes about 1/2 of my DPS in a fight...that is really sad.</div></div><hr />

Actually what is sadder is that our DPS is so low. I think it goes without saying that Shaman are on the lower half of the totem pole DPS wise, and when 50% (I take you at your word) comes from our pet, yet we are not a &quot;pet class,&quot; then something is not right.</div></div><hr />

... ive seen shamans do out 170 DPS not including dots... i've parsed beastlords around 10 dps. (no joke).<br />
<br />
<br />
I havent seen my pet randomly disappear... but it doesnt take much to have that happen with how weak it is :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Problem with our DPS isnt raids, its grouping situations. We need DPS thats quick to apply. Stacking dots and nuking takes time.<br />
<br />
That is ofcourse if we would be a dps class, are we?</div></div><hr />

hmm I like you dont have rangers or rogues in your parsing, im pretty sure they both can do alot more dps then a war and a shaman.<br />
You can always find a parsing that 'fits' you needs and how you want it.<br />
<br />
But I do think shamans can have pretty high DPS, if they want.<br />
We did Time yesterday and I dotted (bane, BoS, PoX, BoN) from start to end, and with crits and foci I did easy 1.5K or tick, and that was a dps i could keep up, without going oom.<br />
So if you really want you can be high on the DPS list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know when i started this thread, Dps was never a concern of mine, just thought it was sad puppy couldnt take a under 2k AE, but yes we can do DPS, although i rarely get to see it, because i am usually always Slowing/Healing/Curing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When you pet dies just bring up a new one, and put it on TZ/VZ the AEs or not to bad once the first one is over with. if you keep TZ/VZ in a corner dogdog is pretty ok, i normally get pet toys and buff it with haste, 9 and fos. works like a charm :)</div></div><hr />

I diddnt mean to mislead you Adonnisninaste, it wasnt about poofing it was about puppy not being able to do anything because he died to one AE that was near canni 5 dmg, because i was in the wrong place with a unbuffed pet, I just thought it was silly was all.<br />
<br />
    But then again title was poor dogdog so take it how you will  ;)</div></div><hr />

I would absolutely *love* to see a log that shows a Shaman doing 170 DPS *without* DoT's.<br />
<br />
Enlighten me ?</div></div><hr />

Oh, just have a buffed, mage-equipped pet in some low AC MOB's back and chainnuke without resists and get a couple of crits.<br />
<br />
Of course if you are talking reliable aggroless damage on a boss that has an AE it does get a little tougher. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious, is that just shaman dps, and not dps including dogdog?  <br />
<br />
The reason why I ask is because in raids, there is no way you can associate pet names with owners (unless it's BST pet... soandso's warder).  For example, how would you know if Jabatik or Gonner was a shaman pet or mage pet, or if it belonged to shaman_01, shaman_02, etc, etc.  Maybe you've written down the pet names, I don't know, and that's why I had to ask.<br />
<br />
Parsing DPS for others can be erroneous, simply because some players can be too far away from you to capture and log the damage done in fights.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm a little curious too.  Even if dogdog is doing max, that is about 30dps.  That leaves 140dps for us to do.  Assuming you were not doing any debuffs/slows and just chain casting nukes..is this even possible?  I'll have to do the math, but this certainly isn't something you can sustain without dots.<br />
<br />
If you are doing the cold based nuke,  Alla has it at about 89dps.  You can add in ID and casting haste..but I don't think you are going to get 50 more DPS out of it.  If you have max casting fury..not sure, maybe another 10% or so?  Still not sure if possible.<br />
<br />
If you are doing the rain..maybe possible with 0 resists...<br />
<br />
The poison nuke is about 100dps from Alla..still not sure.  <br />
<br />
I'm just curious how a shaman got 170dps without any DoT's. cause I'll be giving it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep.<br />
<br />
Agree.<br />
<br />
Dogs can't be parsed because ownership can't be established.  Still waiting to hear an explanation of how this might be possible without DoT's, because I could sure get a lot more groups if I could do 170 DPS and still have my pet and DoT's to add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">SM2 is great for farming and raids. Prep puppy, give him all the toys and buffs and stuff him in your moldy virtual backpack until it's safe to bring him out :) It's funny when you forget about Scooby who you gave a muzzle and two ixi fists to and something goes horribly wrong and you suddenly think oh yea, he's been in this backpack all along and you whip out a snarling 3khp, 70% hasted, dual wielding rusty paw dog who saves the day.<br />

Argh, the withdrawl symptons are hitting me hard now. I knew I should have stayed away from this board lol.</div></div><hr />
