<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Bears-<br />
<br />
After a fruitless Search, I'd like to draw on the assembled wisdom and memory of the Shaman community.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall rumors of an indoor SoW spell comming in LDoN.<br />
<br />
As I'm 51 and currently going 100% AA to get Run3 (seems like a good idea with a dungeon expanion comming) unless I'm going to get it as a spell in the expansion (assuming it isn't some 60+ spell thats going to go for 100k)<br />
<br />
Anybody know what the deal is?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

The name cracks me up hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great thanks!<br />
<br />
Back to 100% reg exp then.<br />
<br />
Love this board.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Apparently there will be indoor SOW spells. Pretty nifty for the lower levels. Don't know how it compares with RS3 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">from what i've heard from some people, shrew is slower than run 3, or about the same, don't exactally remember, regardess i'd still pound out run 3, as it is awsome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive neard the same as Bamce.  Percentage slower than run3, but still sufficient to get you away from most mobs chasing you.<br />
<br />
However, I am still going to strongly recommend getting R3.  The great thing about R3 is that its ALWAYS there.  What happens when you get a terrible pull, the cleric and tank goes down, the CC cant get a hold of the situation, and you make the decision to run, only to have your Shrew or Mongoose spell drop 2 steps into your flight?  Dead shaman, thats what.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you are going to need those 3 points into general AA's (and 3 more) to get into archtype AA's for Canni 5 and all the other good abilities. <br />
<br />
When I hit 51 I did 100% AA to get R1, then went 70/30 reg/aa to get the other 2 points (with a few nights of 100% just to top off close points)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Those are spells players will be getting LONG before they can even think about buying Run Speed. Run Speed 3 will still be an upgrade for people when they reach their 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I timer all my spells either in game or out of game .. if my buffs are failing 5 seconds into a fight then I'm being a poor shaman by not halting my group for the 10 seconds it takes to rebuff the slot in question and send them back on my way .. no different with shrew/mongoose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmm...tough choice as I have insta-SoW booties hotkeyed...but safety first I guess...I'll tough out 3 AAs to get R3.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

People with your amazing degree of ignorance and complete and utter lack of tact make me cry at night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gafasiycarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Acctually Spirit of Wolf adds 10 atk and 1 hp/regen a tick</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, you managed to outdo yourself as I was staring in awe at your last idiotic comment trying to think of a reply. Congrats?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

Acctually if I was stupid I wouldn't have a cool name unlike your gay name, your name makes Richard Simmons mother proud of her sons obvious love for women</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">thats spirit of teh billy <br />
<br />
Billy doesn't have regen<br />
<br />
These spells are for people without Run3 so they can have run speed indoors i beleive they are apart of Ldon which is all indoors hehe<br />
<br />
Run3 if prolly the first aa to get and a must have even with sow booties</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Acctually if I was stupid I wouldn't have a cool name unlike your gay name, your name makes Richard Simmons mother proud of her sons obvious love for women<br />
<br />
This from the guy whose name is &quot;Bracy is a fag&quot; backwards...<br />
<br />
Sounds like you have some serious repression issues going on there, as well as the ability to display your (remarkable) ignorance of the game for all to see. <br />
<br />
You must be so proud. Well done.<br />
<br />
Nagafen, the hardest mob in the game...  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Okaaaay,<br />
<br />
With regard to my SoW boots comments, it was badly worded, even a level 51 n00b (Lars birthday is March 2000, shoot me I'm really a casual player) knows SoW don't work indoors, bud.  I was speaking to the general drop-of-run-speed issue.  Poor wording on my part.<br />
<br />
Agreed run3 is the way to go and the good 'ole CoM is getting my n00b ass AA quite nicely.<br />
<br />
Please leave Bracy alone, he really has enough problems already, the SK boards are even making fun of him.<br />
<br />
