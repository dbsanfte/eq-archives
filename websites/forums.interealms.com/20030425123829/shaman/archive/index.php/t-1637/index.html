<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zcul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you realize the amount of different <br />
combinations that are possible from<br />
the existing herbs alone?<br />
<br />
Add that with the number of different<br />
components, dropped, sold and made <br />
from other tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Add that with other stuff dropped and <br />
sold and made and whatever.<br />
<br />
<br />
And now, grab your alchemy potion bag,<br />
about 1000000 pp, and make sure that<br />
you have a surgeon nearby to fix your <br />
carpatial tunnel syndrom regularly.<br />
<br />
:mad: <br />
<br />
Due to the nature of alchemy being experimental,<br />
we would like one class of our server never to<br />
even muster up the amount of energy it takes<br />
to try about 10000 different combinations, log it<br />
in a messageboard and then retry the combinations<br />
everytime there is a patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
:mad: <br />
<br />
I'm so angry about this. Why can't they just<br />
publish the recipies at least or make some kind<br />
of HINTS towards the right combinations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fortunately, you don't lose herbs if they don't combine anymore.<br />
<br />
I've personally done all the pre-Luclin two herb combos out there.  I found nothing new.  I wasn't about to try the three herb combos, since that was a LOT more to try.<br />
<br />
I don't believe it's worth pursuing any further until we know that Verant is going to do something about alchemy as a whole, since it really needs a serious revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zcul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lately, everything seem to be needing a serious revamp.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone did try all of the new Luclin 3-herb combos, and found nothing new.  I suspect that there's been a lot more testing than you realize...but there's just nothing new to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With the ability to read the SPDAT file,  it really helps when looking for alchemy recipes.  I know not everyone does this but it saves a whole bunch of time.  The &quot;effects&quot; for the spiritstones and prayer idols were found before one stone was actually made. The Luclin potion effects were discovered the same way.  Then everyone found out it took an arm and leg to make them.<br />
<br />
I personally believe that SPDAT reading wouldn't be as bad as it is today (its really cheating) if they actually gave more clues or actual recipes that weren't so dam ambiguious.  Spells should probably be more defined too.  I mean, as an iksar, if had the ability to use a 1 regen tick potion but didnt know the effects - I wouldn't be able to tell what it did really.  Alot of the spells are this way, granted the game is so freakin old now that nothing is a mystery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are still some mysteries. And reading the spdat won't tell you everything. Also, there could be potions not discovered that have an already used spell.<br />
<br />
Remember when the original alchemy revamp came out the shamans all banded together and tried out thousands of different combinations. And lost all their money in the process.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, people don't think there will be anything good to find because most alchemy products are disappointing at best. Also, the game's old now, so people don't experiment so much.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's a couple of the remaining mysteries of alchemy:<br />
<br />
What are elf leaf and larkspur for?<br />
Is there a missing potion between skill ~120 and ~140?<br />
Why were the first alchemy herbs reintroduced in Shar Vahl?<br />
How do i get my money back? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol, REFUND REFUND REFUND!<br />
<br />
<br />
Your absolutely right, if a potion did use a spell already in the game, it wouldn't be so obvious.  If I remember correctly, the possibility equation for our alchemy combinations is crazy.<br />
<br />
(number of total herbs)^(Slots in Alchemy Bag) = ??? OMG<br />
<br />
Equation above would not be entirely accurate since none of the known recipes require more than 1 of the same herb - but then again it could be very possible.<br />
<br />
Good luck for anyone attempting to do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, the number of possible combos for a given number of herbs used is:<br />
<br />
(Number of Herb types)!/((Number of herb types - number of herbs used)! * (number of herbs used)!)<br />
<br />
That assumes that no herb is used more than once.<br />
<br />
Either way, you are going to end up with enough combos to make a sane person decide to skip trying everything.<br />
<br />
If herbs can be used more than once in a given recipie it would be:<br />
(Herb types)^(Herbs used)/(Herbs used)!</div></div><hr />
