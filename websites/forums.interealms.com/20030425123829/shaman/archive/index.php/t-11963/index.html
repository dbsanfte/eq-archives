<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New to the end game, but am sick of having to wait for the mana regen to inch up to be able to cannidance, and the sit agro is getting pretty significant too.  My question is what are the pros and cons of each beast?<br />
<br />
I noticed that the tan/brown horse is cheaper than the white/black horse and all lizards, which are all the same price.  If there is no significant difference, I would just as soon save the 1050 plat and buy something else.<br />
<br />
Any opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I vote for horse<br />
if you dont care about color, 1k cheaper.<br />
you see the head and dont on lizard, but since your a shaman you can shrink and it wont matter.<br />
i think lizards are a bit slower, they also bounce instead of run. it gets annoying and gives you a headache after a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But the bouncing of the leezord is worth it, if you look at it in third person view. OMG is it funny! I look like a whacked out rodeo rider. My arms stay down by my sides and my back stays stiff as a board, all while my leezord bucks like a ticked off bull. It's so hilarious, that it's worth the choppy motion. :D Of course, I bought the cheap one, so I click it off when I have to move quickly. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They are basically the exact same functionality with different models and animations. So if the bumping up and down bugs you, you might not like Drogs. For me it was a VERY easy choice. I have had a horse for months and I two box with my monk all the time. After clicking on my horses head for the thousandth time even double shrunk trying to loot a mob on the ground or targeting a mob, I sold back the horse and got a drog as fast as I could. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to select a mob out of a group to slow and continually getting &quot;Stelmachs mount considers you amiably&quot;. Arrggh I wanted to scream, and since I was playing the monk at the same time I didn't have a great deal of time to completely ignore what he was doing to try to turn sideways and look down to be able to finally get a target and not my horse. For that simple functionality difference the drog was much better. I have clicked on him on accident once in all the time I have had him. Its much nicer when people ask for buffs that aren't grouped with you, you know the inevitable time you lingered too long near the Nexus portal stone in PoK and there are now five people asking for buffs and you keep clicking your horses head and trying to slew about to target them. I just want to rebuff and med, not have to re shrink every time I zone just to target. Just my opinion though, everyone is different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zupe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With a lizard the head doesn't get in the way of your view, you can also loot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chiyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">use the external views to get around the &quot;horses head&quot; issue and save yourself 1000p ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buffcake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had the 8k-ish horse &amp; lucked out on a rune turn-in (got a duplicate Focus of the Seventh).  Less than an hour later, my Bazaar mule had 120k.  I bought the 103k Lizard &amp; LOVE it.  I love that the head is not in the way for one, but more importantly, I like the way the lizard turns when standing: not the huge amount of wobble that my horse had.  My 2cp?  Lizard &gt; Horse</div></div><hr />
