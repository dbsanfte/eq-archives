<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am asking if the community as a whole will tune into Farscape tonight on the Sci Fi channel at 8pm or midnight. Doesn't matter if you watch it, tape it, or play it in the background, the Sci Fi channel has cancelled Farscape and the fans are hoping if we get enough Nielson ratings that they will reconsider.<br />
<br />
Farscape is on the Sci Fi channel at 8pm or Midnight.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've watched Farscape for 4 years, and will watch it tonight as always. It is the best SF on television at the present, and in fact has been the best since about half-way through its first season--it was putting anything the ST gristmill was cranking out to shame, and even better than X-Files was the last 2 seasons of that show (which should have been let die sooner).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately (and not to be a downer here) but I've never seen ANY of these sort of &quot;please watch&quot; drives work. The closest they've ever come was with Babylon 5, and that only saved about a half-dozen episodes as it turned out.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: the SciFi channel paid a ****load of money to Steven Spielberg for his &quot;Taken&quot; crap, and they had to cut costs someplace else. Farscape was the chosen lamb. Why it wasn't Stargate (a much inferior show), I can't imagine, but apparently that show has more fans. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought Taken was pretty good, but I also had Tivo at the time and could fast forward past the 5 minutes of show, 2 minute of ads routine.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm not a Farscape fan (sorry guys, personal preferences there).  Hope your show isn't cancelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drizan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FRELL YOU SCI-FI Channel!<br />
<br />
Oh wait I kinda gave myself away didn't I?<br />
<br />
Save Farscape (http://www.savefarscape.com/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok fine, you want Farscape to live(not a fan here) but why do you have to mock Stargate, IMO that far exceeds Farscape as a SCI-FI show, i'll admitt its wrong of them to chop Micheal Shanks and bring in Corin Nemic (can't act) but hes coming back in the next series. Also theres going to be a new Stargate film and a spin of Stargate series. (The spin off will be set in the era that the SG-1 team went to when they were taken to the 1960's via stargate cuz of sun flares then got jolted into the future where the spin off is set).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to watch it a while ago.  But now I got free cable and I dont want to complain about not gettin gthe Sci-Fi channel since that would be admitting that I dont pay for it :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ps<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me a synopsis of the show since the one of the two Critons died?  I do like the show just havent seen it in a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am curious as to exactly how the Neilsen system works.  I had always heard it was a very small group of people who were sampled.  So I did a little research.<br />
<br />
http://www.howstuffworks.com/question433.htm <br />
<br />
Is this to mean that for the Farscape campaign to work some of the members of the Crucible communtity need to be some of the 5,000 peeps with black boxes in their home?  Any experts out there want to shed some light on the television ratings process?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Edit: Double post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, 6 people with nielsen boxes would bring up the raitings high<br />
enough to bring Farscape into the next bracket for advertising. <br />
<br />
In any case, I hope another network picks it up. UPN looks<br />
promising, as well as their parent company Viacom (who's <br />
looking to either buy sci-fi, or start a new science fiction channel). <br />
<br />
If you want a primer, check out &quot;watchfarscape.com&quot; &amp; click on<br />
the &quot;campaign&quot; link. I think there's a sticky thread with info<br />
on primers, or you can just post asking where to find it. <br />
<br />
Best damn show I've ever seen, and the only one that I've<br />
gone and bought (season 1 boxed set). <br />
<br />
Fans of several shows have campaigned and won one more<br />
season. Roswell, Cagney and Lacey, the original Star Trek, um,<br />
and some others. <br />
<br />
The real shame is that sci-fi promissed to fund seasons 4&amp;5,<br />
then pulled out at the end of season 4 filming. Pretty shady.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wasn't a big fan of Stargate either until I watched a few episodes. It wasn't bad and it was entertaining, so I try not to dog it too much. But they funded Tremors: The Series. That is such a load of horse manure if there was one. I mean, come on. Let the father from Family Ties die and move on.<br />
<br />
Taken held my interest for the first week but after that I really didn't care. IMO anything Spielberg puts out now a days isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
The Save Farscape campaign has worked imo. The fans are very loyal and have done alot (including making their own commercial).<br />
<br />
The Tracker show lost my interest in the first 15 min. But I have to be fair and say I wasn't really watching. So I wil give it another chance.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just hope Sci FI pulls its collective head out of its a$$ and decides to take on Farscape again. Such a good show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">farscape........ I will never watch that again for the life of me.  Sorry not a fan here. I will tell my little brother to watch it to help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stargate &gt; Farscape , you lost my support with that comment , just wanted to come back and let ya know ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not trying to intentionally hijack this thread, but I just keep seeing people say &quot;Farscape....it's the best show I've ever seen&quot;, or variations there of.<br />
<br />
While it's ok, I have to ask...did we all forget &quot;Babylon 5&quot; so quickly? The spin off was campy and short lived (because JMS got tired of network interference and script rewrites to suit their purpose), but B5 was hands down the absolute best show I've ever seen. The entire story was written before they ever began filming. It was never intended to go past 5 seasons. A solid beginning, middle, and ending to a very solid show.<br />
<br />
Nothing even comes close these days....not even Farscape or SG-1.</div></div><hr />

Well SG-1 in the series pervious to the current one, but it'll get better when Daniel Jackson is back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bab5 was great too, I espically loved that they did a couple of<br />
tv-movies. If Farscape had the kind of promotion that (TBS?)<br />
was given Bab5, Farscape wouldn't have been canceled.<br />
<br />
I've enjoyed Stargate too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">B5 was indeed the best ever Sci Fi show. Trying to keep it didnt work so guess youre on a losing battle with Farscape also.</div></div><hr />
