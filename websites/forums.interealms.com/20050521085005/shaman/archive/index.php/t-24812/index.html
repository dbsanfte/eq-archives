<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">His name is Pext or Pixt or something like that.  Anyhow, here's how it went. <br />
<br />
Group consisted of ranger, necro, BST, druid and myself.  We were just XP'n along the walkway just across the first bridge from zone in from DS.  BAM, this dude pops.  Ranger goes down fairly quickly, as we were not ready for the fight.  BST followed shortly afterwards.  Necro FD's, druid and I make for the zone line.  While running, and just before zoning, I stop to take a look.  The namer is following, but with no train.  I decide, what the heck, I'll try to root it.  I do, it lands, I zone.<br />
<br />
Upon landing, I quickly zone back in to find it un-molested by passer's-by.  I debuff/slow it, toss a Q on myself, and get to work.  During this, the druid was zoning back in, necro was rezzing.  Between druid heals, and Q'n myself, I managed to straight up tank the mob down to 20%.  I finally ate the dirt just as I saw the necro and ranger running up.  I guess he runs at 15% health, or near it.  Ranger TS's, necro and druid blast it. It dies.  Necro rezzes me, we loot rune + gear item.  <br />
<br />
All in all, was a fun fight.  I plan on trying again with only myself and a druid this time.  $$$ says It can be duo'd.  I am not &quot;uber&quot; geared, but have some decent stuff.  This should be an easy mob for a /bazaar geared shaman to trio or group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Judging by where you're describing, that sounds like Pixt Trent.  He's definitely duo/trio'able, and definitely soloable if properly geared, skilled, and such.  There is another Pixt guy more towards WoS I believe and he's the same difficulty, as are most of the &quot;mini-named&quot; (Ridgerunners, etc.) in NC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am mainly VT/EP geared.  I solo often.  The main problem with this guy, was I had never seen him before, and wasn't ready for everything he had to &quot; offer &quot; me. :p   Next time I go, I will attempt a solo run at him, and post the results, along with how I took her down.  <br />
<br />
Now, onto a question.  I located the named murk, who spawns at the last murk before the WoS zone line, down in the trench.  Murkglider Schooleader I think it is.  Well, I saw a bunch of murk pup's, who are said to spawn when the namer is at around 40-50% health.  My question(s) is/are:<br />
<br />
1.  Does the namer roam?<br />
2.  Do the pup's follow if she roams?<br />
3.  Do the pup's despawn after X amount of time from the namer getting downed?<br />
<br />
I ask, because I was at the spawn point, with 2 trash murk's, and a handful of pup's, but no namer.  <br />
<br />
I am gathering as much info on these named mobs as possible, and will post it here.  Tactic's and such that I used, for examples for others.  These, to me, seem to be the only viable/effecient area's where a moderately geared/AA'd shaman can solo for runes and decent gear.  There are some mobs in Harbinger's spire to solo, but in my opinion, is too risky for the reward.  If you want a straight up challenge, without having to worry much about you mob bringing friends to the fight, then Nobles Causeway is your best bet.  <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is not the Murkglider Schoolleader that spawns by WoS zone. It is the fecund murkglider, and I think I have also seen an aggressive murkglider in that area.<br />
The school leader spawn further inside the zone in some cave.<br />
<br />
The fecund murkglider does spawn the pups. I have never seen it roam. Don't know whether the pups despawn - when I see them, I usually kill them to get the area cleaned up again.<br />

I don't know the exact location, but it's really simple to get to.  Move into NC from DS, and when you come to the first bridge on the left, take it.  Just after the bridge, set up shop.  Now, you are looking for a roaming Kyv.  Pext Trident can spawn anywhere along that ledge you will be on between the bridge you crossed, and another bridge just a little ways past your camp.  Be sure to do a /time check after you down the PH so you know when to expect 1) another PH, or 2) Pext Trident.  <br />
<br />
Him having the element of surprise is not good.  After clearing the 2 static spawns just past the first bridge, and 2 just on the other side of the camp, I sit and wait for the PH to path by.  Down the Kyv, and move yourself up on the hill a bit.  Med/rebuff/read a book, whatever.  Wait for static's to respawn.  Clear them again, and get set for a possible namer encounter.  If the zones not full of people, you don't have to worry about pulling him to you before someone ganks him.  Just sit and wait a minute or two, and he'll path right to you. <br />
<br />
I believe I landed slow right away, without debuff.  What I did, was this.  I Q'd dogdog, sent him in.  Then I cast epic, Breath of Ultor, Pox of Bertox...then I got summoned.  Keep Q on yourself at all times.  Depending on your gear/AA's, you may need to spam an occasional Tnarg's Mending.  If you have Bane, cast it too.  Hold off on your Spirit Call ability until the mob is around 20% life or so.  This is to help ensure when he thinks about running, and for some reason your root isn't on em,you can close out the fight in a timely manner.  Any DPS is good DPS.  <br />
<br />
At this point in the fight, you've got great aggro goin on, and your DoT's are doin the work.  All you need to worry about is keeping the Q's rollin, and the Bane refreshed.  Good luck, and post how it goes for ya!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">General technique for all the nameds in NC for me is:<br />
<br />
Pull with mali decay, VP the mob. Hit it with Malos and slow and spam back off on pet incase its a caster. get mana back, Epic, Wunshi, Bane. Trushar myself. By this point i'm normally summoned, I hit the mob with a Blood of Yoppa then just keep myself alive and refresh   dots as needed.<br />
<br />
At 25-30% unleash spirit call and root named if its a runner. I find all dragorn nameds never break VP early, ukun packmaster does and the murkgliders about half way through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have found it better to use magic based root on ukuns in NC.  Even the packmaster can be rooted in place and debuffed before you start the damage( get summoned).  They rarely break paralizing earth after malos.  I suspect when dogs HP get upgraded we can let dog tank by keeping packmaster rooted and healing dog.  While I love VP, with GoD and OOW sony increased interest in game by making us learn the venerabilities and strength of different MOB classes.  For many of the mobs VP is super, but for others it needs disease buff to stick at all and will break early.  I like this, forces change of tactics from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's one named in NC that is pretty hard to solo; &quot;a Massive Bazu&quot;. Quads for 900ish and is only partially slowable, makes for a pretty fun challenge solo.<br />
<br />
PH is the bazus in the ridge past the packmaster in the southeast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wulf, how do you get around the snare proc thing on massive bazu? Even with Drog/levi on and strafe running I could not get out of melee range quick enough to summon kite effectively, and quad 900 (well hits for 5-600 on me regularly, but fast with odd hit in 8-900 range) is a bit rough on my 8khp/1600ish ac. I had to gate both times trying this guy, can kill all other named i have tried np (summoned, step back 2ft, cast, summoned, rinse repeat)<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

You will have to tank it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just tank it, spot heal when needed ofc. Keep BoT running at all times.<br />
<br />
I've done it maybe 4-5 times and it wasn't too hard really but I'm sure it would be trivial with spiritual serenity and the new oow spot heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hah, massive bazu sure was fun.  I engaged him expecting the standard'ish 650 with a gimp AE.  Of course once he started smacking me around for 882 and proc'ing that root or snare (I thought it was a root, others report snare, /shrug!), I was a bit surprised.  I lived, he died, but man it sure was one helluva fight.  Fun stuff.  :)</div></div><hr />
