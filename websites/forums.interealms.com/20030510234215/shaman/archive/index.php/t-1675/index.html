I'ma 55lvl iksar shaman and can always get like 3 of my good friends to come usally a 57 cleric a 60 necro and a 60 war, and i know i need more.

I'd recommend 2 groups for it, that harm touch proc can really tear through the tanks before he gets slowed. A lv60 to pull Venril, would most likely get at least 2 adds of the Arisen, keep those mezzed and drop Venril asap. There has been reports of the spirit of Rile despawning too soon, before you get to hand in your cudgel and the skull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take 2 groups or more.  It's a rough fight, especially if you can't get him slowed (not sure what level to do it reliably).  That proc goes off like mad (usually in triples, so 2400 damage at a time).  Keep an enchanter ready to tash him fast, and mez the 2 arisen that come with.  You probably want a rune before you pull, you'll eat a few harm touches on the way in.  We pulled to the secret hallway there and killed him.  I looted and ran off to handin the stuff before the arisen were still mezzed.</div></div><hr />
