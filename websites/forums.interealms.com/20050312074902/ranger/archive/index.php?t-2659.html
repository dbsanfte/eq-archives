If your guild can't get you a bow of doom they wont be able to get you this one either.  Doomshade is, well, kind of easy to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, it isn't as good as a Bow of Doom or a primal/priceless bow ratio-wise, but not everyone has a Sleeper's Tomb key, and not everyone is lucky enough to see a Bow of Doom drop off Doomshade.  Four DS kills here and zero bows.</div></div><hr />

True enough, our MA/SA warlords got the earrings.  Very good boost for them considering that they were using 21 and 26 percent haste items prior to that, respectively.</div></div><hr />

Dexterity is only a secondary stat in fletching, wisdom affects your skill-up rate more.  Success rate is only affected by skill level.</div></div><hr />

There is a thread here and a news story on castersrealm where Verant said it is the highes of either Wis, Int or Dex (For Fletching.  No such thing as a secondary stat for any tradeskill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hm, have I been out of the tradeskill community that long?<br />
<br />
It was not very long ago that WIS/INT was the primary stat for all tradeskills, DEX was a secondary stat for fletching and STR was a secondary stat for smithing.  This is direct from Verant and gospel on eqtraders.com, of course.<br />
<br />
Now they've done away with secondary stats entirely?  Anyone have this link handy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whichever is the highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Strength.<br />
<br />
What other skills have secondary skills like Smithing?<br />
<br />
Fletching runs off Dexterity, Jewelry runs off Dexterity, Tailoring will run off Dexterity soon.  Basically that means whichever is highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Dexterity will be the stat checked for chances to raise skill.<br />

Well, unless this drops off the new names I was seeing in ssra temple on track today and not one of the bosses (rhag1/2 don't count as bosses :P) if your guild can't get primal than it can't get this either. <br />
<br />
Can't get primal because a) no keys and b) Sleeper's awakened on our server, so the drop rate is now below abysmal and heavily contested.<br />
<br />
But thanks for asking. :-\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, without trying to sound too 'elite' here...  those of you lvl 40s and low 50s saying we're wrong to diss this bow?  Hello?  Can you even *get* this bow?  The reason we're upset is because there has been a distinct lack of good bows in the game for a long time now, since primal bow came out over a year ago.  The ranger community has been trying to lobby for an upgrade to primal for quite a while, and (very briefly) got it with Bow of Shadows, which was then promptly yanked.  This bow is nothing.  Some ok stats, but other than that its crap.  If we're going to get the shaft on melee weapons, we should at least be able to expect to see a new high end bow come into the game, whether it be off Creator, or Shei, or whoever.  Not some range item that just happens to have a ratio tossed in as a cursory gesture.<br />
<br />
Would really like to see something like the Bow of Shadows put back in the game, just on a raid level mob.  The Radir guy that was dropping it was one group difficulty, which is ridiculous for how uber that bow was.  In that sense I can see why they removed it, but should have put it back in game by now on some SoL boss mob...</div></div><hr />

Bull.<br />
a) if you can't get a Doomshade bow or Primal bow, you won't see this one.<br />
b) hi, if sleeper is awake, you still get primal. Yes it's work, but who says life is easy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andric d'Regor</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is silly. If you can get this bow you have access to better. Is it a good bow? hell yes. is it a ranger bow? na. By the time you get this any guild worth its salt would be doing its damndest to  equip its rangers with better. I would far prefer to see warriors rogues etc get this insead of doom/primal.<br />
<br />
The 'pass it to me' attitude is where the level restrictions are coming from. reality is that the only thing good about this are the stats and range - therefore a class that doesnt use bow seriously gets better mileage from this. Rangers would replace with better asap, this is near end of game for most others whom can use.<br />
<br />
Silly discussion. this is a range item first, bow second from at the point of the game where it is realisticaly attainable. ideal for pulling but not good enough for TS rangers. <br />
<br />
Big problem is lack of variety in real TS bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm happy for you all bow-wise but I don't really care much about bows.  I'd rather have them provide me with high end loot that isn't a bow.<br />
<br />
I didn't play for 3 years only to have them add aaxp and make it so that I am obligated to use archery and forego other loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerail</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what alot of people seem to misunderstand is that when we gripe about the war bow of rallos zek being sucky, or this bow being sucky...its not because it isn't a decent bow, its because considering what mob it drops off of...it just sucks compared to the other loot.  <br />
<br />
War Bow would OWN if it came off Vindi or Statue, this bow would simply rock if it were a drop off a rare spawn on the first floor of ssra that 1 or 2 groups could take out.  <br />
<br />
But when your guild goes and kills something like the avatar of war, or a tough mob in ssra and gets this *crap* instead of nice blades of carnage, or hate givers, or helms of truesight, or bone chillers, or ft6 shields etc etc, you get a little angry.  <br />
<br />
Hell my guild killed AOW and we got 2 bows, 1 ranger there didn't have primal, and I took the other bow in hopes they'd upgrade it (actually it was deffered to me by sharidann  =) and the bow has sat in my bags 90% of the time because primal is better.  When you kill something of that difficulty and half the loot is crap, you're going to get a bit upset.<br />
<br />
Now like i said if these bows dropped of easier stuff they would be excellent bows.  War bow would be great for a 55+ ranger who hasn't gotten into ST yet, and this bow would be great for a 50+ ranger whose guild hasnt killed statue yet, but when these are dropping off of high end raid mobs that take ~50 well equipped well trained people to kill, it makes them sucky and not worth while, and you'll see crap like this rotting.  Now if it dropped off easier mobs, then you wouldn't have lvl 50 rangers saying 'oh pass that here' you'd see them saying, yeah my guild killed that last night and i got this excellent pre primal bow. (which would be great)<br />
<br />
So before you complain about us complaining, try and get the proper perspective, if you and your guild works their butts off and you get loot that should be dropping off mobs that are 10x easier..you'll complain too<br />
<br />
p.s. excuse spelling errors</div></div><hr />

Edit:  this is appropriate RvR from the mob that drops this if you ask me.  This comes from Glyphed. Very nice graphic too.</div></div><hr />
