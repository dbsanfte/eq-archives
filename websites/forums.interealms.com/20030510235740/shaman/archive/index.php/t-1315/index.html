<br />
I am two drops away from getting my Shield of Bane Warding but having some trouble finding the Burning Priest up in SD.  My GL happened to have killed him and has the amulet but he's a war and won't be doing the quest.<br />
<br />
Can that part of the quest be MQ'd?  If he turns in the amulet and then I turn in the note from Spiritist Roleko, the black flame charcoal and the thought leech brain to Scribe Cholsa, will it work?<br />
<br />
I would love to hear from anyone with input... <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

If you have to combine stuff and it's no drop, obviously you have to have all the pieces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done the shield quest a few times now for myself and assisting friends.  Basically if you complete the Tormented Vashir skull camp (get all 8 skulls and box them) you can have up to 3 other people get the Brain, Amulet and Charcoal.<br />
<br />
The Brain is real simple, the amulet seems to be the sticker these days, the Burning Priest is a lot more rare then he used to be, probably to slow the shield's influx.<br />
