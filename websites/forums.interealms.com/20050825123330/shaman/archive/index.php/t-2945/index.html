<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have any info on this zone? <br />
<br />
I would like to start hunting here and maybe even start a little raid.  Looking for any info such as mobs, resists, etc...<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Bring a good group, not a pickup zone. <br />
<br />
Don't let the casters cast... AE poison rains for 350x3 hurt. 150+ PR still not resisting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My experience with resists and areas of the dungeon.  Without an enchanter, I usually stick to the maze, the pools/sewers, and the lower throne room area.  In these areas pulls tend to be a bit easier (level 53-55 mobs) that can be slowed and tank mezzed with Malo (no tash needed).  Once you want to crawl into 4c, Avatar Pyramid, or any place with the Brown lizards (57/58+ mobs), then you'll like to have an enchanter with you.<br />
<br />
The Brown clerics have a *HUGE* mana pool.  They don't seem to be bound by the 2 Complete Heal limit, and even with mana tapping they usually get off a CH or 2.<br />
<br />
Many of the shaman cast AOE slow, so have your clicky pants or your best cure disease memmed to get tanks back in it.<br />
<br />
The necros cast 3x350 or 3x550 poison rain depending on level.  The range is small so back casters away and let tanks engage Nuke these down.<br />
<br />
I do know that one group of 60's can go anywhere in the dungeon with a little skill short of the Ring of Slime event.<br />
<br />
I think a great introduction is to crawl the maze.  Most spawns are singles or pairs (although some rooms have 3 mobs).  There are many nameds that pop in there and the loot is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">warriors are weak in this zone.  better to have hybrids as tanks, sk's/bards/monks make a good melee choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nine out of 10 times I'd rather have an SK or pally tank in an exp group. If you don't need discs, ie you're not raiding or doing something like a one-group HoT, a well-equipped hybrid offers a lot.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as far as CT goes, it's not bring your own group on every server. On Fennin, it ranges from 12 to 40 people, and you can LFG with some success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mobs do not run, so snarer is not needed.  Very high level chanter is needed for Crowd control, as only the highest level mez spells work.  Everything summons.  Shamans are popular in there, because slow is key to success and the mobs can drop a slowing enchanter very fast.  Mostly 58+ in the zone for good reason.  <br />
<br />
Horses are awesome in there, pets are not.  Pets get roasted by the AoE poison pretty quick.  <br />
<br />
Try not to die at the spawn point of a see invis mob :).  Makes CR a pain.</div></div><hr />

I go with my regular grind group which includes a paladin. They rock with the chain stunning and such.  A warrior's taunt is at times overlooked by a target, but a paladin's stun is instant aggro.  When I do get resisted on turgur's and gain aggro, I usually only get attacked one round or so before my pally gains aggro back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well group situation is fine...definately soloable and amazing exp...dont try the casters though, stuff there seems to have VERY high attack ratings...so IMO AC doesnt play much of a role there...I dont have canna 5 yet..but id imagine the exp would be amazing if you would have less DT. Exp is still amazing there with a group, sewers are a great camp, have to cast malo a lot in CT..very resistant mobs from my experience...better as a grouping zone but is soloable if you know what your doing. Drop rates arent bad either...got a 33/36 2hb out of there and boots of slime, nice weapon to whack things with hehe =O</div></div><hr />
