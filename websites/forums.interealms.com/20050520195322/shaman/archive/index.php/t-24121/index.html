<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow Shamen,<br />
<br />
Anyone ever camp in Natimbi for the Talisman of the Spirirtseer?<br />
<br />
If so, how many mobs did you kill before it dropped?<br />
<br />
Ive been hunting off and on there for about a week and have killed roughly 400 various mobs and have yet to see it drop (nor have I seen the Shell Collar drop).<br />
<br />
Ive read/posted about ths topic at Allakhazam but Im curious to hear any responses here.  <br />
<br />
Reading other posts, some have seen it drop in 24 kills and some havent seen it drop after 1,000 kills.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have mostly hunted there since 49. I am 55 now. I have yet to see single Talisman of the Spiritseer drop. But I have seen four drops of the Shell Inlaid Collar. Two of these dropped while soloing so they were all mine.<br />
<br />
I finally gave up on the Talisman dropping about 52 and used the money from selling the first Shell Inlaid Collar plus some extra pp to purchase one in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its truly one of those &quot;random&quot; items. I am fairly sure it can drop off any mob in the zone. I farmed 20hp augs there while PLing some friends at Restless Souls, and in about 10ish hours total, I got 1 tali, 1 inlaid, and 3 20hp augs, plus assorted other garbage. No idea how many mobs we killed, I would just send my pet into the field behind me to kill anything it would attack constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am unfamiliar with the zone you speak of.  You did this solo or in group?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mostly soloing.<br />
<br />
Yes it can drop off any mob in the zone.<br />
<br />
Ive probably put in about 20 hours total in 10 days and like I said earlier, killed about 400 total.....roughly 20-30 kills per hour.<br />
<br />
Im level 65 with 25 aas.<br />
<br />
Thanks for replys,<br />
interesting</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea about how many mobs you killed?<br />
<br />
500? 1,000?<br />
<br />
I like this zone because its just as good as any to hunt in for me as blues give 2% exp and nothing aggroes in zone....and the 2 neckpieces are worth about 35-40,000 plat on Stromm.  I would wear the Talisman but sell the Collar.<br />
<br />
Granted, like every other item in this game, as more content is released (i.e. 105 hp/ Flowing thought 2/ Regen 2 all on the same droppable OoW items), 6 months from now I see these neckpieces dropping 10,000.<br />
<br />
Great idea though for SOE to implement random mob drop of these items...should do this in more zones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What do you hunt for the the augments?<br />
<br />
I have never seen them drop. I mostly hunt the turtles (not fierce), stonemites, and lobsters when solo. Pulled the named lobster the other night when duoing with a friend and just dropped a crappy ring. When in a group we pull just about everything near the camp...turtles, stonemites, fleshrippers, lobsters, restless souls, warfiends, darklurches, etc...and with a good group we pull even the named except Cragbeast Queen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The named soul, Tumia Lahlo, or something like that drops the 25hp aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not sure about how many I have killed. At 49 I was root rotting and took about 5mins. Once I hit 52 I decided to try using the pet and just tanking them with V.<br />
<br />
Now my melee skills are maxxed until 65 and they rarely drop me below 85% health once slowed and crippled. KEI and regrowth handle most of the rest. They take about 2min a pull to kill. <br />
<br />
As to how many...if I had to guess and it is just that a guess somewhere near a 1000. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahh...think I only killed her once in a pick up group. Don't think I am high enough to solo her yet.<br />
<br />
Love the zone though.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Yeah Im not high enough to solo her yet either.  She is immune to slow and hits hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah Im not high enough to solo her yet either.  She is immune to slow and hits hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
She is not immune to slow.  it may take a try or two, but she definately is slowable. <br />
<br />
I believe she might be immune to runspeed changes, but definately not to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the named Restless Suol who drops the +20 hp aug as the rare is slowable, and should be easily doable by any 65 shaman with half-decent gear. The key is to pull her out of the camp, to avoid re-pops, as the adds are what are more likely to kill you. Those restless souls are half light-blue to a 65 (all light blue to a 68, BTW) and are a great way to PL a paladin (or  any class, really). Actually, at 65, you could see slight movement in the AAXP bar, not a lot, but it moved. And the potential loot is decent. I got all the loots I mentioned there (although reflecting back, I think my 10 hour estimate was a bit low, probably closer to 20, with me, 55 Paladin and 57 Necro I was PLing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got my Talisman whilst doing the Kiki's Recipe Book quest for my alt dr00d. It dropped off one of those damn annoying, almost-invisible mites that added while I was killing mobs on the beach. Total time there ... 3 hours or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Balzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would estimate my time there at around 25 hours and I haven't seen either neck drop.  I grab the souls camp when it's open, but most of the time has been spent slaughtering anything that moves.  I'm not sure how many kills/hour I average, but I'm guessing 20-30.  <br />
<br />
As an aside, I have killed the named soul maybe 10 times and have had one hp aug drop.  <br />
