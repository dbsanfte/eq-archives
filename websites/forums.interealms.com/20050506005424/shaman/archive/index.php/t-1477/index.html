<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothakmithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I am close to finishing my epic and I have a little conundrum.  The Hole and Kirn apparently isn't a problem for me, my guild tells me that we can do it one group no problem.   What is a problem is that I don't have an Iksar Child tear, and an enchanter in my guild does.  I was wondering if the enchanter can hand in the tear and for me to loot whatever it is that Rak drops?  If that is the case all I'd need to do is get the ring from the Hole and go to CoM for Neh and Rak.  Thanks for any advice in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think the only way to properly mq the tear is the hander-in'er needs to have enough truespirit faction. something like, once the tear is handed in with the right faction, rak will respawn with the thingie. otherwise, i think he either eats the tear and doesn't aggro, or killing him wont get the correct drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gothakmithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doesn't that suck, I doubt the 60 enchanter in my guild wants to spend his time getting faction, ho hum. Anyone have an idea of how to go about getting faction for someone who isn't a shaman? And how much faction would be enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Truespirit faction is used for the SK and the wizard epic quests.<br />
<br />
How one goes about getting it when one is not a member of those classes is a bit of a toughie. The issue is that the starting point can only be done by members of those classes, and all following items require a certain level of faction, thus seemingly making it impossible. It ain't, though...<br />
<br />
...and a chanter would probably have a better time of it than anyone else.<br />
<br />
I know a cleric who used charm wands that drop off of golems in Fear to charm the wandering spirit and turn in woe and envy repeatedly until he had allied faction with Truespirit. Unfortunately, it was all for naught, as what he was hoping to do turned out to be undoable. Still, he did demonstrate that the faction is possible to get for the pathetically determined. :p</div></div><hr />
