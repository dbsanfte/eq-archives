<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I may soon have the chance to join a pickup raid to PoF and would like to get the tear from the Iksar child.  I believe it spawns from killing a specific golem there.  Having never been to PoF before, I would like to know if there is a specific place in the zone the golem spawns and any other info on bringing it down.<br />
<br />
Being guildless, this may be my only chance to acquire the tear.  Any advice/info would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are 3 Golems they are Mini-Bosses. So they arent going to be something your going to miss. They are on a 3day timer, so have a tracker let ya know if they are up. <br />
<br />
From there you need to Determine if this pickup raid can handle them. In my experience killing all 3 golems normally wields 2 Tears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">three golems in fixed spawn spots, Fright, Dread and Terror. they deathtouch but aren't too hard.<br />
<br />
Fright and Terror spawn the iksar broodling at the excact spot they die. the broodling is level 1, but you can be certain some idiot will kill it by accident. just make sure nobody loots the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Find a map of PoF, there's some around I don't remember the link anymore, but I've seen it here in Crusible too.<br />
<br />
Basically I suggest clear the zonein hill first, then clear to east and to south (all the way to wall) don't advance more to east when puller starts to eat golem DTs. Then move camp to yellow tower in south wall and clear wall and it's vicinity, pull first of the golems (I believe you can pull now eather Dread or Terror) mezzing adds and all focusing on golem kill, pull the other kill, then clear more towards north and pull Fright.<br />
<br />
Terror &amp; Fright give tear, Dread &amp; Terror DTs while Fright casts AoE cold if I recall correctly. When ready for golem pull, have someone (like tear receiving shamans :P ) go with puller to agro golem first for DT so puller is alive to make the actual pull. They ain't bad, just need to not waste time in downing them due to DT.<br />
I believe DT's have been report to be about 1min recycle, but they don't DT usually that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since it is going to be a pickup raid make it VERY clear that you are interested in the tear and talk to every other shaman in the raid to find out if they also need it.  Pickup raids are usually chaotic and I was &quot;missed&quot; for my tear twice on raid leader goofs before I joined my current guild.<br />
<br />
Gud luck on yer raid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pick up raids &lt;SHUTTERS&gt;<br />
<br />
It's just me personly but when I get a tell for a pick up raid. I run just has fast has my little sowed feet will carry me in the oppist direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the good advice and info.  Hope to have my tear soon  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, I steer clear of pick-up raids, too.<br />
<br />
I have to know at least 3 or 4 people fairly before I'll even consider it.  I often get tells from a guild doing a raid, and finding themselves a shaman short.  If it's just a shaman-less guild, I'll go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">usually a pickup raid will mainly have people from one guild hosting it. planes are so easy these days that you shouldn't really worry imo, unless nobody is above lvl 50 heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hiho,<br />
<br />
got myself the tear with a pickup raid. Not all are bad, and if you are in a guild which cannot do this on their own its best to join those constantly.<br />
Don't expect to get the tear on first attempt, most of the time more than 1 shaman is present and sometimes pickup raids fail on those golems and don't try again (what a shame).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah plus its tricky getting on raid the day the golems are up.  That was the hardest part for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yup, Fright and Terror will spawn the Iksar broodling. Dread does not.<br />
<br />
Fright and Dread are the ones who deathtouch. Terror casts AoE cold.<br />
<br />
I just went on another guild's Fear raid and was the second of two Shamans to loot a Child's Tear :D it was amazing</div></div><hr />
