&quot;Is it a good idea for SOE to provide a safe way for players to trade items and characters to one another in-game for real money?&quot; Answer choices include yes, no, and I don't care.<br />

Quite a bomb to drop, eh?<br />

That poll was so wrong on so many levels.  It takes a large step to move into this direction, but a much smaller one to sell your own game's items afterward.</div></div><hr />

As buggy as things are I can just see geting a credit card bill with $300 worth of wrong or bugged player-to-player cash transfers. As apathetic as the credit card companies have become about doing automated business I'd be afraid to have a credit card of mine tied into a system like this unwillingly. Or even worse how about the parents who pay for a kids account. I can see a scam artist talking a 10 year old into &quot;just go ahead and authorize this...&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can't belive they'd ever implement this.  I'd like to believe it's because they care too much about the integrity of their product.  But I can no longer make that statement.  I still, however, don't believe they'll do it, albeit for a less virtuous reason - server rollbacks.  <br />
<br />
Say I buy a pair of flayed barbarianskin leggings (sorry to all my shaman brothers from the north  :p ) for 100 RL dollars for my monk, and the server crashes 12 seconds after that.  They might roll us back to a state where I don't have the leggings.  SOE controls the state of EQ, but they couldn't roll back the charge to the credit card company.  <br />
<br />
Actually, I suppose they could try to log such before-and-after problems, and process credits to the credit card companies to compensate for rolled-back purchases.  But I can't imagine what a headache that would be.<br />

Egad - the sheer fact that we're discussing this is just depressing.<br />

<br />
Since the fact is that people are going to continue to do this RL money trading for in-game items/gear/accounts - let Sony regulate, IMO.<br />

I voted Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'll vote yes also.<br />
SoE themselves aren't selling the items/pp/characters.  The vote was about them being the middleman handling the transaction between the buyer and the seller; making it a safe transfaction.  All they are saying is they are condoning the sale of items/pp/characters for real life money from one player to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I say NO.  I don't think that SOE should get involved with RL money transactions for IG items.  They need every Rep point they can muster to keep this game going.  Personally, I would lose respect for SOE if they got involved with Yantis or even tried to put them out of business by selling the items themselves.  Thats just less people dedicated to getting this game fixed, and they need all the people they can get.<br />
<br />
This game is already filled with people that don't know how to play it at the higher levels.  I see no reason to encourage this.<br />

You're right, buying items and characters is pointless, which is why most people won't do it and worries of it becoming widespread are baseless.<br />

Would I ever buy something in EQ I very much doubt it...  but maybe Id sell something someday who knows, and Im way too suspicious a person to use yantis crap.  So I votes YES.  Id rather SoE moderated it, and the fact they earn more money, nothing wrong with that they are a business after all.</div></div><hr />

People already buy characters, items and plat. My point is, since it's ALREADY happening, take the power away from people like Yantis and his sweatshops.<br />
<br />
My preference would be for SOE to crack down on Yantis and Playerauctions and everyone who violates the EULA to buy/sell Everquest pixels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Incorrect. I feel most people HAVE bought plat or a account at some time in their EQ life. Therefore its not baseless. Most people i know have indulged in the dark side and it is already widespread. I think SoE should not get involved in this practice cause it will kill whats left of this game. SoE needs to start activly persuing people that buy and sell things in this game and make it a huge pain in the ass and ban account they know are sold and look into taking down places like PA. But that would require a extra level of dedicationa nd care for this product that i dont think SoE is capible of yet. They are getting better, but i think this mentality is out of their reach ATM sadly.<br />
<br />
My perspective anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Here's how it will play out...<br />
Step 1:    SOE barters sales in-game to ensure integrity<br />
.... time passes .....<br />
Step 2:    SOE removes limitations on no-drop items when barted through them  (sales sky-rocket)<br />
..... time passes and its even harder than it is now to get enough people online to raid .....<br />
Step 3:    SOE offers pre-leveled characters<br />
.....  more time passes:   game becomes like Planetside<br />
<br />
End result:   Game remains popular with all 65's running about doing raids, PVP, quests, etc   Focus becomes like Planetside with primarily open raids<br />
<br />
Nightmare scenario or reality?  Sounds to me like an excellent (from a business standpoint) way to phase out EQ yet remain profitable.  Will the bean counters win over historical gameplay?   (Check out UO sometime so see how thats playing out.....)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I guess the real question would be.<br />
<br />
Do you trust SOE?<br />
<br />
I mean. Look at the letter from Smedley. Theya re taking the people off OoW to get stuff done o the live servers.<br />
<br />
Didnt they say way back when that the monthly fee was for the live team to maintain and upgrade the content on those live servers and that a seperate team was making the expansions?<br />
<br />
What I guess would happen is they would be a Playerauction type place and then one too many beancounters would talk someone into just lowering the spawn rate on this glut of items wew have for sale so they will get transferred quicker. Then next would be the We don;t have quite enough to make bonus this quarter.. Go ahead and add a one time special deal on Rubicite armour. or something. 10 dollers get a full suit of it. Or for 20 get a dark elf mask.<br />
<br />
Then it would go way downhill way fast.<br />
<br />
SOE has been moneygrubbing us for a while and you really think they will have the testicular fortatude to not abuse yet another sure fire flash in the pan money making scheme. <br />
<br />
I mean they are charging 50 Bucks to change a name. And what 75 to Move a charecter to another account and server? And Remember the days of there will be no Geared charecter move ever. It would hurt the integrity of the server.. Fallen before the cash outlays.<br />
<br />
Take a long term look at it. It is a bad idea to introduce sanctioned cash outlays casue then every wannabee who is hopeing for the quick buck will be allowed to become a virtual Hawker of his crap. So Farming would ioncrease even more cause it would be legal and sactioned in the eyes of SOE.<br />
<br />
I mean come on. Gloriana after all the stuff about playerauctions you don't see this? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Voted no. I know it happens, that doesn't mean I have to like it or worse yet validate it. I realize the immersiveness of EQ has been thrown aside a lot in a lot of areas but making it legal just tears it up and throws it in the garbage. If there is one thing that would make me quit, it is Sony endorsing selling stuff for real money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I trust SOE more than Yantis.<br />
<br />
Plus, honestly, I find the whole idea of &quot;trusting&quot; a video game company to be a little weird. They are a business to make money, I trust them to do their best to make their company successful. As far as a personal trust relationship between me and them, why would I trust them? They're a corporation out to make a profit.<br />
<br />
Do you &quot;trust&quot; the company that makes your toaster?<br />
<br />
PS I think geared character moves was a great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A company's job is to make money.  I don't see faulting a company for trying to keep it's employees paid and provide it's customers with the products and services they want to keep them buying &quot;your&quot; product as opposed to a competitor's product.<br />
<br />
Yantis/IGE is a competitor.  There was some sort of lawsuit a while back with Mythic and DAoC where people won and set a precident that folks *could* buy and sell the time they spent acquiring in-game items, or whatever, and that was a service that a person could provide to another person, and basically trying to go after it legally gets really sticky since that precident is already there, and most courts see time spent as the person behind the keyboard's time... they're not into video games and pixels and little electronic men.  They're into Frankie sat logged into this machine for 800 hours to achieve &quot;this&quot; ... and now he's marketing that &quot;this&quot; to someone else for the cost of 50 hours labor... it's tough.<br />
<br />
If I still had my account active, I would log in and vote &quot;Yes&quot; ... simply because I would rather support SOE in the hopes they can keep folks going than support folks like Yantis/IGE ... and SOE can DEMOLISH Yantis, and all the rest of the small-timers, this way, effortlessly.  I don't especially like the idea of some companies employing herds of kids or poverty-striken folks to farm plat all day, then sell it back.  Singapore is very difficult to get your money from if they don't come through on the trade.<br />
<br />
This would be safe, effective, and would help SOE kill upstarts like Yantis, et.al.  It already happens.  Why should SOE not be able to control it instead of trying to stop it.  It makes MILLIONS.  I'm pretty sure there's some Japanese VP or Board of Directors member somewhere that's noticed that too ... millions that AREN'T going back to SONY, on thier own product ... <br />
<br />
If I were a Japanese board of director, I'd be pretty upset about that lost potential revenue when the market is CLEARLY there and it would be virtually nothing for SOE to take the reins themselves...<br />
<br />
Do the math ... my bets are it's coming soon to a server near you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If the items you get are completely buyable, if the characters are as well, then why work for anything?  No matter what you have, you will impress no one, and the urge to impress others is what drives folks to play EQ.  Take that away and the game will crash and burn even more swiftly.<br />
<br />
Welcome to vapid generalizations. While there are likely folks who play to get items just to impress others ... personally, I doubt they are the majority. It is the &quot;impress others&quot; that I find hard to believe. That is even more shallow and silly than the progression of SOE selling items ingame. Ironically, SOE selling items ingame is more/less going to happen down the road ... if it is not going on already.<br />
<br />
What is lost in the game itself are the tiny little things that the majority of current players don't even know ever existed. That first set of banded armor; rangers questing for ivy; learning to tailor to get some decent cloth armor for your mage; bard lambert. Was the gear any good? Not by today's standards. Yet at the time it was decent, if not great, and it was something you ... worked and quested for. The path of the game was the value in the game.<br />
<br />
Things were done not to brag or show off or whatever ... but because that is how you got the best gear available. You could only get this gear by earning it or bartering with other players who were actually online at the time. You had to interact. You had to play. You had to progress in a stair step fashion from day one to ding 55 ... and those steps were tough (both ways!!!!).<br />
<br />
Today you can get from level 1 to 65 having never talked to a single player ingame ... never ... ever. You can start out in top of the line, raid drop gear at level 1. All you have to do is buy it. This is just staying in the game. The path is smoother if you spend more RL cash to 'acquire' game cash or characters or items. I ask, 'why would you?' It is a game. There is no holy grail at the end of it ... in point of fact, there is no end to it. No peak. <br />
<br />
You can claim an end. Conquer time and get an item for each slot in your inventory from there. Max a tradeskill; max all tradeskills. Get each character slot on a server filled with at lvl 65, elementally geared toon. Whatever ... but whatever you might call the end game. The point where you won the game, there is still so much that exists that you have not done or tried. There are still options. So many that no one can 'totally win the game.'<br />
<br />
For those who actually acquire gear to use as tokens of status are morons. In case you missed it - I said MORONS!!!! Of course, SOE recognizes that morons will pay for more and more pixel candy. Morons are too stupid to realize that even if an item only costs 1 penny, that 1 penny is in reality worth more than any pixel candy you can purchace.<br />
<br />
Given business management, the real underlying question in this poll gives SOE one single answer: if the player base wants secure transactions, then SOE can buy up Yantis and keep it tranparently separate from the game, provide a secure transaction path and monopolize the selling of items so all the money goes into their coffers. SOE can play both ends of the transaction game while focusing on keeping any competitors out of their market ... without any player ever knowing they are simply paying SOE for items.<br />
<br />
If you voted yes, or in any way can justify selling any ingame item for real life cash, or have paid cash for pixel candy ... welcome to being the moron. If your enjoyment in this game is based on acquiring items by any available method because having those items makes you feel cool and gives you bragging rights ... you have crossed the line and are a stupid f***ing moron.<br />
<br />
That there is any shaman who can justify the Yantis practice and now the SOE entry into that market shows how far downhill this game has gone.</div></div><hr />

Im of the same mind as Gloriana here in that id rather have SoE doing it than IGE or Scumbag (aka Yantis).<br />

      But yantis don't control EQ . Yantis don't control the drop rate in EQ...Anyway i'm against both  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">One thing about EQ is everyone is playing on relatively equal terms. As soon as people can start paying RL $$ for items it adds a large inbalance. Not to mention any sense of real achievement starts flying out the window.<br />
<br />
Yes, a significant minority are already buying stuff in game for RL $$. However, that is NO reason to make it official. Thats like saying &quot;Well, quite a few people take cocaine, we might as well make it legal as we can't stop it&quot;. <br />
<br />
It'll harm the in-game economy more than it is already. Why sell items for pp when you can get RL $$ for them? At the moment I happily give away ornate patterns to good friends. Would I still do that knowing I can safely, legitimately sell them for RL $$? Probably not.<br />
<br />
Arguments about ninja-looting are bad enough at the moment, but at least you can sit back and say &quot;Its just a game&quot;. But once you put real monetary value to things, well its a whole new ball game.<br />
<br />
I voted NO. You might have guessed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think the thing some people are missing is that this is NOT SOE selling items to players. It is merely SOE offering to moderate the RL exchange of items for dollars. The regluar rules still apply, you cannot sell no-drop (except on FV), you cannot sell flags, etc etc, unless you are offering entire accounts.<br />
<br />
Two dangers I see on this path though, and neither has anything to do with stupid CC# arguements. <br />
<br />
Problem #1. What is to stop the mega-hardcore elite (or anyone, actually) from PLing characters on accounts SOLELY for the purpose of selling them. Would be a simple matter to get them flagged up, a few &quot;probably would rot anyway&quot; items, and BAM put it up for sale. I realize this type of thing is probably being done now, but the scale is probably small. After all, it IS still against the EULA. However, once SOE puts their &quot;stamp of approval&quot; on this type of activity, the door would be open for this to become a legitimate &quot;business&quot;. Hell, I might actually go into this business myself, why not. SOE says its OK. How much is a Time-flagged Rogue with 10 Time items worth? Don't even need the EP flags to get to Time, just 85% them in and loot the God items. <br />
<br />
Problem #2. What is the next logical step? Think hard people . . . YUP! You guessed it. SOE THEMSELVES selling items. I can picture it now. Merchants in the Bazaar, with names over their heads like &quot;Velious Quest Items&quot; and a Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl, only $49.99 (just enter your credit card # in the box). Next up, Luclin Weapons! Emp Sword, $29.99, PoP Weapons, SEWS, $79.99. How UBER do you want to be? Well, how much cash you got?<br />
<br />
While I am against sites like Player Auctions and Yantis's trash, having SOE put a stamp of approval on RL cash-for-gear is a poison pill and would be bad for the game. Let the fringe element buy pp and gear if they want too, leave Yantis alone. Its really NOT that huge a deal right now (expcept for bugged crap like we had a couple months ago). But the INSTANT SOE says &quot;Its OK, we are changing the EULA&quot; it becomes a MAJOR thing. Yantis-type sites will pop up ALL over. People will /auction IN GAME. That would just not be cool, not one bit.</div></div><hr />

i trust neither, sony tricks people into buying expansions, why would you trust them to make or engineer a system to sell items ?<br />
they would probably incorperate a 20% sonyEQ tax on everything you sell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Allowing items to be sold in-game for cash would create a very interesting and competitive environment. I hate the concept of buying/selling characters through Yantis or the like, it goes against the spirit of the game IMO.<br />
<br />
However, If I had a sellable item that I no longer used (and would normally sell it to a vendor for chump change) the allure of getting real cash for that item would be very tempting. Hell, sell enough things and you could make playing EQ profitable, or at least cost nothing.<br />
<br />
But, the concepts of CAWU and any other altruistic method of loot distribution would go right out the window. If a valuable (sellable) item dropped for a group it would no longer matter who could best use it, or if it was an upgrade. Or better yet, what if your guild was raiding VT and a rare (hence expensive) tradeskill component dropped, the guild leaders would be placed in an awkward position of having loot with real cash value under their fingertips. I can imagine guilds forming for the sole purpose of raiding for loot to sell and distribute real cash to its members.<br />
<br />
This would change the entire culture of EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Seriously if Sony wanted to take care of Yantis they could in a heart beat.<br />
<br />
They use accounts to offer to Sell plat to yantis, soon as trade initiates. Ban the account buying the plat. Rinse repeat. Yantis will no longer risk accounts to buy the plat from folks to resell. No more plat selling.<br />
<br />
Step two. Buy low end gear from yantis again come trade time Ban accounts used for trading.<br />
As long as sony uses purchases less the 12.00 dollars per ban they break even with the monthly fee each of the new yantis account created to take over the trades.<br />
<br />
Of course then they will simply offer the same service and change the eula to state its an offence to offer the same services outside of SOE.<br />
funny how the eula states they can change it so if they wanted to they would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Problem #1. What is to stop the mega-hardcore elite (or anyone, actually) from PLing characters on accounts SOLELY for the purpose of selling them. Would be a simple matter to get them flagged up, a few &quot;probably would rot anyway&quot; items, and BAM put it up for sale. I realize this type of thing is probably being done now, but the scale is probably small.<br />
<br />
Not probably, certainly.  When I first moved to Legends there was a huge shakeup in the officership of Township Rebellion over ebaying the guild bank with the then guild leader leaving in disgrace.  Plus Leviathan had a group of people from Veeshan who were in a PL and sell ring.  They'd create accounts on SH, buy cheap lewtz, PL em to 65, grab some rot loots then send em back and auction em off.<br />
<br />
I've seen people that refuse to use anything they haven't looted themselves. I've known people that have put a Blade of Carnage on the credit card.  Heck, I don't know any personally, but I'm sure there are people out there that have cybered (and more) for loot.<br />
<br />
Problem #2. What is the next logical step? Think hard people . . . YUP! You guessed it. SOE THEMSELVES selling items.<br />
<br />
Yeah, just like they were going to do that when they open the Legends server.  I'm sure everyone remembers the funny photoshopped screenshot with the graphic asking you to enter your CC to loot the Mylrokar's dagger.  Except they didn't do that on Legends (at least they hadn't started in Feb when I left). Heck, maybe Legends would be less of a ghost town if they did start selling loot for cold hard cash.<br />
<br />
All Sony is doing is getting the ability to control something they are going to get grief over if it goes wrong.  That is, if you send someone some money for loot and they scam you, what's your first reaction? Yea, petition. Then when the GM says they can't do anything you rant and rave about what a bunch of sorry bastards Sony's customer support has. Sony, it's pretty obvious, can't *stop* the selling of items.  So they may as well supervise it as best they can and try to stop scammers.<br />
<br />
So yes, I voted yes.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to feel like my accomplishments are any less because people choose to buy gear and Sony helps them not get ripped off (and the only real accomplishment I have is playing the game for 3 years while still enjoying it and meeting some good friends - selling gear won't change that).  I play for fun.  Sure I'd love to not have a job and raid and have a bigger e-penis.  Except that's not true. I like my paycheck more than I like to get my unbuffed HP to 7k or whatever.</div></div><hr />

You tell Sarkoris, &quot;horrified&quot;<br />
Sarkoris tells you, &quot;that was my reaction too&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm going to hope that the real reason behind the question was to gauge player's feelings about ebaying.  If SoE became a participant, or worse a dealer, in items for RL cash the conflict of interest would destroy the game.  Even if they were truly &quot;honest&quot;, EVERYTHING that changed in the game would be perceived by the playerbase as some kind of scam -- yeah yeah, I acknowledge multiple rushed, unfinished expansions and crappy CS.<br />
<br />
I am not a purist by any means.  For me, twinking and powerlevelling make the game more fun.  I love looting things my alts can use.  I don't get buying plat for cash though.  That's like purchasing a book then paying extra to have it flipped to the last chapter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">That SoE hasn't shut Yantis down is likely an indication that they feel it will have negative effect in game, or shut down a potential revenue stream for them in the future (the existance of the poll itself speaks volumes), or that they fear Yantis will tie them up in litigation and challenge the EULA.  None of those are good for Sony, so they turn a blind eye.  Voting no will benefit Yantis (at the very least taking out his monopoly and likely killing his ability to set bazzaar prices on each server), voting yes benefits SoE more, but shows my distaste for purchased items.  Tough call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I haven't seen this yet, but going to vote no. Selling items and cash does bad things to the economy. And like Blazz said, if this gets implemented, having SOE sell items and/or cash is not a big step anymore (and that is an even worse idea).<br />
<br />
If this is something that they really want to do, they should set up a separate server where selling items and characters is allowed (maybe even use the FV rules on loot with very few nodrop items to make it a real playground for those with too much cash). Transfers there would be allowed with gear, but if you want to leave the server, you transfer back naked. The economy on the server would be permanently messed up from day one, but at least it could work as a money sink for the other servers, and a graveyard for eBayed or retired characters.  :p</div></div><hr />

This service that SoE is polling opinion about is similar to the trade that occurs currently through PA or Yantis... droppables and cash between players for RL money.  Elemental Sleeves are no drop....<br />
<br />
As far as this being the &quot;gateway drug&quot; for eventual sale of No Drop items or pre-leveled, stocked, characters... I can see the character thing - but not the No Drop items.  What's the difference of you buying a Sony pre-leveled character or a Player-leveled character?  Why not No Drop - nothing in particular - just a gut feeling.<br />
<br />
To those of you saying this is the end of the world - no, it's not.  This type of trading is as old as EQ is and is unfortunately all to prevelant.  By Sony entering the &quot;market&quot;, it puts stricter controls on it and puts Yantis out of business (we can hope!).  It IS Sony's product - there IS a market for money to be made from this product - Sony DOES have the right to tap that profit on their own product.<br />

Though I'd like to add - I think the majority of EQ players are basically a mob.  I think a lot of them DO play for the feeling of being powerful and respected:  a feeling they can get in-game but not IRL.  My feeling that the people on this board are the minority.  How soon we forget those groups of people comparing HP and AC and linking every piece of gear to find out who was uberer.  Anyone read that article in Wired way back about the guy playing UO who emptied his savings account to buy a house full of goodies for his UO character?  Might be an extreme case, but I think that guy's closer to the rule than the exception.<br />
<br />
Just because you've learned how to avoid them doesn't mean they're not still out there.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my point.  As has been said above, once these items are buyable, they'll be more common, and the prestige attached to them will disappear.  The DE mask is no more useful than a DE potion.  But people still drool over them, because they're 'old skool'.<br />
<br />
Much as it would please me personally to have that element removed from the game, it's a bad business move, long term.  Short term, of course, it'll provide a quick buck.  If you REALLY want to get paranoid about it, you could consider it a very clever exit strategy for SoE.</div></div><hr />

you shout about how it is wrong?  bugger off.  Sony gets to decide what is right and wrong in their game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">If you project this line of reasoning out ...<br />
<br />
1. SOE provides a safe transfer of RL cash for items in game. Initially not in the buying/selling of the items.<br />
<br />
2. To get in on the revenue stream, they gradually change to adding a surcharge for the secure transaction.<br />
<br />
3. To increase the revenue stream, they introduce purchasable items directly from SOE. Here is where they have the total monopoly. These are not tangible items that have to be created. They are code and pixels, which SOE, as controllers of the code, have an unlimited supply of.<br />
<br />
The potentials of where this going to go are numerous ... and all downhill for the game. Justifying it because it has/is/will be done does not justify it. It is wrong. If SOE wanted to cure any negative reputation effects of the current practice they could easily do it by coming down hard on the Yantis folks. Visually and with great vehemence.<br />
<br />
They don't need any spy-bots wheeling and dealing with Yantis folks ... SOE controls the logs. They have the info on transactions and conversations at hand ... they just need to read them and do their job enforcing the EULA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">What I think will happen if this goes thru is that SoE will open a new site for the sales of in game tradable items.  Like a EQ-Ebay.  SoE will host the site and conduct the transactions.  They will prolly also create some in game interface for you to drop off / pickup the items after the sale has been completed.  SoE will prolly charge the seller for the transaction, just like Ebay.<br />
<br />
This isnt going to make Yantis go away.  It will actually increase his profits.  I expect more people to buy/sell items if they know for sure the transaction is safe.  Knowing this, I still voted yes.  <br />
<br />
SoE isnt going to try to put away Yantis.  It would require too much time and resources and yield zero return profit-wise.  Not a good investment for them.  On the other hand, you ask, why not just have SoE sell lvl 65 characters, flags, AAs, no drop items?  Cause they 'know' that would inflame ALOT of people and cause massive subscription cancellations.  Another bad business move so I doubt it'll happen.  They are a business after all.  Im sure they considered the reprocussions before putting out the vote.  As you can tell by this thread alone, quite a few already dont care or would even prefer they mediate the transactions.  Either way, Yantis isnt going away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I think what most people are missing is you can't control this type of activity.  As long as you can give an email address to somebody in game there is a potential business transaction right there.  The only way to control not being able to sell something virtual for real cash is to make everything no drop and to remove the ability to multiquest.  This is the only way to stop it.  Think about it real hard people.  There is no way to stop this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I don't give a hoot about protecting players from scams or Yantis.  If they try to cheat, they get what they deserve.  The game should have internal integrity or it is worthless.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, SOE doesn't need this to crack down on Yantis.  They need to drag IGE to court and they need to show they are protecting their trademarks by banning every single account suspected of EULA violation.  <br />
<br />
It's astonishing they even ask this question, but sadly it is proof the accountants and beancounters are running the show totally, and game integrity means jack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I voted no, but I can understand their reasoning behind it.<br />
<br />
And unlike many, I can see a possible reason for this...closing the gap between raiders and casuals.<br />
<br />
If a casual player, who does not have the time to raid to get the loot that would make him more equal in gear to a raider, can buy certain gear directly from SoE, that puts them closer together and allows SoE to design zones with just ONE type of character, not TWO (the uber geared raider, the less geared casual, who are of equal level/AA).<br />
<br />
This is one of the things that must be done to save EQ, IMHO.  When casuals get frustrated and start leaving, SoE loses the majority of its playerbase.<br />
<br />
In the future, look for SoE to start directly controlling the sale of gear to characters for real-life money (elemental quality, but not Time), then watch them remove the Nodrop tag off some gear, as it works on Firiona Vie server.<br />
<br />
They'll do this so THEY control that trade, to prevent Yantis from trying to corner the market on this suddenly available gear.<br />
<br />
They'll do this because they HAVE to do it.  The gear disparity between raiders and casuals has made it absolutely impossible for them to design zones and expansions that both types of players can enjoy.  What's laughably easy for raiders is too hard for casuals, and this has already caused a major drop of casuals in the game.<br />
<br />
GoD did more than chase off high-end guilds.  It's also caused a loss of many casual players, who see that they will forever be trapped in BoT, HoH, LDoN, and maybe Tactics, because everything past that will be denied to them.<br />
<br />
Casuals are the true lifeblood of EQ, no matter what raiders think, because no matter how many accounts those 10% of the playerbase who are raiders have, they're still nowhere near the number of accounts held by casuals.<br />
<br />
To prevent both the mass exodus of the raiders and the casuals, SoE has to close the gap between them.  They can't very well nerf all the raider gear, because that's horribly unfair, so watch them remove the nodrop tag off a bunch of raid loot.  Not Time gear or upper elemental gear, but watch them make a bunch of PoP and lower Elemental raid loot droppable.</div></div><hr />

Much of your post didn't sit well with me, but the above quote really got me. Do you somehow think it's any more fair to a raider (does it strike anyone around here that there are different levels of raiding?) to show up in POK one day and see some level 50 character wearing Elemental armor when that level 50 character has never even seen the zone from which the equipment he purchased and now wears comes from?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">It's a bad idea, no doubt.  The accomplishments that each player shoots for in the game are built on the idea that they are actually accomplishments, thay they represent something scare and unsual.  If merely buying or selling these things for RL $'s is legitimized, the acomplishments turn into nothing more then the same competition play in real life, with the ones able to spend the most cash able to win it.  I would think a vast majority of players dont buy plat/items/chars, but if Sony makes it legit, then why not?  <br />
<br />
I do not doubt that Sony would eventually move to the sale of items in game for $'s in a heartbeat.  See www.secondlife.com for a MMO that tries to make money this way (you can buy your own island for only $980 plus $195 per month (really)).</div></div><hr />

I would likely see Sony charging a minor transaction fee off of everything as well, why wouldnt they?<br />
<br />
I see something like this ruining the game, think farming was bad before?  People will LIVE their lives making money off of EQ by farming and selling things, anything of any value will be perma camped because its their job and you will have to buy it for real $ if you want it.<br />
<br />
It lowers the barrier of entry, it empowers even the lazy who wouldnt sell before because they had to go to the internet, or because it was against the Eula, deal with paypal etc.  So those who considered it before but didnt want to deal with everything else, can now click a button or two and now have the easy cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>skafloc1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Well to be honest I despise Ige, yantis for the manner in which they take over websites.. plastering their bull@s advertisments all over  once reputable sites.<br />
<br />
However . I find myself questioning WHY exactly sony is NOW suddenly soo interested in finding out how we  feel about the possiblity of buying/trading characters and items through THEM.<br />
<br />
Is it simply that sony believe's  this is yet another way to shake some pennies out of the folks  playing eq? <br />
<br />
In other words .. sure well arrange &quot;safe&quot; tansfers of characters/gear whatever through US but your going to pay us for it.<br />
<br />
I see this more as a means to shut down or perhaps limit these entrepeneur companies who are in fact violating sony policies than in the interest of providing us the paying customer something extra.<br />
<br />
One thing I will say is this though.. For nearly 4and half years I have played a shaman on the emarr server spending much of that time in the top 2 guilds Divine  grace and Magister.<br />
<br />
I like many of you was one of the leaders of my class and had few peers in terms of progression.gear and aa's but NOW with the current state of the shaman class I finally mothballed  my shm  and began playing a rogue I created as my first eq character.<br />
<br />
The one thing I truely wish  is that sony allowed for transfer of no drop gear between your OWN characters on a account (assuming they can equip it since we already have recommended levels and certain flagging requirements to complete elem or god armor quests)<br />
<br />
Why not? after all I spent the time earning it would it really hurt the game if we were able to utilize even a portion of that invested time with other characters? <br />
<br />
I mean hell we have 8 char slots  and even with the advantage of todays advancement curve you could still spend what a few years getting several characters in the upper end of progression,aa and gear?<br />
<br />
To some of you this may sound cheesy but after building up a time/god geared/flagged character,earning nearly 600 aa points and in the end being disgusted by how utterly mediocre we have become as a class in god If I had some /any means to transfer some of that work to a character I do enjoy playing I could live with myself knowing I personally  spent the time earning it.<br />
<br />
for the first time ever  I actually am considering  trading in my shm account for a comparable rogue in terms of gear /aa and flags.<br />
<br />
So from that point of view I do wish there was a safe trusted means of making such a transfer. <br />
<br />
It is because of scammers ,hackers  and ige/yantis whores that I haven't done it already.<br />
<br />
Well who knows maybe sony will finally get it and make our class worth enjoying again with oow . <br />
<br />
I have my doubts but it is because I put so much effort into my shaman that I feel so strongly and am willing to get them ONE more chance to make us whole again with the proper vision and perspective they once had.<br />
<br />
Somehow I turned this into a rant so let me close by saying even though I post rarely here ..you all have a wonderful and interesting perective on our class and I enjoy the discussions greatly:)<br />

I do not the festering ooze that is capitalism affecting my fun time.  If this were to pass, and SOE bascially says that buying and selling virtual items for cash is ok, and they broker it, then the game will go to hell.<br />
<br />
There's no way people will ever share in a game where everything in the game has a cash price tag.  The game will no longer be fun - in fact, it will no longer be a game - it'll be a second job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, honey, I'm done at the office for the day.  I think I'll log on to EQ and farm some ornate to sell - daddy needs a new pair of shoes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
I think the thing that saddens me the most is that EQ is a game - it's something people should be involved in for fun - it should be fun to acquire your gear and earn your in-game accomplishments - but obviously a large number of people would rather PAY their way through a GAME.<br />
<br />

<br />
It'd be nice if they had different servers.  You could have servers for people that actually PLAY the game and don't want to farm it for RL cash or buy their way thru it - and then servers for people who can't stop being capitalists for long enough to play a game without making a profit on it and the suckers that want to pay their way thru their &quot;fun.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Spare me the platitudes.<br />
<br />
People already buy characters, items and plat. My point is, since it's ALREADY happening, take the power away from people like Yantis and his sweatshops.<br />
<br />
My preference would be for SOE to crack down on Yantis and Playerauctions and everyone who violates the EULA to buy/sell Everquest pixels.<br />
<br />
There is one BIG difference between Yantis buying/selling items and players and SOE.  Yantis has to play by SOE's rules aka. drop rarity, plat farming limitations.  SOE can make their own rules, and can change drop rates to suit their wimps.  If Flayed Barb legs selling for $100 dollars and SOE takes a $10 cut, then it is very easy to tune the encounter to net a higher drop rate/higher cut of the profit.  While I hate companies like Yantis who profit from a game like this, they can't control how much they make.  If they want more to sell- they have to farm it.  SOE can control the &quot;cash flow&quot; and that is much more dangerous...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Please...stop...being...stupid. Can NO DROP items currently be transferred or sold? Then what makes you think they would suddenly, magically start if SoE did this? Do you not realize that it would make the NO DROP flag utterly meaningless? The current EQ management are greedy halfwits, but they still know they're running a video game, not a virtual mall. Retail box freebies and tie-in stuff like the PC Gamer shield are as far down that road as they'll go, and wisely so.<br />
<br />
The correct response to the poll question is &quot;no&quot;, for the reason which has already been stated. You're not supposed to be able to attain money or items in EQ with resources outside the game. Who cares if cheaters get screwed now and then? It's bad enough that SoE doesn't crack down on such transactions; the last thing they need to do is legitimize them by making them an official part of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My answer is no. <br />
Where do they draw the line at what they sell? They have to make the items being sold worth the money, so people will buy them. It makes for a horrible circle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I answered yes thoroughly and wholeheartedly.  Here's my reasons why, though I fully expect page after page of neg rep bumps for trying to give logical reasons why this isn't a problem.  :P<br />
<br />
The main reason is that I believe each person is responsible for themselves to have fun in the game how they want.  I am not responsible for the fun other people have in game, and their fun should lay on my shoulders anything beyond my contributing to the raid/group I'm in with that person, or any gear I'm selling in game via bazaar or auction channels.<br />
<br />
I xp with friends.  I raid with my guild.  We go kill stuff.  We go get flags.  We are a mostly self sufficient force on our server.  What other people are doing on the server does not really affect what we do.  If someone goes and buys an account from someone no longer planning to play, this does not affect me.  My fun in the game is through doing what I want to do with my friends.  My fun in the game is through raiding difficult targets and seeing new items drop.  My fun in the game is through seeing new places I haven't been to before and figuring out new encounters.  My fun in the game is hanging out with friends xping wherever we want to go.  Someone else buying a character from someone else (or potentially some gear from Sony or whatever) is not going to prohibit me in any way from doing what I do.  My philosophy in life in general is do whatever you want to in life as long as it doesn't prevent me from doing what I want to.  Same thing applies to EQ IMO.  If you want to powerlevel a character and sell it off to another person, your actions aren't stopping me from having fun in the game.  Go nuts.<br />
<br />
If you look out there, there's already items being sold and characters being sold.  I've known a few people that have had no job of their own, but payed for rent by selling items in game.  Items in game already have an established real world value, as well as characters in game.  You can acknowledge that sales already happen or not, but it doesn't change the fact that it's already in effect.  Having Sony officially broker the deals is not going to all of a sudden start the whole in game sales for real money process.<br />
<br />
Sony was asking if it should be a *safe* broker between deals that already are going on.  Buying items or characters now isn't safe.  You have no idea how reliable the source is for selling items if you wish to buy.  If you sell your character to someone, they can very easily tell paypal that they never received delivery for their payment, and demand for their payment to be returned.  Once a character is sold, someone can try to steal it back, which causes even more headaches for Sony to figure out the rightful owner of the account is.<br />
<br />
There's already a precedent set of another game not preventing the sale of accounts nor the item within the game.  From what I remember, Ultima Online had no problems with people selling accounts to other people.  And in that game, the world didn't go to hell because of filthy ebayers or whatever.<br />
<br />
I'm also rather fond of the idea of not being screwed out of being able to acquire an item because it was removed from the game at one point before I managed to acquire it myself.  There's many many players out there with dark elf masks, but because I didn't spend about 12 hours camping one myself due to the lines, I can't turn into a dark elf for free.  I'm not going to waste millions of plat hoping to get one in the casino.  I'd like to be able to get a dark elf mask, and if Sony wanted to sell me one for a few bucks, I'm all for it.  It'll provide me a lot more fun than most of what else I can buy for a few bucks.  There's a good number of items out there I'd like to be able to get, but can't for extenuating circumstances out of your control.  Sometimes drop rates suck on items horribly.  Sometimes you can do your best to try and help raid to kill a target for something, but you might not ever see it.  Our guild has 8 or so active shaman, and we have 2 TA so far after about 3 months of time raiding.  I'd love to be able to spend a few bucks to buy a TA just so I don't have to worry about that one game changing item by showing up to every single time raid and hoarding points to try and get it when I can.<br />
<br />
Another example of why I said yes is because of something that's happened to a friend of mine.  Her roommate (Starphyre on Brell.  avoid her at all costs) also played eq before she moved out.  That roommate has since used my friend's account to steal a load of cash from another person in EQ, and has managed to get my friend's account banned because of it.  There goes her 65 ele plane flagged 100AA shadowknight down the drain.  She's already spent the hours and hours levelling up.  She's done the flagging thing already.  She's already geared herself up.  My time helping her level back up and her time levelling back up is worth RL money.  Powerlevelling up a level 30 toon isn't especially fun so she can hunt with me again.  That's work.  I make about $15.00 an hour at my workplace.  That's what my time is worth to me.  I estimate my time to help her get back to where she was before is probably worth a few thousand dollars (no joke there).  Being able to safely buy another shadowknight of the same level and flags already would well be worth it.<br />
<br />
What you do in EQ is your own business.  What I do is my own business.  If you want to spend RL time making RL money to buy in game items so be it.  If you want to spend time in game acquiring items to sell for RL money so be it.  It's a fair tradeoff of time for both parties involved.  And regardless, it doesn't affect me in the slightest.  More power to you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Nice way to SCREW OVER YOUR GUILD.<br />
You'll get an item if you're skilled and dedicated enough. <br />
People get into raiding guilds because they are good enough players to manage to join the raiding guild.<br />
The items guildmembers win is because they've put in enough time raiding with the guild that they are deserving of the item because of their time investment.<br />
Do you point fingers at every person that tires of being in your guild and scream at the for SCREWING OVER YOUR GUILD for not wanting to be with you any more?<br />
Do you bitch and whine and start rants over people for quitting the game and SCREWING OVER YOUR GUILD because they decide that after playing they no longer want to play eq?<br />
<br />
You need to get some perspective.<br />
People don't go leveling up their characters, joining guilds, raid with them for months, acquiring probably about 1 item every 15-30 real life days, and quitting to sell their character for profit.<br />
That would be *extremely* unprofitable for someone planning to level characters to sell for profit.<br />
The characters being sold are going to be:<br />
1.  main characters that have quite playing eq because they no longer want to play eq ever again.  these characters, if they aren't sold, are going to rot with their gear since they won't ever be played anymore.  These people are quitting and no matter what, you won't see the gear whether they quite or sell the character.  But selling the character might actually let you see that gear benefit your guild again depending who its sold to (ie sold to guild mate, or sold to someone wanting to join your guild but underequiped at present to app)<br />
2.  main characters being sold because whoever is playing the character desperately needs cash for whatever RL reason and is willing to sacrifice their EQ career because they need money moreso (for example, you lose your job and you have things like &quot;rent&quot; to pay for).  Someone that can't afford to play eq is pretty much the same situation as #1.<br />
3.  2nd comped characters that have become too expensive for someone to afford to keep active anymore.  If you are going to quit playing an alt because you can't afford it, might as well sell it to someone who might make some further use of the character.  These characters aren't winning &quot;your guild's&quot; loot cuz they are alts.  If they are winning all your hard earned loot, your guild needs some new looting rules, or harder raid targets.<br />
4.  2nd comped characters that have been power levelled up for the purpose of selling to another person.  These characters will be very poorly equiped (bazaar gear, ornate at best) since good gear comes from raiding, and raiding to acquire gear takes months of time (up to a full year)to get fully equip every inventory slot with raid acquired gear.  These characters aren't the ones taking all your guild's loot becaus they just don't have the patience to acquire lots of raid loot because it's better to just level up more characters faster to make money.<br />
<br />
Soooo, who's out screwing over your guild?  I can't think of any other types of people out there that would factor in.  If someone's quitting, they are quitting, and they are taking their items with them when they quit and you can't stop that.  Being able to get something after you quit is all the better if you are not going to play any more.  People mass producing botted characters powerlevelled up aren't taking your loot because they just don't have any of your guild's loot, and you have nothing to worry about from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">While I agree with the general tone of this post, I disagree with this particular point: <br />

It is NOT hard to get a character to 65, 50 aa, and Time flagged if you are a hardcore player and your guild is farming Quarm. That being said, guilds that have been farming Time for more than a few months end up with a LOT of loot rotting. Its just the nature of the zone, its more loot-packed than VT. Since you do not require the FULL gamut of flags to get into Time, it would become a very simple matter for mega-high end guilds to PL, Time Flag, get a few Time items, and sell the account. I am sure the advirtising of such an account would be misleading as well. Such a character would probably not be maxxed in skills, and not have all EP flags. However, just saying something like &quot;All Spells, Time Flagged, 3 Time items&quot; would certainly lead a buyer to &quot;think&quot; it was a semi-real account. <br />
<br />
This part, though, is ABSOLUTELY true and I agree 100%<br />
The items guildmembers win is because they've put in enough time raiding with the guild that they are deserving of the item because of their time investment.<br />
For the MOST part (with few extreme exceptions) people who earn loot on raids in guilds earn this loot AFTER they have invested their time into the guild. Therefore, anything they have, they certainly EARNED. I used to get pissy when I noticed people would burn all their DKP then jump-ship to a higher guild than mine, but then I realized something. In order to get that DKP, they were at the raids, helping out. There are exceptions, of course, tradables like Stonewood Bows, BoCs, etc are USUALLY distributed freely but are considered &quot;guild loot&quot; to be returned upon leaving the guild. Overall in general though, you see a piece of gear on someone, odds are they worked for it raiding or in some other meritable fashion (web page worker, raid leader, officer, merchant for guild, etc, lots of &quot;non-raid&quot; duties in big guilds)</div></div><hr />

2. There are people who frown on Yantis and his ilk because of the risk of banning/item destruction. These people will be free to engadge in more farming for loot.<br />

3. It is a proven fact that the top of the food chain has a much much easier time going after the middle tier encounters and items. What would be diffacult for an up and comer will be very trivial for the raider crowd. And with that ease of kills now comes a SOE approved way of getting rid of the loot. So take your two box and go whack the dragons for a quick hundred bucks. The lower end folks will never see much up. <br />

4. It is a mercenary thing to do. It is just bad Mojo man. Yantis is hated for a reason, and he doesnt scam people at all. I mean he has a ton of good transaction histories. So why is he hated.  Because he gets these items through people farming for him, or him botting farm accounts with cheap labor. And if he pays Playerauctions or he pays sony for it what is the differance? Only thing that this will do is hurt the game. <br />
<br />
5. The retired accounts should actually be retired. What wopuld the purpose of the game be if you could buy an account from SoE. You might as well just start at level 65 with 200 AA. It is just another part of Screw the journy I want the &quot;fun stuff&quot; now Now Now! Some of the best fun in the game was to be had at level 20. Now it isnt even a dustmote in the eye of the PC crowd. <br />

6. SoE is already raking in the profits. Does anyone really think any of the cash from this would actually be dovetailed into makeing the game better? It would be earmarked for production of some different game or a new boat for somebody. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">This isn't all that different from implementing casinos in game, or legalising prostitution in RL. <br />
<br />
By regulating it themselves they can put in safeguards to avoid their clients risking being screwed over when transacting through unofficial channels. The tradeoff is encouraging people to farm items to sell in RL. The choices are simple. <br />
<br />
On the one hand if they do this they condone the sale of items for RL money, which in a sense takes away from the experience of everyone who thinks ebay and buying stuff is cheating. But it brings the black market into the light where it can be regulated and controlled to a certain extent. Yantis will likely have a bazaar mule on every server and people will trasact with him directly in game at lower risk to themselves or their wallet. <br />
<br />
On the other if they don't then the people who already do this will simply keep doing it through other means, usually less safe. And it leaves the way wide open for black market to flourish. Natural selection will inevitably strike a few people who get screwed...which is something I have no actual problem with since they know the risk they're taking before they shell out the cash.<br />
<br />
Personally I think having people buy items is basically the same as someone playing with cheat codes but that's just me. If they do condone it by making it possible in game then the nature of the game will be irremediably changed for the worst.</div></div><hr />

I am surprised many people cannot see the difference between these two.  The survey was not about (1).</div></div><hr />

It was most definately about (1)<br />
<br />
That is like saying &quot;Well, you know, people are doing so much crack, lets just give them some at a good price that is regulated so that it is &quot;safe&quot; and free from defects and while we are at it, we should give these clients a safe place to do it as well&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why not simply make it harder for the selling of accounts and items a lot harder??<br />
<br />
I think it is a VERY BAD idea to buy / sell plat / items for RL money.<br />
<br />
Don't make the problem &quot;safe&quot;.  Get rid of the problem imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I wonder how much God Mode will cost?  EQ comes closer to a typical Sony console game every day.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I don't think Sony understands that their playerbase has been around all these years because of their unswerving faith in the game and the system of advancement in place.   People can safely assume a certain amount of knowledge and skill based on a player's gear, level etc and that will be gone in favor of MasterCard Maestro's.  Guilds will have one less way of screening appliants, as gear and possibly AA's will just be about money.  True, the current situation allows buying of gear and platinum to take place, but I think it is not at all commonplace because of the risk and stigma involved.  If SoE legitimizes the practice it will become rampant.  Why play the game if the rewards can just be bought?  Hanging out with friends won't be enough to keep people playing, as friends can do all manner of things together that are just as fun.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents, keep the change :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">&quot;Your sense of achievement comes from what you manage to do yourself.<br />
Your achievements aren't restricted by another person's actions.<br />
Play to get what you can out of the game for you.<br />
You can't measure your own success by comparing it against where other people around you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
These are not EQ lessons, they are LIFE lessons that most people can't even learn within their own lifetimes.  You can't expect them to learn and apply them within the course of a few years of playing EQ, which isn't even anything but trivial compared to life as a whole.<br />
<br />
Different places are different; people were different where I used to live, not that they didn't have their own set of characteristic unique problems.  But I've lived where I am now for more than 20 years, and I can tell you that a very small percentage of people live or believe as you advise, and that goes way more than double for how they feel about a game and what happens in it.  And remember, a lot of people playing EQ are KIDS or people of equivalent mentality(which is a word that does not mean intelligence) and shut-ins.<br />
<br />
In my experience, not just life but EQ too PRECISELY is ALL about where you are compared to others regardless of whether you earned it or not and regardless of who is deserving and who isn't.  You will bash your brains out against a wall until they're gone if you expect anything different, though what you would hope for or try to work toward is up to you.  It would be lovely if things weren't so.<br />
<br />
Sony will inevitably become happy to not just facilitate free transfers, but to buy and sell things to the average joe, and the average joe will be happy to buy things at least once in a while.  EQ isn't a sandbox full of saints; it's a bunch of schmoes just like anywhere else, and there's little of nobility about it.<br />
<br />
And that's what Sony will cater to.<br />
<br />
I think expecting Sony to do free transfers and nothing else, and keep it that way, is naive in the extreme, to the point of clownishness really.  They will inevitably find plenty of ways to squeeze more money out of the scheme.  <br />
<br />
Will it hurt the game?  For many, it will flat out ruin it.  Some level 40 punk running around with a TA is going to take all the drive and pride out of a lot of people.  Others won't care, and others will be standing in line to buy.  I think the better question to ask is, will it hurt a lot of players and the play experience?  Because I'm not sure it would necessarily clean out the monthly black ink at all.<br />
<br />
Whether it helps you or hurts your enjoyment of the game will be an individual matter, but I think it's very likely that question will be less than theoretical eventually.  There's too much money in doing this, and Sony has always both liked and understood money far better than it has liked, understood, or respected customers.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the poll is meaningless.  They already decided to do it.  The rest?  Don't get yourself excited about the outcome.  You already know what the outcome will be.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm just curious how much of a percentage Sony is going to try to glom on to when they do the item transfers.  I wonder how over the top they can go on their fees before people either refuse the service or ridicule the game to the skies?  I think that's what the poll is trying to determine right now.<br />
<br />
You can charge more for something that's acceptable than for something that you'll have fewer supporters of and customers for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Oh, Brothur, good luck on your idea for cleaning up the crack epidemic.  Not that it's worked for the last 20-some years, but...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I didn't read have the crap posted here, just wanted to post something that was posted by one of our members that attended the meeting recently at SOE:<br />
<br />
We got the low down on why the poll went up Sat morning.<br />
<br />
Basically 40% of all the petitions they handle have to do with items / plat in game being lost. Last month they processed 50k petitions. 70% of those that deal with items / plat are all scams or related to PA / IGE. To basically quote the head of CS when he was in my panel room,<br />
<br />
&quot;We are ****ing sick and tired of dealing with IGE, Yantis, and all of the other plat / account / item vendors, its wastes too much of our time and resources having to track down whats going on in those situations which takes away from real customer problems that you all have. If we can provide a controlled forum for this to happen, not only will we be able to track all of this stuff 100x faster, it will also probably flood the market with stuff making it basically worthless to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
They aren't planning to sell items that they generate (as far as EQ is concerned), they are only going to provide a means for players to transfer the items/cash in game under their regulation (for a % fee of course) so that they don't have to spend the enourmous amount of time, money, and manpower to deal with all the scams and problems IGE/Yantis is causing.<br />
<br />
&quot;it will also probably flood the market with stuff making it basically worthless to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
EXACTLY.   The reason a lot of people don't sell their items and plat now is because its against the EULA.  But as soon as SOE says its ok to sell and buy items for cash from other players using their service, the amount of plat and items that will flood the market will cause the real dollar value to drop like a rock.   Tons of people that normally wouldn't have sold their extra plat/items will now do so since its &quot;legal&quot;.  People will farm tons of cash thinking they can make some quick money.  But so much plat will flood the market for sale that it will quickly become not worth it.   People aren't going to spend the time to farm plat when plat prices reach insane low prices.  Would you sell your 200k in the bank for only $10?.   They will not only eliminate sites like PlayerAuctions/IGE (why risk using their service when you can used SOE's service) but they'll completely destroy the &quot;economy&quot; of selling items/plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Given the info from Sony on how much they are having to spend of their CS budget on scams, I'm ok with them doing something like this poll suggests.  I'm pretty wary of the implementation, but I'm open to ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">how do you think yantis got like 5 million pp on every server? i doubt he farmed it all, i bet a chip of the money goes to SoE <br />
<br />
the other poll question i saw is how many characters do you usually play? im wondering if they might make it possible to box more than 1 character on 1 account so you dont have to pay an arm and a leg to keep like 3-4 accounts active....<br />
<br />
as far as char trading goes, i dont know...getting 65 is alot of work and some dont wanna do it again so i think its a good idea to make a fair way to do it.</div></div><hr />

Maybe SOE is building a method to pay us to beta test for them. lol<br />

Do you somehow think it's any more fair to a raider (does it strike anyone around here that there are different levels of raiding?) to show up in POK one day and see some level 50 character wearing Elemental armor when that level 50 character has never even seen the zone from which the equipment he purchased and now wears comes from? What a damn insult. I worked VERY hard to get where I am, and I continue to work hard to get where I wish to go. Yes, WORK. A bigger RL paycheck should not make high-end gear accessible to people. Work and effort and skill should. <br />

I agree with you Thlayli ... hell the **** NO.<br />

Heh work.<br />
I work a 60 hr week most weeks thats what i call work.<br />
If you consider PLAYING EQ as work then to me theres something wrong.<br />
I play EQ to get away from work  its a leisure activity to me not work.<br />

Seriously, what was even more interesting was the other poll mentioning how many accounts you have.<br />
How bout they have a poll if Sony should address bugs or not?  Should shamans live in the ass-end of space?<br />
Wake the H up Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I completely fail to understand how this will drive Yantis out of business.<br />
<br />
If anything, this will INCREASE his business...this is a freaking gold mine for him. <br />
<br />
As everyone pointed out, SOE is working on safeguarding player to player transactions.  At this very moment, who is the biggest single person involved in that exact type of transaction?  <br />
<br />
Yantis.<br />
<br />
SOE guarantees you that Yantis will give you gear, SOE guarantees Yantis that he will get your RL money. Suddenly everyone feels safe buying plat from IGE because it's guaranteed by SOE.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - If/When SOE decides to offer their own items for sale, nothing will stop Yantis or other people from undercutting SOE on the price.  So SOE will have to have some sort of incentive to buy from them.  Hmmm...perhaps SOE will be the only place to buy No Drop items?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Hmmm...somehow I completely overlooked Jaradis' post.  His post makes sense to me, even though its practically the opposite of mine.  I guess I could see it either way. :)</div></div><hr />
