<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday we had a discussion in our guild about what cloak a shaman wants to wear and both sides had some good points. <br />
<br />
My current options are:<br />
<br />
A lodizal Shell Shield: <br />
+23 AC +10 Str -5 Agi +10 Wis +5 Cha +10 vsMg +20 vsFire +20 vsCold +5.00 Wt   Enduring Breath <br />
<br />
A Hierophant’s Cloak: <br />
 +10 AC +4 Str +4 Sta +4 Agi +4 Dex +4 Wis +4 Int +4 Cha +75 HP +75 Mana +1.00 Wt   <br />
<br />
Frostreaver’s Embroidered Cloak : <br />
+15 AC +8 Wis +8 Int +8 Cha +15 vsFire +15 vsCold +50 Mana +2.00 Wt   Spell Haste III <br />
<br />
Cloak of Mourning: <br />
+25 AC +15 Str +20 Wis + 100 HP +75 Mana +10 vsMg +10 vsFire +10 vsCold +10 vsPos +10 vsDis +0.10 Wt   Flowing Thought IV <br />
<br />
So my question is what would you prefer as cloak and more important why?<br />
<br />
(PS feel free to take a look at my gear and suggest a better cloak if I missed it)<br />
<br />
Edit: on request the stats</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">stats please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What Jin said.  I've never even been in the same zone as these cloaks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, balanced resists and 100hp plus 25AC with FT4...........<br />
<br />
What was the question again? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you had a real choice between all these, could you really pick anything else than the Cloak of Mourning??!?!<br />
<br />
DROOOOL<br />
<br />
<br />
EDITED - - <br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, just noticed the Spell Haste III......thinking.......still thinking.....ogre brain overheating.......this was a tough one......<br />
<br />
Would depend on my other gear I guess, particularly if I had Affliction Haste III on any other item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd say the cloak of the mourning is the best of the cloaks you listed. It is however also the hardest one to get being off the cursed. Nice balance of hps and resists and good ac with FT 4 as a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm still wearing a lod shield because of the resists and perma EB. I Currently like the resists and the EB over the hps on the hierophant cloak altho the hps are nice and might be more valuable to someone with less hps over all.<br />
<br />
My eventual go is a sapphire studded mantle to keep my perma eb and the cloak of the mourning as a cloak or a cloak of the black wind.<br />
<br />
Never did like the dain cloak personally and the effect isn't enough to make me wear it now but we do have shaman in guild who do wear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For asking this question given those cloaks you should have to do push-ups.<br />
<br />
But to summarize in three words:<br />
<br />
What Naagruz said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I had the option between those choices, I would wear the Cloak of the Mourning.  Hitpoints, mana, resists, and a big chunk of FT, best of the choices you have listed, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This thread is the closest I'll get to any of these cloaks. <br />
<br />
I would take the Cloak of Mourning until I could upgrade to something from PoP.<br />
<br />
Gear from New expansions/zones &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gear from older expansions/zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FT4 cloak is the obvious choice here, but most won't be able to get that and the other 3 are purchasable items so are much easier to obtain. <br />
<br />
My personal preference is HP&gt;AC&gt;Resists&gt;Wisdom&gt;Mana <br />
<br />
In this case, I prefer the Lodizal Shield over the other 2, but the spell haste 3 would be very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cloak of Mourning.<br />
<br />
then I'd probably go with the spell haste on dain cloak, even though its stats are the crappiest of all.  I'm a big fan of spell haste.  Your stats are pretty good so it shouldn't hurt you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are in a guild capable of getting a Cloak of Mourning, then you should take that one. The dain cloak shouldnt even be in the running since if you can get that cloak, you can get one of the other spell haste items that are available out there, and the ones I have seen are much better in terms of shaman type items, than the dain cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dain cloak clearly.<br />
<br />
Focus item effects have way more magnitude than some stats.  I pee-pee on stats against a focus III item, especially one with spell haste III.  <br />
<br />
The only question is whether you already got a spell haste III one.</div></div><hr />
