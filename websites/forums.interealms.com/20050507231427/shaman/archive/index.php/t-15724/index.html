<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eddiedale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya crucible.  First i want to thank each and everyone of you that posts on these boards regularly, you've been an invaluable source of info and insight to me and by far the biggest reason why 1) my Sham is built right, 2) why i'm a pretty good player, 3) how and why i've grown so much in the short 4 months i've been playing, he's level 62 now and Epic.  I really can't thank you enough..!  I love the game, the Shammy you've helped me build, and the Crucible for the vast amount of knowledge that is here from all of the time you guys have spent learning the hard way..!  I have a question about weapon procs for alpha dog, i know i've read here from time to time and different posts about certain ones procing different things, but of course now that i kinda need the info, i couldn't find what i was looking for.  I'm trying to hunt and solo in OS for items to sell for pp because the spell cost now is killing me.  Everytime it seems i go in there i get my kei dispelled, which really pisses me off...lol.  I can solo in there np without it, but it sure slows things down.  It seems no matter which slot it's in, it's the first one dispelled.  So i thought i'd try giving alpha dog some weapons that proc stun maybe and see if that keeps them from casting dispel on me.  I don't know, just a thought i had.  Which are the best ones for this...?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gnoll-hide lariat is the standard answer to that question. They used to be pretty common from Infected Paw. I don't see them much any  more. The stun is handy, but I wouldn't rely on it to interrupt too many casts. I use dogdog bashing and a mage air pet a lot in Sebilis and the casters still are able to get off a large number of spells and those annoying dispells on me fairly frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dual gnoll hide lariats on a hasted, focused, PEed, bashing pet helps a lot for me. Add in the mix a little VP (the AA) action with the knockback and those stupid shaman and wizard casters are toast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I usually go with a mix of these:<br />
<br />
-gnoll hide lariat: for stuns.<br />
-staff of writhing: procs chaotic feedback (stun), which is even better than lariat since proc is very hard to resist. Even use this in pvp, where it's good on targets that have even up to 200mr. Lore, can only use one.<br />
-serrated bone dirk: procs engulfing darkness, which snares the mobs, or at least strips their sow. Helps massively in decreasing the amounts of runners/trains you cause.<br />
-sword of skyfire for farming greencons and factioning. Fire rain ae proc.<br />
<br />
There's of course also the whole range of mage summoned items, but im usually too lazy to ask for them. The muzzle of mardu is nice tho as it gives your pet a bit extra attack speed.</div></div><hr />
