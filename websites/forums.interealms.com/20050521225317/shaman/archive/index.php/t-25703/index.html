<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>okoye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry guys, i know you all are tired of seeing them and BTW i did &quot;search&quot;, but all i could find were posts about SK, monk, warr, etc.  I have a 67 necro and now that i have the chance to box, i was thinking of making a shaman.  But the big question is this, what kind of high end camps would i be able to handle where 67 pet would be tanking, if any?  I am kind of curious as to what we would be able to take on, if kiting wasn't an option.  I really dont know much about shamans, so i figured i would ask the experts here. Thanks in advance for your responses.<br />

( Just to give you an idea, nec has 3.5k hps 5.5mana unbuffed with most offensive aa's and very few defensive aa's )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">necro and shaman rock anywhere the mobs dont summon.  in high end encounters nowadays a necro pet wont last more then a couple rounds at most.  <br />
<br />
what you have to look at is what the shaman could tank. the shaman with max defensive aa's will tank better then the pet, regardless of gear (in otherwords bazaar geared).  not to mention to do any real damage the shaman would wind up tanking anyway.<br />
<br />
yes the necro will out damage the shaman, but the minute the necro gets summoned he will FD and who will wind up tanking?  thats right the shaman, NOT the necro pet.<br />
<br />
if your not fighting summoning mobs, then you will be kiting.<br />
<br />
editted:  just remembered there is at least one NC named that doesnt summon.  cant remember the name of hand...  im positive the great shaman solo'ers here will know it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>necrognomicon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi,<br />
<br />
First post here, but felt i had to reply to the above poster on two boxing.<br />
I two box a 70 necro with 350 and a 68 shammy with 125 aa, my gear isn't great at all but have both 1.5's. necro has like 7 k hps buffed normally and we can kill summoning mobs no problems with a tiny bit of space. <br />
<br />
The thing is you don't use the shammy to tank. Necro pulls with lowest damage snare as you do not want mob to fall below 98 pct when it starts summoning. Root it, malo it, reroot it, spam some more snares for agro, slow it, crippling spasm it, crippling claudication it, spam some more snares at it, root it again, unleash dog dogs, army of the dead, send pets in, activate both epics and stuff like ancestral aid, grip of mori it then commence lifetapping the named into oblivion whilst spamming necro with heals. <br />
<br />
Key to success is fast killing and at present with plenty of kiting corpses around i can spam the mob with 13 pets. Can kill any named in Rcod with no problems at all now, usually don't fall below 50 pct. You just have to be quite precise and not engage until fully debuffed which is no problems with malo and root as the mob won't summon till your dps goes in (took a lot of deaths working out what i think is a good strategy). Going to try and duo some mpg named soon. Anyhow point of the post is that necro/shammy combo is actually one of the best combo's for a lot of named imho. Sure there are others but we can hold our own with equipment that leaves much to be desired. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>okoye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the input guys, greatly appretiated.  Yea, soloing oow named was kind of the idea here, but i dont think my necro has the gear yet to tank tap these kind of mobs.  Im sure by the time my sham got to 65+ the necro would be alot better in the gear department so i think i am going to go this route.  I've had alot of people say that the bst would be the best to 2box with but imo, i see the sham working out better here.  Again thanks for the responses. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Butogz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Necro and Shaman is probably one of best duo combinations I can think of other than a druid &amp; enchater charming duo. I duoed a lot with a 70 necro before she server transfered, and it was some of the funnest times I have had in EQ. <br />
<br />
Once mob is slowed necro pet can easly tank most any &quot;one groupable mob&quot; (we would fully buff 2 pets and suspend one before we took on harder named). If it is a bit to much for the pet even when slowed the necro can life tap FD flop tank wonderfully.  Leaving corpses for wake the dead is godly. This is expecially easy to do for all the BoT named since you can clear tons of fast kill giants giving corpses and makeing a huge clear fighting area.  Also in griegs end it is so easy to make fast large corpse piles before duoing the servitor of luclin.<br />
<br />
We never did any WoW camps before she transfered, but as a solo Shaman I can take down NC named with ease, and RCoD with some effort.  But with a necro FD pulling RCoD and the added insane DPS that a necro brings to the table, you could get both characters nicely geared (or super rich) and all spells 66-70 in no time.<br />
<br />
Also, when we did experiance grinding in PoFire we could kill the mob before VP3's duration ran a single course, which means we could get 2 blue AA every 1.5-2 minutes without going below 80% mana.  Which is another point to make, Necro and Shaman have the best mana regen in the game so down time for this duo is almost null.  <br />
<br />
I say do the duo!</div></div><hr />
