<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw this thread and I about died.  I dont know if it has been posted here yet, but take a look at what Good Bards used to be able to do.  6 AA's every 20 minutes or so, no joke. It has been nerfed now but still is quite amazing that it was allowed to go on for as long while everyone was saying how chanters were sooo very overpowered. Kinda Ironic. Really though the fact that Worry and others managed to pull this off is amazing. This wasnt something your everyday Bard could do, at least not to this extent. Anyways this was pretty amazing IMO.<br />

Both smart people but this kind of behavior is not good for the game.  It is good that it got nurfed.</div></div><hr />

LOL Valka!  The most I love about these posts are the bards and enchanters who claim how dangerous it is!  Ohhh, it's so dangerous.  And hard.  Gets me everytime.  For me, duo'ing in PoS and pulling two mobs instead of one is dangerous.  Generally fatal.</div></div><hr />
