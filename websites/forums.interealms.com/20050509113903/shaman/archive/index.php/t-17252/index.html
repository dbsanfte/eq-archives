Out of curiosity, it's not set to use the ` key (right next to the 1 key on the top row of the keyboard) is it?  I know I had this function mapped there, and in the last patch SoE forced the ` key as an alternate to the F8 key.<br />
<br />
From the last patch message..<br />
<br />
- You can now use the (`) key to &quot;Target nearest NPC&quot;, in addition to F8. <br />
<br />
If that's not it, not too sure....</div></div><hr />

Check your keyboard options under the UI section, there should be something like &quot;Switch between targets&quot; or something like that at the bottom of the section, and assign it to an unused key.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you had an_orc_pawn00 targeted, then you went to target an_orc_pawn01.  Now you want to go back to targeting an_orc_pawn00, hit that hotkey and it retargets that one. <br />
<br />
It was introduced in a patch in May or June I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh it is the ` key =) I'll check that when I get home, that's probably the problem.. I sety it to that key since it's right above the tab key and I use that one a lot too =)<br />
<br />
oyah.. and to the question that was made about the hotkey in question..<br />
<br />
Options menu(alt+o), then to keyboard. on the dropdown menu, switch it to all. Towards the bottom somewhere you'll see a programable option that says last 2 targets. Program that to a key of your choice, and play around with it. You can switch between 2 mobs that you are fighting at once. Also very helpful when you are charm fighting. you can attempt to keep the pet on the second target(takes practice) and when you see charm break switch target and slow so the chanter doesn't get his arse whooped</div></div><hr />

Exact same reason I picked that key :)</div></div><hr />
