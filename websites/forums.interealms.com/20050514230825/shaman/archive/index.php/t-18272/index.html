<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone says shaman DPS sucks so badly . but I often feel like im doing respectable damage . Am I just flatering myself ?<br />
Typicly I exp in LDoN or Tactics .<br />
Most fights I am able too use Dogdog , bane and athema . the dots dont usualy reach full duration but i get 3-4 ticks outta them . In tactics the often do reach full duration . I dont use BoS much becase BoS/Bane gets me major agro .<br />
So Athema + Bane is like 700per Tic right ? so if I get 3-4 ticks im prob kickin out 2500pts in DoT dmg per mob in a typical LDoN .<br />
Then theres the puppy .. I know hes not a HUGE damage dealer but I think its pretty fair too say im dealing 3k per mob in my typical LDoN group .<br />
Now I admit 3k per mob Isnt a HUGE deal but its VERY sustainable by me . And It just dosent seem THAT bad . Sometimes I even drop a Vstrike but thats not too often though ..<br />
So what are your opinions ... do you really feel your DPS is very low ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm one of about 7 shaman in a guild that JUST got flagged for Plane of Time, so we are all decently geared but not totally outrageously so...on heavy shaman raids (pretty much anything over 4 shaman) we often have time to nuke/dot. Suprisingly, it's fairly common for at least one shaman to make it into the top 10 dps parses. And yes, the shaman actually lives thru the fight hehe. These parses are usually done by our melee folks checking their dps, and you should hear em when they say &quot;***, how'd a shaman get in there&quot; ...especially when their parses don't cover anything but our nukes/aes, and any DD component to dots we toss out. <br />
<br />
About the only thing I'd REALLY like to see in regards to our DPS output, is at nuke with a 1k plus base hit, and/or a faster casting nuke that hits for more than 675, mostly for exp groups. I like Bane and all, but sometimes you need that damage right now, not in a tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally don't feel like our dps is low, but I do feel that any dps we can add to a group is just icing on the cake.  The problem with our dps is, after we slow, our dots are huge agro magnets if you have a war in your group, and hell even sometimes blood of saryrn/bane pulls agro off of sk/pal's.  So I might throw a BoS on at 60% in an exp group, and maybe a tears of saryrn or a velium strike at the end, and I feel satisfied with the damage I have done. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget indirect damage such as the extra damage added through avatar.  Usually this is the only damage I contribute, but only because I am the main healer and slower and (if necessary) crowd control so ALL of my spell gems are tied up.  I usually dont have time to nuke or DOT anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was duoing with a Ranger the other day, and he made the comment that he was being outdamaged by a Shaman. He seemed a little embarrased. :)<br />
When you can stack a dot, both rains, and both nukes while all that is running; your DPS is going to be pretty good. This is after slow, and, or debuffing. <br />
I told him it was one of our little secrets that we could do that much damage in a short period of time and be able to do our main job on the very next pull.<br />
So, our DPS is not *bad*, its just not the reason you would invite a Shaman into your group. And I agree we should get some upgrades to our nuking line. On big raid targets, after maximum debuffs, I still get my already paltry damage mitigated down quite a bit. A 1k+ high end nuke would be real nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, if you use a poison dot and start raining, I've a feeling you're going to get agro (unless of course you're talking about a big boss mob that someone's gotten a lot of agro on already beforehand).  Also, in a normal LDoN situation, for example, if you're going to rain a lot, you're likely going to need malos as well, which is a big mana sinker-- might as well just dot and use velium strike (with focus item) over and over again.<br />
<br />
Also, the best one can do really is dot+(alternate rain1 and rain2)... I don't think you can cast rain1 then rain2 and then nuke before rain1 refreshes (i.e. by the time you are able to nuke you should've been able to recast rain1 instead).<br />
<br />
I could be wrong of course. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I want to see them add a poison nuke damage focus (akin to the e'ci line for cold damage, etc) so that we can use our elemental gloves to maximum effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bane + BoS = ~120 DPS, no matter how long they last. 1 tick of each is ~120 DPS. Its not real tricky math. Of course, if the mob only lived for 1 or 2 ticks of each, its some damn expensive DPS. <br />
<br />
I do solid DPS and no one can say I don't. I have SCF3 now so my mace procs 900, and is nearly unresistable. This is super nice in XP groups. On raids, I generally drop Bane (after my other duties) then alternate between SoT and a Tnarg on the MA or RT. Nothing spectacular DPSwise, but much more will get me summoned more often than not. <br />
<br />
Honestly, if there is one thing I would like to see Shaman get, it would be a de-aggro spell so we can do MORE damage. The 4th+ shaman on most raids are basically just dead weight. Sure they can nuke and DOT and heal a little etc, but certainly not like having &quot;spare&quot; wizards or mages, who can REALLY blow things up. However, with some form of de-aggro, we could really let it hang out a little.<br />
<br />
Note: Time equiped Shaman are kinda an exception, they have the AC, HPs and AA to suck up a LOT of hits. Curretnly I can break 6200 hps and 1300 AC, and I can probalby solo the giants in Sol Ro toe-to-toe, but getting mushed by Reparm because I overaggroed isnt real high on my list of &quot;things to do&quot; heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solo/duo, my DPS is the suck though - I have too many other responsibilities.  it does allow me to let rip with high aggro DoTs though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would have to use a disease dot if you don't want aggro. Also the example was duoing, not LDoN. LDoN mobs need to die fast enough that you wouldn't have time to put that many spells on him. I never debuff just so rains will land by the way, if I've debuffed it was to get slow in. Resists on our rain spells do suck, but they are not that mana intensive, so it pays off in the end.<br />
This isn't something your going to do all the time, its just something you can do. Mages and Wizards, for example, can pack more damage into a smaller time, with less effort than us. We CAN do it, but the time/situation does not always allow.<br />
On the other hand, have you ever not been able to put an XP group together because you had no Mage? Have you ever seen a guild stop in its tracks because it didn't have enough Beastlords?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, for a class not meant to do DPS in a fight, we do damn well. Our self-inflicted damage (DoTs, DD, pet) is respectable enough on exp targets, and our ambient damage (Haste and buffs) isn't anything to ignore. I personally wouldn't mind a little upwards tweaking (even if it's just improving the efficiency or cast times of spells we have), but I feel I'm pretty solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think our dps sits at about the right spot. A bit more in the way of &quot;instant&quot; damage would be nice for when a mob needs to be dead right away, but sustainable dps via rains, dots and nukes is respectable whilst not really treading on the toes of everyone else.<br />
<br />
As pointed out above, BoS + Bane = 120dps. Now that's pretty respectable and somewhere like BoT or Tactics with horse, kei and canni V its also sustainable as mobs last a little while. In LDoN I tend to stick to rains and nukes - which I use will depend somewhat on resists and crowd control tactics. If we're root-parking adds I'll keep up BoS to stick on rooted mobs. <br />
<br />
If I'm playing one of my other chars and want dps I sure as hell won't choose a shaman, but I don't feel we're totally useless in the dps department. We don't have the big fast bangs but with our mana regen we can sustain decent dps throughout a session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">anyone have a list of DPS per class to compare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bane + Blood is good DPS, but the problem lies in the fact that we often can't use both dots on the same target for either aggro reasons or because the mob is immune to one or the other. I think only one of the four BoT bosses is susceptible to both poison and magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's always nice to see DPS figures on paper and then compare them to your real DPS. <br />
Bane + Blood might look like 120 DPS, but if you factor in resists and the time you spend on doing other things before and during the DoT'ing, you end up doing about 80 DPS, if that. Aggro is another significant issue when using DoTs as your source of DPS<br />
<br />
Shaman DPS in PoP is sub par for the very reasons stated above. You may think it's better than it really is, that's why you should take the time and parse your fights.<br />
Mana regen isn't an issue in PoP, no well equipped caster will go OOM on a Boss encounter anymore, so that Canni isn't making up for the lack of DPS like it was during Luclin.<br />
<br />
Whenever you feel like your DPS is great, just go to Lucy and compare our damage spells to other classes to see how it is in reality. Most Shamans in highend guilds will take the safe route of chain casting Velium Strike with a 30-35% nuke focus(DPS doesn't matter if you die 30 seconds into the fight), which, using a 20-23% haste item and cleric haste buff, will put your sustained DPS at about 120-130 for the fight.<br />
<br />
That's about as much as an unbuffed high end Monk does.<br />
<br />
Necromancers and Mages will likely be doing 220ish sustained DPS at raids(again, sustained), while Wizard and Rogue will probably be a good 30 points higher. This is the DPS figure at the very high end spectrum of the game, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I alluded to this in another thread, but I was on my 63 Enchanter, duoing with a 64-65 Shaman in FG (He was doing Shard hunting).  He had KEI and (iirc) 164 AA's.  He was using dog dog (I am not sure about this it's been awhile). I had a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
He told me he was pumping out about 800 DPS. Note he was not jumping up and down like a first grader who had to go 'potty' doing Cann. He would periodically, but not every opportunity.  It was simple root, + dot, + my charmed pet. Any extras got mezzed or rooted. <br />
<br />
Now he had all the toys, but didn't bother to use a Fungal. He had Malo, Epic and his guild is one of the top 10 on Xev. (Can't remember his name though. Oh well, EQ and life imitate each other).<br />
<br />
But he was dropping Pox + Bane + Blood + a slew of other dots inc Epic. Heck he might have been using Ebolt too. :).  He would only melee if the MOB aggroed him.<br />
<br />
800 DPS. That number I am sure about. Even if he 'dramatized' by 100%, 400 DPS in a duoing group (we had about as much chance of dying as I do of Jenny McCarthy knocking on my door tonight looking to solo ME) is pretty darned good.</div></div><hr />

It does depend on a lot of things.  Some way of reducing Agro would be wonderful.  The other day against Hydro I kept Bane + Blood up the whole time, for that 120ish DPS.  ((only had maybe 1 or 2 resists balanced against the Burning Affliction item))  I got summoned and killed at like 20.  This was with a warrior using BOC + edge of eternity i think from time auged with anger3.  So not the best combo yet, but a fairly good one.<br />
<br />
a lot of times, I don't run with a chanter.  As such when 2+ mobs come in during an LDON run.  At least one of them is going to get fully dotted bane, blood, even epic.   Its often not a surprise for the mob to be 50ish or lower, by the time the melees get to it.<br />
<br />
We have more ability to chain cast on a raid/boss encounter than your typical druid.  Due to Cann.  But our edge in mana regen has whitled away as we havent got a cann upgrade.  ((Mana Regen Buffs Increasing means that % wise Cann is a smaller % upgrade in mana regen than it used to be.  Same true for more efficient nukes))</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can maybe hit a peak of 800DPS for a few seconds while all dots are active but it's a meaningless number. The same goes for the 120DPS figure for Bane and BoS, you aren't doing 120DPS from the beginning to the end of a fight, which is what average DPS implies. <br />
<br />
Realisitically, in an outdoor exp group I can put out around 100DPS over the course of an evening between rains, the occasional DoT and my puppy. I doubt many shaman will get much past that without high end focus/FT gear It also seems about right when you compare it with the people I group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A shaman was doing 800 DPS because he told you he was? <br />
<br />
Pardon me for not believing him. Maybe... MAYBE if you added up all those DOT's it'd come out to 800 DPS, but let's see, that'd be 4800 per tick? <br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn - 320/tick. <br />
Bane - 420/tick<br />
Scourge of Nife - 254 (?)/tick<br />
Bane of Nife - 214/tick<br />
<br />
The disease dot's are all lower/tick. Anathema is somewhere near where Bane of Nife is /tick, maybe a bit more. You could add up all 5 of them, and add 30% as a guess for the ultimate dot focus item, and you'd come up with about 1800/tick. Which would be 300 DPS. More impressive than I expected, actually.  But by the time you've stacked 5 dot's, Bane and Anathema are running out and you have to recast them. So it's practically impossible to stack more than 5 dot's - unless you stack a bunch of slow ones first, and ignore all the casting time issues it took you to get them going, and then pretend all that time when most of these dot's aren't active doesn't affect your DPS. <br />
<br />
And even then, you wouldn't really add all THAT much, since the epic and disease dots are so low/tick, compared to Bane and Blood. And that's also assuming you're doing nothing but casting dot's, in which case you're not canni'ing, except for CanV.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Calculating Shaman DPS based off the potential damage for all of our dots is like calculating melee damage assuming max hits every time. It just doesn't work like that. You miss ticks, spells get resisted, you manage aggro, and all of a sudden things just don't look so good. A Ranger shooting a mob for a 3k crit with Trueshot is by no means an accurate representation of what their actual damage output is.</div></div><hr />

I havent' done the math, but I don't think shamans could hit 4800/tick even if we stacked every dot from level one up, ignoring the fact that that'd be impossible due to cast times. ;)<br />
<br />
800/tick, maybe...  no way 800dps.<br />

By dotting the 2nd mob I do about 20% of the damage. <br />
<br />
I would like an upgraded poison nuke, quick casting like Spear of torment for 900 ish dd. I don't like the fact theres a Blast of Venom and a Spear of torment and the only difference being is one has a lesser failure rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">120 DPS isn't hard to maintain for a shaman on just about any mob. However, in order for a shaman to reach and maintain 180+ dps, he'd have to be dealing with the right mob.<br />
<br />
A shaman bent on DPS on a low poison resist raid level mob can do respectable damage. In fact, on such a mob, in terms of sustained dps, we usually out damage everybody except wizards, mages, beastlords, monks, and rogues. I listed the melee dependent dps classes at the end, because in many fights melee isn't really an option because of the need to avoid or dodge AEs. I didn't list rangers because inevitably the mob gets pinned somewhere and archery becomes useless.<br />
<br />
Our damage potential is highly situational. However, to a lesser extent, so is everyone else's.<br />
<br />
In exp groups the situation is totally different. Unless a mob has the hps to live for the duration of our dots, our sustained dps is far less than spectacular.</div></div><hr />

I have gave up on the dotting the mobs long time ago.  Probably you'll get better DPS and less headaches sticking with the DD all the way with FM3.<br />
<br />
I am never going to go back to using dots ever again.  Total waste of my resourses while grouping with exp group or Solo'ing.<br />

I actually kill mobs lot faster with sticking with DD while solo'ing, equip doggy with the mage summoned items and equip myself with DD bracer, earring and Ring.  <br />
And where is the Extended Dot bracer goes???  In the trash can!!!!<br />

<br />
I don't have a problem with shaman dps.  Bane was a HUGE boost.<br />
<br />
As far as raid encounters or xp groups go, I tend to just use rains or velium strike.  But we're not about dps in raid encounters or xp groups, so I don't really care if that dps is 'good' or not.  A heal that keeps a rogue alive is far more dps than anything else we could do.<br />

If the mobs are exceptionally high hps, then we shine much more brightly in a DPS role.  But with the typical 10khp exp mob, in a full group, we aren't a good choice for DPS&gt;  <br />

That said, we are the ONLY class that can fully support a group AND still be able to deal some DPS in addition to our other contributions.   Puppy plus Bane is my usual thing (100 DPS) when filling the role of group healer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">800 DPS. That number I am sure about. Even if he 'dramatized' by 100%, 400 DPS in a duoing group (we had about as much chance of dying as I do of Jenny McCarthy knocking on my door tonight looking to solo ME) is pretty darned good.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of our dots including Ancient Scourge of Nife combined per tick would be 2325.  It would take over 80 seconds from casting times alone to apply all of those dots, meaning you wouldn't even be able to finish applying half of them before they would start wearing off.  Not to mention that you would have to be unscribing and scribing dots left and right to be able to cast them all.  I just had to do this to show how impossible it would be for a shaman to even dream of doing 800 dps.  400 dps maybe in a very short burst with wave dd's, our best dps dot's, pet, and 5 aa pets....maybe, but no possible way to sustain that much dps for more than a few seconds.</div></div><hr />

I stack multiple dots on raids, but I cannot keep them up. Not because I lose mana, but because no tank can keep up with the aggro generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You also end up hitting a cast time vs duration wall on dot dps.  Cast Bane, BoS, Ultor, etc and by the time the third lands, Bane wears off, then after recasting Bane, BoS wears off, etc.  During this time you can do nothing but recast dots too.  This all depends on the mob living that long too.  I usually stick with nuking unless it is a very high hp boss mob that happens to be suceptible to dots (and the debuffing/rebuffing/etc is being taken care of by others).  Cazic Thule is a good example.  You can dot him pretty much non stop until he kills you :).  <br />
<br />
Velium Strike with focus effects and crits is highly underrated.  I seem to have fairly short windows of time where I can contribute damage while performing my other duties, and nukes just take less planning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with most of what is said here, but I also feel (like Penny) that our DPS is decent and that what we really need to shine is aggro management. I am actually VERY solid DPS in LDoN, with the Sharkspine Club and FoM. 900 procs go a long way. VP + Bane on an add and melee the primary or just SoT it dead. On raids, if we have a lot of shaman, I generally try to FA as many as possible as a DOT is ticking, then heal. My job on Raids isnt DPS. In XP groups in the EPs, I melee as well, adding the procs to my total DPS. The amount of DOT/Nuking I can do depends on who the tank is. Paladins and SKs, I let it rip, Warriors I am more cautious, Monks I just let him deal it and melee only.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">While grouping, my dps is nonexistant usually as I tend to be in very melee heavy groups. In those instances, I am healer, slower and CC if necessary. My contribution to dps in those instances is, as Blazz mentioned, to FA all the melee. I don't have the time usually to swap damage spells in and out, so I dont do damage. If there is another healing class in the group, then I will mem Bane or Velium strike but in groups, I am usually THE support system. Soloing, I can do decent dps. I don't put up the numbers a rogue will, but they can't solo. ;) Bane, Blood and Ultor are very nice and will average around 140ish dps. In all likelihood though, that number is a touch high. I am usually casting the dots as they fade to be as mana efficient as possible. Or some time will be lost due to root breaking and having to reposition the mob. I'd rather kill a touch slower with NO downtime than blow my load, so to speak, and then have a wincing session between each pull. :)</div></div><hr />

Once you have the time to dedicate to DPS you can do some significant damage. I noticed this in VT once with my old guild. We had so many shaman that i didnt really need to heal or slow or cripple or anything and since the mobs take so long to kill, i put up my DoTs.<br />
<br />
2 things i notice. <br />
<br />
#1 the mobs died noticably faster when i was stacking DoTs.<br />
<br />
#2 i discovered a fun game to play. Its called steal aggro from the MA and live to tell about it. I would routinely pull aggro from the MA and im not talking taunt aggro from landing a DoT, im talking damage aggro form DoTs that were already landing. The game was to put out just the right DPS to get summoned and get smacked for a while, then to give it back to the MA before you die. Was the only thing i thought was fun about VT other then looting a dead mob corpse.</div></div><hr />

Typicly I exp in LDoN or Tactics .<br />
Most fights I am able too use Dogdog , bane and athema . the dots dont usualy reach full duration but i get 3-4 ticks outta them . In tactics the often do reach full duration . I dont use BoS much becase BoS/Bane gets me major agro .<br />
So Athema + Bane is like 700per Tic right ? so if I get 3-4 ticks im prob kickin out 2500pts in DoT dmg per mob in a typical LDoN .<br />
Then theres the puppy .. I know hes not a HUGE damage dealer but I think its pretty fair too say im dealing 3k per mob in my typical LDoN group .<br />
Now I admit 3k per mob Isnt a HUGE deal but its VERY sustainable by me . And It just dosent seem THAT bad . Sometimes I even drop a Vstrike but thats not too often though ..<br />
So what are your opinions ... do you really feel your DPS is very low ?<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Hi Grim, as someone pointed out above most high level shaman (time+, 400+aa's) just chain ice nukes after malos, slow.<br />
<br />
If we are talking about LDON (may it rest in peace) it really depends on the dps of the group.  As you know, killing time varies hugely 20 sec to 45 sec lets say.<br />
<br />
But, lets talk Omens now.  Again average fights have a variance but less so than LDON.  I'd say 40 sec to 1 min depending on the group dps.  I'd say I can blast out 5 ice nukes averaging (including resists, crits, etc. 35% Focus) about 1k per = 5k/fight (about 100dps).  I can keep that up in chain group with crack and cannying to beat all, but it's not easy.<br />
<br />
I parsed my new epic with ice proc aug in MPG yesterday.  I had on FA also to help kick my attack up to 1525 so I could hit something.  I was cranking out approximately 3k in damage per fight.  And using no mana and was available for spot heals instantly.  <br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm thinking that most times I'm now better off doing melee now until I get the new ice nuke (which is such a big joke to begin with, and at 6th in order for 69 spells is also a big joke - further evidence that the developers have little clue).<br />
<br />
I'd much rather do rains and poison nuke but the developer's (my buddies) have not put in poison focus items except for one in GoD.<br />
<br />
Anyway, pretty sad that a fully focused, 500aa shaman is just about as good hiting f1 as I am cranking out nukes and cannying like crazy to regain mana.  Yes, I think our nukes are underpowered and slow casting. Don't even get me started on DOT's which I gave up 2 years ago although I suppose when I get the higher level bane spell, cranking out those two dots and meleeing is probably the way to go - nice that I invested all those aa's in nuke crits huh?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I loaded up a parsing program the other day to check my rogue. I left it up when I switched to my Shaman. It's not great with parsing spell damage but for self dps it is okay. Along with debuffing I parsed my DPS including the zerg puppies on a raid. Best I got was around 120dps I think. Average was 80dps. To put it in perspective the rogues were around 340-420 and it scaled down from there, BLs around 200-220, Wars around 180, Rangers did well, 250-290ish, monks 240-290, Paladins dead last aside from casters at around 90-120. Bards around 120-150. I think I could do more damage with some effort and the right mobs but again it's aggro that holds us back, stack much more than 2 dots and an occasional nuke and you will be eating turff on raids and tanking in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah forgot to mention - if I had pet up that would have added around 30dps from the parsing I did.</div></div><hr />

   That my friend is the pure (noticable) damage capacity you have. its not bad, situational of coarse, but not bad.  I was doing primals a few months ago, and I found myself uin a situation to be able to chain rains, rogue was doing parses(he cant parse DoT DMG btw) druids scored over 20K I scored 10.5 k in roughly a 8 min fight. <br />

----------<br />
<br />
Not too many math wizards in this forum.  Yoppa is 450/tick which is 450/6= 75dps when it lands, add 15% for burning affliction and aa's, less resists 20% (just for conversation) = 71.25 dps.  At 7 ticks if you malos and slow immediately and cast this you may get full duration if fight is 50+ seconds, maybe.  Then you cast bane, for example, which takes about 10 more seconds to cast including Yoppa refresh. 5 ticks at 420/tick, 60dps, say 57dps after the above mentioned modifiers.  Again you might get full duration.. if fight is 50+ seconds maybe.<br />
<br />
Now that damage is about exactly equal to chain casting 5 velium strikes fully focused and aa'd.  Difference is you have 20 seconds to melee (or whatever), you burn 350 less mana. Good deal. Bad deal is you might not get full duration and you might mess up a potential mez if things go bad.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the math adds up (I'm sure Ryan is happy I said that) and Shaman are exactly where the &quot;developers&quot; of EQ want them to be....100 dps, 125ish (situationally) with fluffy whether using DOT's or nukes in a typical experience group kill of 50 seconds.  Developer says, hmmm, shaman malos and slows, kicks out 125 dps (situationally), and has buffs that add indirect damage (wunshi, FA, might) and situationally haste. Also Shaman can situationally heal and cc &quot;woot, no need for balance ..... on to next class&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If anyone wants a lesson in what Ryan is thinking read the above.<br />
<br />
The $100 question is do we have enough slow advantage, buffs, heals, cc, etc. to warrent being 75/dps ish behind a Beastlord?  I think so in Omens, in my personal opinion if you have all our spells (not counting ancients).<br />
<br />
The next $100 question is how do we stack up against Chanters?  Well the calculation isn't as easy as with Beastlords but I can take a guess.  We slow better than a chanter... I have no doubt about that if you have the GoD slow.  Our buffs are pretty good now, crack is easy to buy and I'm guessing chanter chain nuking is about the same as Shaman all things considered.  So it gets down to healing vs CC as the x factor. If we just had a serious negative resist modifier on VP we could halfway be ghetto mezzers, but it is next to worthless in difficult content.  Mez is better than spot healing 2 rampaging DPS machines in MPG wacking everything in sight.<br />
<br />
So, I continue to believe that fluffy innate duel wield, increase in talsman of alacrity to 60%, and a adding a negative (100?) resist modifier on VP is our balance equation.  Oh, and cut our ice nuke cast time down to the druids # of 6.35 seconds (pure annoyance issue and also so we can hit things in raid clearings - amazing how ice nuke always has about a second left to cast when raid clearing mob is killed). And for goodness gracious add a poison nuke focus readibly obtainable in Omens for those of us who would prefer to rain and nuke (that be me, btw).  Oh and give us the ability to add pet focus items - we are a pet class btw.<br />

the dps problem is when we get in a group. malos/slow then we get to start piling on dps. 10 seconds after the rest of the group starts we get to start casting one of our eternal castime low damage nukes or a dot that doesnt have a chance to finish. we usually dont inflict any damage at all for a full 15-20 seconds in an exp group...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Fix aggro on Blood of Saryrn to not be insane and set the recast time on Bane to 15 seconds if it gets resisted instead of the normal 30 and I'd be a happy Shaman.  Our aggro is REALLY ridiculous.  I can steal aggro practically any time I want if a warrior is tanking.  Even last night, I was running a moderate BoS/Bane combo on An Elemental Masterpiece in Air last night.  The mob was near dead and our tank dropped and I immediately had aggro and was chewed up and spit out.  There's no way I was outdamaging the entire raid with 800hp every 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
Now that damage is about exactly equal to chain casting 5 velium strikes fully focused and aa'd. Difference is you have 20 seconds to melee (or whatever), you burn 350 less mana. Good deal. Bad deal is you might not get full duration and you might mess up a potential mez if things go bad.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the math adds up No it doesn't because you fail to take into account Velium Strike landing for partial(which it seems to do a lot).  DoTs, once they stick, land for their full values.  Nukes are too sketchy to say that.</div></div><hr />

Every time you parsed, you should include other people you parsed as well so we could see a comparison.<br />

Right now wizards in my guild w/o proper focus or spells are hitting 8.4k crits. That's in 6 seconds including 1 concussion. 1400dps but if they don't crit at all it's 700dps.. if you average and round down you get 1000dps. &quot;on paper&quot; but in reality on boss mobs they only do around 550.. so take whatever paper numbers you have, divide by 2 and that's where we are at. 100dps maybe 125. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I have heard that one problem with parsers  i don't and haven't yet used one so maybe i am wrong) is they often only count your dps when you are actually hitting the mob, and don't use some kind of input to signify the beginning (pull) and (end) of a raid fight.<br />
<br />
I noticed a symptom of this trait when someone posted a parse from a raid mob, and i only had ever fired one nuke in the fight (was too busy healing) and it showed my DPS as massive. <br />
<br />
Are there any parsers that can achieve this? (even if it meant kicking the thing off with a kepyress and stopping it)<br />
<br />
On the whole i &quot;feel&quot; that on raid type situations or mobs my DPS is perfectly decent, but that in groups it's pretty rubbish. I might be totally wrong. I haven't parsed it and am in no hurry to.<br />
<br />
OOW was a clear DPS tweak for shamans since mobs have more HPs so you can dot much more than in GoD. So DPS isnt just about how fast we can stack the dots, but also about mob HPs, and how we can deal with the agro. If you look at necro dots ours arent THAT much worse, but they have a built in way to deal with agro (FD), we don't. <br />
<br />
From what I've seen Druids are doing similar DPS to us, but win a higher DPS due to their superior nukes. This is again based on my &quot;feel&quot; and not any parses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And why is the minimum damage for nukes showing in the parser 893(Yoppa's Rain), if you were alternating rains? Shouldn't it be 650(Tears of Saryrn)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">DPS problems are as follows:<br />
(1) Too much aggro on DoTs.<br />
(2) No resistance modifiers on DoTs or nukes.<br />
(3) DD slightly too slow and/or weak.<br />
(4) GoD direction towards faster fights (ameliorated slightly in OOW) minimalizes DPS of all dot classes--therefor a little help in DD department should be given.<br />
<br />
Sustained 120 dps is about right imo for shaman at level 65. However, a shaman should be able to do this without excessive aggro or resists, and should be able to switch to DDs to get close to this level.<br />
<br />
I do believe that all three priest classes should be mostly interchangeable, all three tanks should be mostly interchangeble, all three pullers (rangers/monks/bards) should be mostly interchangeable, and the other dps classes should be mostly interchangeable. The difference would be in utility and in area and mob expertise.<br />
<br />
Thus, I think our dps woes are minor, and mostly should be taken care of by needed adjustments for necromancers (lowered aggro on dots/shorter duration dots) and a few slight upgrades for shaman (dd cast time and dd and dot and rain poison resist adjustments).<br />
<br />
The heal issue is where the trouble is at--you must have enough healing to survive the worst burst damage to be experienced during the crawl--otherwise all die. Slow is thus essentially useless if the highest dps mob cannot be slowed. Healing power required is gaged on the worst mob likely to be fought, not on the easy mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Let us define DPS.<br />
<br />
DPS = damage per second.<br />
<br />
DPS is an average number.  It's taken over a period of time.  That period of time seems to be the point of confusion for most people.<br />
<br />
1 mob agro's puller<br />
5 shaman begins casting malos<br />
8 mob reaches camp<br />
9 warrior engages mob, malos lands<br />
10 other melee engage mob<br />
11 shaman begins casting slow<br />
13 slow lands<br />
16 shaman begins casting bane<br />
21 bane lands<br />
24 first tic of bane hits<br />
30 second tic<br />
36 third tic<br />
42 fourth tic<br />
48 last tic of bane, bane ends, mob dies<br />
<br />
Most melee begin the fight when the mob gets into camp.  Some casters that parse start in casting range.  Let's actually be generous and start in camp.<br />
<br />
48-8 = 40 seconds.  420 x 5 = 2100 damage.  DPS for the fight = 52.5 dps.<br />
<br />
Measured over a single tic (when bane is running), you are doing 420/6 = 70 dps.  That is not an accurate number.  If you want to compare to other classes, you have to use the same time period (ie, same base divisor) that they are using.  Otherwise you are comparing apples and oranges.  It just doesn't work.  Yeah it's fruit, but your apple pie is gonna taste pretty freaking odd if you get the wrong thing.<br />
<br />
Guys, it is not accurate to add up all the potential dots, add X% for crits and y% for focus items, and then throw in a nuke--and divide by 6.  That is a hugely inflated number that means crap.  A wizard doing that with a crit on corona flare with a good focus item gets 1200dps.  It's a MEANINGLESS number.  In statistical terms, it's your single highest tic of dps over the course of a fight.  That's an outlier that is often ignored in figuring true averages (it's not infrequent to eliminate the lowest and highest results and average the rest--not that it would be appropriate in this case, but I thought I'd mention it).<br />
<br />
For consistency with melee, you might as well start timing when the mob gets to camp and they can start parsing their damage.<br />
<br />
Warriors are considered low dps.  You'll be burning heavy mana to get up to 2/3 of a warrior over the course of a fight if you go with a realistic measure of dps.<br />
<br />
So yes, shaman are low dps.  Generally, however, the longer a fight stretches, the higher our dps will go.  We have time to stack DoTs, nukes, etc.  Time is our friend.  (Don't forget, we can slow time! ;) )<br />
<br />
Please, no more posts of, &quot;I did 487 dps over the course of a fight!&quot;  No, you didn't.  If you had up 6 running DoTs, a rain, and a nuke, you might have gotten 487 dps over the course of ONE tic.<br />

No it doesn't because you fail to take into account Velium Strike landing for partial(which it seems to do a lot).  DoTs, once they stick, land for their full values.  Nukes are too sketchy to say that.<br />

<br />
Sorry I should have been more clear.  When I think of dps I immediately think of the dps that Chutoi defined.  When I think of damage per tick, I think of &quot;hey my dot does XX damage per tick&quot; which, as he detailed, is not the same as dps when calculated on a per mob basis.<br />
<br />
Yes, the dps of that dot for that tick can be measured but generally is misused when claims such as &quot;bane is 70dps&quot; are made.  70dps from bane is accurate on a per tick basis, but dps is generally calcuated over the duration a mob lives, or per fight, hence the distinction between damage per tick and damage per second.  Chutoi said it all in detail of course, but really the definitions are simple.<br />
<br />
DPS covers anything doing damage and is calculated on the duration of a fight.  Damage per tick relates specifically to DoT damage on a per tick basis to serve as a measure of comparison for DoT's.  I don't think I have ever heard a rogue's damage to be stated as &quot;1200 DPT&quot;, or the equivalent of 200 DPS.<br />
<br />
Damage per tick is not an average and is not the same as say, average damage per tick.  Bane always does 420+x, x = modifiers, damage per tick.  Always.  Bane's average damage per tick over several ticks will vary, but for any tick, the damage is not an average.  Spear of Torment instantly does 675 damage over a course of time ranging from infinity to where time approaches zero, but is usually around 6.5 seconds (cast time + recast time).  It is calculated in damage per second and is therefor an average damage over X seconds.<br />
