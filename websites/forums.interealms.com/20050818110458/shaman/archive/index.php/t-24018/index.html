Finally, hit the Sold! button to begin the game. The game will start immediately and you can safely familiarize yourself with the game's single interface screen as the game progresses on its own. Soon your avatar will will be seeking and destroying an exotic panopoly of beasts while you gaze proudly on. Missing, you will notice, is the tedious march from town, the bewildering maze of cookie cutter streets hiding some specific merchant or NPC, and the repetetive hunt for just the right beast to execute. Progress Quest supplies your character with an endless series of victims, as well as exciting quests which keep your quest log full to the brim at all times.<br />
<br />
TREASURE: Each slain creature yields a trophy, which can be sold in any town. When the encumbrance bar reaches maximum, your character automatically returns to the nearest town to sell your loot. If sufficiently liquid, he may then purchase an upgrade in equpiment (weapon or armor). That being done, the interpid adventurer then returns to the frontier to spill more blood. Tip: The amount your character can carry before his encumbrance bar fills up increases as his STR stat improves. <br />
