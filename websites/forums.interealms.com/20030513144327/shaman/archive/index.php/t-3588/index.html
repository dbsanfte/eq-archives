<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Another epic question:<br />
<br />
Ok, I got 47 last night, and some guys were camping reavers, so I asked if I could loot the 3 books if they killed the rever that pops him, they did, so i went and turned them into the spirit, and i have the idol from last night when i was exping there. So now, my question is, how hard is it to raid The Hole, and if I brought two groups of 45-55ish levels, could I do it? Or do I need to be higher and higher levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What classes will you be bringing?<br />
Do you have anyone who knows the way?<br />
Do you have someone who knows the agro/pathing deep in the hole?<br />
<br />
With the right classes and knowledge it will be quite easy for 2 groups.<br />
<br />
Without it, you can expect a couple wipeouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even though mez/charm has been amazingly improved, pathing there is truly annoying.  Nothing like forcing the chanter to AE cuz the thing decided to turn off and wake up the neighbors... twice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, Hole raids stand and fall with your knowledge of the zone. Especially if you go down there with such a force. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Be sure to have a good MA. Very important. Try to get the highest Warrior you can, it helps a lot.<br />
2. Get a crazy mezzer. Maybe 2 that work in a team together. Trust me, you will get adds in the city, cause the pathing is unpredictable.<br />
3. Get a puller that knows the zone inside out. Respawn is the enemy out in the city, and you must pull quick, kill, and move to the next spot to go on.<br />
4. Make a halfling rogue (worshipping Brell), move him there, bind, sow and explore the zone. Most mobs will not be KOS, if you run into one rinse repeat. Know the place.<br />
5. Keep your raid force on its toes. No slacking while this move through the city. No afk for 5 mins. This may kill the whole raid. Stay focused for 30 mins and you will make it.<br />
6. Do all the other epic parts till this one, otherwise you might not have enough true spirit faction for the turn in of the icon. It is not too bad to lose the icon because you can get a new one quite easily, but its hard to get another raid into the Hole organized, so spare yourself the trouble and do the rest of the quest beforehand.<br />
7. Search for things like &quot;the hole&quot;, &quot;kirn&quot;, &quot;epic&quot; on this board and you will find many more useful information about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have made a Halfling Rogue worshipping Brell (inate Hide and Sneak ability at level 1) -- get the map from eqatlas.com, and this is really a good way to learn the layout and mob locations in the zone. Got him bound in Paineel at the entrance to the Hole.  He can wiggle thru the rocks to enter. He can walk around among golems and elementals freely, but must hide+sneak to get by ratmans and apparitions. He had no trouble sneaking all the way to the top of the tower at the end of the zone to get to Kirn. Kirn himself conned dubious to the rogue, I suppose he's on TrueSpirit faction.<br />
<br />
Even made use of him recently to drag 3 corpses out of the city, including my own (I was able to simply /consent my rogue then log on the rogue to drag my shaman corpse).</div></div><hr />
