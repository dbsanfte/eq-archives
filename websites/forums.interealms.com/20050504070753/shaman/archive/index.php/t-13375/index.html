<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
I just got myself flagged for tactics last night and was wondering which mobs are likely to drop Spectral parchments?<br />
<br />
I am 1 blue from 63 and been holding off cause I personally feel it's not so great being 63 with lvl 61-62 spells lol. I don't even have Pox, VoB, Topor, Malo or Tigirs heh<br />
<br />
So whats the chance of getting a couple of spec parchies to get the new level off to a good start in tactics?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">all normal mob can drop, and drop rate is like ethereal parchment at PoV's exp mob<br />
<br />
Frenzy(name ? just too common spawn to be a 'name') at pit have very high chance drop spectral, also any other bigger have common drop spectral and rare rune</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahhh .. great! Thanks for the info Shamam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rate seems to be about the same as BoT off normal mobs ... low as hell.  I've seen 1 spectral in tactics in a number of days exping there (not counting named).  I've seen about 7 in BoT in months of exping there.<br />
<br />
It's a good thing most of our spectral spells are not really that useful, because they're hard as hell to acquire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My exp group got 3 specs in one night the other day.  2 off of normal mobs I think, one off a named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replies guys.<br />
<br />
Gwain, where were you hunting? In the pit? If so which part, though not sure how much that info will help as I have only been in the zone in area and then zoned out lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've found the pit to be good for specs.<br />
One spectral seems to drop about every 2 hours on average that I've been in there.<br />
Also, from the zone in, hang a right or left right away and try fighting down to the room where VZ/TZ is.<br />
When our guild clears down to them, we usually get a minimum of 2 specs on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've seen maybe one or two Specs drop off of normal mobs in BoT.  I've seen quite a few Specs drop off mobs in PoT, especially in Arena or down by the Armorer's spawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shouldn't have waited to level... you could be soloing in tactix for those specs now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We got two snare kiting last night.  They droped of a Daiku Death Knight and a Daiku Warrior.  They also drop the items for Bloodmetal Earings of Engagement.  Dont summon quad 500ish.  We did it with a group of all melles. Was fun.</div></div><hr />
