<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guys and gals I got some serious concerns for WOW. I have been following this game since it was first announced and i have watched it grow (i never got into beta or the stress) however from what i have been reading Vivendi is squeezing Blizzard with a door to crank this game out. This has become quite obvious in the past month and a half when things are gettign rushed all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
Now I know from what i read that compared to other mmorpg's the game has a lot less bugs and I also understand that u can't really &quot;FINISH&quot; a mmorpg because it's a work in progress but closed beta has officially ended and 2 classes lack talents. There have also been issues that have been brough up by several people as to how the death penalty is not meaningful enough. I totally agree. A 5 minute run is not gonna make me afraid to die in the game. Since there is no risk the game can get boring and some people have already expressed that. I know the death penalty in eq ued to be horrible (talking before luclin when u could not get insane xp and make it up in a few hours) but Blizzard seems unwilling to understand that the game will NEED a meaningful death penalty. The leveling is also frighteningly fast. Level 60 in 2 weeks? I mean without help (buffs and PL) that cannot be done even in EQ. And it was definately not possible in eq's glory days (before SOE took over).<br />
There should come some respect with being 60. And the promise of a hero class and high end content (with no risk again) is also not very good. I am starting to doubt Blizzard for the first time in my life. They make awesome games ut this looks like it's being rushed out the door without much thinking goign into critical issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

But peep dis - <br />
Level 60 in 2 weeks? I mean without help (buffs and PL) that cannot be done even in EQ. <br />

While dat do be true, buffs be easy to get and have &quot;u&quot; been seeing a boatload of newbs lately? Heail No. 'Sides, who gibes fek about newbs anyway, it's about retaining accounts ober at SonyEQ. (DaMAN).<br />
<br />
Oh, and are you wun ob dems &quot;Goth&quot; boys I roll for dey lunch money? What de fek is a &quot;meaningful death penalty&quot;? Looks, if you be looking for pain and misery I can hooks you up. I know a brutha into that crap. Couple of girly-girls too. (Aldough I do tinks one is fronting about being a chick - IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to clarify, I believe level 65 was reached in everquest on 3 days played. On that froglok cleric.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, in my opinion, the level grind is something that has been plaguing MMO's since they were invented. The greater the grind, the lesser the fun, to a certain extent. Allow me to explain.<br />
<br />
Level grinding to level X (maximum level) must be meaningful in the three following ways only:<br />
<br />
1) It must define a character not only from similar classes but also from other players of the same class - example: Alt Adv and class specific disciplines for EQ, Talents and Abilities and skills for WoW.<br />
<br />
2) it must force the player of the character to have a minimum knowledge base of the character to reach level X. Example: controlling agro, crowd controlling effectively, twisting songs, healing correct targets, etc.<br />
<br />
3) It must force the player to value their character.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the grind to level X can achieve all three of the above, there is NO REASON to lengthen the grind. Instead of adding more quests and more mobs an more levelling areas so that the experience bar can be slowed down, that time should be spent on high-end content accessible to casual and hardcore players alike, so that there is like-level competition for PvP and natural resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tolgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This following quote is in the WoW article on Raid Content. If they pull that off then the leveling speed is not going to be an issue. As far as the 2 classes without talents goes, they'll get a good 2 weeks of testing (assuming the Nov 22 release date is true) and will sure to be tweaked the first month or two. Nothing new there as far as MMORPG's go.<br />
 The game is ready and if Blizzard pulls off the end game as advertised WoW is going to be a huge hit for all the people that are tired of the exp grind that is EQ/EQ2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*We knew from the beginning that players had an expectation going into World of Warcraft for a good raid game. Early on in development, we planned out everything that we felt would make for good raid content. We really tried to go top-heavy with it, to make these raid encounters truly spectacular, because we knew we weren't going to put in a steep leveling curve. We aren't going to bog people down in the normal leveling process, so we expect that there will be a lot of people at maximum level and they'll be anticipating some truly epic challenges.*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WoW was ready for commercial release last July (start of Beta 2).  If you use SOE (EQ and SWG) or Mythic (DAoC) as a baseline, WoW was ready even before that.  It's utterly ready now.  A couple of classes don't have their talents in yet?  BFD!  Talents are an interesting part of the game, but not critical to getting it out on the street.  Besides, for the talents already in the game, Blizz got them pretty well right on the first try.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Death penalty is more than adequate.  A 5 minute run might be the case for lower levels, but if you've managed to push for an hour into your instance dungeon, experience a group wipe, run back (10-15 minutes) to your instance portal, rez yourself and find the instance repopulated, I believe you've been penalized more than enough.  Trust me Soulstorm, you'll feel the risk aplenty.<br />
<br />
Still, if you're looking for a nice experience penalty plus a run back, Blizzard has been gracious enough to satisfy the masochists too.  Just right-click on your local graveyard spirit, give away a big chunk of experience, then run to where you were at 2/3 speed, fighting the whole way.  That should satisfy the hard core in you.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Penny:  You're missing something that a lot of Everquest players (including myself sometimes, back in the day miss.<br />
<br />
You don't have to be max level to have fun.  In everquest, yes, the really cool events and such were only for high levels, so yeah, in everquest, you did have to be high level to do the really interesting stuff.  If the quests and such are fun at all levels in WoW, then you don't *have* to rush rush rush to 50 or 60 or whatever the max is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gwain but this is the problem ppl have expressed about fast leveling.<br />
Quests give better xp than just mindless xp grind. Hmm Ok. <br />
<br />
So as i do quest in zone 1 where quests are fun i end up say 7 levels higher by the time i am done with the quests i wanted. Ok but now OTHER zones of similar level who had quests which were just as good now have quests i cannot take anymore cause i outgrew them. A few zones levels the character too fast no matter which zones you pick.<br />
This means i miss out content by leveling so quickly.<br />
I am still of the opinion that leveling needs to be toned down a tad.<br />
<br />
And as for the high end content in EQ: Sure u get to 65 well now 70 just so that u can raid and raid and raid. EVERRAID. I enjoyed my journey to 55 and it has taken me longer perhaps even being a troll and all but i loved it. Seeing different zones doing quests starting my epic gettign my boots etc. A lot of a mmorpg is about the journey. If the journey is 2 to 4 weeks for average players than the DESTINATION better be good. And so far many players are not happy with it. Only a few good zones to go to. Content needs to be added and it will be they said they are saving a lot for retail but I still got my concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: Btw the froglock cleric who leveled to 65 in 2 days or 3 days was powerleveld AROUND THE CLOCK by the whole guild. This was not a single person staying up for 3 days it was ppl logging on one after another and others helping and taking turns and aoeing **** to level him up. Without such help it's not possible to level any char even an @ssling to 65 in 2 days. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tolgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes leveling is faster in WoW but to say that 2-4 weeks to 60 for the average player is not true. It's been said many times that WoW is targetting the casual player and that Raid Content/PvP is in place to keep the hardcore players busy/happy.<br />
<br />
It will still take a few months for the average player to level to 60 and many more months for them to see everything that lvl 60 has to offer.</div></div><hr />

I am not talking about race specific quests. I am not talking about crossing over from alliance to horde. I am also not talking about doing EVERY quest in the game since some quests will not appeal to me. But outgrowing zones of similar level so quickly is I think a problem. But this is all talk until i experience this firsthand.<br />

I think that the leveling speed is great. No kore &quot;job&quot; to get to max level and then start enjoying the content but a fast path to 60 and then lots of content<br />
<br />
I think that you have to see it before you understand how it works and why it aint a problem</div></div><hr />

1 froglok cleric + 1 lvl 65 insane necro = lvl 65 cleric in 3 days ... no guild involed ... also there was somthing about the cleric getting the epic on the 4th or 5th day i think ...</div></div><hr />

Soul,<br />
<br />
Your theory might hold true for low levels, but not higher.  There are considerably more quests for lower level characters.  As you reach the higher levels, you won't find yourself &quot;skipping&quot; quests because you level too fast.  Quite the opposite occurs:  You end up traveling to other parts of the world to add quests to your log if you want to keep your experience gains strictly to questing.<br />
<br />
Besides, many of the quests send you to zones you might not have visited otherwise.  This, in turn, leads you to more NPCs with yellow exclamation points over their heads (i.e. more quests).  Typical EQ grinding has the opposite effect.  Once you find a good grind zone for your level, you stay there for days on end.<br />
<br />
Ironically, I find WoW levels you more quickly if you solo.  Grouping seems to dampen the experience rate somewhat, but opens up the world of &quot;elite&quot; quests which provide the best loot drops for weapons/equipment.  It's an interesting experience balancing effect and lets you help others complete a quest you may already have under your belt without significant experience gain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">WoW does not entirely level faster solo...  lots of exp comes from quests and quite a lot of quests will go faster by way of grouping, ie elite quests or kill X quests etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not to say your concerns might not still hold true for you after release - it's a strange world after all, but...<br />
<br />
You've never played the game, yet you are worried about how fun it will be based on some game mechanics, compared to your experiences in EQ.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't built on the same gaming paradigm as EQ.  I wouldn't get too caught up worrying about how fun it might or might not be until you play it.<br />
<br />
I used to subscribe to the &quot;meaningful death penalty&quot; BS.  When I played WoW, I realized that I was crowing that 'meaningful' crap to justify to myself how I could waste all that time (in a game) not having fun.  Remember that games are about having fun.  No matter how hard EQ has tried over the years to convince you that games = work, tediousness, waiting, etc... it's still just not true.  More fun = better game, and I don't think you'll have to play WoW for very long to see that.<br />
<br />
From what I can tell reading about and playing both WoW and EQ2, the two games represent the extreme ends of the spectrum.  If you believe that you can't enjoy a mmorpg without all the waiting and suffering of EQ, EQ2 will be for you.  If you're tired of all that, WoW will likely make you happy.</div></div><hr />

WoW is not EQ. Do not compare them to each other.</div></div><hr />
