<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ailbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could someone post a guide or instructions on how to make a Fleeting Quiver?  I know its not exactly a Ranger only thing, but it is vital to a Ranger to have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalenth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It requires a fairly high skill in tailoring (they triv. at 222 I believe, though I've heard of successes with a skill as low as 170).<br />
<br />
Here's the recipe: <br />
<br />
(1) fleeting quiver pattern, (1) aviak egg oil, (1) high quality lion skin, (1) vial of distilled mana, (1) griffon feather.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few points:<br />
<br />
The &quot;high quality lion skin&quot; is the only semi-painful item to get. They are rare drops off the Highland Lions in North Karana (don't make the same mistake I did, and spend countless hours in EK or SK killing lions, they don't drop there. Only off the Highland lions.)<br />
<br />
Distilled mana is made by a 39+ enchanter using their distill mana spell, and a poison vial and (2) sapphires.<br />
<br />
Aviak egg oil is brewed, and is simply made by combining an aviak egg + water flask in a brew barrel.<br />
<br />
Fleeting quiver pattern can be purchased in the Bazaar inside the stone building, off the tailoring vendor.<br />
<br />
Griffon feathers drop fairly commonly off griffons (I believe the lesser griffenes and griffawns can drop them too, not 100% sure though).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks.<br />
<br />
Something I would like to know is how  the tailoring skill compares to the fletching skill cost- and time-wise ?<br />
<br />
I'd say geting fletching to 170 is farily easy and all in all it costed me around 200p, re-selling the arrows and buying/selling with 2 Opal Encrusted Steins equipped.<br />
<br />
But I suspect that for tailoring a long time may be spent at higher levels hunting for elusive skins and also raising brewing and smithing ,is that true ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was just thinking.. do you get any items back if you fail on the Fleeting Quiver ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Getting tailoring to 170 is costly and/or time-consuming.<br />
<br />
And no, you get no items back on a failed FQ combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>faB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Found out most of these ingredients sell at the Bazaar, prices I have seen:<br />
Aviak Egg Oil, 30p<br />
Griffon Feathers, 10p<br />
Sapphire, 100p<br />
HQ Lion Skin, 200+ pp (it was a few days ago, I don't remember now but it wasn't cheap)<br />
<br />
Vial of Distilled Mana, saw one for 300p<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Anyway I bought some of those then I figured it's not  as fun so NK and BB here I come :D  I'll use my bought ingredients if  Fleeting Quiver fails</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Griffon Feathers do drop off of Griffenes and Griffawns as well as Griffons.  Aviak Eggs are (as far as I know) only foraged in Butcherblock.  Don't know if they are drops from aviaks or not.  But hey, if I can get 30p for it in the Bazaar, maybe I'll stop eating those eggs when I get them ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can usually find some Grif feathers at the Gyps in NK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I found griffon feathers to be very common off griffawns in JP. The vendors there usually have a lot of them. <br />
<br />
Aviak eggs (for oil) do drop off the aviaks in Butcherblock (posibly steamfont as well now). The ones I used were foraged (and are an easy forrage).<br />
<br />
The hide is a rite bitch. I suspect they increased the drop rate though as I have seen a few lately. I got my first of my 5th lion, and my second off number ~200. For a long while they were selling for 1kpp each for good reason as it would take you 4-5 hours of tracking to get one.  Nowadays 200-400pp is common price and thats pretty fair if you value your time.</div></div><hr />

What server are you on? I sell aviak oil for 5p, and it'll sometimes be ages before anyone will buy. I still have some in the bank (helped raise my brewing on them), so if you're on the Rathe, just let me know if you need some :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Annalyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doesn't distilled mana take  2 sapphires?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kalenth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, sorry, brain lapse . . . heh. <br />
<br />
Distilled mana does take (2) sapphs (will edit my post above).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MuKu314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can I just buy all these ingredients and give it to a player with high skill in tailoring so they can combine it for me?<br />
<br />
Or is this no-drop, and I must do it myself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fletching is a relativly easily skill to raise since untill very high levels all ingredients you need are easily purchasable from vendors and at high levels from other players in bizaar. <br />
<br />
Tailoring is either a very expensive skill to raise or a very time consuming one. You either buy all your pelts and silks and stuff or you farm them. As long as you farm the ingredients yourself and at certain stages brew or smith the components yourself, then it is a really cheap skill to raise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I view that Tailoring is a skill that is not too important to me.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, I'ld love to get my hand on a Fleeting Quiver!<br />
<br />
But for all those who cant make one for themselves, dont want feel like camping or buying the materials or just plain dont have the pp to buy one...<br />
<br />
There is always the JQotH 6slot 35wr<br />
<br />
Granted its not a Fleeting Quiver, but easily obtained and a piece of cake for any one who is in Katta because they just soloed the Grimling runner for the Rallic pattern.<br />
<br />
Just go down into the tunnels to the left of the bank, Kill a lvl 35 Halfling, Galren Fuzzytoes (everytime a Halfling dies an angel gets their wings :D ), take the note to SS, Aderyn Goldleaf. He is pretty hard to find, but you're a Ranger track him.:p <br />
<br />
Note: A gnome guard wanders by the room Fuzzytoes is in, wait till he goes by and you have a +10min window to kill Fuzzytoes. Not sure if he will agro, never got the chance to find out. :)<br />
<br />
This is the next best thing to the Fleeting quiver, when ever a Mage isnt arround that is.<br />
