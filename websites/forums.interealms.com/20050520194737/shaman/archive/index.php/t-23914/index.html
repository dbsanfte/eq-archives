<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need some help, havent been able to get in game at all today, 9-22-04, says i cant establish a connection with the server, and to check my internet connection.<br />
Well i can get on the internet net of course, since i am typing this, any help would be great on how to fix this or why it happens.<br />
I have tried Complete file check many times,<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So you can get to the server select screen but not past that?<br />
<br />
If its trying to load char screen and getting right to the end and than booting you? Or can you get to char screen than not get in?<br />
<br />
Which version of direct X are you using? Drivers up to date? and i'll ask the dumb question ....sure there isnt anything to patch? You probably have patched everything since you did a file check but i cant remember if its the same thing. <br />
<br />
When i forgot to patch other day was booting me out and telling me i couldn't connect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, i cant get to the the server select screen.<br />

You might have the ports that EQ uses blocked.  Either from a router, software firewall like zone alarm, or possibly winxp service pack 2.  <br />
<br />
If you are sure its not you, then are you on a college campus?  Perhaps the network admin blocked access to EQ?<br />
<br />
If none of the above apply.. well, try turning off anti-virus software.. and I'm assuming you can get to other internet sites right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my multitude of discussions with the EQ tech guys, try this<br />
<br />
1) Go to command prompt<br />
2) Type in tracert {YOUR SERVER}.everquest.com<br />
<br />
That way you can at least see if you are having a drop in signal somewhere. <br />
<br />
GOOD LUCK.</div></div><hr />
