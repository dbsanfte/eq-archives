<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guess who's back...back again... Ah sorry hehe.  I've been running a lot more aggro tests and trying to nail down different values for spells.  I've been able to pin down aggro numbers for quite a few spells already, but some I still have to do and some numbers still seem a bit off.  Numbers first, then more chit chat...<br />
<br />
Curse of spirits (epic dot) - 1413 total damage, ~1128 aggro generated, ~.798 aggro to damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Plague 60 + (22 X 55) - 1270 total damage, ~1044 aggro generated, ~.82 aggro to damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Ice Strike (675 cold nuke) - 675 base damage, ~534 aggro generated, ~.79 aggro to damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Blast of Poison (400 poison nuke) - 400 base damage, ~312 aggro generated, ~.78 aggro to damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Venom of the snake 40 + (8 X 59) - 512 total damage, ~900 aggro, ~1.75 aggro to damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Ebolt 110 + (8 X 146) - 1278 total damage, ~1596 aggro generated, ~1.25 aggro to damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Ok let's see now.  First almost all my tests have &quot;non melee damage&quot; coming in at right around the .8 aggro to damage ratio.  I've tried to find a relationship between poison counters and aggro added, but don't have anything yet.  Looking at Ebolt verse VoTS you should be able to remove the non-melee damage at the usual ~.8 ratio then take what is left and divide it by number of poison counters, but when I do that for Ebolt I get ~57 aggro per counter, and doing that for VoTS I get ~70 aggro per poison counter.  I'll test this further and am getting numbers for BoN/Taintedbreath/etc.  <br />
<br />
The main thing to remember about the aggro to damage ratios is that they only get better for nukes.  Crit'n blast of poison makes it do 800 damage, but it still generates ~312 aggro.  Where as adding focus or crit'n a dot makes it generate more aggro.  I ran more tests with VoTS and other dots and aggro increased in line with increase in damage done.  This means that even plague that starts off being almost equal with frost strike winds up generating more aggro per point of damage done as you add in critical affliction, burning affliciton, improved damage, etc.  I'll update this list sometime next week most likely if people want with my findings on other dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">perhaps i've missed your earlier posts, but i have a few questions about your methods.<br />
<br />
how are you calculating agro numbers so accurately?<br />
<br />
do you have a formula for agro per counter for disease, poison, and curse counters?  a formula for agro per point of non-melee (nuke) damage?  a formula for agro per point of dot damage?  if so, how did you derive and verify these formulas?<br />
<br />
Crit'n blast of poison makes it do 800 damage, but it still generates ~312 aggro.<br />
<br />
are you saying that, say, a wizard's critical strike of chaos focused with a familiar, bard, and the best worn focus for, say, 8k will generate the same agro as a non-crit unfocused 3288 strike of chaos?<br />
<br />
just for a frame of reference, how much agro would a melee hit for 100 damage create? a nuke for 100? a raw hate proc/disc for 100?<br />
<br />
how much agro do resists generate, whether they be from dots or nukes?<br />
<br />
i guess i'd just like to see the calculations, logs, parses etc you're using to come up with these numbers.  would like to see some parses done with the ldon curse dots, and the higher level disease/poison dots that have no nuke components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh. i looked at your post history and found the previous post about dot agro, heh.  i'll read the replies and such then post any unanswered questions here i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok let's see.  Aggro numbers are arrived at by using an SK + a shaman.  I have another post on the board in regards to dot aggro where I was showing crit ticks and focus raising dot aggro.  <br />
<br />
Melee aggro isn't tied to damage, but is tied to the swing.  The swing whether it hits or misses determines aggro.  This is based upon the weapons damage and the damage bonus.  A few good threads on this and this is what helps me narrow down the aggro numbers so close by using a weapon like a FS dagger that is only 12 aggro per swing.<br />
<br />
Resists are just as much aggro as the spell.  Landing a 675 base damage nuke for 0 (resist), 23, 400, and crit'n/focused for 1400 gives the same aggro.  That is one of the big problems between dots/nukes atm.  Even if a dot starts off being on par in terms of aggro to damage like plague once you add on ~10% aggro free damage from ID, add in aggro free damage from crits, etc well the &quot;tick&quot; portion of dot aggro continues to do more aggro from the extra damage then even dots like plague that were close in terms of aggro to damage ratio start to fall behind and a dot like Ebolt or VoTS just get's down right silly.<br />
<br />
Basically I pull with shaman, get numbers for initital aggro, then re-test several times to make sure it's right (things like double attack on last round to turn mob, etc).  Then I pull and use a spell, record how much aggro it takes to turn, re-run tests.  All tests were done atleast 3 times, most far more.  SK always turns the second they get aggro, never ripostes, both characters are the same level, fight in 3rd person to keep both about as close to the mob as possible, etc.  Hope that answers everything; might of missed something hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really like the way you did this. It would be cool to also find out how hp % of total effects as an agro modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In all the tests I've done HP% didn't make any differance until it was frenzy aggro and it was absolute aggro.  I did most tests at 100% for both chars.  A few times though my shaman would be down in the 40-50% range from multiple tests and right on que SK would still take aggro right back.  It's possible there is some mod based on hp%, but all I've been able to see is the usual frenzy aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good work. I'd like to see what the results are for the DoTs people use at 65 though... bane, blood, ultor, ancient scourge, etc<br />
<br />
Edit: do you have SCS? that would put nukes at 1 point of agro per point of damage if you do have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm working on it.  I was/am hoping to find a relationship between dmg/counters/etc, but not having much luck atm.  Started testing bane and pox and others, but didn't have much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">alright, your methods make sense to me.<br />
the main points it seems you've proven through your experiments are:<br />
<br />
1) nukes generate hate at a fixed rate of aproximately .785 points of hate per point of the nuke's base damage.  this figure is completely independant of the actual damage done by the spell (resists, mitigation, foci, crits).<br />
<br />
2) dots generate hate in two ways: a) an initial amount of hate based on the counters they add and the non-melee damage they inflict when cast (not all dots have this initial non-melee hit) and b) an amount of hate added each tick of aproximately .785 points of hate per point of actual damage the spell does.  this second amount of hate varies depending on foci and crits.<br />
<br />
it looks like you need to do some more experimenting to derive a more accurate ratio of agro per counters for disease, poison, curse, fire and cold counters.  on a side note, it bears mentioning that other spells use these same counters, notably slow, the malo lines and the tashan line.  i also didn't see a formula for the agro of resisted dots.<br />
<br />
so a quick comparison of nukes vs. dots looks something like this:<br />
<br />
-mana efficiency:<br />
<br />
the top wizard nuke, ancient strike of chaos, does a base of 3288 points of damage for 768 mana.  given the max focus (discordant fire - 45% and echo of the trusik - 25%) of 70%, this spell reaches an ideal damage per mana ratio of 5589 damage for 768 mana or 7.278 dpm.<br />
<br />
the top necromancer dot, horror, does a base of 430 damage over 6 ticks, or 2580 damage, for 470 mana.  given the max focus (discordant energy - 45% and echo of the trusik - 25%) of 70%, this spell reaches an ideal damage per mana ratio of 4386 damage for 470 mana, or 9.332 dpm.<br />
<br />
-agro efficiency:<br />
<br />
the top wizard nuke, ancient strike of chaos, generates .785 x 3288 (base damage) or 2581.08 points of hate.  given the max 70% focus, this nuke can has an ideal damage per agro ratio of 5589.6 / 2581.08 or 2.166  dpa.<br />
<br />
the top necro dot, horror generates an uncertain but negligible amount of agro based on the curse counters it initially adds.  its agro is then calculated at an aproximate rate of .785 x the actual damage dealt by horror over the 6 ticks it runs.  given the max 70% focus, this dot generates a total agro of 4386 x .785 or 3443.01 agro, plus whatever agro is generated from the curse counters.  its ideal damage per agro ratio is therefore 4386 / 3443.01 or 1.274 dpa.<br />
<br />
these numbers ignore specialization checks and mana preservation foci, as well as chances to score critical hits (it bears mentioning that this chance is substantially higher with max nuke crit AA's than with max dot crit AA's.)  they also ignore dot extension foci.  they also assume that the dot is given time to run its full duration and achieve maximum mana efficiency.  the damage per agro number for a poison dot like blood of saryn would be substantially lower due to the huge additional agro of poison counters.<br />
<br />
...so...<br />
<br />
dots are generally more mana efficient than nukes, assuming they have the time to run their full durations.  this assumption is highly fallible, though, especially considering the brief nature of most gates of discord group and raid situations.<br />
<br />
nukes are hugely more agro efficient than dots, due largely to the fact that any damage added to nukes by songs, familiars, foci, etc is completely agro free.<br />
<br />
nukes crit substantially more than dots (i don't have the numbers for this, but the max gates crit nuke aa yields a much higher crit rate than critical affliction III).<br />
<br />
all in all, nukes are a much better means of dealing damage than dots in almost any group or raid situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">qhor -  Good summary, the one main thing I think most people miss is also that a dot has to run it's full duration and you have to start having aggro sooner.  For instance let's say you drop a dot that does 200 aggro when it lands, then 100 aggro each tick for 8 ticks.  That's 1000 aggro, now compared to a nuke that does the same damage for the same aggro the nuker can wait 40(ish) seconds for the tank to build aggro and then cast the nuke and still do the same damage over time, with a much bigger safety net in terms of aggro.  Where as the dot'r has 200 aggro to start, then 300, then 400, etc.  Depending on how procs go, crit ticks, focus, etc, it's just very uncertain.  I'm sure lots of people have seen themselves pull aggro on the second or third tick of a dot.  With dots though you just can't afford to wait to cast them.  <br />
<br />
Also SCS doesn't effect &quot;tick&quot; aggro as far as I can tell or anyone else has been able to show me.  It does effect casting aggro though, so that puts nukes even further ahead.<br />
<br />
I'm working on more tests now for higher level shm dots and trying to nail down poison counter aggro.  Disease counters don't add hardly anything it appears and curse counters add some, but I'm unsure how much currently.  I'll post follow up results as I get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ok, here's a random suggestion for the counter agro thing.<br />
<br />
it seems logical to me that the agro of a resisted dot would work like this:<br />
<br />
.785 x (base damage) + (counter agro)<br />
<br />
to prove or disprove that, you could use a dot with very low counter agro, like the low-level shaman ldon dot curse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4092&amp;source=Live).  it's been suggested that the agro from curse counters is even less than disease counter agro. that spell only adds 4 curse counters anyway, so the (counter agro) value for the spell curse can basically be assumed to be zero.  so its resisted agro might look like<br />
<br />
.785 x (76 x 6 = 456) = 357.96<br />
<br />
so pull some magic immune mob and bounce a curse off it.  then do your sk's agro magic thingy and find out just how much agro the resisted spell was.  if the resisted dot formula's right, which it probably isn't (but who knows!) then you could do a few similar experiments with resisted poison dots, compare their resist agro, and come up with some value for agro per poison counter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually that's very close to what I'm going to do.  That will help me see initial aggro on a couple different spells.  What I really want is a poison immune mob atm though hehe.  Just going to head out and fight some high PR mobs, I'll get enough bounces to have enough of a sample.  Disease counters appear to be almost no aggro since the change, curse counters do add some and poison counters are a lot.  I'll see what I can do,  but probably be sometime next week before I've got more results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">most undead stuff is poison immune, the stuff in povalor would work or probably even dreadlands or karnor's or com or pod or cod, idk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aren't most mobs in Veksar highly resistant to poison/disease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What Racoo said. Veksar without Bane line of DoT's is a PITA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would love to see the other results especially from the poison DOT line.<br />
<br />
Fair warning: Lots of incoherent rambling and basic math following.<br />
<br />
When we are assuming (!), that all shaman poison DOTs are calculated with the same aggro formula, it should be possible to get some results with 3 or more value sets of different spells. The difference between VoTS and Ebolt is significant enough to lead to a pattern hopefully.<br />
<br />
As i see it we have 2 possible variables, that we can take for sure:<br />
- aggro influence of initial non-melee - factor unknown (maybe same like 'normal' damage)<br />
- aggro influence of DOT damage - factor unknown.<br />
<br />
Add possible counter influence as 3rd variable likely dependant on the number of attached counters and on the type of counter.<br />
<br />
For completeness sake there may be some additional unknown factor, we continue to miss.<br />
<br />
For VoTS a possible formula could look like: 40x + 472y + 7z + ? = 900<br />
where EBolt could look like: 110x + 1168y + 10z  + ? = 1596,<br />
assuming the reported aggro values are correct.<br />
<br />
To solve those equations ignoring the ?-part, you would need atleast a third set of values for a different spell, following the same aggro rules. I tried to insert 0.8 for x or for y but didn't reach meaningful results for the other two variables  :( .<br />
<br />
If those formulas aren't solvable with 3 value sets<br />
- we miss a factor in calculating (the ?-part)<br />
or<br />
- the tested spells do not follow the same aggro rules<br />
or<br />
- the method of gathering test data has some basic flaw, we are failing to see.<br />
<br />
Don't say, i didn't warn you from the start  :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good info, I like the creative methodology.  Reminds me of the old days of the Crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What I really want is a poison immune mob atm though hehe.<br />
<br />
Geonids in Wakening Lands fit this description I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One thing that might be worth verifying is to test to see if your FS dagger is really 12 agro per swing.  The simple way would be to use a 200 agro SK spell and have a wizard (doesn't get double attack) use a FS dagger to see when he gets agro, should be swing 20, swing 19 should have a total hate of 192.<br />
<br />
Also along these lines, it might be worth checking the dot agro using a different weapon entirely (assuming you can find an accurage agro value for it) just to make sure that the numbers are where you are thinking they are.<br />
<br />
Also, once again, thanks a lot for this great information!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aggro per swing is different for different classes.  It's based upon Weapon_Damage + (Damage_Bouns * N).  I'm double checking those numbers now and running some different tests with poison counters.  I'm going to do the immune tests and see what I get for numbers, but aggro between mobs/levels looks to be different atm, so it might take a bit to get enough different tests to figure it all out.  Also I know it doesn't effect shaman, but looks like DW rate might have been stealth changed, so I'm doing tests on that atm too.  The issues with dot aggro have been passed along, so even if we don't get exact numbers hopefully they'll make changes to CA/BA for now and we can go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have to say I am thankful for your efforts, even though your class who you are teamlead of seems to be not quite so happy about your efforts (at least some). It's nice to know that some can look behind class-centric needs and see the overall impact of game problems.<br />
