<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A seriously untapped source of revenue...  it was only a matter of time.  Very interesting stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting, but the article fails to address the basic flaw of inflation.  The suggestion that is made is for NPCs to not respawn with loot, to prevent farming of loot &gt; cash.  If NPCs do not regenerate with loot then the game is over shortly.  If resources are finite, then they will be consumed completely.  Game over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For example, in the original Everquest (and most MM games) the creeps continually regenerated with some copper, silver, or gold on them. As players kill the ever-regenerating horde of creeps, all of the coins regenerated along with the creeps end up in the players accounts. The “money supply&quot; of Everquest constantly grows and grows and grows. This creates never-ending in-game price inflation, which in turn makes it harder for newbies to save up enough money to buy anything useful in the game. A game that is too difficult or boring for newbies (I just killed my ten thousandth polar bear cub saving up for a level four fuzz buster...) is damaging its own potential for success. For the designers of Everquest, the only way to deal with the inflation problem was to create new areas of the game with more objects for sale in stores for the money to chase after. However, as long as the creeps keep regenerating with money on them, the inflation problem will never go away. <br />
<br />
that is bull****, in Real life Economic, if goverment issue more money then there will be huge price inflation so goverment need very carefully to control money supply. this doesn't apply to EQ, it actually go opposite effect, like when there are more &quot;money&quot; in game will cause huge deflation since everyone only want buy &quot;best&quot; item and those medium/low quality item drop their price by huge amount<br />
<br />
<br />
the article writer is just a serious dreamer,  you can't apply same concept from online casinos to other MM online game; he forgot how much time/$$ player want spend to buy fun; game isn't fun if publisher monopoly everything try max profit from players(except casinos); I think he should open a shop and try sell land at moon for $1 per huge chunk, he still earn unlimit profit since there are unlimit land at moon/planet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I couldn't take the article very serious after the pavlov's dog bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">***?  The biggest problem in EQ is deflation not inflation.  You can get haste and a kunark weapon for a stack of damn spiderling silks anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Big words, not enough pictures and graphs, i dont understand :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with comments here (didn't read article at all).   In EQ the prices are going DOWN on almost everything, only THE top line items are at higher and higher prices.  Most of them you can only acquire through trading as the people holding onto them are aware of how useless pp is to them personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had a friend who I got started on EQ.  He was having a great time in the bazaar selling leather padding in his 20's, had way more money than I ever had at that level.  Started dabbling in buying and selling other stuff there.<br />
<br />
His wife asked him &quot;Why on earth do you care about that stuff?  It's just fake money.&quot;<br />
<br />
His reply was &quot;Yeah, but I get to buy whatever I want and it DOESN'T COST ANYTHING!&quot;<br />
<br />
And she quite clearly understood.<br />
<br />
As a struggling family, they don't have a lot of money to throw around (he has since quit EQ due to the cost btw).  But in-game he could be a mogul and wheel and deal to his hearts' content.<br />
<br />
If items in-game were easily convertible to real money, it would be a lot more expensive to play - and he just wouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">items deflate as new more &quot;uber&quot; items are released, and as teh quantity increases of that item.<br />
<br />
but the amount of plat in game is inflationary. that's why consumables like spider silk and padding's can sell for 20p each in teh bazaar, where 3 years ago in EC tunnel it was 20p for a stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Too much theory; not enough days /played.  Interesting though.  A few thoughts:<br />
<br />
(1) You would have to seriously limit the influx of items into the game for them to retain value:  game becomes static and boring.<br />
<br />
(2) He/she fails to take the major market participants in the real world into account, not to over-generalize but most are not able to afford a great deal of incremental cost to play.  A large proportion of Gamers have limited disposable incomes.  As the rich get richer the poor quit playing. (I really wonder who pays several hundred dollars to E-Bay a character, though they obviously do).<br />
<br />
(3) If you want to make money online I have one word for you:  Porno.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Virtual objects in the game world cost nothing for the host to create, but may be of sufficient economic value to players to warrant spending money to obtain them.  <br />
<br />
This is where his theory falls apart for me.  If Sony started selling loot in everquest I would no longer play.  This would cost customers, and ultimately the demise of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know a good way to get pp outta the game ... make our potions cheaper so people will actually buy them.  No really there needs to be more consumables in the game and not things you have to have like food or water but things people want to use on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can you friggin imagine the chaos and backstabbing and pimping that would go on when Uber_mob_001 pops?<br />
<br />
People are jerk offs now about it, imagine if the mob could drop 1000 dollar trinket?<br />
<br />
Neat idea, in theory. In theory, communism works.  Homer Simpson said that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yes they need to make alchemy a good way to make money like enc have jewelery (i know all classes have it but only encs can enchant and have jewelery mastery aa) my alchemy skill is 190 and i have my trophy but do i ever use alchemy? no b/c theres no money in it even though i spent several thousand plat getting my skill that high i cant make money off it they need to make alchemy more useful so people will actually buy it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe 15 years ago, I read an interesting short story.  It was about an online dungeon-delving type RPG - but you had to pay.  You paid for online time.  You paid for in game needs like food, water, rope, new weapons, new armor, and healing.  The catch?  In game loot = real cash.<br />
<br />
In reality, I don't know how well it'd work...  you'd have a large amount of people running around, all hoping for the big score.  Sort of like an interactive lottery... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hehehe there is not finite amount of money in the game, there would be but Shaman have put a very Unfair share of it back into the Vendors hands.<br />
<br />
I remember when he was asking questions and doing surveys on different websites / chat forums. He had a nice idea but i think some of his reasoning is flawed.<br />
<br />
Truth be told as much as i would hate to see it and would probably force me to leave the game, Some daily / weekly maintenance cost. Armor and weapons do not take the abuse of fighting as well as you would think. Making weapons and armor degrade and needing repairs and maintenance by either PC smiths or NPC smiths would be one way to make plat flow around o out of the game.</div></div><hr />
