<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are the new prayer and portal spells on the Test Server for?  Are they just playing around or are they part of the caster rebalancing project? <br />
<br />
The 'Portal' spells are another project and won't be castable by players. <br />
<br />
The 'Prayer' spells are associated with some new trade skill work we're doing.   I've just added over a thousand recipes to various tradeskills, and expect to see those go live in a couple weeks.  These new recipes expand on various cultural tradeskills, fill in some gaps in tradeskill progression, and raise the bar significantly for grandmaster tradesfolk.  Many of the new recipes create items of a much higher quality than previously available, and I expect they'll be in high demand.    <br />
<br />
In addition to the recipes I added, Yakatizma has plans to smooth out the skill gain progression and make some adjustments to the trivial levels of many older recipes.<br />
This is from Caster's Realm, the same item that discusses the shaman slow fixes.<br />
<br />
Will there be some crumbs thrown to alchemy from this tradeskill revamp?  Will we see fixes in the high cost, low reward recipes and prices of ingredients?  Grandmaster in alchemy???<br />
<br />
Inquiring shamans want to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What we going to get more potions that last 2 minutes, cast breeze, and cost 200pp to make at level 160? I'll believe an alchemy fix when I see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd be willing to bet that even if they do upgrade alchemy they will forget that it's lvl caped and we still won't be able to get past 180 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hope we get thrown more than a bone ... as everyone knows that Alchemy is broken today as a trade skill.   <br />
<br />
Just as a add ... one cultural trade skill that been mention is Baking.  Given that Grobb got a bunch of improvements for trade skills (vendors, ovens, etc) ... I'm guessing that the Troll based Baking items may be some of the new recipes.   Not that I expect these things to be anything more than toys ... but who knows maybe we can cook up some Goody based recipes for cool effects.   <br />

Wood Elf BrainPie - FT I effect - anyone?</div></div><hr />

ok I know, it was an easy one :D</div></div><hr />

that's why we have alchemy mastery :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this mean grow may be &quot;smoothed&quot; so that it can't take you up to 180 for the price that it is?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On EQ traders, a review of the Trade Skills discussion at last weekend's Fan Faire indicated that there may be a review of pricing for vendor items. From the notes taken of two meetings on tradeskills comes this tidbit:<br />
<br />
Can we please get a review of component costs for skills, some of it is just to expensive? He agreed, and said it was on his list to do. Probably alchemy would be looked at first, then tinkering.<br />
<br />
In addition, there is mention of 1000 new recipes.  &quot;There's something for everyone&quot; language suggests new alchemy recipes (/shudder).<br />
<br />
Dang, let's fix what we got first.<br />
<br />
Here's the link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alchemy isnt broken, it's just too expensive for the resulting product. They need to go back and lower herb prices again because it costs to much to make expendable items. I dont mind paying 200 platinum for a permanent magic ring, but who wants to pay 200 platinum for a 1 charge breeze potion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Alchemy was once very broken.<br />
<br />
From a post on Graffes:<br />
<br />
* They apologized again for the Alchemy &quot;working as intended&quot; debacle. Very funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Alchemy is a good skill which makes great potions. but must be  some sick bastards on the dev team who takes a great potion like breeze or gate and turns them into crap.  they say &quot;OMG gate to innothule is OVERPOWERING. make it cost 170pp to make and take 30 seconds to cast.&quot;  -woots- and -high fives- all around.<br />
<br />
I hit 170 alchemy during kunark and have never seen a need to advance past that level . only becuase every decent potion i hear about is hamstringed by the devs. this is INTENTIONAL . 2 minutes breeze is no bug. 30 second 180pp a try  gate potion is INTENTIONAL<br />
<br />
there wont be any fix as long as they keep monkeying with the potions. you can keep lowering the herb prices but until the actual potions are practica, Alchemy will remain a broken skill.</div></div><hr />
