<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently camped in OT, where many mobs are red to me, but all thorned succulents are white or lower, and a few tigresses and sarnaks are yellow to blue too.  <br />
<br />
As my main method of soloing i pull w/ slow, then root, drop EB, and affliction for tougher mobs, then sit and med, or canni up abit.<br />
<br />
oh yeah, i buff myself w/ sta, dex, sow, regen, and occasionally haste if im meleein to max defense...<br />
<br />
now, i can solo white mobs without taking more then 100hp damage in this way, and i have 800 unbuffed, but it does take alot of mana, mostly from root breaks.<br />
<br />
i dont nuke much, because of the large mana costs, and EB/Affliction are very effecient...<br />
<br />
<br />
I was just wundrin, is there a better way of doing this? i dont canni THAT much during fights, because i have a pretty good mana pool.  im almost never stressed for mana mid fight, and eventhen  i rarely take too much damage save canni.  I do melee sometimes, but my downtime is always more doing that cause i have to heal up abit, but i dont use as much mana.  i believe im getting a good 1hb from my friend soon(dont know name, &quot;present&quot;), so that should help in dmg dealing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wundring what you guys solo'd, and how in the last couple of boring levels.</div></div><hr />
