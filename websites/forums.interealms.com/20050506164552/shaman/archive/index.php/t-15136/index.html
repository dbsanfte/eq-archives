<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can a well suited shaman with epic and all spells solo at all in POP zones? Or is it impossible? Please let me know. Thanks. Oh and how is downtime with shaman regening mana ? Are we as good as necro at 65? Thanks..</div></div><hr />

Wow, useful response  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
My understanding, though I am niether 65 nor do I possess an epic or all the spells, is that a shaman with good hp/ac who picks the right zone can solo 2nd tier efficiently and do ok in 3rd tier if they're skilled.  I'm sure some of our more enlightened members will give you some specifics, but I hope that helps for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Level 65 shaman can quite easily solo in PoP.<br />
Zones I've soloed in:<br />
PoJ<br />
PoD<br />
PoI<br />
PoN<br />
HoH<br />
PoS<br />
PoV<br />
PoTactics<br />
PoSuck (the zone with Saryrn in it.   refuse to call it any other name)<br />
Temple of Sol Ro (tank down mobs or kite them.  usually a bit of both)<br />
Plane of Fire<br />
<br />
I could solo in CoD, but there's too many unslowables, and too many adds to deal with, and too many trains to the zone in which is about the only place you can handle soloing.<br />
<br />
The plane of water and air just aren't engineered to allow you to solo the mobs there with the types of pulls you'll get.<br />
The plane of earth has enough solo pulls, but the mobs rampage and seem to have harsher resists and there's traps in the zone that mess you up and the mobs have really annoying procs.  Soloing in PoE would be more effort than it's worth.<br />
<br />
I think I could solo in Bastion of Thunder, but it's honestly been so long since I've hunted there that I can't remember if the mobs mitigate slow and/or they summon you, but either one severly inhibits soloing.  It's why soloing generally isn't done in PoS either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was soloing in PoN near the graveyard quite easily at 60 with Torpor.  My favorite spot - go north from the GY, there's a &quot;fake treant&quot; and then the zone edge veers right, there's a static spawn at the tip (often a bird, sometimes a tree, rarely a spider).  Keep going past this point to the next &quot;valley&quot; in the zone wall and set up camp here.  There are four static spawns in easy pulling distance, three trees to your north and the one you just passed.  Trains run around the outcropping so they pretty much miss you.<br />
<br />
Strategy: root the mob, apply Maloxxx, apply Turgur's, apply epic, back off and apply your best disease DoT.  Root will break, so run back to camp, take the hits while applying more DoTs, reroot and back off.  Either heal yer dog or just back him off when he gets low.  I keep Regrowth on him so if I do back him off he recovers super fast.<br />
<br />
PoD/PoI are just about as easy.<br />
<br />
I have attempted to solo HoH, and while I have made individual kills there I never got into a viable rhythm, mostly due to the fact that it's very hard to pull singles there.<br />
<br />
I have soloed successfully in PoS/PoV but it's too much work.  Honestly, if I'm soloing I prefer a steady supply of low blues but NO DOWNTIME, even if the XP isn't quite as good.  I get bored easily and don't want a 10-minute recovery period after a kill.  Someone better at soloing, or someone who likes a 10-15 minute intense hunt followed by 5-10 minutes of downtime, would probably find some spots in PoS/PoV to be quite good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A non idiot shaman can solo any mob who doesn't summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">anymob that does summon, and is rootable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A mob being unrootable doesn't make it unsoloable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aslong as you can slow it enough to make it tankable with Torpor/Q you can solo unrootable mobs...<br />
<br />
As for soloing in the planes its quite possible. When PoP came out ( i was still quite ghetto then, still am btw ) i soloed the yardtrash in PoN, i believe i was round 58 or so then...<br />
<br />
If you have most of your spells you can solo outside the cave in PoV, just stack your dots and see the mobs HP's tick down.<br />
<br />
Depending on where you lie gearwise and spellwise you can probably solo in a majority of the zones of PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your necro will do it better, but we do it just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think it was at 56 I was in the right court yard in a group.  We got extras and people died.  I was able to get things rooted, and was able to wear them down using mainly the epic and the occational DoT.  After the group broke up, I decided to see if I could do it without any back up.  I would pull with Malasi (or whatever that is at that level) root, slow, epic, and then DoT.  I did not use the pet.  I didn't keep doing it because exp is better grouped, but it can be done at 56.<br />
