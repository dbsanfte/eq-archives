<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerplikda</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having both a Half elf ranger and a halfling ranger I think wood elf only fletching is CRAP. <br />
<br />
I love doing tradeskills in RL. I do candlemaking, minor wood/metal work, leathercraft, sew, cook, starting on brewing and wife is trying to get me into soapmaking. <br />
<br />
I used to think trade skills were cool in EQ till I realized how much of a pain in the &amp;%^$%#$^%$(^ it is. <br />
<br />
In RL it doesn't take me 400 combines to master making eggs. I think there need to be more recipes for ALL tradeskill and they need to be more useful for the players. FLETCHING included.<br />
<br />
I am still a lowbie ranger but dang I would love to be able to make a bow at 225+ skill that is 28+ dam for less than 70 del because I am sure I will have 225 fletching skill LOOOOOONG before I am of the level that I can go and say hi to the sleeper or dragon necropolis.</div></div><hr />

Makes about as much sense as Wood-Elf Onlu Cultural Fletching.  Could you imagine the uproar that would cause :cool:</div></div><hr />
