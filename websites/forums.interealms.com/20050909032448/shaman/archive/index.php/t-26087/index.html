<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm bugged for getting any further progresion quests and was wondering if any of you had seen this or had a suggestion.  I posted the following on the SoE boards:<br />
<br />
I am amiable and have completed all the steps through Emoush but am unable to get the next quests from Private Nylaen Kel'Ther.  I had a problem with Chieftain Relae Aderi eating my glowing stone which was replaced by a GM.<br />
 <br />
Background:<br />
 <br />
I completed the first 3 progression quests (Greed of the Goblins, Creating an Antidote, and Burning Arrows) and did the Children of Gimblax event.  I received the Gift of the Keepers ability and 2 AAs.<br />
 <br />
About this time I did the Calling of Emoush event and received a glowing stone.  It was before I completed the next set of quests.  Can't remember the exact order.<br />
 <br />
I completed the second set of quests (Turn the Tides of the Sand, Recover the Lost Map, and Defend the Kirin Contract) but did not yet do the Sickness of Spirit mission.<br />
 <br />
I hailed the Chieftain and got the text asking for evidence of the Emoush kill and handed him my glowing stone.  He ate it.  I /petitioned and got my stone back.  I then attempted to give the stone to the Chieftain again and he would not take it.<br />
 <br />
I then did the Sickness of the Spirit mission and went back to the Chieftain.  When I hailed him I received the Valor of the Keepers ability and 2 AAs.  I had not offered him the stone yet.  I then tried to give him the glowing stone but he would not (and still will not) take it.<br />
 <br />
Between the time the Chieftain ate my stone and when I hailed him and got the Valor of the Keepers ability the Chieftain would send me to the Private and the Private would give me the next 3 quests (Snowfoot Revenge, Protect the Waters, and The Sacred Scrolls).  I think I did not accept those quests but I'm not sure.<br />
 <br />
Since I hailed the Chieftain and got the Valor of the Keepers ability I no longer get sent to the Private and the Private will no longer give me the quests.  I have killed snowfoot goblins in a group and the quest did not appear or update as we killed.  At this point the Chieftain merely tells me to go find Tirrunun and kill him and the Private gives his standard text.<br />
 <br />
I /petitioned this problem but was informed by a GM in response that they can't fix this problem and to report it here and /bug it.<br />
 <br />
Let me know if there is any more information you need to know.  Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok here's the rundown on what happened.<br />
<br />
Basically the Cheiftain did not eat your first stone, he accpeted it like he was supposed to. However because you had not yet done the teir 2 group mission, you had not completed all the steps to obtain the second faction award, so you did not get it.<br />
<br />
After you completed the teir 2 group mission and you went back to camp and hailed the Cheiftain you recived the 2nd faction reward, as you had then compelted all the teir two tasks.<br />
<br />
The stone the GM reimbursed you can be destroyed.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why you were able to get the teir 3 quests before completing all the teir 3 tasks. You should not have been able to.<br />
<br />
I would hazard a guess that when you petitioned to have your stone replaced because it was &quot;eaten&quot; the GM might have done something else on top of giving you a new stone, possible adjusting your faction level.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that something got thrown out of wack because you did the turn in out of order. From what I understand you are supposed to complete the 3 quests, then the group mission, then the raid mission. In reality you can do them in any order, however DO NOT turn in the raid item until you have completed the rest.<br />
<br />
You are not the only person that has had this problem.<br />
<br />
Anyways because the Cheiftan will not send you to one of his underlings to get the teir 3 tasks, it appears that everything is working as it is supposed to now.<br />
<br />
Now I bet you're saying ***? I can't progress, how can everything be working right?<br />
<br />
The reason is becuase unless you also did a ton of missions aside from the assigned tasks in order to get faction, you will not have a high enough faction level to get the tier 3 tasks.<br />
<br />
You need to have a high amiable faction level before the NPC's will give you the teir 3 tasks. If you have just done the assigned tasks in order and perhaps a few missions for crystals, your faction will not be high enough.<br />
<br />
Keep working those missions, and turning in the sphere for the faction boosts. I'll bet after 5 or so more missions, 10 at the outside your faction will be high enough to get the teir 3 tasks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like gaknab said he didn't eat it he accepted it like he's suppose to but since you hadn't completed the sickness of spirit mission yet you hadn't finished that level and didn't get the aa and exp.<br />
 <br />
I then did the Sickness of the Spirit mission and went back to the Chieftain.  When I hailed him I received the Valor of the Keepers ability and 2 AAs.  I had not offered him the stone yet.  I then tried to give him the glowing stone but he would not (and still will not) take it.<br />
 <br />
Now that you've completed the tier it gave you the aa's and exp. It won't take the stone again because it already took the one from you and there's no reason to take a second.<br />
<br />
Between the time the Chieftain ate my stone and when I hailed him and got the Valor of the Keepers ability the Chieftain would send me to the Private and the Private would give me the next 3 quests (Snowfoot Revenge, Protect the Waters, and The Sacred Scrolls).  I think I did not accept those quests but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
There's no way not to accept the quests. They are automatically added the instant you hail. Not to cover the obvious but if you hit alt q for tasks they should still be listed?<br />
<br />
Since I hailed the Chieftain and got the Valor of the Keepers ability I no longer get sent to the Private and the Private will no longer give me the quests.  I have killed snowfoot goblins in a group and the quest did not appear or update as we killed.  At this point the Chieftain merely tells me to go find Tirrunun and kill him and the Private gives his standard text.<br />
 <br />

At this point my biggest question would be what shows up in your Alt q window if anything. If nothing you probably just need more faction. My bard is in that situation right now. He's finished the second set but can't get the third set because he needs more faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the responses.  Looks like I just need more faction.  I should be close but hard to tell high amiable from amiable.<br />
<br />
When I do the alt-q I show the first 6 tasks completed.  It would be nice if the window also showed missions and events in the progression line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know whether destroying the stone or getting more faction did it but I'm unbugged now.  Thanks )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Benthair Dunthat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My druid is in the same position, finished step 2 but not high enough faction for Step 3. My monk, however, has received the Step 3 tasks. Although both of them con amiably to their respective camps (druid/good - monk/evil), the good druid is dubious to the dark guards and the evil monk is scowls to the good guards.<br />
<br />
Guess what I am suggesting is that you may be able to judge if you are &quot;high amiable&quot; by conning the opposing guards.</div></div><hr />
