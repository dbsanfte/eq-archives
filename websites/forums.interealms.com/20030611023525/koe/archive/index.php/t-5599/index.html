<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dear Mr. Smith:<br />
<br />
         Ann Landers wouldn't print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out.<br />
         Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain.<br />
<br />
         It's about my son, Billy. He's always been a good, normal 10-year-old boy. Well, last spring<br />
         we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy.<br />
<br />
         We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming,<br />
         canoeing, games, singing by the campfire - you know. There were sports camps and<br />
         specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in<br />
         Tibetan knot tying.<br />
<br />
         I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It's where he went last year. Billy would have<br />
         none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We<br />
         should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago.<br />
<br />
         I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. He's changed. I can't explain it. See for<br />
         yourself.<br />
<br />
         These are some of my little Billy's letters:<br />
<br />
         Letter #1<br />
         The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We're<br />
         learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up.<br />
         - Love, Billy.<br />
<br />
         Letter #2<br />
         Dear Mom, Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to<br />
         choose what we want to drink. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I'm getting used<br />
         to it now. Gotta go, it's time for the flowchart class.<br />
         - Love, Billy.<br />
         P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It's spell checked too.<br />
<br />
         Letter #3<br />
         Dear Mom, Don't worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the<br />
         green computer screens. It was real neat. I don't have much of a tan cause we don't go<br />
         outside very often. You can't see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp<br />
         camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I'm OK, really.<br />
         - Love, Billy.<br />
<br />
         Letter #4<br />
         Dear Mom, I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough. This is the best camp ever.<br />
         We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and<br />
         yelled. Can you send more money? I've got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that<br />
         you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad.<br />
         - Love, Billy.<br />
<br />
         Letter #5<br />
         Dear Mother, Forget the money for the telephone. We've got a way to not pay. Sorry I<br />
         haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good at getting onto any computer in the<br />
         country. It's really easy! I got into the university's in less than 15 minutes. Frederick did it in<br />
         five, he's going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He's really smart. He says<br />
         that I shouldn't call myself Billy anymore. So, I'm not.<br />
         - Signed, William.<br />
<br />
         Letter #6<br />
         Dear Mother, How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why'd you get so upset? I<br />
         haven't gained that much weight. The glasses aren't real. Everybody wears them. I was<br />
         trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you'd be proud of my<br />
         program. After all, I've made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000.<br />
         Anyway, I've paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won't be home until late August.<br />
         - Regards, William.<br />
<br />
         Letter #7<br />
         Mother, Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only 10 years old. It was silly of<br />
         you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. -<br />
         the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. OK? I won't write<br />
         again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication<br />
         drain me.<br />
         - Sincerely, William.<br />
<br />
         What can I do, Mr. Smith? See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my<br />
         little boy. I know that it's probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these<br />
         letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to<br />
         do so. Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
         Sally Gates, Concerned Parent</div></div><hr />
