<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Muggins here has been browbeaten into organising raids on Naggy and Vox for my guild's level 52 and lower peeps. Gulp.<br />
<br />
So, here is my current plan:<br />
<br />
Minimum level: 47?<br />
Minimum Magic resist before buffs: 100<br />
Minimum Fire/cold resist before buffs: 100<br />
<br />
Minimum number of people: 20 (i.e. 4 groups of 5)<br />
<br />
At the moment I can guarantee:<br />
2 main tanks - both warriors, bit will be over level 50, and 2 clerics both over level 50, 1 monk level 52, 1 shaman level 51, 1 druid level 52. Everyone else will be a mishmash of players from level 47 - 50 of all different classes, including at least 1 mage, 1 wizard, 1 ranger.<br />
<br />
We will have some higher level characters standing by for high level buffs - particularly high level Cleric hp/Ac buffs, drood resist buffs, Chanter hastes etc<br />
 <br />
Do we stand any chance ?<br />
<br />
If you think we stand a snowball's chance in lavastorm of pulling this off, I would appreciate ANY advice on what I need to concentrate on, any strategys and traps for young players etc.<br />
<br />
I have been on 1 Vox raid, so I have some clue (but I spent about 50% of the time feared and at level 39 I just went along for the rush!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Guildmate of mine got heavily into Vox/Naggy raids, quite some time ago.  He has a few good guides up, check them out.  http://www.crimsontalon.com/raid.htm</div></div><hr />

My cleric, who had next to zero resists, did fine on his first, and so far only Naggy raid. 21 people, 3 deaths. However, we did have druid resists buffs, and cleric aegolism.  I guess you should make sure you have enough clerics though :) We had 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Naggy is a piece of cake - you can do him with 24 or less if they are even halfway competent and have a decent mix...<br />
<br />
From what you have listed it sounds like you could use 2-4 more clerics (any over 39th will do really)...shoot for a dozen melee types or so and try to make sure you have a 49th+ wizard or two (and don't forget to make the shaman nuke ;-)<br />
<br />
Vox is much much harder - if your guild has 53rd+s see if they will help with break in/covering ice giant repop...I'd try a practice raid on this one to see if you can get to her lair easily first..and to get everyone familiar with the route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any Vox, Naggy raid guide needs as its first sentence:<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring 2 glasses of water and a bottle of aspirin, place next to monitor and prepare to use.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, with good gear naggy and vox can be done with 9 people, and probably less.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok, the thing for Vox is ENCHANTERS.  If you don't have atleast 3 enchanters, don't go.  You need them all manasieving/theft of thought-ing from the very beginning so that she can't CH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">oh yea, bards are crucial too</div></div><hr />

I've been a few Vox/Naggy raids recently. The general rule of thumb for the resists has been 50MR 80FR/CR as a minimum. With druid buffs and mage items my resists get upto 150 ish (cant remember the exact number)<br />
<br />
If you have enough bards in the raid then putting one in each group will send the resists through the roof.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest that everyone gets an insta right  click item to replace dispelled buffs. I use a tinkered spyglass that I click between heals as I loose my junk buffs.<br />

On Antonius Bayle an 18 man naggy team is being set up with the aim to reduce this to 12 once they get the knack. This is with people like me with average gear rather than with people with kickass stuff!</div></div><hr />
