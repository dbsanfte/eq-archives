<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am intersted in hearing some tips for soloing dragons in WW.<br />
<br />
What kind of armor do I need to get before I can attempt this, what lvl do I need and what are the names on the dragons you can solo?<br />
<br />
I dont have malo, torpor or epic and is lvl 59 atm.<br />
<br />
Guessing starting of with malonis... then send pet as a speedbump and get slow of. then just get in teh face and dot jbb and what ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the only dragon in WW that is soloable is yeldema, this is what i do when i fight her:  <br />
<br />
get c3 from nexus or whatever and head out to ww.<br />
<br />
when you zone into WW from SG, go out the tunnel, turn left and follow the cliff-line until you hit yeldema, shes a red dragon that looks exactly like Nagafen and Telkaronar, she is sitting on a nest with big eggs.    i go to the cliff near the water which is around 600 feet from her, summon pet, give him celerity,  and get fom.. <br />
my spell line up was (this was at lvl58):<br />
1. gate<br />
2. chloroblast<br />
3. kraggs<br />
4. turgurs<br />
5. ebolt<br />
6. bof<br />
7. plague<br />
8. malosini<br />
<br />
park pet near cliff and wait till there are no roamers around, only drakes and craygwurms and hounds will add on you.<br />
<br />
pull her with malosini, slow her.. stack the dots and JBB.. heal as needed and reapply dots.. she runs when shes on hp but very slowly so i dont even bother rooting.   <br />
<br />
oh and first time i solod her was at lvl56 but i had VoQ.  pretty much same tactic only healing with chloroblast was a pain.<br />
<br />
best of luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bull**** btw =p<br />
<br />
I suggest you not to say things like &quot;the only&quot; or &quot;never&quot; or such things about stuff you have no clue about  =)<br />
<br />
other then that find it out the path to figuring out an encounter is what makes this game worthwile not the loot you wont get anyways from these.<br />
<br />
I can just tell you there are more then 3 possibly shaman soloable so called &quot;dragons&quot; in WW. Yeldema is not even a dragon yeldema is a joke .... even a warrior has soloed yeldema already.<br />
<br />
Yeldema is the one &quot;dragon&quot; everyone kills.... the others are most likely only by shaman/chanter ( and bards in some cases) soloable. But who knows  what some crazy people try and get done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hey smartass, before you try to diss other ppl how about you actually read the first post on the thread?<br />
<br />
he said he is a 59 shaman with no torpor, malo or epic.. now im positive a lvl65 shaman decked out in VT gear like you can solo other dragons, if you cant you should heavily consider another game, but i doubt he will be able to do it without uber buffs or even at all.<br />
<br />
kthxbye~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 59 you might be able to do Yeldema, but it would be difficult.  A few others have done it (use the search feature if you can find them).  At 60 with torpor Yeldema becomes much more manageable, as well as opening the door to all of the nest dragons.  Most of the valley dragons (along the wall by ToV) are soloable as well at 60, though they are very difficult.<br />
<br />
I would say the ae nest dragons are not soloable before 60, but then someone will just come along one day and prove me wrong.  With enough determination, skill, and practice at it, you may manage to kill one without torpor.  None of it is worthwhile other than for bragging rights, however, if you are aiming for loot or exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the nest dragons might be doable, but tough.  The valley dragons are right-out, not soloable...they're the toughest dragons in the zone (excepting Sont/Kland).</div></div><hr />

<br />
all of these dragons besides the one that silences should be entirely soloable. All easily slowable at 65 with malo an none of them hit that hard. I'll admit I have yet to try myself, but with good resists and smart playing I see no reason why it cant be done. I've duo'd Allyish a few times trying for a 6/7 tali, and that dragon is a punk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While some of the dragons that are soloable are painfully long and difficult (such as anything that can CH, or the gaters - because fighting on some bind points can be a problem with adds), there are only a  VERY few dragons in WW that are not shaman-soloable.<br />
<br />
These are:<br />
Category 1) Fluxproc dragons<br />
---Most notable, the Saparas.  There isn't really much to do about a 1k+ proc.  Maybe someone with really spiffy gear will prove me wrong with one that doesn't proc as often (like Mav Sapara).  But I'm pretty sure that no one will be soloing Jen or Rak.<br />
<br />
Category 2) Silence dragons<br />
---Esorpa of the Ring, Ionat.  They silence too often, for too long.  I know someone said they got Esorpa to 60 once, so perhaps it is doable if you are in VERY good gear and get VERY lucky, but I think that would be more fluke that typical.<br />
<br />
Category 3) Massive damage<br />
---Sontalak, Klandicar.  Because, well ... that should be obvious.  Harla Dar can fit in here, too, although its more a problem with her resists and spellcasting than the damage per se.<br />
<br />
Everything else CAN be soloed.  Now then ... sub 60 ... I think dropping the weak AE dragons (like Gafala or Hachaeva) would be VERY tough, but I suppose it might be theoretically possible.  Good hp and resists will help a lot.  I'd probably employ potions for that attempt - at least the DS.  Soloing purists will argue that the intaclick heal potion is unfair ... but that ought to make these quite doable, although still difficult.</div></div><hr />
