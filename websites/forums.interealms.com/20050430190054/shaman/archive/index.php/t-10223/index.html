<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys I have a close friend playing a Mage and we are both level 34 with these characters. We duoed last night and was a blast but what I am wondering is how far can we go as a duo?<br />
<br />
Any input would be much appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd vote it one of the best duos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh absolutely; at 63 (shm) and 65 (mag) this combo works wonders. We've regularly grouped in valor and storms and had a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mage/Shaman is one of the most powerful duos in the game simply because the classes compliment each other to remove weaknesses.  <br />
<br />
The shaman covers the defensive side of the fight, being able to slow, buff up the pet, keep everyone alive, and otherwise control the situation better (plus pets don't bitch when you torpor them :D)<br />
<br />
The mage gets the killing done, with efficient nukes, and a decent tank that goes between the 2 casters and the mob, which coincidentally puts out some decent damage on its own. Summoned Focus items add a little versatility.<br />
<br />
Mage/Shaman is one of my favorite duos, but I'm also partial to Necro/Shaman or Bard/Shaman, which give a lot more flexibility at the expense of sheer destructive power, or tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Edit: Spelling &gt; Me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mage/Shaman lacks a lot of utility. You don't have FD, lull or harmony to split camps and you also miss out on Snare and Fear. Earth Pets are also annoying, once a mob is rooted he always seems to beat on the shaman pet. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, you're combining the best defensive with the best offensive class in the game. It can't help but work well. As long as you don't mind sticking to places where you can pull mainly singles the sheer killing power of a mage combined with shaman slow and crowd control seems to work well all the way into the 60s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Splitting camps is very easy once the mage gets level 55 and attains CotH.<br />
<br />
Splitting/killing giant camps in Storms is easy enough with a shaman/mage duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was grouped with a mage and my warrior wife the other day and the mage was astonished to discover that his pet had soloed an add while we were focusing our attention on two others.  Seems he hadn't dealt with shaman slows in small groups before and didn't quite realize how much more his pet could do when paired with those slows :-)<br />
<br />
He was pretty gung ho on finding a shaman to duo with regularly after that session.</div></div><hr />

Fun fight and made more so with the Wurm add soon into the fight, ended up having 2 really hating me a lot there for a bit,  the Dragon Yeldema is soloable by necros and sk's becuase they can fear kite it but for a first person view of the fight it is OMG that thing is a monster,  ended up topor tanking it most of the fight and was lucky to get those casted without interruptions. For a lv 55- mob this is one tough cookie.  anyways mage shaman R good.<br />
Anyways my advice for doing larger mobs that hit for lots and are generally fast before slowed is to reslow early and often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Reyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This thread got me interested in trying to box a mage and shaman. I can imagine that the mage is a fairly low maintenance class who would perform well when boxed?<br />
<br />
You say this duo is very powerful, but how well do you think this boxing combination would perform at higher levels? I'd love to be able to kill Guardian Wurms, Lodizal, etc. with just a duo and not being restricted to a melee class to compliment my shaman.<br />
<br />
Also I think these two could work very well in a regular group if the mage doesn't require that much attention (tried boxing a bard and a shaman once, not gonna make that mistake again).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to 2box 60 shaman and mage all the time. Had no trouble killing the named mind burrower in Maidens Eye when I tried it. Think the fight lasted 3 epic casts long.  Ran out to the middle of the zone and grabed it with turgurs...had masive amounts of adds, all the stuff that spawns when you run over a triger out there. Begin casting CotH...ooo, it's all alone sitting on the hill in front of me. Mage casts mala (I didn't have malo at the time) I slow it. Send in both pets. Mage uses DoTs and a couple mod rods. I kept torpor on the mage and the pet.<br />
<br />
CotH makes pulling easy...just go through a few pearls. Used CotH to pull in UP alot back then as well. Start casting just before shaman is back to the tunnel, goes off halfway through the tunnel, leaving your pull standing there and the adds are usually outside the tunnel still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A mage/shaman combo is very powerful. I group with a Shaman all the time (I'm obviously the mage).<br />
<br />
As for things we can kill:<br />
Lodizal<br />
Guardian Wurms<br />
All of Sebilis (jumpy, prots, fungi king...no trak obviously)<br />
Most WW dragons (Ayillish, etc)<br />
Phinny<br />
Anything in tier 1&amp;2 planes (other than high named)<br />
<br />
Pretty much anything we set our minds on. It's harder to find certain mobs up than it is to kill them.<br />
<br />
Pulling is easy just about anywhere with CotH.<br />
<br />
And we can do all this without being in a guild (we dont raid, all of our items we attained ourselves), so you don't need to get all the best gear to do it. Just need to have the guts to try something that other people say you cant do.<br />
<br />
This is a great combo through the levels too. You start out as a great combo and you only get better from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The mage/shm duo is excellent. The majority of my hunting is with a mage friend.<br />
<br />
What i like about mages<br />
1. they can heal their own pets<br />
2. air pet stun combos well with shm slows so heals are not needed that frequently (add Gnoll Lariats and watch the xp fly)<br />
3. reduced downtime since pets regen is amazing (better than monk with fungi)<br />
4. Regrowth / mod rod = reduce more downtime<br />
<br />
I also find that our 61 pet no longer steals taunt from the mage pets.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The issue with dogdog tanking instead of magician pets was melee range, that seems to have been fixed with True Spirit.  Basically, Pet agro is like root agro, mobs will always choose the closest one.   Magician elementals, along with various other advantages, have a crazy-long melee range.  Dogdog does not.  Without some severe shenanegans before, it was impossible to convince mobs to prefer the more tankish pet for hitting.  Before 61, it's pretty much a waste of mana to even bring up a shaman pet, except for tanking adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Big, huge, important point here. I always group with a shaman (we made the characters together). Up until she got the lvl 61 pet, the shaman pet would get agro 98% of the time. This was very frustrating considering the different tanking abilities of each pet. Eventually we found ways to have the mage pet keep agro a little more, but that would reduce dps and was generally a pain.<br />
<br />
Now it's the exact opposite. The mage pet gets agro 98% of the time now. That makes things so much easier.</div></div><hr />
