<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ability: Discordant Defiance <br />
Description: This ability raises the maximum that your resistances can increased to with items and spells by 5 points per rank. <br />
Cost per Level: 5<br />
<br />
I didnt know there was a cap... if there is I sure dont have to worry about buying this AA for a LONG time.  I see so many folks with 500 to all resists that my 160s arent going to be busting past the glass ceiling any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, nice list ... low-cost AAs that are pretty nifty ... I like the extra healing AA's and the chance for a crit tick on an HOT. Sharp. The pet AA's ... I could do without those. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very relieved that the costs seem more in line with POP AA costs than GoD AA costs. Can't wait to get the rez, group heal, new cann and crit HOTs!! Lots of other stuff looks yummy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think those are the initial costs. Some might be the same for each level, but many probably escalate as you increase, just like the PoP ones (some were 3 3 3, others were 2 4 6). With the large number of AAs in the list, we could be talking about some serious AA numbers to get all of the usefull ones. Abilities listed as having a 3 cost probably are actually 3 6 9 while those listed for 5 are likely 5 5 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, I know they are the intial costs. Still, initial costs beginning at 3 (3/6/9) are far more appealing than initial costs beginning at 5 (5/10/15).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A lot of the info is incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Incorrect in a bad way? (ie the costs look lower than reality)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Incorrect in that the HP regen is no longer 5 per rank, only 1 per rank.  The Delay Death is 50 hp per rank instead of 100 per rank.  Etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, most likely many of those are initial costs and go 3/6/9.   For the most part they seem to be like PoP ones, the healing, defensive, offensive, etc all go 3/6/9 and the ones that raise stat caps, ft caps, etc are 5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Incorrect in a bad way? (ie the costs look lower than reality)<br />
<br />
The AA costs look as if they were correct, but Delay Death, for instance, gives only a 50 HP buffer per rank instead of 100.</div></div><hr />
