I have been killed countless times only to be healed off the ground to continue fighting.<br />
<br />
My favorite to date was just a few days ago, when a friend (Iksar Monk) and I were killing some guards in Seru while waiting for some others to join us to work on the earring quest.  There was one particular citizen of this city (I can't remember his name but we started calling him Elmo), who ended up beating the crap out of us a couple of times, and we became determined to do him in.  The third time we pulled Elmo it was going to be close, but I was so determined this time I didn't really care if I died, I just wanted him dead.  It so happened that Elmo's HP and mine ran out at exactly the same time; Elmo lay dead on the floor, I lay bleeding to death in a puddle beside him.  Within seconds, my friend has started to bandage me, and up I stood, victorius; Saved by a Bandaid.<br />
<br />
Took me a couple of days to quit lauging....my best FD yet.<br />
<br />
Was wondering if any other rangers out there are practicing the fine art of FD.....*grin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, getting jumped in EJ, the group scattering like teenagers being caught having a party, then creating more trains as everyone ran off in thier own direction. Trying to find each other again in the mayhem of being chased around a zone you don't know, being jumped by more and more mobs. MY RL wife (also a ranger) was about to die, I find her, stop, cast heal, get it channeled through my own hits as the druid shows up, channels HER heal to give my wife enough hitpoints to make a dash for the zone line.<br />
The only one I knew how to find was Field of Bone. Was quite exciting, and I STILL fear EJ</div></div><hr />

I'm Solo but Have SOW up and Full health so I give it a go. Down to half a bub, no MANA and thinking its time to flee, but Thistle is down to no red showing, just one good wack and he's mine. Swing Miss, Swing Miss, You have been knocked unconciouss. Waiting for the death blow; Then I get the you have gained exp. Moral IS never underestimate the mighty power of our Flame lick Spell.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reminder.<br />
<br />
Way back in the LOIO career, I was grouped with a shammy and an enchanter.  Shammy was oom and had cannibalized down to 1 bubble of health. I was down and bleeding when the Enchanter finally got the mezz to stick. Enchanter slapped a bandaid on me to save the day!!  I will never forget the way my heart was pounding at the end of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glor</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long ago, me and my warrior buddy Talad were duoing corrupt Qeynos guards in WK.  We were fighting the hard one from the guard tower near the fishing village this one particular day.  He was very hard for our level, so we were aggro kiting so-to-speak (I'd keep aggro with flamelick, he would follow behind and melee.)  One particular fight was going badly, where I was having a hard time regaining aggro when he would periodically turn on Talad.  Talad was getting low on health, so I would close and engage in melee, taunting and flamelicking.  This happened time after time, with me taking several big hits each time I would regain aggro.  So both of our health meters were on the decline.<br />
<br />
As the guard was about to die, once again Talad got too much aggro and I had to close into melee range to try and gain aggro.  Well, one last big hit put me on the ground, unconscious.  Talad scored a successful taunt, and I popped back up.  Immediately, the guard was on me and I went down a SECOND time.  again, Talad scores a successful taunt, and I lay there bleeding.  Miraculously, I stood up again and the evil guard fell.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that was an arduous read, but the point is, that was a DOUBLE Ranger FD. :)</div></div><hr />

It was the best chanter FD I had ever seen. Spooked our cleric when the supposed dead man wanted a heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamas</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way back in the early days of EQ, at the tender level of 16 or so, I was in Unrest and had just returned from LD to find my group still fighting near the tunnel mouth. I had gone LD very low on health, and when I logged in, a mob they were fighting hit me and inflicted me with rabies even as it knocked me unconscious. I lay there at zero hit points watching them continue to fight and pull, unable even to send a tell or speak in guildchat, hoping and praying someone would notice I wasn't actually dead. I lay there like that for over an hour until the rabies wore off and my natural healing allowed me to stand back up with 1 hit point.<br />
<br />
And I was promptly killed by a ghoul as soon as I stood. :\</div></div><hr />

The cleric was going down, fast.  He hit his invul spell, and it took effect just as he fell to the ground.  Luckily by the time it wore off, the mobs were mezzed, and he had not bled to death, so I could heal him!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeril of Veeshan</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best example I've seen of this was the other night in CT .... we had a Pally MT (taunt still not working at that time) and the cleric started to lag while CHing.  Well, it started to look like he wasn't gonna make it, and I fired a heal in a pitiful last attempt to save him.  He dropped to bleeding, was healed for my mighty 90 (so standing again), then hit once for exactly 89.  The CH hit EXACTLY after the 89 hit .... he looked like a basketball .... down, up, down, up.  Then it came through the raid channel : Holy!  Aeril, you saved my life with a ranger heal!<br />
Hehe .... amazing luck played off like it was amazing skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ytrill Stonebow</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember camping the maid and butler about a year (?) ago, just me (43ish) and another Ranger (52ish). We got some adds that we couldn't park; they were resisting WAY above their level. Just as we were about to dispatch the last one, I noticed it was hammering my partner's unconscious body.<br />
<br />
I got one of those uber Ranger heals off in the nick of time - hehe. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tathagata</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I was about level 20. I think it was in Everfrost and I think the guy healing me was bout level 10.<br />
I got into trouble, started walking back to the guards, realised i wouldnt make it so i turned to make a last defiant stand.<br />
A young player came up and decided to help by healing as much as he could. Little did he know he was in for the best laugh we have had yet.<br />
to keep it short, I got knocked unconcious just as his heal landed, so i went down and got back up and kept fighting, it then happened again and again and again. About 5 or 6 times I went down and got up again to continue fighting. Ended up I killed the mob and we laughed our asses off.<br />
Tath the half elven Yoyo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegan Quistfeather</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had totally forgotten about this one until I was about halfway through this thread.  I was in a Old Ct group Level 28 or so pulling the Planks.  I got a couple Alligators with the Crsader that was up.  Took the Harm Touch fight going great untill my Bard Friend (Gotta love Bard Aggro)  Gets all the mobs on him.  We keep fighting kill all but one Gator and he is at no health.  Goes Unconsious I heal, Uncosious again, I heal, Unconsious again, I heal, after 5 down ups the SK in the group finally just Harmtouches the Gator.  Can't remember what the hell our healer was doing (Was one of thos bad Pickup groupd).<br />
<br />
Next day at work me and the bard were laughing hysterically about it.  Saved by a pathetic(30?) Ranger heal!</div></div><hr />

Shortly after joining the guild I'm with now, a raiding guild, it happened on a raid, and the cleric was going off about how she couldn't believe I lived.  I just had to shrug it off and say, &quot;It happens.&quot; :p</div></div><hr />
