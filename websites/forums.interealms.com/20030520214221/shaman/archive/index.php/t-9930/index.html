<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else getting insane resists on cold/poison nukes/dots in BoT on regular giants, even after malo/malosini? Its gotten so bad that all I do is slow(hello migitation message:), keep pet on the mob, spear dot and wait for the mob to die.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas how to improve DPS in here, we are bound to be here a long time, and id like to feel like im pulling my load atleast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depend on what type of giant, only Water giant suck for shaman, all other are ok, I alway malo every giant to reduce risk on resist and let tank few second get agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yup depends on wing you are in.<br />
<br />
I like sand/south, poison and cold land well there.<br />
Other 2 wings my spells seem to land okay.<br />
<br />
The water wing sucks, disease will land there after debuff but usually fights don't last longenough for disease to run very far.<br />
<br />
What you might consider doing for water wing is spelling your cleric a bit.  You heal (and use pet and epic if possible) and let them nuke and melee and summon hammers and all that.  At least it's something I do to keep myself occupied from time to time.   If your heals are not keeping up they are always there to help. <br />
<br />
If you are having problems with agro, have someone root on inc.  Simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sand giants are the only ones that spells land regularly for full damage on.  I always malo and malosini every giant in the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use Pox/epic on the water giants (east wing). Better doing crap damage than none at all ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: i'll use the 'spell the cleric' idea next time Henora; I already step in for 'super cleric clarity' by taking over healing for a few pulls (ie: after a round of virtues/ bad pull etc)</div></div><hr />
