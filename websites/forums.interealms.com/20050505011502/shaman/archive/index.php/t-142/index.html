<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Berserker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I logged on the other night and saw the price increase.  Needless to say its pretty sad what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Here is the deal we need to send the word out to all the message boards to have everyone cancel their subscriptions.<br />
<br />
<br />
What does that do?  Really nothing, all that happens is that you are not automatically renewed.  After your subscription time runs out you just need to input your credit card number before you can start playing again.  You can still play with your subscription canceled for the time you have paid for.<br />
<br />
I am not asking people to quit, this is more of a protest for show.  It does not affect you one bit in the game.  And they promise to hold characters for at least 3 Months after subscription runs out.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you are with me, go ahead and do it, also pass the word along.  If enough people cancel their subscription in the next week that will force Verant to look at the changes they are making.</div></div><hr />

I am glad they are raising the price and hope they make a lot of cash and get rich....   it will encourage others to develope great games that we can all play and $36 more a year is a pitance compared to how much Dell got for my new computer.<br />

The price hasn't been increased in 3 years, no one in their right mind is going to cancel their account over 3 dollars.  Every time VI changes one little thing about the game posts like this spring up, its so udderly ridiculous because none of them have been effective and this one certainly won't.   You don't like the game, then don't play either way stop complaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol<br />
no thanks, dont think i'll be canceling because of 3 dollars a month. Perhaps you should let your's run out if it bothers you that much. <br />
<br />
I have a feeling you wont let your acct lapse anyway. So...what are we talking about again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to agree here, it is JUST 3 bucks. How many forms of entertainment do you spend so much time on, and get it for so cheap? Hell, THREE YEARS with no price increase, it is fair.<br />
<br />
Prices inflate, EQ is a big deal, I can't imagine the required resources to run countless servers (don't forget, each zone takes quite a few resources, add in players, etc...)<br />
<br />
Had the price doubled, there would be cause for concern. They matched competing companies, and that, to me, is not too much to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Consider for a moment the increased costs of running the game over the 3 years that it's been out (hardware, bandwidth, labor, etc.) $3 is very reasonable, and, correct me if i'm wrong, brings EQ's cost in line with what DAoC charges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is hilarious.<br />
<br />
EQ is the only thing in the world whos price has not gone up in the last 2-3 years.<br />
<br />
If you cant afford 2 dollars more a month then your obvioulsy paying to much for something else.<br />
<br />
Name one thing that gives you as much entertainment and interaction at such a good price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The price is still so good I am keeping 3 accounts...may drop account #4 though once I get a druid up to full port ability on one of my main accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, currently I am paying for 4 accounts.  Mine, Ving's, Druid account and a former guildmember who had fallen on some financial hard times so I picked up the account and then she had a falling out with the guild (like 5 months ago) and I kept paying for it but I haven't seen her since.<br />
<br />
I recently tried to access the account because I wanted to cancel the subscription but she had changed the password.  <br />
<br />
What do you think is the best way to cancel that account?  I have four accounts on my credit card bill and I'm not sure which is which.  I think the easiest way is just to log into the three that I have and change them to another credit card. Then, when I get my bill for the next month, call Verant and cancel the one that is left.<br />
<br />
It wasn't really a big deal before, but I just don't feel like paying an extra 3 bucks a month for an account of someone that doesn't play anymore and then changed the password so I couldn't use the account either.  So, this one's for you, Beserker :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not only is Luclin unfinished, SOE has already announced yet another expansion. God the arrogance. <br />
<br />
When Legends was being discussed on these boards - I was flat out against it for this very reason. I predicted then, that if Legends was a success, then SOE would raise the monthly fee across all servers, and that's what happened.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm.. if 3 bucks a months is a make or break deal for then quit/protest. Personally eq is the most cost effective entertainment dollar I can think of (barring free things). They havnt raised the price since release, they do continue to add free content(hole/paineel/stonebrunt etc) and honestly Im still addicted after 3 years(though I take sporadic breaks when I get bored).<br />
<br />
IMO is less lag for me when people protesting the 3 bucks price increase quit =p<br />
<br />
Regarding luclin: it has made me and my small(5 person) guild filthy rich(well.. compared to before anyway.. not really compared to anyone else) by farming Shields of Bane Warding =p What else can I spend a week farming to make 25k a pop. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I understand the method of your protest, but I did not see any mention about why we were to protest in the first place.  Sure, they are increasing the price, but maybe you could be specific about whats wrong with them increasing the price.  You mentioned that what they were doing was pretty sad, perhaps you could elaborate on that before I blindy follow you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The whole fight is about the principle of the matter.  Sure 3$/month for most people is not that big of a deal.  However what level is a big deal?  When will you say its enough?<br />
<br />
Hey a decent concert is usually 50-75$ and that lasts like 3 hours so maybe Verant should charge a 25$/hour fee.  I do believe in the free market and they will find a price that will make them the most money.<br />
<br />
The protest would be for people to demand better services for their increase in cost.  Sure a movie costs more now a days but hey every place now has stadium seating with comfortable seats.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I guess in the end Landragoran is right.  The general populace does not care.  Also I predict that you will see another significant price increase before the year is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heh I find it no big deal.  I think its one of the BEST games out trere.  Dont get me wrong Final fantasy is still by FAR the best game/games out there.  I dont mind 3 more bills.  They have so many servers and so much up keep too the servers.  I dont see why they dont raise it up more then that.  Cancle your acount and if your on the zev give me your gear before you go.  I wont mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ahh, I see what you're saying now.<br />
<br />
So it's more of a preventative measure then a means by which to return the prices back to the way they were?<br />
<br />
I suppose I could see how VI might be much more willing to increase prices again if they found that noone minded the first hike, and that doing as you suggest would be an excellent way to let them know that we'll let this one go, but not to make a habit of it. :)<br />
<br />
So, I see where you're coming from (unless that's not where you're coming from, then I'm a dolt), but I'm still too lazy to go ahead and do it.  Sorry. :)</div></div><hr />

I think they are trying to hard and its causing more problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A 3 buck increase on an already extremely cheap monthly fee manages to piss off an ex eBay farmer. Am I the only one smelling a hypocrit here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Lets look at the facts and not the sentimentality.<br />
<br />
1. The company that produces everquest and supports it is not a non-profit organization, and Sony is a publicly held company as far as I am aware. <br />
<br />
2. Publicly held companies are responsible to be profitable for their stockholders.<br />
<br />
3. Like any company, there will be a bottom line with budget goals that need to be met.<br />
<br />
4. The company in question has many expenses that are part of the ongoing support of this game, including, but not limited to, hardware maintenance, hardware upgrades, network support staff, content developers, office administration, management, custodial staff, marketing, coding, artwork, internet connectivity, research and development, legal fees, lease, distribution fees, and electricity to make everything run. <br />
<br />
5. It is a sure bet that at least the costs associated with electricity, wages for at least much of the staff, and the building leases, along with addition of staff and hardware, have gone up over the past 3 years. <br />
<br />
6. Up until this point, even though these other things have gone up in cost for them, they have not raised the price to us.<br />
<br />
7. Increasing costs with the same subscription rate translates into lower performance on the ratio of money going out compared to money coming in. <br />
<br />
8. They are raising pricing by a moderate amount to keep budgets at their target levels. <br />
<br />
Really, if you look at your own situation, you have probably noticed that your rent, your utility bills, and damn near everything else that you pay for has gone up in price over the past three years. This happens to companies as well. To make up for lost revenue, a price increase is sometimes implemented. It is very simple. If these people that run the companies are given a bottom line to meet and they do not meet it, people lose their jobs after a while. It is the way economics tend to work. Now 3 dollars is not that much. It is surely more to some people than it is to others, but that really is not important here. The facts are that their costs have increased, and to make up for it so have ours. I personally think that they made a HUGE snafu with their timing of this however. They would have been MUCH better off announcing this right before the release of Luclin, or at least before the Legends server came online. With legends being more expensive, many people are pointing at that as the catalyst. While there may be SOME truth to that, I think that mostly it is due to pure and simple economic strategy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I am glad to see that most of the crucible audience is on the reasonable side of this issue.  Rio and Berserker excluded.  <br />
<br />
<br />
 Berserker -- Also I predict that you will see another significant price increase before the year is over. <br />
<br />
There is NO WAY there will be another increase in the standard subscription this year.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The protest would be for people to demand better services for their increase in cost.  <br />
<br />
I guess I am still among the few who believe we get great service for the fees we pay.  As for the overall value of EQ.  It is pretty much unbeatable.  We are entertained by this game for hours on end.  Some people spend half their waking hours logged in.  I don't think many of us have come across a better entertainment value than that.<br />
<br />
Face it this is arguably the greatest computer game of all time.  A fee increase of three dollars a month shouldn't inspire a subscriber uprising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Maybe Berserker is missing that VI has more then doubled the content that's available from the start. Also the CS HAS been improved if you want to believe or not. You just didn't get an answer from a gm or guide in the first few weeks and months from gm's. Now I get basically every petition answered (not that I have to petition often).<br />

So while they increased the content, zones, equipment, features, support they haven't increased the fees once. Tell me who else does this.</div></div><hr />

Or even worse, doing something mindless like watching idiot box from night to night.<br />
 Spending 13$ a month in EQ must be the best investment money&lt;-&gt;entertainement wise I have done in my whole adult age. I cant even think how much money Eq has saved me from spending. Well that maybe sounds stupid but yea it's true. If I spend my time in a raid I cant be drinking my 5th pint at the pub:) <br />
 And on the other hand, what other hobby can keep you entertained  as much as you want as often as you like ffor lousy 13$ a month? I take my Gf to movies once, and maybe take her for a beer at the bar after and I've easily spent 20$. For few hours of fun.<br />
 13$ is damn cheap for this much fun. Especially now that VI really seems to have started to do things for players. New expansions, new improvements, new features. I'm not a fanboy of verant but I sure wont complain either.  We live in a capitalist world, better get used to it.</div></div><hr />

I work as an office administrative type for a major cable-modem ISP.  I know how much bandwidth charges are.  Excite@Home and all it's contracts went down (Cox, AT&amp;T, Comcast, etc) because the cost of bandwidth coupled with maintance costs when you have the equipment above capasaty (I know I spelled that wrong but I'm in a hurry).  Verant has been doing a pretty good job of upgrading its equipment, all things concidered.  I'm willing to bet the price increase is just to cover bandwidth costs, plus make up for the fact that they've been undercharging for a while.<br />

What do you think is the best way to cancel that account?  I have four accounts on my credit card bill and I'm not sure which is which.  I think the easiest way is just to log into the three that I have and change them to another credit card. Then, when I get my bill for the next month, call Verant and cancel the one that is left.<br />
<br />
If you can live without this credit card for a little while, I have another possible solution.  Contact your credit card company and tell them that you lost your card.  They should cancel your account, and assign you a new one.  I had this happen several years ago when I lost my wallet.<br />
<br />
Now, when your EQ subscriptions run out, Verant won't be able to bill the cancelled credit card, and you'll be prompted to update the billing information on your three remaining accounts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I think its amazing that resonably intelligent people believe that Verant out of the goodness of their heart hasnt increased the price in 3 years. I bet that if they at any time saw their profits drop they would have increased the price.<br />
<br />
They have probably been making TONS of money from EQ with the old rates but since they see that DAoC is more expensive and still has customers and that their own Legends server is also doing quite well at a much higher price they feel resonably sure that people wont leave even if they raise the price. It also makes it easier for them to charge an even higher price when Starwars/EQ2 is released since most people will be saying &quot;Ahh, its only 10 dollars more than the old EQ&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I think Verant is doing this and trying to get as many Long term 1 or 2 year sign ups as possible and get as much money up front as they can, since they know that lots of people will leave EQ when the new MMORPGs (including star wars) come out.  So they want to milk money out of the EQ players while they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Valsorath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well you got one of two things.<br />
<br />
1. They are adjusting for inflation.  over the years they have never made a rate hike?!?! It was bound to happen.  Your $10/bucks a month that you started with is now only worth like $7.50.  You have to adjust at some point.<br />
<br />
2. this is the first of many rate hikes left to come.  Every sucessful business will adjuste their prices based on what the market will bare.  It simple economics.  You have enuff capital equipment lets see how we can get more revenues from the existing investment.  <br />
<br />
I used to work for a internet personals firm.  when i started they charged (guess what?) $10/bucks a month.  When i left they charged $35/month.  And people would Gladly hand over their cc #'s.  Did we lose a few b/c of the hikes? Yes...but there were more loosers where that came from and if you looked at the math we made MUCH more money off the $35 dollar peeps that the other ones.  Every revenu model has a sweet spot and they could just be begining to explore and find it.  If this is the case..then yeah i would be pissed and concider &quot;protesting&quot;, but if it is an adjustment...well then more power to em.<br />

we shall see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Anien Altrades</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I for one did cancel my account.  I don't play any of the other games that are 12.95, because they are 12.95.  Thanks to the current economic climate, rather than be laid off, I was forced to take a substantial cut in pay.  $3 is a VERY big thing to me these days.  You'd be surprised with the amount of groceries that buys.  That being said, I think you should all cancel your subscriptions.  Why?  Because you can go buy the silly Game Cards for the old rate, and they have to honor them.  That's what I'm gonna do.  Those of you not doing the 12 mos or 24 mos subscription, I would encourage you to do the same.  I'm not a harcore gamer, but I think this forum is usually very friendly to newcomers and low level peeps alike.  If you have the money, feel free to pay it.  I think it's a reasonable increase, but not reasonable for me until they reinstate my pay.<br />

Berserker clearly stated he's not advocating that you CANCEL your account permanently.  Again, as clearly stated in his message, he's NOT advocating that you QUIT the game over the price increase.<br />
<br />
He is simply suggesting a way that you can communicate your dissatisfaction to VI.  Once the subscription period that you have paid for runs out, he suggests you re-enter your credit card number.<br />
<br />
<br />
Posts that say &quot;I'm not upset by the price increase, I still think it is a good deal&quot; are responsive to Berserker.  Posts that say &quot;You'd have to be crazy to cancel your account over $3&quot; are not.<br />
<br />
Sheesh.<br />

I think Verant is doing this and trying to get as many Long term 1 or 2 year sign ups as possible and get as much money up front as they can, since they know that lots of people will leave EQ when the new MMORPGs (including star wars) come out.  So they want to milk money out of the EQ players while they can. <br />

That is an excellent take on the situation - I didn't want to comment on this thread again, but I wanted to give a /nod in agreement to your theory. <br />
<br />
Try to sucker customers into a 2 year subscription, and when they drop EQ for SWG in 10 months, they still have to keep paying for a game they no longer play.<br />
<br />
Pretty crafty idea actually.......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Ummm...Just a quick note.<br />
<br />
This isn't such a small deal to all people.  I live in Canada...That means I already WAS paying $13 a month...Now I'm paying $17.  That's $204 a year!  That's not as cheap as it's made out to be.  I personally am making roughly $45k a year, right now.  I pay for University fees, I live with friends, so pay hydro, telephone bills, food, and other living expenses.  That extra $204 a year is a LOT to me.  I barely got by before, the added $60 a year isn't gonna kill me, but it's still a lot.<br />
<br />
Put it this way...Think of how much money you make per hour.  Think how many hours/minutes you have to work to play 1 month of EverQuest.  Think of this the whole time you're working...And how much effort you put in to this compared to enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Do the same, but replace EQ with say...Rounds on a golf course, or the cable bill for tv, or the internet connection that allows you to work at home, instead of those late night's at the office.<br />
<br />
Now, imagine you're me.  I BARELY squeek by my living expenses, and just barely manage to pay for EQ.  If VI raised the price to $15 american, something in my life would have to go...Guess which is the first thing to get chucked?<br />
<br />
This is a smal increase..BUT, if Verant ever raises it again, in the near future, I can see a big fuss.<br />
<br />
For now, just add another reason to your list of why you wanna boycott Verant.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">man, fisrt off... F Canada ;)<br />
<br />
secondly, you should give up University and keep the EQ!!!!!!<br />
<br />
nice view Oogg.  I can speculate that's the case.</div></div><hr />
