Yes there should be posts made to the devs about changes we want but until the negative energy surrounding this board stops nothing is going to happen soon.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is more to this post than you know my friend. Its so true in many ways. Its like my guild boards that a unhappy member will post daily and links from how things are broken and X game is going to destroy EQ. Sheep feed off that crap and actully start believing it. <br />
In the shaman community there is problems and I am disappointed that its taking the developers so long to admit 1. They screwed up horendously and are working to fix 2. Quit releasing broken content with broken fixes to broken classes.<br />

<br />
You have a couple of interesting points but I feel the need to disagree with your key argument... I don't think that people quit playing EQ because they read these boards. <br />
<br />
Yes, there is negativity here, because there isn't a great deal to be positive about, but it's warranted for some.<br />
<br />
Consider that there is really little new information to be found in EQ outside GoD. Time equipped Shaman have been doing the same old, same old, for quite some time. Repetition breeds apathy. Adding hp, or mana, isn't as exciting when you are already nicely geared, and while some challenges remain it becomes more of a &quot;what mob can I kill with a couple of people that used to take 40?&quot; type challenge, as opposed to &quot;How the heck to we take this mob on at all?&quot; one.<br />
<br />
I think people are quitting because they have just come to the end of the game for themselves. Not everyone quitting is quitting over GoD. Perhaps they have just had enough, and the incentive is not the same.<br />
<br />
It's also the beginning of Summer and many people put EQ on the backburner.<br />
<br />
While I think the collective wisdom on these boards may be a factor in people choosing to quit, I think it is a minor factor and would assume the real reasons lie within their own guilds, or circles of friends.<br />
<br />
Challenging the old content leads to other guilds getting annoyed. If a few friends get together and 2 group Vindi, or AoW, and another guild comes along with a raid force for it it could lead to bad feelings. It's the new content causing the issues, not the negativity here. The problem is that this is the main outlet for the current feelings.<br />
<br />
It's great that you are still having a blast in EQ. Don't let the doom and gloom get you down.... try and ignore it, that way when it hits you you can enjoy it in all its glory. :)</div></div><hr />

Mangler Moreau, you are not the only one that wants a bit less whining.<br />

Some are even affraid to step forward because of rep-bumpers. <br />

Bah, forums are for voicing your opinon.. Shaman got shafted plain and simple!  Its not myth, its not rumor.. If everything was peachy then youd see lots of posts on how nice and comfy thing were..I cant get a group on GoD..And the only reason Im pissed about it is due to the fact that I paid for it!!  I paid for damn thing and cant play it as a shaman...If sony has posted ahead of time that GoD was going to be an non shaman friendly zone I wouldnt have wasted the money..Thats why Im pissed...Any probably why some othes are pissed..</div></div><hr />

Very funny.  This is the funniest thing posted all week.<br />
<br />
Right, its ok to voice your concerns about the topics that people are posting, but its not allright to post your concerns about where the shaman class or the game as a whole is headed.  Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
thank you, I did not know that i was just a sheep following the leaders when i decided to quit.<br />
The fact that the game has been all about sitting before unfinished content for weeks had nothing to do with it, the fact that my class is a shadow of it's former self had nothing to do with it and the fact that SoE never even talks to us had also nothing to do with it.<br />
No i am just following Thott on the way out (I asume you know he made a new graph about the amount of players leaving and how much better it will now be in EQ)<br />
<br />
 If you are unhappy with the GoD expansion or Ldon or any of the other expansions find something else to do.  Just because the 'in' crowd is doing GoD or Ldon does not mean you must do it also.  <br />
<br />
<br />
i did find something else to do it is another game<br />
<br />
 Yes there should be posts made to the devs about changes we want but until the negative energy surrounding this board stops nothing is going to happen soon. <br />
<br />
I believe that the message that currently is send to SoE is the only one they understand. And that message is that a lot of accounts are cancelled atm. THAT is what SoE understands and THAT is what will force changes to be made. <br />
it is a fact that no matter how nice you present a topic NOTHING will be done untill people leave the game for it or until it is presented in a manner that will draw a lot of negative attention</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I do have to agree in some parts to what the original poster has said.  But then again, right now I'm more apt to taking the less physical anger and more reasonable route.  I don't like to see every post whining more than anyone else (hence my thread on it a while back).  If you look at the EQlive shaman section too, there are mostly posts the same type of posts there.</div></div><hr />

Im sorry this isnt happy wonderland like you wish it to be and frankly like i wish it to be. But there is REAL issues that are frustrating and being ignored and we are all PAINFULY watching a wonderful and joyful hobby being ruined and dismantled by gross incompetence from SoE.<br />
<br />

<br />
Contrary to what some people think, EQ is NOT real life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Quite frankly, I haven't the foggiest idea what Mangler is talking about.  Oh sure, there are the usual flame wars and mindless troll posts that are made, but hey, that's been going on since I joined.<br />
<br />
What I have seen here is clear-headed, careful analyses of the shaman role in EQ over the years by dozens of level-headed players whose goal was to improve the playability and enjoyability of the game and of our class.<br />
<br />
Read carefully the posts of those of us who have canceled our accounts. You will not see one of them claiming that the whiners on this board have had any influence on their decision whatsoever.  Instead, you will see intellegent, thought provoking commentary on how EQ no longer captures their imagination and spirit of adventure.  The shaman class has been badly handled over the years since Kunark, and rendered useless in the last expansion.  People on this forum have worked tirelessly to document the many design flaws that have emerged in the shaman class.  The solutions to these problems offered thus far in public statements by SoE representatives fall far short of what is needed to save the game for the shaman class.<br />
<br />
I sympathize with your concern over negativity, but there's a clear difference between whining and constructive criticisms coupled with proposals for improvements.  Since the latter have been unacceptably addressed by SoE representatives, it is no surprise that many of those shamans who have played the game for years have lost interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have to agree with the original poster, and I dont think its so much an argument that the concerns are not warranted.  Its just sort of a...we've stated our complaints, we've thrown a fit, and we are where we are.  Once upon a time I used to log into this board and hurry to read the next imformative post, and even enjoy the occasional rant.  Now that ratio has reversed a tad, and I know why we're angry, and I agree with alot of the points, but I still play this game.  I'd like to be able to read some of the &quot;old&quot; crucible again.<br />
<br />
Flame the hell out of me, I just miss the way things used to be, and about near as I can tell an expansion I dont group in much came out and ruined my board.  If your still playing enjoy the game for what it is, and if your not why are you posting on an eq message board.  Free country people are allowed to do and say more or less what they want and likewise this is my 2 cp....we've all heard the same arguments over and over, and the devs arent going to give us everything we want, just accept it and quit or play the game flawed as it is, maybe bring up a new point or argument once and awhile.  I wish you all well flame away.<br />
<br />
I do respect even those that complain so much about shaman being broken, just I disagree on the need to explain it so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree to a certain degree that negativity feeds negativity, but there is considerable justification here. I have tried to remain positive, to offer solutions to the problems, not just whine about them. I have defended EQ in a lot of ways here, too.<br />
<br />
However, that being said, I think that SOE is trying to stick their fingers in the holes, and cannot see that the whole dike is crumbling around them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My gear or what zones I play in does not matter.  I enjoy the zones I go to.  I enjoy the style of my play.  There are problems with our class as I have said but I enjoy being a shaman.  If you do not enjoy being a shaman raiding elemental planes or time zones maybe its you that needs to look at what you are doing and change that.  If you are unhappy raiding time or the planes because you feel underpowered why do you continue going making yourself unhappy over and over?  Is it because of the sense of power you feel for your character when you happen to roll for or use raids points to get that uber item you want?  Does your guild force you to go on these raids you hate attending?  If  you no longer enjoy what you are doing change the way you do it or wait for that patch you are hoping for weeks, months, years in advance and continue to be unhappy until then.  As for my gear I am a solo player but now that I have hit 65 and joined a small guild that is in the growing process,  I am just now starting to do Ldon raids.  Yep I have had the expansion all this time and just now started doing them.  15 adventures so far.  I am also hopping to get PoP flagged but I am guessing that will be difficult as most people are already flagged.  This was the choice I made and I will live by it.  Also I created this character in October of 2000 and I just now hit 65 a few days ago.  You will notice that I have 70 aa points though all from solo play.  Why?  Because I enjoyed getting AA points instead of levels.  I don't play according to the 'in' crowd.  I play how it makes me happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what would you do, Mangler, if suddenly, this style of play that has made you moderately happy for quite a while was COMPLETELY swept out from under your feet?<br />
<br />
Super high end Shaman dont want to be excellent healers, soloers, debuffers and DPS outputters in TRIVIAL content man. They want to compete where they are MEANT to compete. Being able to solo an LDoN normal run doesnt = fun for everyone. <br />
<br />
I am relatively happy on my character, honestly. But the couple gates trials I have done have shown me how it REALLY feels to be worthless. And any shaman who has been on a raid with 4 or more other shamans knows some of that feeling too. <br />
<br />
People understand, and even appriciate where you are coming from. To be honest, I thnk some are even JEALOUS of the obvious enjoyment you are getting from your character, since theirs isnt &quot;fun&quot; anymore. So now what? They should abandon the character they have spent YEARS building? They should stick to stuff more &quot;their speed&quot;, like soloing Tables for AAs? I am not sure what you expect these shamans who are bitching and moaning about the relative unplayability of the class in this most recent expansion to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Even tho I have hammered some whiners on the board in the past, it is a necessary evil that all of the negative comments are heard.  At least the Crucible gives Shaman a chance to voice their opinions (no matter how repetitive they are).  There is nothing wrong with unloading your frustrations into a community of people who understand and sympathize with most of them.  That is why Shaman have a tight knit community, and that is what we are all here for.<br />
<br />
It does get old, but at least everyone is aware of why alot of our best Shaman in EQ are leaving the game now.  I am not leaving the game, but I can understand why others are and the complaints that they have.  Everyone has the option to not read the threads on complaints...excercise that right if you are fed up with it.<br />

<br />
What I got from  Mangler's post was that when you look at the main page of the forum there are a number of posts about the same issues, and people are reiteratingthe same points in new posts, thus giving an air of negativity about the place. None of us ragtag shaman doubt for a minuite that the top end is broken, but it does make for depressing reading. He's just suggesting that people should try changing their goals and finding something enjoyable to try, rather than getting so fed up that they quit.<br />
<br />
I get disheartend when I read that respected people from the boards are leaving because they feel that strongly.<br />
<br />
I know that every once in a while someone says that the boards are full of people moaning, and that its not as good as it used to be, but for the first time I actually think that this is true. I think it's the spate of goodbye messages that make me feel this. <br />
<br />
btw I'm not saying that people who post goodbye messages are moaning or that they shouldn't do it.<br />
<br />
I do think that at the moment the crucible is an unhappy house.  :(</div></div><hr />

Well this is raid-dependant, really. In Fire, for example, its usually just &quot;Bird Bird, bring in twinks to loot sleeves (/snicker), then Named, Named, Named, move to castle 2, clear a couple roamers and trash mobs, then Named, Named. Very little for Shamans 3-5 to do. The debuff channel is fun to watch, 3 Malos calls, followed by 5 Slow calls, heh. <br />
<br />
Of course, in Air, its the complete opposite. There is so much trash to clear before you start getting to the named that EVERYONE has a job. For myself, recently, I have taken up an idea I saw here, and I pick an off-tank, and fully debuff his mob. Seeing how it works then going to offer that suggestion to the other de-buffers. <br />
<br />
In LDoN hard, I contribute. Period. Slow, Bane, Quies and heals are solid in there, no matter what anyone says. I may not be an effective main-healer in those yet, but I am damn sure a good choice for 2nd-healer/main debuffer.</div></div><hr />

I propose that you start up your own messageboard, call it &quot;My Playhouse&quot; - then you can post to yourself about all the great times you're having, and how happy you are with EQ.<br />
<br />
Posting a negative post complaining about how negative and whiny everyone's gotten really IS high comedy.  Telling people to stop posting their opinions on an open messageboard is almost (but not quite) as ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I played for 65 levels and thoroughly enjoyed it (cept for that bit of pain getting malo and torpor way back when).  Don't presume to tell me I don't know how to play the game in an enjoyable way.  Don't for a minute assume that you know some unfathomable &quot;secret&quot; about how to play a shaman on EQ that I didn't stumble onto.  Feel free to stay on your high horse - some of us will just stand here snickering at how proudly you sit atop your one-trick pony.<br />
<br />
I didn't suddenly forget how to enjoy my shaman.  Sony took what I loved about my class, and crippled it.  The game changed, and my class was pushed to the margins.  If I wanted to be useful from the sidelines, I wouldn't have stuck with the shaman for that long.</div></div><hr />

Very funny.  This is the funniest thing posted all week.<br />

Right, its ok to voice your concerns about the topics that people are posting, but its not allright to post your concerns about where the shaman class or the game as a whole is headed.  Ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Hey Ronax, you know what is funnier.  <br />
Is rep-bumps have nothing with whether it is &quot;not alright to post your concerns about where the shaman class or the game as a whole is headed.&quot;<br />

They are totally two different subjects.</div></div><hr />

I am glad the pissed are quitting.  They should have done so long ago.  There is no point playing a game that they don't enjoy.  The funny thing is they keep comming back to the eq boards to bitch and gloat how good WoW looks.  Oh well, who gives a ****.  Ignore the negativity my friend.  It will go away when WoW goes live.

<br />
They are totally two different subjects.<br />
And yet you made the connection with your &quot;Who cares about rep-bumps just voice your concerns thats what the board is for.&quot; statement (which oddly enough had nothing to do with what Ronax said) by putting the two ideas in the same sentence.<br />
<br />
Ronax simply commented on the irony of someone telling the shaman community how sick they were of certain posts, basically how they were whining about whiners.  His choice of quotes was questionable, but it's basically quoting the same crap from a different poster.<br />
<br />
Posting about negativity in the current environment is about as useless as commenting on the shaman class being a powerhouse (a point you have yet to prove).  At least the masses of departing shaman are sending a wake up call to SoE.  There's a reason why you're only seeing the request for input threads now on the SoE boards.  If people were not quitting they'd assume nothing was wrong.<br />
<br />
You might try in the future bumping the &quot;positive&quot; thread, at least thats got some links to some great pics.</div></div><hr />

It seems to me most class boards are innundated with posts proclaiming their class to be the &quot;most broken&quot;, or that they had &quot;lost identity&quot;. I can't speak for the end game, as I have never gotten there, but I do know that this is supposed to be fun, and it is a shame if SoE has ruined the fun for so many of you. The negativity is everywhere though, not just here. It seems as though many of the more serious players are up and quitting, but the casual folks like me are definitely sticking around. I truly hope SoE takes all your complaints seriously, and mine too should I have some someday. Well, I guess that's my ramble for now, thank you for taking time to read this, and I hope you all will find a way to have more fun!</div></div><hr />

I didn't care much for the immature rants, but it's true, even children are entitled to free speech. I art holier than tho because I &quot;experienced recent upper level shamans concerns about PoTime or GoD zones.&quot; Just a fancy way of saying my d* is bigger than yours, but you should know the whining started long before Time or GoD was an issue.<br />
<br />
Face it, this game has had a good run, and the inevitable is coming. Balancing 14 classes was hard enough to start off with. For every class, you'd have to check it against 13 others, and the variables for each class are astronomical this far down the road (not to mention there are 2 extra classes now).</div></div><hr />

What ticks me off is the other 99% of the whiners on this board that will complain about everything.  I just don't get complaining about increasing the level cap or maybe focus affect levels or things like that.  What would you rather have - a static game??  Sure, old content becomes more trivial and current hard content might even become doable by the non-uber crowd - so what?  When I was lvl 8, Crushbone was hard.  Is it hard now?  No.  Is that bad?  I personally don't think so.<br />
<br />
Sure, a new expansion comes out and, if you want to stay with the uber crowd, your gear needs serious upgrades...what would you do differently?  A new expansion comes out but it doesn't have anything anyone could use that's better/more beneficial then what they already have?  I'm sure a lot of people would love that expansion... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because your statements were invalid since you could not base whether a shaman was a powerhouse or not with your lack of experience in upper game (your LDON and Teir 3 experiences are just not the concern.)<br />
<br />
That and coupled with the fact you quit over four months ago.<br />
<br />
For example you would have no knowledge or (play experience) as to the fact the named fly in GoD sewers can be soloed by a shaman and by select classes in order to obtain very nice loot and much needed class spells.<br />
<br />
Tarthug, you will have NO play experience as to how much the mitigation changes in the recent patch to come will affect a shaman's play style or usefulness in groups.<br />
<br />
Even if I could beyond a shadow of a doubt prove to &quot;all that play&quot; the game that shamans are quite a powerful class you personally would have no way of testing my theory. <br />
<br />
At least I can agree with you on one thing with your lack of play knowledge:<br />
It is actually quite a bore to argue with some one that whines for no other reason but for the sake of whining. /yawn.</div></div><hr />

LOL! I made it easy on you then (simple, ignore GoD where content is an increased liability) and you still couldn't prove it.<br />
<br />
That and coupled with the fact you quit over four months ago.<br />
<br />
For example you would have no knowledge or (play experience) as to the fact the named fly in GoD sewers can be soloed by a shaman and by select classes in order to obtain very nice loot and much needed class spells.<br />
First off the shaman class has traditionally been a group support class, the diversity required to fill that roll has made us a strong soloing class.  With the reduced effectiveness in comparrison of so many other classes based on content (and no, I don't actually have to experience the content to know a low hp mob that quads for 900 and mostly mitigates slow is going to hose us in almost every sense of the word, or that slow immune boss mobs hurt the shaman class as I was slowing on raids in Luclin and velious when they were released).  Other classes also have a variety of skills in which they specialise and will in all likelihood solo the fly with greater ease, less time, or both.  This doesn't make us a powerhouse.  If we could solo more mobs, more effectively than almost any other class, then you might be on to something.  Taking one mob example doesn't prove too much.  Besides, I heard they made a change to this encounter so that you had to kill X number of mobs before this fly popped.  While it still may be doable, you might want to revise how frequently a shaman can do it and if it's worth their while.<br />
<br />
Tarthug, you will have NO play experience as to how much the mitigation changes in the recent patch to come will affect a shaman's play style or usefulness in groups.<br />
neither will you.  This patch isn't out and when it is, I'll learn about it on the boards and learn what the vocal community thinks not too long after you do.  I had played a shaman since June 99 and I've only been gone 4 months, I still have a pretty good idea how we work.<br />
<br />
Even if I could beyond a shadow of a doubt prove to &quot;all that play&quot; the game that shamans are quite a powerful class you personally would have no way of testing my theory. <br />
Well, assuming you posted effective logs or parse results (something that has never been done by those supporting the point of view you share with a few others) I would imagine it would make quantitative sense.  That's something I should be able to verify without actually playing.  There are examples, by asking questions here and asking a few shaman I know who still play, I should be able to develop a consensus and compare experiences, that and 5 years of experience should be able to get a close picture.  The thing is you haven't tried or even offer to prove anything.  I've offered links, quotes and arguments (all in the other thread) that you were either unwilling or more likely unable to either understand or counter.<br />
<br />
At least I can agree with you on one thing with your lack of play knowledge:<br />
It is actually quite a bore to argue with some one that whines for no other reason but for the sake of whining. /yawn.<br />
I could play the &quot;I know you are, but what am I game?&quot; till my fingers fall off, but so far, you've done nothing to substantiate your point of view other than to tell me my opinion doesn't count.  Now you whine about whiners (a label you give me despite the fact I've proven my moderate stance, not a label I, or others, would give me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I'm inclined to agree with this post.<br />
<br />
I used to come to work, get my cup of tea or cocoa, check my email for &quot;emergencies&quot; and then read the Shaman's Crucible to wake up.  I'd then come back to it over lunch, or any other time I felt justified in taking a break.  The board was enjoyable to read.  The energy was positive.  The overall message was go out there, find something fun or interesting, and come back and tell us about it.  <br />
<br />
Now I'll sometimes go weeks without reading the board.  It's no longer fun, just post after post of micro focusing on what's wrong.  And the overall tone is cranky.  Even posts that start out positive tend to break down into sniping somewhere along the way.  A good example of this is the City of Heroes breath of fresh air post.  <br />
<br />
As the initial poster stated, YES, we agree that there is much that is wrong.  But is there some way to combat it without allowing it to ruin the game and this message board?  <br />
<br />
I miss those illustrated adventure stories from Nixx.  On the one hand, I Can't say that I've written any fun to read threads in a while.  But hasn't anyone done anything that was fun?  Funny?  Enjoyable?  New?  Exciting?  Tell us about it!<br />
<br />
I can appreciate that there is much about the game that could be better, but does the general folder of the message board have to be dominated by the anger and frustration?  Can we create a separate section for &quot;Class Improvements Discussion&quot;?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The reason for the &quot;negativity&quot; is simple. You will not get SOE to acknowledge that there is a problem without making a big stink over weeeks and month. And many of us elder shamans just blew a gasket after GoD multiplied the problems us shamans were having for 2-3 expansions.<br />
<br />
Do I still care? Not really. I log on once or twice a week to raid with my guild. I don t care about GoD, new AA, more levels or gear. Within the next few month I will see Time and after that I ll probably retire for good. <br />
<br />
I sure hope that our month-long complaints will lead to improvement of the shaman class so that all of you whiners whining about our efforts will have a better game to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Shortly after PoP's release, my old guild went belly-up, and I was doing friend-groups and pickup-groups in PoStorms, Justice, eventually BoT - that kind of crap.  I was a shaman in the zones where shamans are still on top of the game.<br />
<br />
I would come to the Crucible, and read the posts from shamans in zones where slow was mitigated to uselessness.  Where their &quot;primary ability&quot; was easily supplied by one of three other classes - with no loss in effectiveness.  And I thought &quot;Man, it sure sucks to be them.&quot;  I didn't have a lot of empathy, because i wasn't there.<br />
<br />
The sad thing here, Dirtnap, is that people like you sneer from the sidelines when we all know that eventually, most of you will get to this same point in content, and one of two things will happen.  You'll either realize &quot;hey, this really sucks, why doesn't anybody do anything about it?&quot;  or it'll be fixed by then, because all of these &quot;whiners&quot; made enough noise to draw attention to the problems.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the recent patch message.  Looks like SoE is asking players to send in their feedback - er, &quot;whining&quot;, because they want to hear it.  Funny, huh?  Luckily, I'm not personally effected by your comments.  I'm coming here to gloat about how good *CoH* looks (and plays, more importantly).  /laugh<br />
<br />
Don't worry.  I expect you'll get your wish soon enough, and increasing numbers of people will vacate the game, and these boards, eventually.  It just take a while to complete the weaning process...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Grillk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Hello all! I think a big part of what is making people so unhappy is that the end game seems to have taken almost all the fun out of the game. I am not &quot;teh ubor&quot; nor will I ever be. I doubt I will ever see the end game truthfully. It seems like there is entirely too much number crunching going on for it be truly fun. I work in finance, so I stare at numbers all day long, so really the last thing I want to worry about when I get home is &quot;parsing my DPS&quot;. Have fun again people! If raiding sucks and you feel worthless, do something else! Take your best friends and go destroy some old world content. There are few thigns as satisfying as owning mobs that used to terrify you! Do something nice for a random noob, I know theyr'e hard to find but even small things can be gratifying! I found a true noob the other night and gave him a Gladius. it was his first magic weapon and he was happier than you would believe. Try to remember, games are supposed to be fun!
