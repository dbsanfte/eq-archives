<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been a long time.  Three maybe four years.  I never imagined I would play a single game that long.  But, all things must come to an end.  <br />
<br />
I havent even been playing the last 6 months or so, but I still logged in from time to time, trying to get into playing again but I just cant.  I knew it was over when my beloved guild, Evolution Dawns disbanded.  I tried to stick in there and keep playing but it just isn't fun anymore.<br />
<br />
So, im hanging up my black furs, and puttin the Spear of Fate in the closet.  I doubt my x guildies will see this but I would like to take this time to say goodbye to some of the best people I have never met :)<br />
<br />
Althea, Remoe, Ubiyen, Razha, Selestial, Klaxxus, Ognar, Jhoric, Brody, Saydo, and so many many more, I will miss you all.  I wish all of you a happy life, fat lewt and big xp.<br />
<br />
To my Shaman brethern I wish you all the same.  Keep on a cannin, and be safe.<br />

Retired............</div></div><hr />

<br />
take care mate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh god here we go .. monkey see monkey do eh ?<br />
<br />
see ya next week</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take care Thunndar - we'll miss you on Xegony. <br />
<br />
Krup<br />
<br />
/wonders why Litgruv is such a social zit sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This thread sums up the state of this board pretty well.  Nice guy, regular contributor for 3+ years retires.  Gets a two-sentence flame from a moronic spammer who has almost single-handedly turned this board into crap. <br />
<br />
I would have thought that even Litgruv would not be so much of an anus as to spew his usual crap in a retirement thread started by someone who has been here 4x as long as his reign of idiocy.  Sadly, I was wrong, and we have reached yet another new low, sponsored yet again by Litbrew.<br />
<br />
/salute Thunndar.  Good luck in your new adventures in real life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Take care man. Wont be long I think and we'll start seeing alot more posts like this one will prolly be mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Litgruv is total dog****, agreed.<br />
<br />
Take it easy, you sound like a great guy, and your server is worse off for not having you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I’ve not been posting on this board for long, but I’ve been in game for about a year and a half and I played UO for a year and a half before EQ.  And my beloved guild, the Moonshadows, also recently disbanded. So I can sympathize with how you’re feeling.  If it is truly time for you to move on, I wish you the best.  Remember the time you spent in Norrath fondly and take some time to reacquaint yourself with the real world.  But just in case it’s just a break you need, I’d recommend not giving away your gear or deleting your character.  I’ve seen others do this and six months later find they miss EQ too much to stay away and have to start all over again.  <br />
<br />
But whatever your decision, take care and enjoy yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Take care sir~<br />
<br />
Make sure not to do anything rash with your account, you never know when the urge will bring you back.  Or maybe do something rash because of that =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's called turnover or, even more specifically, churn.  Whether it's a game that continues for 4+ years or a workforce or whatever you just expect some people to tire and leave.  Nothing bad about it, people just outgrow some hobbies.   As the game gets older the churn rate increases so you'll see more and more old timers hanging up thier boots.  From a business point of view, as long as more customers are signing up than leaving (churn rate) all is good.<br />
<br />
Gah, I have to go back to work tomorrow &amp; put on my scheduling / volumns hat &amp; deal with churn rate, training classes and similar things, don't make me think about work this late :P<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever hobbies catches your eye next, enjoy the big blue room and that bright thing in the sky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thunndar, thanks for everything you've done for this board, and I wish you the best in real life. /salute<br />
<br />
Litgruv, you're a real bastard. Go away.</div></div><hr />

#2 im just sick of this &quot;movement&quot; where everoyne is sick of EQ and the things that the mean evil SoE machine does , so we must all quit and move on.<br />
<br />
Perhaps its mistdirected. I dont know you and im sure you are a great person that will be missed by many. It wasnt meant to be a personal comment.<br />
<br />
Guess im a lil jadded on this stuff , ive seen it for year and year in many games were everyone hopes on a bandwagon and rides off in the sunset.<br />
<br />
<br />
So take this as my appoligy to you personaly Thunndar . You didnt deserve that i guess.  Good luck to you .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Retiring after four years has got to be extremely hard and in a certain way, emotional. I know Evel has grown to be a real part of me in the last four years and Im not sure if Ill ever be able to stop playing this game entirely...till they pull the plug at least.<br />
<br />
There are memories I have in this game that are as meaningful to me as if they had happened in real life....friends that Ive never seen face to face, but are as dear to me as real life friends.<br />
<br />
I understand where these posts come from....for people who really grew their character, as I said before, its a fairly emotional thing.<br />
<br />
Good Luck to you my friend...<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. of topic to Gorre...I -love- your title man....being an Irish troll, Guinness represents about 25% of my blood stream 75% of the time :)</div></div><hr />
