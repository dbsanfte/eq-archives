<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently my AC unbuffed is 1004 unbuffed and my hps are 2092.  My magelo is mostly up to date except that I downgraded to a Goranga Idol from the Sharp Claws due to cash needs and a good cash offer.  That being said, I'm trying to decide how I want to evolve as a charecter.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have the chance to effectively bump up my ac 13 raw as I own a Lodi and raise my base resists to around 90 each for the big 3, but losing 75 hp in the process.<br />
<br />
Not sure if my magelo is listed so I'll just go across the board (ignorning non hp/ac altering stats) and leave out what I don't think I&quot;m going to upgrade (vindi bp, solstice ear, etc..)<br />
<br />
Barbed Rubicite Helm : 16ac 65hp 6agi (didn't think I'd buy anything better on either so this seems a non-issue)<br />
<br />
Heavy Dragon Mask:  12ac 5fr <br />
<br />
Ivandry's Hoop: 6ac 6wis 6hp (this was something I was betting people would say switch out for something)<br />
<br />
Tracking Wolf Collar: 10ac  40hp/mana 2% to dodge<br />
<br />
CC Gaunts:20ac<br />
<br />
JBB: 14ac (I don't use this as much as I used to, even soloing unless I'm tanking things in UP)<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield: 25ac 40 hp 5sta<br />
<br />
Hiero Cloak:10ac 75/75 4 to all<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been told drop the CC for some HP gauntlets and I'm pretty sure I'm going to phase out the Ivandry's for the 4ac 35/35 earring and I'm looking at playing with around 25k in cash and a Lodi and 2 tinks I can sell if need be.<br />
<br />
Any input?  I don't want to blow my whole bank on a 5hp upgrade, but I dont' midn dropping it if someone has good ideas.</div></div><hr />

I'm a gimp and forgot to put that on, you may shoot me later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo the &quot;planarian larvae&quot; for my solo XP now, and tried it with AC gear.  My normal AC with my mana/wis/hp gear is around 950.  When I go &quot;shell shaman&quot; with all my AC gear and buffs, I am up around 1150.<br />
<br />
I don't notice a difference in the damage I take between the two.  I do, however, like having the extra 600HP from my hp/wis/mana gear.<br />
<br />
So just this fatbear's opinion, AC is negligible for us at high end.<br />
<br />
If someone could point me to a parser, I will log a few fights and post the results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hitpoints always will be king.  <br />
<br />
Most mobs you run into are going to be geared towards whooping on tanks who have far more AC than we will ever get.  Hopefully it will be the tanks on the sharp end and not you.  PoS giants don't care if you have 800AC or 1800AC because they are still going to kill you solo.  At least more hp gives you a buffer and time to recieve a heal, land a slow, or gate.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that hitpoints don't get debuffed like AC/resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys, on the advice I recieved plus some from Sebazy of U.K. on BBane, I retooled my gear.  Upped my HP by about 120 and I still have 2 slots left to finish (ear and arms) and I'm just too cheap and saving for malo to pay it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your input. This actually is because we're doing NToV regularly and I was noticing hits for full since I'm in the slowing rotation once malo is in now and I was pureed almost every time I got aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quest for the Coldain Military Wristguard if you can.  The EA3 is nice when you solo, and it is still pretty nice when you are slowing adds, as the slow lasts longer (speaking from a chanter perspective there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In xp groups I don't worry about slow duration Eriadoc.  Usually by the time slow is worn, I'm either dead, or going to be.  Only time I can think of slow wearing is when I'm with a chanter and they are mezzing and even then I'll get the message.<br />
<br />
I'd consider it primarily a soloing tool as I RARELY have even bane go to duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just looked at the slow durations for Turgur's vs. Shiftless (not a peer-to-peer comparison, but at 55, that is the slow I use with chanter), and the duration is roughly double for Turgur's.  So yeah, I can see how you wouldn't be worried about it LOL.  Thanks for the reply though ... made me look it up.  I am only 42 now, but I will need to know that stuff very soon   =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dunno man, i got 6600 hp 1450ac buffed and i STILL get tossed around like a red headed step child. Like i always have.<br />
<br />
Although whats beating down on me is a 800 quading red to 65 asskicker. The better gear you get the more nasty the mobs are it seems. Everyone keeps telling me combat agility and lightning reflexes is the way to go, but i dunno i still have so many AAs i need to work on that i wont be finishing LR for some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I find the EA3 on the Coldain Wristguard to be useful when root parking adds. YMMV of course - I haven't been to many PoP zones, but I did find stuff in POI harder to root park than normal.</div></div><hr />
