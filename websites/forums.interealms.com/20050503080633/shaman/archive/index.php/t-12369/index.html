<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MoonDoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I apologise if this has been covered before, but recently it seems to be happening more often.  Maybe it's just more noticable because I now fight summoning mobs much more frequently.<br />
<br />
Basically what happens is;<br />
<br />
1) Mob pulled, tank has engaged<br />
<br />
2) You begin to cast Turgur's<br />
<br />
3) You somehow get aggro and are summoned before the spell lands<br />
<br />
4) The mob is unslowed.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it's some sort of timing issue between the client and server, and that the mob is somehow reacting to my attack.  Either that or the mobs are much smarter than I thought and realise how dangerous we shaman are!<br />
<br />
Either way, it's annoying!<br />
<br />
I've even had mobs turn from the tank and attack me as soon as I begin to cast Turgur's, thereby interrupting my casting.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this, or can cast any light on it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds odd, whats your HP when this is happening, are you canning too low and getting low HP aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Place, mob, your hp at that time (full or low), were you standing in front of tank?<br />
There ARE some mob like to target priest class first and or class that can slow (shm espically) without ANY reason.<br />
<br />
Its odd but I can fairly say u wont see it happen again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Odd -- I've not experienced this, even in PoP and the new lands of LoY.  Even with Reds, the following steps make agro minimal:<br />
<br />
Paladin pulls, as mob is coming in, cast slow (or malosi then slow if mob red).  Paladin gets to camp, turns and stuns.  I send in pet, and cripple or re-slow if resisted.  Epic, JBB, etc.  The only time I get agro is when I double dot, or get sloppy with the nukes.<br />
<br />
When I don't have a paladin in group, I tend to lay off cripple, and if the dmg is slow I will double dot mid-way through the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MoonDoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Regarding HP, no - I was at least 90%, and had not cannied down, either at the time, or immediately before.<br />
<br />
I noticed the 'early summoning' particularly in the 'earth' area of BoT, but have had 'early aggro' in 'Back Cave' in PoV.<br />
<br />
I have usually been behind the tank, or at least to one side.<br />
<br />
Our druid puller in BoT said that she had also seen mobs react to her nukes before they landed.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if it was a timing issue;<br />
<br />
1) I cast slow<br />
<br />
2) Slow is resisted and mob summons me<br />
<br />
3) For some reason the resist message is lost in mid-summon and I never see it.<br />
<br />
In which case is not pre-emptive aggro, but just a lost message, possible?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One way to prevent aggro from a resisted slow is to not get resisted!  I target the incoming mob as early as possible and cast Malxxxx as far away as I can.  It is nearly a zero aggro spell.  (Yes, you can get aggro if the mob is pull right over you).  Once Malxxxx has landed, you can 'almost' guarantee slow landed.  I know some people say they never mal in exp groups etc.. etc..  Personally, I'd rather not trust cleric_01 when I can control the situation myself.<br />
<br />
To answer your question directly, once in a while I've seen spell messages appear out of order or very delayed.  It almost acted as if the window wasn't scroll all the way down.  not sure what to tell you though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Couple of guesses:<br />
Dog will generate aggro for you, so I don't send him in until I've already slowed.<br />
Maybe someone (earth pet?) is rooting the critter, then it'll turn to you if you're closer.<br />
<br />
I agree fully with the malo, too.  Unless I'm with a chanter and cleric who know how much I love to slow JUST as the thing lands in camp, I'd best malo or I'm gonna get pasted PDQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The above poster may have hit it on the head.  I've seen cases where the instant I send in my pet, the mob will turn and run at me.  This is from beyond normal aggro range and before I've cast a single spell.  This is very noticeable in LoY as mobs tend to have a small aggro radius more often there than in other zones.  Make sure you send in the pet AFTER the mob is slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MoonDoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the replies all.<br />
<br />
I WAS using a dog in PoV, where I seemed to get aggro early, and my usual exp group sequence is to hit Slow, and then hit Attack whilst Turgur's is still casting.  So it's quite possible that my dog was indeed causing the mob to attack me before slow landed in that situation. Thanks :)<br />
<br />
But I didnt have a dog when I was in BoT, although two necro pets were up.  In hindsight I am usually in a group with either a necro pet, or a charmed pet, whether this has any bearing I dont know. No one was rooting, no need.<br />
<br />
When I summon a dog I always turn taunting off, as I believe that a taunt operates as a ranged attack the instant you tell your dog to attack, and can generate aggro from quite a distance.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a spot where its a decent pulling distance I Malo as soon as I get a target, even if I think the mob might not need Malo. <br />
<br />
If it's closer range, or I think I can slow it, I'll often skip Malo and try to land Slow sooner.<br />
<br />
But if I have any doubts at all, I Malo first.<br />
<br />
I've been 65 for over 2 weeks but have no new spells yet, however a nice chain bracer pattern did drop for me in BoT :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Taunt off IS very important.<br />
<br />
But also, try to get the puller to do more damage when pulling.  Get better arrows, better bow, use a damage-causing spell instead of a damageless debuff, whatever.<br />
<br />
Malo is low aggro but not ZERO aggro, so if the puller plinked a piddly arrow at it and missed, or did 12 points of damage or something, Malo will out-aggro the puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Best thing to do is wait until tank has good aggro. So wait 5-10 secs or wait until mob is 95% before malo/slowing. PoP is all about aggro management. This was something I had to learn early back in Valor when I was 60 and had just grinded there for the first time. I was one of those Shamans who as soon as I saw a target, I'd slow it asap. That doesn't work to well in PoP.<br />
<br />
Usually, what I do now is:<br />
- I stand next to, besides, or behind the tank always to avoid ping pong and so Tank can get aggro back again.<br />
- As soon as tank engages(mob at 99%), I Malos mob. There's not much aggro at all for me. Also, Malos is a 5 sec cast, so this gives time for tank to get aggro.<br />
-By the time I cast slow, mob should be anywhere around 90-95%. Sometimes I do notice mob turns to look at me, but most tanks regain aggro immediatly, so I don't even get hit. Again, I always stand next to main tank so they can regain aggro.<br />
<br />
Just time your slows...make sure you give MT enough time to get aggro. About the early aggro...I think I have come across this a few times...but not enough to say theres a problem. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Great thread, I love focused input.<br />
<br />
Dog can DEFINITELY taunt, given the right situation.  If I've pulled with malo, I've seen the mob pull an about-face the instant I hit pet attack, because dog fired off his taunt and it took.<br />
<br />
However, the only pet I've ever seen take taunt off of a PC is that crazy lvl 61 mage pet.  Should I really leave dog's taunt off in normal exp groups?  I've found that he does a good job getting critters off me for minor aggro, such as from healing or just on proximity adds - so I'd like to leave taunt on so he can tank it till I can get it slowed.  But if I'm actually having a negative impact on the MT's ability to keep attention, I'll start flipping it off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't think I've ever seen dog get aggro from the MT after he's got the monster's full attention.  Not sure if that is because the dog's taunt does not take if a PC has taunted or what, but I that has never happened to me.  <br />
<br />
I usually leave it on when I'm in a group just because of adds, or if I'm pulling.  Most time's I'll pull with Malosini (no malo here) and run back to camp where I stop, turn, sick dog and cast slow all at once.  Dog usually prevents the mob from hitting me if the MT is slow in grabbing aggro.  Same goes for adds, if I see one I'll sick him real quick and attempt a slow right off the bat.  Works well for me and so far no complaints :)</div></div><hr />
