<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had a problem once where it would hang trying to log one character on... others were fine.   I was told to log on one of the characters who COULD get on, and zone.  Then log off and log on the problem-child.  Worked just fine.  Something had gotten 'stuck' in the zoning processes.</div></div><hr />
