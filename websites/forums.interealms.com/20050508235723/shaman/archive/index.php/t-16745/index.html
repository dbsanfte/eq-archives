<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I logged on last night and promptly got a pickup group.  We got a MMC adventure and went to LFay to zone in.  We all got a message stating the dungeon was too dangerous to enter and we couldn't get in - it was like running into an invisible wall.  After trying for some time we went to get a Guk adventure.  Same thing happened.  Took a good bit of time and got nothing accomplished, finally logged off in disgust.<br />
<br />
I play at off hours - 11:30 pm to 1:30 am EST most nights.  We tried petitioning but no GMS or Guides on.<br />
<br />
Has this happened to anyone else?  Anyone know what causes it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">too many instances of the dungeon usually causes this.  The other factor is that the dungeon got bugged somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same thing happened to alot of people on FV last night.  It was the first time I'd heard of it.  GM's started sending out global messages that they were aware of the problem and to keep trying to get in.  Sounds like the zones were borked to me.  <br />
<br />
I only say that because there were relatively few people at the wayfarer camps.  I've seen those camps with so many people it was like moving around in the bazaar on a busy day.  Even so, I never had any problems, or heard of anyone having problems until last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was told by a GM that it happens when &quot;a member of the group has received the exact same adventure twice in a row&quot;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'm not sure exactly how ldon works..but i remember reading about the group has to be within 6 or 7 levels of each other...was someone excessively low or high in the group?  otherwise its probably just some bug like everyone else says~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It won't even give you an adventure if you're group levels are too far out of range. <br />
<br />
When this happens I usually just have everyone in group drop adventure and get a new one. Happened maybe three times since LDoN gone live to me, but I saw it happening to a lot of people last night. <br />
<br />
Leaving the adventure before you go in doesn't count against you. It only goes on your record if one person has zoned in and the adventure counter has started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It wont even give you an adventure if the people in the group are not the appropriate levels, or if you dont have enough people in the group.<br />
<br />
We had the same thing happen to us last week. First time we waited the full 30 minutes trying to get in. Then we were told we had failed, but did not get charged for a failure. We then went to another camp, got a new adventure, and ran into the same thing.<br />
<br />
I petitioned during the time we were sitting there waiting to get into the first adventure. I logged 5 hours later, and still had no response to my petition. Not even from a guide.<br />
<br />
My take on it is that when all the instances of the dungeons are full, you get that message. Because I have only seen and heard of it happening during prime time hours. But you will never get SoE to admit this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have gotten this before and my entire group camped out and came back in and we were able to get in the dungeon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The LDoN server had a very quick downtime period last night, so maybe it was fixing this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This has been happening intermittently since release, and it hit me again last night.  My guess is that they're hitting an instance limit, and don't want to say so, because that's a pretty significant disincentive to sales.  'Buy LDoN!  You can play in it sometimes!'<br />
<br />
It really sucked last night, when I had right around 2 hours exactly to play.  We just kept trying, then about 25 minutes later, got a new adventure and tried again, same thing, so I logged after being on for 45 minutes and having accomplished absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Well, I take that back, I sent /feedback that the &quot;too dangerous&quot; message was awful because it left absolutely no reference as to what the error was or what you were supposed to do about it.  This comes up every day or two on the tech forums, but all the reps have to say are &quot;it's being looked at.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, by now someone can look at the code and figure out what the message means.   &quot;One of your groupmates has corruption in their adventure log,&quot; &quot;there are too many instances of the dungeon loaded,&quot; &quot;you all need to get a new adventure,&quot; SOMETHING.  Even if it's really an error state and they don't know what causes it, someone knows what the error MEANS and isn't spilling the beans, which to me points to a limitation that they don't want to talk about until they raise it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've received the exact same adventure twice in a row before, and had no issues entering the dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We had it happen with all of us getting first adventure of the day so wasnt possible to have same one twice in a row. All other groups at the time couldnt get in either. Thought about trying the camp out and come back but it was everfrost and we all decided didnt really want to go there anyway at that time. So we went to EC and got one there.</div></div><hr />
