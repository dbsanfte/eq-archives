AT THIS TIME...<br />
<br />
AS they add more skills and abilities, they will at some point add some type of regen. I would actually expect it with this next expansion. <br />
This also greatly depends on how much +end they add to items</div></div><hr />

Its only a matter of time until melee start complaining about the advantage casters have in mana regen vs melee and endurance regen. I can already see the posts....And they will get it. When was the last time SOE added caster spells without a $$$ expansion? Yet melees whine for 3 months and boom....they totally rewrite the game mechanics for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but yea, when a group is seeking a mainhealer always druid or cleric, thats a must have position for every group that they have a shot at.  Then there's also the DPS factor, snare factor for some situations, druids don't suck and infact have it going on pretty well as everything stands at this time.<br />
<br />
Need a slower?  chanter, beastlord, or shaman, old debate, ya'll know the arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I vote druid...because most of the time when I'm grouped with druids they seem confused and not sure what they should be doing...or they're doing something that annoys me.  This would give them something unique to do that wouldn't annoy me.<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll give it to monks...since monks could already (self) heal and are getting styles that have DoT and root effects - in only makes sense that they should get more spell-like abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd hardly say druids suck. They are fairly effective healers. Respectable nukers and have a nice variety of useful spells already. All around a generally well rounded class.<br />
<br />
Obviously since this is a shaman board things are going to general go that way anyway but I think that is the logical choice. If you look at things Melee stats like str dex agility sta all effect the endurance bar. Shaman are the ones who get all the buffs to improve those stats and even get the biggest buff with those all rolled into it, avatar. I wouldn't want to endurance regen added to avatar for example but it wouldn't be bad added to the acumen line or even in a new spell. I wouldn't have a problem with BST getting a less version or single target versions but i don't think they really need any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You know, I'm torn.  On one hand, if such a spell were to be put into the game, I'd be pretty upset if another class and not shaman got the spell.  Seeing as how we had the most stamina regen spells of any class, it would be logical that we'd get it.   If we didn't get it, it would just look like a gigantic &quot;eff you!&quot; from the dev team.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, it may be overpowering as a spell line, it would certainly be annoying to have to keep on all the melees in the group, and I'd be just as happy to not get it at all.  Well, provided that nobody else gets it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nacireen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Can you say ACUMEN, we'd only be getting back what we already had, a spell that with proper extensions can last around 2hrs, and was the ONLY non burst sta regen spell in the game before we got ganked.  Give it back to us but with +end regen and let me advert the melee crack in pok. ;P  Their stated reason for not doing so was they didn't want to foster melee becomeing more buff dependant.  So what the heck is KEI?  Does anyone over 45 with a manabar NOT try to get kei whenever possible?  These supposed &quot;fixes&quot; for melee are some of the most overpowering crap I've seen in this game yet.  Now there is absolutely NO incentive to play most hybrid classes as the spells they sacrificed melee abilities for are now given for FREE to the pure melees out there.  (/rant off)  <br />
<br />
Sorry, after getting my shaman to 65 I started playing a ranger maybe 2 weeks before these went live.  It sickens me to see a warrior healing better than a hybrid at the same level and using no mana to do it, while a hybrid has to deal with the new endurance and their inherently slower regen of it.</div></div><hr />

It has the same duration of VoQ/KeI<br />
In 2 versions, single and group (no thanks, I don't want to buff any melee, one by one, in a 72 ppl raid).<br />
No other classe should get a weaker version more powerful than 50% of the initial line.<br />
<br />
In any other way, no thanks, I don't want it.<br />
<br />
PS : got a neat idea to help balance :p. Make this endurance regen buff not stackable with any mana regen spell (voq/sd/nine) so some hybrids will have to choose between tanking better than a war or healing better than a shaman (me ??? evil with paladin ??? naaaaaah...)</div></div><hr />

I predict that shaman will LOSE and get this.<br />

I think that:<br />
Warriors should get a rogue-only END regeneration<br />
Rogues should get a monk-only END regeneration<br />
Rogues should get a warrior-only END regeneration.<br />
<br />
All regeneration spells last 6 minutes with a 2 minute recast.  <br />
All regeneration spells are group only.<br />

<br />
Mind you when it's fully implemented I'll be taxing the endurance a bit more...  But we'll see.<br />
<br />
If an Endurance regen HAS to be implemented, shamans should get it no question.  Echanters to hell, the melee buffers are supposed to be shaman, and that's the way it should remain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Nacireen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">This poll needs a &quot;nobody&quot; option.

<br />
By that logic and to make things &quot;balanced&quot; wouldn't we also just need to remove all mana regen effects and just make spells cheaper?  Point blank with these new melee abilities if they continue to be able to run constant on the new abilities, and never worry about using a buff slot to help regen they have only become manafree casters with nice armor.  This changed system has sofar screwed every class except pure melee in terms of balance.<br />
<br />
That being said the changes were needed just handled WAY wrong.  SoE states they don't want to make melee more &quot;buff dependant&quot;, so do the same for casters/hybrids.  The agro issue was the main gripe melee always had, and there have been great steps in that direction yes, but SoE got way carried away playing with their new toy and made the pure melee classes WAY far overpowered.  Now at 63 a Warrior can for the paltry sum of 3 COPPER heal themselves for 1200hp per minute, oh and they can do anything other than hit autoattack or use a clicky during that time.  While this is GREAT for a warrior wanting to solo some low blues, or even go fight some greens to farm faction or whatever, where's the balance in this?  Hybrids got nothing sofar, and have become far less desired in groups.  Casters get only indirect benefit in that when we can't find another tank a warrior can pretty much hold the agro like the hybrids used to be able to.  So now we have a lot of hybrids that can't agro as much as before, and a lot of warriors/monk/rogues that get more than ever in the way of abilities and utility.<br />
<br />
What is the compelling reason to pick the ranger that's LFG now when you want a dps in a pre 50's grp?  The monk/war/rogue will FAR outdamage them, won't be screaming OOM and also won't care about that caster gear you might see drop.  Oh, and the same applies for ALL hybrids.  They've really suffered some losses with the system as is.  The casters not so much but pure melee are coming closer to caster ability to solo while having NONE of the drawbacks that limit us.  If they are going to get all these new abilities they should have to farm their dual weilding little butts off like us casters do for spells.  They should then have prohibitively high costs to use (just like our spells do) such that with no regen buff they are constantly yelling &quot;OOE&quot; just like that cleric that told the grp kei was fading just as the pull reaches camp.  As it stands pure melee sofar get to have their cake and eat it to.  None of the caster frustrations, none of the sacrifices in equipment/skills that a hybrid payed for lower versions of the caster goodies.  NO DOWNSIDE.  For them, everyone else gets to watch the pure melee get better and better without having to work for or earn anything.<br />
<br />
This has been quite a bit longer than I intended and I don't want to leave the impression I liked things as they were, but this is the most messed up implementation I could have possibly imagined.  Hybrids should have gotten some new ablities, not on par with pure melee of course, but something.  Like that healing discipline could be a mana regen for hybrids or somesuch.  Second the tomes with the exception of the ones for the already existing disciplines should have cost FAR more, and there should NEVER have been any 55+ ones on vendors, period.  You want caster type abilities, taste some caster type frustration.  &quot;I camped this area for 2 weeks and still no Tome of Healing Will...&quot;  Or, &quot;No I don't have Healing Will yet, cheapest I've found it is 7k...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, I think I'm done for now...</div></div><hr />

Who should get it? Have to agree with the no-one option. Let there be a couple item foci and maybe an AA or two, and keep the regen cap down around 6-10 max, otherwise it just gets to be hard to balance. And no one wants to lose another buff slot anyhow.<br />

<br />
The bard song I had forgotten about but the enchanter spells never were that effective anyway so didn't even consider them, however on the subject of balance, the current system is nowhere even CLOSE to a balance.  Now we have manaless casters that need no help from any other class to preform in the guise of pure melee.  Who are now far more effective than any hybrid except in the extreme endgame, all without spending one single AA, no time camping rare drops or buying MQs, and spending no more than a few copper at easily found merchants.  If there was any semblance of balance here then in a grp where no casters had kei/voq/etc, the pure melee should be going OOE around the same rates the casters are going OOM.  Remember balance doesn't mean one class is happy, it has to be all or balance is out the window.<br />
<br />
I'm happy the pure melee got some new ablilities.  I'm very upset about how it's been handled.  Hybrids got crap, nada, nothing.  And now are next to worthless.  Casters (at least some of them) are pretty much the same with only some of them losing any utility at all but now we are even MORE buff dependant than ever trying to keep mana usage up with the new melee's who need nothing to be able to keep going steadily.  It's quite simply a slap in the face to all casters that the melee's had any 55+ abilities available cheaply from a dern merchant.  Come on, I had to camp for WEEKS to afford some spells turning off xp and doing AA only till I had at least the important spells of the next level as there is NO advantage to gaining a level with a caster if you don't have the upgraded spells.  The pure melee should have felt this pain as well.  Instead the casters still get to watch the pure melee drop a mob and have it looted before it even finishes the falling animation then pull again all the while asking for rebuffs on the spell I had to solo farm for 3 weeks just to afford.  Or they can just pop the 63 disc they got for next to nothing from a MERCHANT and patch heal themselves while runnin off for the next pull, or while they wait on someone else to bring it.<br />
<br />
There is nothing even approaching balance in what we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ommar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well I haven't been on much since these changes to STA and Endurance, but as for who should get the buff for this is an easy answer that would satisfy all involved.  My choice would be for the classes that have the Invigorate buff, that now has NO meaning in the game, be converted to the Endurance buff line and that the Extended Endurance buff go to the Druid at level 62 including MGB and Group (but this is IMO).  The Shaman already have nice buffs that can be traded for in POK just like KEI, Clerics also have the HP buffs.  Yeah the Druid has the BOT9 line but is secondary to KEI and the other REGEN/HP buff spells.<br />
<br />
So I would like all those that have the Invigorate line to be converted to endurance line so we don't have to buy another stupid spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Nacireen, I'm curious if you've played a pure melee at all?  If you think they're anywhere near a hybrid or caster in soloing abilities, you're either nuts or know some &quot;leet strats&quot; that have thus far escaped me.<br />
<br />
You seem to think that healing will is some amazing heal.  100/tick for 10 ticks, every 5 minutes, and it really sucks down the endurance pool.  While doing this, you can't fight.   So at best, that's 20/tick if you use it every time, which generally isn't practical unless you don't mind a minute of downtime for every 4 minutes of fighting.  So basically, maybe every 5 minutes, a melee can top off their health by a few hundred HPs before they start fighting again.  Wow, how will hybrids (or heck, even clerics) ever get a group again?<br />
<br />
One of the nicest things melees got was split discpiline timers, and that also applies to hybrids.  Ya know, just because one class gets a little boost, it's not the end of the world for every other class.<br />
<br />
Oh well, sorry for the off-topic...  On to the question at hand.  I personally don't think anyone needs endurance regen.  It's actually not too bad as it is.  I can incite on every mob and use furious/stonewall as needed (and when available), and while I get pretty low sometimes, I have yet to run out.  I probably would run out if I used healing will, but as mentioned above, it sucks.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Nacireen...I have no idea what your talking about as far as melee soloing.  Not possible for any experience gain unless they want to kill light blues for about 3 hours and get a blue (if they can even solo that far)  Before you speak about melees make sure you play one to 65...I know I have.<br />
