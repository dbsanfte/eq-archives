<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a question for the knowledgeable shaman community regarding inate race regeneration with the trolls and iksars.  I have searched and gotten mixed messages.  Any clarification would help.<br />
<br />
1)  Is the inate regeneration the same sitting or standing? <br />
<br />
2)  I read  about a recent patch altering benefits of sitting regeneration rate so that it increases the longer one sits.  Does this negate inate race regen as some posts have suggested?  Or does it just stack on top of it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

About the innate HP regeneration:<br />
<br />
1) If you sit you will regen your HP faster than standing up.<br />
2) The new changes from that recent patch stacks with the innate regen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Level 65 iksar and trolls lost 4hps of both standing and sitting regen when the regen changes went live. This still has not been fixed.</div></div><hr />

So when OOW comes out will Trolls and Iksar still have a 20% penalty on xp as innate regen with 1k+ hitting mobs doesnt seem quite enough to be the last to ding in your group.</div></div><hr />
