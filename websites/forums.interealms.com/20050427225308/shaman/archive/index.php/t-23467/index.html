<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why go to all the trouble for King/Seer these days when those items don't sell for much in the bazaar?  Well, the Copper Hammer is worth 12k tribute, and the swords the seer drops are worth 7500 or so.  I have picked up 50k+ in tribute in three hours in Droga.  That's a lot of Burning Affliction 4 benefit, folks!<br />
<br />
So here's the guide:<br />
<br />
First, get the annotated in-game map.  http://maps.eq-toolbox.com .  Use invis and run down to the king area.  Really, it's not that hard.  There is one invisible wall, but it's pretty obvious on the map.<br />
<br />
THE GENERAL AREA: Quick description of the king/seer area is in order.  King Droga pops in his throne room, which has no throne but does have a working oven in it.  Those kooky goblins.  The throne room is FULL of gobbies, the toughest ones that Droga has to offer.  Fortunately we won't be killing them all.  The throne room is inside a building that looks fairly regal from the outside, compared to the rest of the junk in the place anyway.  Droga's spawn point is just to the RIGHT of the oven against the back wall as you run in to the room.<br />
<br />
If you exit the throne room and head to either the left or right, you can go up a ramp to a little tunnel directly over the door to the throne room.  Earth Seer Gamolk spawns here, or his PH.<br />
<br />
KILLING EARTH SEER GAMOLK: He's really easy.  Just hit him up with malos, root him, and dot him down.  If you fight him AT his spawn point, HE DOES NOT RUN.  This is because there's another goblin standing out at the far edge of the platform behind the earth seer, and due to the wacky aggro rules in Droga, he's close enough to make the Earth Seer believe he has help, but far enough away not to aggro.  This is a BIG help, believe me.  If you fight him elsewhere, or kill that gobbie first, make sure you keep root handy, or failing that, mem gate :-)<br />
<br />
KILLING KING DRONAN: OK, this is the tricky one.  As I said before, the throne room is chock full of goblins, and we'd rather not aggro them all.  Here's what you do:<br />
<br />
1. Shrink twice.<br />
<br />
2. Cast Quiescence on yourself; invis and run into throne room.<br />
<br />
3. Behind the king's spawn spot there is a crease in the wall.  Put your back to this crease.  Do it fast, before Quiescence fades.<br />
<br />
4. Lead off with Turgur's.  Alternate Malos/Turgur's until he is slowed.  DO NOT MELEE, you don't want to move him an inch from his spot.<br />
<br />
5. Take a deep breath, the only tricky part is done.  Keep Quiescence up as necessary for heals.  Dot to death.  NO MELEE.  NO PET.<br />
<br />
6. He will not run due to the proximity of many other goblins.  He will probably rotate around you slightly, but if you start in the crease, do not melee, and shrink twice, you should not aggro other goblins.<br />
<br />
SPECIAL SPY TRICK: If you are waiting on the king to spawn, it's damned inconvenient to do it in the throne room, where a dropped invis can gain aggro.  Outside the throne room, on the left as you exit, is a crease in the wall.  Cast bear form and shrink, then stick your nose in this crease.  You can see the throne room through the wall now!  This is, surprisingly enough, a safe spot and you will not gain aggro; you can med/canni here and watch for the king all you want.<br />
<br />
BONUS TIP: RUNRI.  You have the map, so you know where his room is.  But what's the strategy for fighting him?<br />
<br />
1. Keep your back to the NORTH wall of the empty room next to Runri and lead off with Spirit Call if you have it.  The temporary doggies will eat the HT for you!  If no spirit call, send dogdog, but give him focus first and possibly Quiescence.<br />
<br />
2. Fight him in the NORTHWEST corner of the empty room.  Just tank him, he's a wimp and won't outdamage Quiescence slowed.  He doesn't run if you fight him in this corner because there are goblins in the next room close enough to him that he thinks they are helping him ;-)<br />
<br />
Be prepared for a long wait if you want the sash.  It can go days.  If you have an alt who can port or use a spiritstone, ferry the daggers you get to the bank and/or to alts on other accounts, the tribute is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can also sit safely on the dirt/tile border as you enter dronan's room.  zero wanderers, just sit a bit to the left so that you don't aggro the first mob on the right as you're entering room.<br />
<br />
i've gone afk there overnite accidentally. . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ormak D'Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">King is actually really easy to pull.<br />
<br />
- Sit in the safespot (dirt pile) near the kings building.  <br />
- Summon up the level 49 Shaman pet.<br />
- Use Assid Vision to target the King or PH.<br />
- Send in pet and after it hits the king call him back.<br />
<br />
You will get the King solo everytime.   This works for any spawn in Droga, just find a safe spot and pet pull everything.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the pet pull will not work in a few select areas.  For instance, pulling Jailor Mauphin is hit and miss.  Since the Jailor can kill the dog in a single round (DS + combat) your quie on dogdog will not always save it.  Probably 1 in 4 of my pulls here has early dog death and massive aggro.<br />
<br />
What you can do, though, is send in a quie'd dogdog after the other 2 mobs in the room with the jailor and clear them out first.  Then go into him invis to fight.  This has been risk free for me.<br />
<br />
As an FYI, the best way to pull with dogdog is to get your target first by going in invis.  Then go to the safe spot and summon dogdog. Target your dog by clicking on it and quie it.  Then use the key to switch back to your original target to get the mob highlighted again.  This key isn't set by default.  Go into Alt-O and you'll find it under &quot;Keyboard,&quot; &quot;Target,&quot; &quot;Toggle last two targets.&quot;  This is a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great tip on the lvl 49 pet pull<br />
<br />
Tsuyoi, what's the problem with Assiduous Vision for targeting?  I used that for next-room targeting on Emp Ssra frequently and it worked fine, should work the same here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tsuyoi, what's the problem with Assiduous Vision for targeting?<br />
<br />
If you can grab your target using Assiduous Vision that should be fine here.  For the jailor you need to go through a door so not sure if that method will work though.  I've never used Assiduous Vision so can't comment.<br />
<br />
Since I have a clicky-invis I use it 100% of the time in Droga except for the occasional CR.  Keeps me from having to dedicate a spell slot to invis or Assiduous Vision.  I use spell sets a lot and am comfortable with them, but nothing like forgetting once and casting AV on your target instead of Malos.  ;)<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />
