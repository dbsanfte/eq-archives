<br />
Soandso shouts, '51 druid LFG pst!'<br />
<br />
I was getting into this conversation with 2 other people I grouped with the other night.  At level 51 there isn't really much a player can offer.  I'm not saying they're a bad player or anything, but can they really do much when the stuffing hits the fan?  Personally I was thinking 55+, while someone else thought 58+.  While I haven't confirmed it, but I'm guessing they're limited to 46+, which after seeing what I've seen, seems rather low.  <br />
While some might say that some of the mobs aren't much worse as seen in Hate, Fear, or Growth, I counter that by saying that none of those zones are really viable exp grind zones and have been for the most part, strictly raid zones, where the raid as a whole can cover for the little guy.<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedric</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel comfortable in the places I've been to so far in PoP at 56.  Exp. can be very nice too.  I've been in groups ranging from 53 - 61 and I feel everyone contributes.<br />
<br />
I figure a well rounded group of 49-51s could handle a yard trash group in PoD or PoN easily.  As you get higher lvl you can move to higher lvl stuff.  I'm not sure a 46 group could do much.  But if it was kinda like an old planes raid with 47-50 4-5 groups they could kill as well.  Of course that would be kinda silly cause the easier PoP stuff drops no loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalvarian</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends entirely on the class.  I've been in PoD groups with a 50 shaman and she (Troll.../shiver) was slowing everything without any trouble.  I've also been grouped with the 51 druid as well and he really had nothing to add to the group.  Heck my 55 DruidBot hardly adds much (aside: level 57 druid 430 point heal, level 58 druid 75% CH...umm..TOO BIG A GAP!).<br />
<br />
So it's more based on class.  Shaman, chanters, clerics, and bards can help at a lot lower levels than INT casters, and damage melee.  Druids and tanking melee need to be even higher to really play their role effectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
REGEN &gt; *<br />
<br />
Chloroplast and Regrowth give 9 hp per mana spent if used efficiently. Most other heals rarely brake 3 hp per mana. Don't believe me? Do the math.<br />
<br />
Damage Shields = Free Damage<br />
Think those mobs hit hard and fast? Great! Load up the DS and watch them beat themselves to death.<br />
<br />
Those last 2 apply to Ranger and Druid spells alike.<br />
<br />
I was also just looking at Druid spells to find some of the sweet spots. Try this on for size.<br />
<br />
Druid DoT's do around 3.6 hp per mana spent at level 52/53 and last just about a minute. Wizard Nukes do between 2.8-3.2 (Ice comet is 2.8, Draughts are 3.2).<br />
<br />
A well played druid is an addition to any group, provided other key points are taken care of. A 51 druid can't replace a 51 cleric in PoP. A 51 druid isn't as useful as slower or CC in PoP. But Regen + DS + Efficient DoT's = an addition to the group.<br />
<br />
My 2cp, and no, I don't play a druid.<br />
<br />
Oh, and try this, get a druid around 55 in PoD that knows how to charm fairly well, and watch them clean up, those rats make NASTY pets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splunge</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very true. Before PoP, Velks was the big grind place for pretty much anyone 50+ but especially 60s in NToV gear just grinding endless AA points.<br />
Once I asked a guildie who was in there how many people were in zone. They said 7. I said lemme guess; your group and (60 uber SK)? Yup. Didnt bother goin. That was crowded. =)<br />
<br />
Went back yesterday early evening (lvl 61 then) just to see if everything was light blue and if the XP sucked real bad now (it did) and there were 5 people there, including me, none of the  others were even 60. Later that night a 59 guild pally said she was the only one in there.<br />
<br />
Go to Velks. Its a wasteland, and finally good XP for pre-60s again.<br />
<br />
Oh, btw, Bodyguards are still dark blue to 61, easily pulled with the new Harmony as thier MR is about negative 4 billion.<br />
They turn light blue at 62. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domandred</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">61+ imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
For what plane?  Plane of Valor or Storms maybe.  Plane of Nightmare, Plane of Justice depending on camp, Plane of Disease, Plane of Innovation I have done all pre 60.  My usual group?<br />
<br />
Me - 58 Ranger (59 now) (slow duty if chanter not available)<br />
60 Bard<br />
60 Paladin<br />
56 Chanter<br />
60 Cleric<br />
<br />
I've done all the teir 1 planes with that group.<br />
<br />
Usual early morning PoN quick exp group:<br />
<br />
Me (59 Ranger) (Tank)  YES I tank PoN safe side<br />
58 Enchanter<br />
55 Paladin<br />
60 Cleric<br />
55+ any melee class<br />
<br />
Rule everything on &quot;safe&quot; side of dropoff.<br />
<br />
This mornings group:<br />
<br />
Me again (59 Ranger in case you forgot)<br />
61 Cleric (same cleric as the other groups she dinged)<br />
60 Ranger<br />
58 Shaman<br />
58 Warrior<br />
59 Rogue<br />
<br />
I mention this group because note we have no chanter.  Between myself and the other ranger we were doing 3 pulls with no mezability.  We just split argo and root parked.<br />
<br />
Another awesome PoN group:<br />
<br />
Me<br />
58 Shaman<br />
61 Ranger (The works in AA)<br />
61 Cleric<br />
<br />
Chain pulling fiends :).  **** exp rules the less people you get in a group.<br />
<br />
Total deaths in PoN for me?  2.  One because I went AFK at graveyard and some monkey pulled a train to there.  The other because I had to go to work and was past the drop off.  Find random mob and commit hari kari.  Rez self in the morning.<br />
<br />
So my point is that you do NOT have to be 61+ to do the first planes.  I've even put a 51 melee in my group and he did just fine.  <br />
<br />
It's the &quot;if your not level 60 your worthless&quot; mentality that actually makes it HARDER to get to 60.  Soon it will be &quot;if your not 65 your worthless&quot;.  How long till &quot;if your not 65 with max aa your worthless&quot;?<br />
<br />
&quot;People have had 3 years to get to 60&quot;.  BAH I know people that just started playing less then a month ago.  Sorry not everyone in the game started on day one.</div></div><hr />

Bodyguards are my bread and water these days.. approximately 16% aaxp an hour there, better than the 12-14% I get in PoN pickup groups, not to mention coldain heads sell pretty decently at the bazaar.  PoD is quite crowded, and finding a decent pickup group isn't always the easiest.  Until I'm through my trials PoV and such is still out of reach, and the trials have more lineups than free beer stands at a rock concert.</div></div><hr />

The group was myself (60 rng), 57 cleric, 57 mage, 54 shaman, 55 enchanter, 53 paladin. We had not trouble at all with mobs on the side of the river where you zone in. We did not try the other side of the river with that group.<br />
<br />
Mostly until they reach the high 50s (58+), I intend to take my friends once a week to all the places that used to be too crowded to get a camp. We did Sebilis D2/lab the other night and it was a first time for all of them. I expect to show them more of Velks, KC, Chardok, etc., too. They're happy to see new places (for them). I'm happy to take friends someplace exciting. Other days I will be in POP usually though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">imo pop is 61+ sure you can get a group there at lower lvls but with the new conning system once your lvl 61 theres really no viable place for you to XP except for pop, once your 65 you have no choice but to XP in pop. it kinda sux really. im not sayign that if your 50 or 55 you shoudlnt go to pop but these zones are going to be so overcrowded with lvl61+ people that you will have a hard time finding a group. plus the fact that the weakest mob in every zone can hit for 200+ really sux for the lvl50ish people as most lvl50ish peopel dont have very good gear and a few whacks form a mob hitting for 200+ hurts fast, hell it hurts fast on me and im 65 =p <br />
          i think sony did a poor job in marketing pop in the fact that its pretty much useless for anyone 55 or lower except for how easy it makes gettign around the world now. then again i guess sony did well in marketing pop as they sorta hid this fact and got more people to buy it add made money$$$ <br />
   in closing ide say anyone50-55 hasnt got a real shot at getting a group, lvl55-58 people will have a shot but most lvl60s arnt gonna let them in their group. 58+ people shouldnt have to many problems getting a group but more than likely any of those lvls will be grouping with the same lvlish people. more than likely if your not 60+ your not going to get into the groups of peopel who are 60+ unless your a good friends with a group member as most people under 60 are shunned by higher lvl groups.<br />

My bigest problem is going LFG and a getting invited to a low to mid 50's group in PON, POI and POD.. The exp is really sucky and they allways need to med. SO pulls are slow. Ho yea and they want me tank cuase there 56 warroir is getting his ass handed to him. And to really kick me in the butt they have to root cuase they want to sit and  med. NO DOUBLE DAMAG. I need to tell them and worse yet is the Mags earth pet that casts root. LOL.  Of course this is if I can convince them that my damage is  bettter if the warroir tanks. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theran</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the one hand I'm happy that most of the 50 &amp; over people have moved to the planes.  I've been leveling my twinks up in the old zones cause they're completely deserted.  With a good group of people we never run out of mobs to kill.  Sometimes we've even been able to hold two of the camps in the zone.  My twink are leveling faster than the people I know who are in there 50's because while they're shouting for group for hours on end I can get a camp within 30 minutes of zoning into one of the old world zones.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I will no longer group with anyone in the tier one zones who is not at least 58 or higher.  I've spent to much time with my main babysitting lowbie groups.  I had one group in Nightmare where no one was over 55.  It was ridiculous.  The pulls were slow, they had to med all the time.  After an hour of this they started commenting in group about the awesome experience they had gotten so far.  I finally had to tell them that I was leaving.  In an hour I got just over 2% exp with 10% going to AA.<br />
<br />
From what I hear the Tier 2 planes are pretty crowded too.  This is just what I've heard from guildmates because after 15 executioner trial failures I've pretty much given up on getting the flag.  It really makes me mad that they tightened up the /con list after 60 so much that there aren't very many non-PoP zones where you can get exp post 60.  So now a days I've got two cruddy choices to make each night.<br />
<br />
1) Spend 6 to 8 hours waiting to try the executioner trial once &amp; fail.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) Spend 3 to 4 hours shouting for a group in zones that have anywhere from 70 to over 100 people experiencing in them.<br />
<br />
One good note is that most of the people I've talked to who are 60+ have said that they will start being pickier about what levels they group with as well.  Ah well at least I'll have a bunch of level 60 characters soon. :p</div></div><hr />

Tier 1 planes can support low-mid 50s groups, with great experience. If you don't like it, don't join the groups. You have that choice. They pay their $13 a month just like everyone else; if they can surivive it, more power to 'em. Period. Personally, I've noticed that &quot;yard trash&quot; groups in PoN and PoD suck royally for exp...for the younger levels they're great. It's using the content. Let 'em.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is 60. Not everyone has had the game for 3 years. I respectfully ask that some of you get this through your heads please. Thank you.<br />
<br />
Planes exp is like a narcotic. Once you get a taste of it, you want more. Let people try to feed their fixes. Beyond the Tier 1 stuff you need flags to proceed. I highly doubt you're going to see anyone below 60 in Tier 2 stuff. If you don't want to group with sub-60s, get flagged and go to T2.</div></div><hr />

A 57 Cleric, a 55 Monk and a 52 Shaman.  I felt as if I contributed to the group, especially with the Cleric and Shaman.<br />
<br />
It all depends on the role you want the person to play.  A low 50s main tank is not going to cut it here.  However,  support classes and damage dealers can contribute to a group in the low to mid 50s.  I'm not saying that they'd be ideal, but they can certainly handle the tier one zones.<br />
<br />
As a player who plays these zones, I don't expect 60+ players to group with me.  However, for you to say that I don't even belong here is ridiculous.  I can get a group here faster and level incredibly faster than anywhere else.  I've gone from 54 to 57 on my cleric since PoP came out.  I haven't leveled that fast since I was in my 40s.  Why shouldn't I take advantage of it?<br />
<br />
I am a casual player who only plays about 15 hours per week.  I spread my time around on three different chars on this server and also have a char on another server that I play with my kids.  I've also taken three breaks of 3 months or more because I need to recharge my batteries as far as interest in the game.  Just because I've been playing a long time and didn't get to 60 before PoP was realeased doesn't mean that I'm a horrible player.  I may not have the experience of some players that can play more often and be a part of guilds that I cannot due to my time constraints, but I'm still a competent player.  I don't care whether or not you group with me, but to tell me I shouldn't even be allowed in the zones is just wrong.<br />

I think he hit the nail right on the head with this, maybe a lvl50 limit should have been put in, low i know for all you 60+ only freaks, but the lvl limit for old planes was 46, but when do you ever see people around 46 in the planes,  hardly ever its all 50+.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerple</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Katalaeia, I was 57 when PoP came out and as a 57 ranger tanked virtually all of the non named mobs in Disease as well as tanking quite a bit of Nightmare and Innovation, and this was while tanking instead of the a few 60+ Warriors.   When I'm not tanking, several pick up groups have complimented me on being one of the better pullers they've had in Disease and Nightmare.  (Note:  I hate pulling and generally think I am awful at it.)<br />
<br />
Yesterday at level 59 I joined a mid 50's group because a friend was a cleric and it was sheer awful.  The 52 chanter was unable to do much.  The 55 Paladin who was pulling and tanking  (I was a replacement in the group and he wanted to keep the jobs) and he was awful as well, although in his case I am sure it was at least half that he was a poor player and not just his class or level.<br />
<br />
On other nights I have seen two level 49 players in Innovation and Disease do quite well.,   One was a Warrior, the other a shadowknight, but neither were tanking.  The warrior was a main character in a otherwise mid 50's group, the shadowknight was an alt twink of a 61 Cleric/61 Necro who was playing in an otherwise 61/62 group.<br />
<br />
So the point is,  I liek it the way it is, while some lower 50's anbd below classes will be fairly usless, others can be helpful if they are good players.<br />
<br />
And just an FYI, I have been playing for less than a year.<br />
<br />
EDIT, Added after:  But it is true about the other zones.  While Velks is still pretty well populated on Vazaelle, Umbral has been empty the past few days, and Cazic Thule has been absolutely abandoned.  .</div></div><hr />

PoP first tier zones are so crowded atm no lvl 55 group can get a camp to kill anyway. By crowded I mean like 100+ in PoN, 36 in PoI, and the other day there was 75+ in PoD.<br />
<br />
When I zone into PoD/PoI/PoN and do a /who LFG I'm usually met with at least 10 names. Enought to start a group but usually no spots to camp so they sit singly hoping to replace someone.</div></div><hr />

Slow is slow, since slows are easy to land in planes on even red mobs.</div></div><hr />
