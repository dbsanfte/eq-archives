<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rustyspear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or am i the only one that is truly disgusted by VI's blatant attempt to appease the druids and their whole &quot;we dont have enough use at raids&quot; montra with this new CH?<br />
<br />
I've seen, and i'm sure your seen, the rather large and redundant posts on druid boards about how they want x, y, and z changed so they can have more &quot;usefulness&quot; on raids.  It comes off as whining and gets old really fast.<br />
<br />
I'm not flaming, just telling VI to get rid of the new spells and never let it go live on other servers!  Never give in to the power of the whoppy cushion!...cuz all they blow is hot air<br />
<br />
Funny how we shamans dont need to complain or have the idea that only through repeatitive complaining, whining and endless threads about &quot;caster balance&quot;, can we get what we want.  I'm proud of your shaman community and happy with the way VI has designed our class...of course i do have a few suggestions for change :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.  I think VI might finally have an inkling that they screwed up when they upped the level cap to 60, and are finally trying to balance the upper end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clerics and only Clerics should get CH imnshfo.<br />
<br />
* IF * druids were to get CH, then there would be only one reaosn to play a cleric and that's res.  Soon druids would be asking for &quot;re-animation&quot; or &quot;re-incarnation&quot; (at a 10% to 25% exp recovery) ....<br />
<br />
what then for Clerics?<br />
<br />
All classes complain.  Shoot I'm guilty. <br />
<br />
I wonder if the folks who used to play overpowered Necros went to druids, then realized (too late) what end game held for them.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't think it's &quot;fair&quot; for a class to be able to quad - kite with near impunity to 51, continue to have good to above average solo abilities to 60, then want to be one of the top - tier raid classes. There HAS to be some sort of trade off.<br />
<br />
druids are a whining bunch of sum-beotches tho. Can you imagine the collective teeth gnashing and tree - humping if TWO of their 60 spells were as hard to get as Torpor and Malo?<br />
<br />
Shoot - every other class gets ONE of the PotC earrings. druids get TWO AND A SPELL!<br />
<br />
There are plenty of reasons to be a druid. They DOMINATE the pay for port market. They DOMINATE the outdoor named spawn (Cough FM cycle cough) market.<br />
<br />
druids have top 3 nukes, top 3 ports, top 4 DOTs, top 3 heals, RESIST spells, FORAGE, TRACK...<br />
<br />
and now they want BETTER healing?<br />
<br />
My new rule about druids..<br />
<br />
1) Not all druids are jerks - but all jerks are druids.<br />
2) (new) Not all druids are whiners - but all whiners have a druid on their account. :)=<br />
<br />
Seriously- if you are a druid and can't find something to do on a raid - you're not looking hard enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Quest was originally for the druid spell with a crappy spell as a side effect. The Reason druids get 2 earrings is that the druid only earring was named after the original player to finish the quest and since it's an obviously druid only effect they made a all/all version with slightly lesser stats and a different effect.<br />
<br />
druids have top 3 nukes, top 3 ports, top 4 DOTs, top 3 heals, RESIST spells, FORAGE, TRACK...<br />
<br />
Try adding some facts there.<br />
Druids 2 best nukes are moonfire at 1150 dmg for 320 mana and wildfire at 1024 for 320 mana also.<br />
Ice comet which wizzards have had since the original game and get at 49 is 1120dmg for 400 mana. Then theres always things like Ice Spear of Solist 1200 dmg for 300 mana, Sunstrike 1615 dmg for 400 mana, Elnerick's Electrical Rending 1890 for 525 mana Garrison's Superior Sundering 2100 for 540. Druids dont' even have the best single nuke let alone the top 3.<br />
<br />
As to ports. The only time ports differ between druids and wizzys is in the original kunak zones and you could argue some of them are better locations but thats open to debate and even so transes are far more convinent for someone selling ports not to mention transes to bind that a druid can't do.<br />
<br />
A druids best dot does 1400 dmg in 1 minute. Necros get better spells like Funeral Pyre of Kelador which is 2400 dmg in 1 minute or Pyrocruor about 2k in 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Do i really need to continue?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think calling the proposed shaman/druid healing spells on Test &quot;complete heals&quot; is a bit of a misnomer.  I assume they are currently flagged that way to ensure they are under the same restrictions as a cleric's true CH spell (focus effects/AA not affecting casting time or mana cost).<br />
<br />
Even if druids get a 2900 point heal, only clerics can fill the health bar of a 7K hitpoint tank.  A cleric's desirability on raids will not be affected by these changes, they will still be needed.  The only chance is, druids and shaman will actually be able to heal a non MA tank while the clerics are all busy in a CH cycle.  I have frustrations during raids like Roy or Lady N., where non MA tanks are instructed to run around the corner and ask for a heal.  A chloro will NOT move the health bar of most of the tanks in my guild, it's laughable.  <br />
<br />
The proposed changes will hurt clerics in their desirability for an exp group.  Due to their unsurpassed healing ability, clerics were the cornerstone of a good exp group, leaving the other 14 classes to fight over the other 5 spots.  The requirement of a cleric in an exp group was offset by the fact that clerics had a great deal of difficulty operating outside of a group.  Since they could not solo, it made sense that grouping was generally an option for them.  Every group needed one!<br />
<br />
As players have grown in power against mob difficulty, non clerics can now hold the healer's role in exp groups.  In a way this is good, it's good that players are so strong that any old 6 friends can get together and exp, without having to wait on X class or Y class to be a success.  It reminds me of our glorious newbie days, when you could get into a derv group with an SK, a mage, a druid and a ranger and have a great time.<br />
<br />
Since clerics are losing their required place in most exp groups, it is only right and fair that they should be given abilities to make them more solo friendly and less dependent on the groups which are no longer dependent on them.<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure where Verant is going with this proposed improvement to druid/shaman healing, all I know is, at three guild clerics are so unhappy by this change, they are contemplating quitting.  It won't do my guild any good to be able to exp all we want if we lose our mighty roster of CH clerics for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Change is what has kept EQ alive this long, and change is the only thing that can save it.  <br />
I want to see clerics soloing.  I want to see them doing druid-like damage in a group.  That will make me happy.  <br />
Many clerics won't want to solo or do damage or for that matter, do anything but sit on their butts and move once every 3 minutes enough to stand up and cast a CH.  This is a &quot;LAME&quot; job if you ask me.  It's stupid and pointless.<br />
<br />
I think yah initially a bunch of the most braindead clerics will quit.  The rest of them will appreciate their new abilities and want to explore their new spells.  That's of course assuming 1) the new heals go live, and 2) that clerics get spells to make them more rounded.  <br />
<br />
Then again this could just be the result of a night of hard drinking at SOE where the dev team got all ethered up and someone said &quot;Hey, what would happen if we . . . ?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but why design such a great and attainable item specifically to be Druid only in the first place?<br />
I mean if they did one special item/earring/whatever for each class, sure.<br />
But just for Druids? I never understood this.<br />
Makes about as much sense as the Druid armor in UP off the only non-summoning mobs in zone.<br />
(Especially with some of the other class armor there being so poor)<br />
Was it part of &quot;caster balancing&quot;?<br />

&quot;I want to see clerics soloing.&quot;<br />
<br />
/agree 100%<br />
<br />
Clerics (and all classes) have to worry about 4 things:<br />
1) soloability<br />
2) exp group (trivial mobs)<br />
3) non-exp group (non-trivial mobs)<br />
4) raids<br />
<br />
Clerics were NEEDED in 3 and 4 due to XP Rez, epic, buff, and CHeal.<br />
Clerics were useful in 2, and hopeless in 1 (from what I understand).<br />
<br />
Now Pally's can provide alternates to Rez.<br />
Druid's (and Shaman's to a lesser extent) can provide alternates to CHeal.<br />
<br />
I think clerics will still hold power in 4.<br />
I think clerics will be SERIOUSLY compromised in 3.<br />
<br />
I DO think it was good to make lesser but still effective enough alternates to key game abilities.<br />
<br />
I think 3 class alternates to every game ability (each being lesser than the last) makes sense:<br />
SLOW: shaman &gt; enchanter &gt; beastlord<br />
CHEAL: cleric &gt; druid &gt; shaman<br />
CROWD CONTROL: enchanter &gt; bard<br />
REZ: cleric &gt; paladin<br />
TANK: warrior &gt; ? &gt; ?<br />
SPELL DAMAGE: wizard &gt; mage &gt; druid<br />
MELEE DAMAGE: rogue &gt; monk &gt; ?<br />
RANGED DAMAGE: ranger &gt; ? &gt; ?<br />
HASTE: bard &gt; enchanter &gt; shaman<br />
FD PULLING: monk &gt; ? &gt; ?<br />
CR: rogues &gt; monks<br />
<br />
I WOULD love to see clerics get a boost in 3, 2, and 1.<br />
I WOULD love to see clerics get an good alternate role in one of the slots above.<br />
I WOULD love to see cleris given a way to solo (maybe undead only)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That must be very very inferior alternatives? Unless the person healed has really few hitpoints.<br />

So you want clerics to get better in everything they are not the best in? So on top of being ABSOLUTELY needed for raids you want them to be good soloing, doing trivial and non-trivial mobs. Oh yeah, thats a great idea because Complete Heal hasnt ****ed up the game enough.<br />
<br />
In my opinion clerics are very close to wizards/warriors/rogues in definately not needing any upgrades at the moment.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the druids.  They have had very little to offer raids for a long time.  The dot stacking is going to be fantastic for them, and for shammies.</div></div><hr />

Then what's your explanation for wizards? They can quadkite, too, solo to 60, and ARE a top raid class. Where's the trade-off? Explain. <br />
<br />
<br />
druids are a whining bunch of sum-beotches tho. Can you imagine the collective teeth gnashing and tree - humping if TWO of their 60 spells were as hard to get as Torpor and Malo?<br />
If I remember correctly, the posters of this forum also spent a long time complaining about spell drops and figuring out what, if anything, had to be changed or improved for shamans. Bringing issues to the forefront in discussion threads is exchanging ideas and doesn't automatically constitute whining.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shoot - every other class gets ONE of the PotC earrings. druids get TWO AND A SPELL!<br />
Wow, are you ever misinformed. First of all, before the quest was solved, all anyone knew was that the quest contained some very difficult recipes for tradeskillers; all the text involved in the quest was not immediately recognized as a druid-only quest. No one even knew what the end product would be or if the quest led to the spell. <br />
<br />
After Xanthe completed the quest, the new earring was patched in, but it was MISTAKENLY marked druid-only, so VI fixed the problem for all the tradeskillers who had the original Solstice earring. This involved setting up Rebecca Cabbageleaf in an emergency patch. Now, if you can't understand that there was a mistake involved, I can't help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think the problem is that most shamans understand that raiding isn't the entire game and don't want clerics squeezed out of exp. groups.<br />
<br />
On this board we recently looked at ways of improving our healing on raids that wouldn't impact on non-raiding.  We were concerned about the impact it would have on other clerics.  My perception is that druids either don't care, or are too retarded to even consider the impact on others.  Can anyone post me some links showing this to be false?<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for clerics: they aren't a very good soloing class and who would want one in their group when another class - the druid - can now heal wel enough for normal groups and also can sow, evac, teleport, damage shield and track for you?  I don't see why a 1st rank soloing class should now supplant Clerics from their only role as group healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think some people are missing the point.<br />
<br />
Sure, 2900 might not touch your 7300 hp tank.<br />
<br />
But, when the vast majority of your warriors are under 5khp buffed, this ****s things up, and it ****s them up bad.<br />
<br />
My warrior fully buffed hits 6k hp.  I'm unguilded, never been guilded.  Wearing full cultural armor.  no ToV loot.  No Sssra or better loot.  When a CH hits me, it usually heals around 4k hp or so.  If you can't see what's wrong with the XP grind factor of implementing spells like this, then you need to have your head examined.<br />
<br />
This spell needs to be raid only.  It needs to be castable in certain zones only.  PERIOD.  Druids will totally replace clerics in XP groups with this.  Without a symbol my tank falls to 5400hp.  CH's are hitting me for 3400.  3400 &gt; 2900 is cleric supremacy?  I don't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rendrac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Then what's your explanation for wizards? They can quadkite, too, solo to 60, and ARE a top raid class. Where's the trade-off? Explain.<br />
<br />
The only people who have a harder time getting into exp groups are necros and mages, and probably paladins too.<br />
<br />
How many bonuses do you get when you invite Joe Wizard into your group, especially under level 50 when you're dealing with ubar leet twinks? You get snare, damage somewhere betwen warriors and paladins, and that's about it. Granted, a wizard on full burn always has and always will do more damage than any rogue, but in order to remain efficient for exp groups, the wizard's damage ability is severely limited.<br />
<br />
Up to level 50, druids get heals, nukes, snares, DoTs, DSes, buffs, and SoW, among other things. In most cases, a druid can get a group simply because they can sow, heal, buff and snare. DSes, nukes and DoTs are usually an aside, but when it comes to efficiency, healing a tank so he can keep taunt so a rogue can do amazing amounts of damage is much more efficient than a nuke or two.<br />
<br />
If the tradeoff isn't apparent to you, then you're more blind than the people screaming that Manaburn needs to be nerfed.<br />

<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, quite a few shamans also are tradeskillers.  So we were following the developments just like everyone else.  Go back and read the texts of the Libers...Its *obvious* that it is druidic in nature.  Painfully obvious.<br />
<br />
Once the quest was solved, the earring that dropped was very nice:<br />
Earring of the Solstice<br />
Wis 5 Int 5 Mana 40 HP 40 all/all no drop recommended level of 35<br />
<br />
When they patched it (and renamed it Xanthe's) You are correct that they changed it to druid only, then immediatly added another earring for non druids.  But to claim that it was 'mistakenly' marked Druid only is silly.  It was a rclick Teleport earring - when has Verant EVER given that ability to other classes (besides wizards)?<br />
<br />
Finally, look at the stats of the 2 earrings:<br />
<br />
Xanthe's Earring of Nature: <br />
AC 5 STR 8, STA 8, WIS 10, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 7, sv cold 7, sv magic 7, recommended level 51, effect: circle of the combines; DRU/ALL, LORE, NO DROP. <br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice: AC 5, STA 5, WIS 8, INT 8, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 5, sv cold 5, sv magic 5, recommended level 51, flowing thought 1, tiny, wt 0.1, ALL/ALL, LORE, NO DROP<br />
<br />
The druid only version gets 8 Str, 3 more Sta, 2 more Wis, and 2 better saves (plus rclick teleport) in exchange for the all/all earring getting 8 Int and FT1.<br />
<br />
Wow, yeah, druids have it rough with these earrings.  The simple fact is - druids can get one of each.  Please show me an earring that I can get with similar stats that costs ~10k??? Even less when I make some of the components myself.<br />
<br />
To everyone else:  didn't mean to spend so much time on a freakin earring rant. :)<br />
<br />
I have the Earring of the Solstice, it's a GREAT earring.<br />
The quest, and the earring is one of the neatest things thats happened in a while.  It was a lot of fun for my guild to get together and make the ingredients for 10 or so earrings.  But to try and deny that one class (out of 14) doesn't have a big advantage with 2 of these earrings is silly.</div></div><hr />

hehehe, I think we got our signals crossed.<br />
I was giving my break down based on the idea that:<br />
&quot;I think 3 class alternates to every game ability (each being lesser than the last) makes sense&quot;<br />
<br />
I meant it to be looked at as things I think SHOULD be in game, not what is live now. (some of it is, some isn't)<br />
I was incorporating the changes on test for my CHeal and Crowd Control ranking.<br />
My bad for not making that more clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want clerics to get better in everything they are not the best in? So on top of being ABSOLUTELY needed for raids you want them to be good soloing, doing trivial and non-trivial mobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, and no.<br />
I would choose to tone down cleric dominance/necessity in raids/high-end groups v. non-trivial mobs, and improve them in other areas.<br />
I would like to do this for ALL classes.<br />

&quot;After Xanthe completed the quest, the new earring was patched in, but it was MISTAKENLY marked druid-only, so VI fixed the problem for all the tradeskillers who had the original Solstice earring. This involved setting up Rebecca Cabbageleaf in an emergency patch. Now, if you can't understand that there was a mistake involved, I can't help you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Finally, look at the stats of the 2 earrings&quot;<br />
&quot;The simple fact is - druids can get one of each.&quot;<br />
<br />
hehe, I agree with Snapdragn.<br />
Making a mistake is one thing, but NOT fixing it baffles me.<br />
I just don't get it that druids get 2 and everyone else gets one, AND the druid only one has better base stats.<br />
<br />
I also don't get Elysian armor either.<br />
The only armor mob in UP that DOESN'T summon, so druids can (and do) farm complete sets for themselves.<br />

<br />
I still think the armor Shaman's can get there is funny. :)<br />

I don't know where Shaman's sit, but as a bard I CAN solo a complete set of Crustacean or Ry'Gor Armor.<br />

With me along of COURSE the druid can keep up on healing!!  The cleric is ALWAYS redundant with a strong shaman in the group, unless the group is fighting super tuff mobs (read: CT, Ssra, Umbral).  The ONLY reason I've taken a cleric in exp groups lately is because I needed 1) extra good healing, 2) high hp buffs, or 3) I expect deaths and rez on tap is handy.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise a druid has already been superior in exp groups to a cleric in my mind.  More options &gt; less options.  <br />
<br />
Clerics need help, this spell emphasizes this disparity.  Druids also needed help in the healing department and God help me, so did I!  As Glori was good enough to point out, me attempting to heal melees on raids is an absolute JOKE unless they are grouped and I can Torpor them (losing damage which may be critical to the success of the fight . . . ).</div></div><hr />

I dont know why people call a 3k heal &quot;cheal&quot;, thats about min health the usual cheal will heal on raids, and ofc c heal can heal up to 7300ish~ <br />
<br />
Because clerics, certainly those around the level that these spells are being tested at (54), know perfectly well what their average CH's are healing for and it ain't a whole lot more than 3k. It might be even less. OK so on a high end raid where a CH chain is needed you still want Clerics in the chain. Not because they will be healing at an average of more than 3k, but for those times when you you have an LD or if there is a BIG spike in damage being done to the tank, you want the 10K heal to make up for that but I don't think it makes sense to consider the balance of a 54 spell with only those kinds of encounters in mind. I look at the amounts that my CH usually heals in exp groups at level 52, landing at anywhere from 20-30% health on average, and the total heal is very rarely more than 3k. Druids are going around crunching numbers as though CH is supposed to land right before the tank falls over ie claiming that a 5k tank will be consistenly healed for 5k by a cleric and 5k is bigger than 3k so what's the problem? That's just not how the spell is used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think a shaman should be making statements like that, unless you really believe that your own class should have a big nerf in some area.</div></div><hr />

Silly me, I thought there was more to a cleric in exp groups than CH.<br />
<br />
There is nothing a cleric can do, other than CH, that a druid can't do better.  Druids get stuns, druids get better DD's, DOT's that effect all types of mobs, better damage shields and similar HP buffs if you don't count symbol.  And if you don't have CH, your max HP is irrelevant anyway as long as you have enough HP to survive a fight.  5khp or 7khp makes no difference vs a shroom in FG.<br />
<br />
If you give Druids a form of CH, there is ZERO reason to bring a cleric along, and clerics really only have one option when it comes to XP gain...grouping.<br />
<br />
So, if you did think there was more to clerics in XP groups, then yes, you are sadly mistaken.  Implement this and there is 0 reason for that class to exist in an XP grind setting out of the harder XP zones (CT, Umbral, Ssra).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Shaman have a slow start and dont really come into their own until later levels. At least untwinked ones dont.<br />
<br />
Against rampart twinking Verant can consequently apply the required levels on items more strictly.<br />
<br />
Never underestimate the power of twinking, and never expect Verant to balance the game so that twinks are challenged. That would be a stupid move indeed, for it forces new players to twink. Bad business decision.<br />
<br />
Fact is druids can do all that stuff with level-appropiate equipment, Shaman cant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Fact is druids can do all that stuff with level-appropiate equipment, Shaman cant.<br />
- Jaundiced Bone armor is way too cheap. Mana pool is irrelevant. JBB is not too expensive. I fail to see where this gear advantage is from druids that allows them to solo untwinked better than shamans. I had crap gear at 50 and I soloed no problem.<br />
<br />
In today's EQ &quot;economy&quot; you can obtain fairly good gear at ridiculously low prices. SBS for 1k? In my time at level 50ish it was 25k. The whole argument that gear allows untwinked druids to solo better than shamans is bullpoop.  Or for that matter any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Different target players, different levels. You are talking about something entirely different than me Zorlac.<br />
<br />
You missed the term level-appropiate (although you made it bold) and you missed the required level part. Jaundice is ridiculously cheap to get and good twink gear. According to the level limit on the right-click, its appropiate level would be 45, though. Talking about wearing Jaundiced at any level below that is already what im talking about.<br />
<br />
So, the economy is messed up because people were playing that game for 3 years already. What exactly has that to do with the design of the classes? Using Mudiflation now as an instrument to discuss class balance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Using Mudiflation now as an instrument to discuss class balance?<br />
- Let's see. Level 20 warrior running around in Funguy Tunic, pair of 12/20 swords, rest is full Cobalt. Do you think this class is balanced and required ANY group? One part of warrior description was: s-hitty soloer, needs group all the time for efficient XP. You think mudflation has no effect on class balance? It has DIRECT effect on it, especially at lower levels.<br />
<br />
That said, as a caster, you don't need to be twinked. You can acquire fairly easy gear for what you need. Especially a shaman for whom mana pool means nothing. I was in black iron armor pieces, gear like Chrysoberyl Talisman and other junk at level 45. All obtained, none twinked. I could solo fine just like a druid can, or wizard, or necro. We are not a gear intensive class. Then I went to dungeons a lot, something a druid can't really do because no one wants him/her, then made more money and got items to trade.<br />
<br />
Again, I fail to see why an untwinked druid soloes better than untwinked shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Agreed Zorlac, but Verant has old players and new players. There are two possibilities. Balancing against Level 20 Warriors with full Cobalt and Fungi, or balancing against Level 20 Warriors with Level-appropiate gear.<br />
<br />
When you balance against the Twinks, groups of non-twinked players will be eaten alive. Lose interest in the game - leave game. When you balance against Newbies, Twinks will move to higher level zones with mobs that con red to them. Now, what is the better solution you think?<br />
<br />
You are talking about the 40s again. Im talking about the twenties. Im talking about banded armor, Im talking about pieces that have either AC or wisdom. Im talking about people that arent spoiled and dont take the power-route for the easiest xp gain. Im talking about people that dont exactly know where the best loot drops, what to buy at what prices. You think they dont exist anymore? I know for certain they do. I met a level 51 Shaman in full banded armor myself. Somebody who just logged in, played her Shaman, logged out. Are equipment guides mandatory know, as well as twink gear?<br />
<br />
Again, I think we are talking about two different things Zorlac. We play Everquest far too long and far to noncasual already that we take certain knowledges for granted.<br />
<br />
And check the Ratio and Resistrates of Shaman-Spells vs Druid spells, the base stats of Shaman Races and Druid Races, as well as the predominant tactics for soloing. Maybe you come to the conclusion that Druids have a higher manapool at the same level, have better damage capacities, have the opinion to snare and root their mobs, giving them more reaction time once root breaks (which doesnt break so often because their dots have no initial damage), have track to pick and choose the appropiate targets for their ventures, and so on. And thats the pre-kiting levels, before the introduction of AE spells. Maybe you see that less armor is less of a problem when the chance that you are being hit is smaller, and more mana efficient spells give you more leeway and faster xpgain. Maybe you dont.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">To the last poster, maybe you ought to read Waters' latest comments on priests before rambling off on something that's your perception and not grounded in their terms of balance.<br />
<br />
If the tradeoff isn't apparent to you, then you're more blind than the people screaming that Manaburn needs to be nerfed.<br />
LOL, oh, you really got me there. First of all, the poster who made the comment about fairness defined what was not fair, and that was solo ability -- quadding -- and wanting to be a top raid class. Going by his own example, wizards aren't &quot;fair&quot; then. <br />
<br />
Nowhere did he mention grouping.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't think it's &quot;fair&quot; for a class to be able to quad - kite with near impunity to 51, continue to have good to above average solo abilities to 60, then want to be one of the top - tier raid classes. There HAS to be some sort of trade off.<br />
Had he mentioned grouping, then that would have helped his argument. Furthermore, the word &quot;trade-off&quot; isn't even a very appropriate term to use, is it? It's a frickin' disadvantage or downside. Nevertheless, Rich Waters just made a statement about priest balancing in which he blatantly says that all priests should have similar value for soloing, grouping, and raiding and that they won't be balanced until this is true. Go read it for yourself on the clerics' forum. <br />
<br />
Shamans are already the model of priest balance except for spell drops, so don't start with the argument on what is fair and what is not. While it's true that shamans and druids can solo very well, that is no reason for them to suck at the other two situations. Moreover, if druids are good at soloing and have group desirability, it doesn't mean they should suck in the endgame for raiding, which they arguably do -- they need the help. <br />
<br />
For a shaman to sit there and complain on this board that another class shouldn't be able to solo, get groups, and be desirable for raids is totally hypocritical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">&quot;RICH WATERS ON CLERIC CHANGES&quot;<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4501<br />
<br />
&quot;NEW CLERIC SPELLS ON TEST&quot;<br />
Hammer of Judgement <br />
Yaulp V <br />
Ethereal Light <br />
Ethereal Elixir <br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/<br />
<br />
These changes coincide with smart game design changes that are going on.<br />
They will provide a break in the game's various bottleneck's (CHeal, Crowd Control, etc.), and give each class added utility in a wider variety of areas in the game.<br />
<br />
VI is reformatting EQ into a basic game design balance.<br />
With each key game ability being spread over a finite number of classes (2-3 it seems like) with each one tiered to provide a different level of that ability (1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3).<br />
Opens up bottlenecks, and (given a 6 person limit per group)provides flexibility to really have some interesting combos.<br />
<br />
Limits like the number of spells/songs one can have memmed at one time, number of people in one group, etc. are key to providing good and varied gameplay.<br />
Scarcity of short term resources combined with abundance of long term resource choices is a great mix.<br />
<br />
I would say the biggest factors in this new move by VI are:<br />
1) smart people at the helm<br />
2) the funding (time, people, and $$) to make the changes<br />
3) maturation of the game, large/active smart player base (that intelligently discusses game issues), active smart designers have provided an understanding what elements are the major play strategy variables in the game.<br />
<br />
Good stuff :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, except for heal over time, group heal, single heal faster/more HP/for less mana. CH is not what makes clerics better exp group healers.<br />
<br />
Druids get stuns<br />
<br />
Perhaps you are referring to Breath of Karana, which has the same resistance problems as many cleric/wizard stuns due to their dual DD/stun nature. Oh and BoK can only be cast outdoors. What an awesome spell!<br />
<br />
...similar HP buffs if you don't count symbol.<br />
<br />
And why exactly would I not count symbol?<br />
<br />
5khp or 7khp makes no difference vs a shroom in FG.<br />
<br />
LOL! People actually GROUP in FG?<br />
<br />
So, if you did think there was more to clerics in XP groups, then yes, you are sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear that. I guess I'll go tell my cleric friends to stop all those things they do other than CH. I'm sure they will appreciate your widsom and start druids immediately. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Quote (random druid)<br />
<br />
 Shamans are already the model of priest balance except for spell drops,<br />
<br />
That's a pretty big &quot; except&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagine if TWO of your CLASS-DEFINING spells were AS RARE and AS EXPENSIVE as Malo and Torpor.<br />
<br />
Druids would be whining, &quot;tactfully-complaining&quot; on their message boards and everywhere else....<br />
<br />
oh wait... <br />
<br />
 so don't start with the argument on what is fair and what is not.<br />
<br />
Druids want:<br />
<br />
1) Top 3 IN solo ability<br />
2) Group DESIREABILITY<br />
3) RAID DESIREABILITY<br />
<br />
Tell me again what the trade off is?<br />
<br />
  While it's true that shamans and druids can solo very well, that is no reason for them to suck at the other two situations. Moreover, if druids are good at soloing and have group desirability, it doesn't mean they should suck in the endgame for raiding, which they arguably do -- they need the help. <br />
<br />
Druids do just fine in groups, I'll take people's words on their Raid problems. <br />
<br />
Personally in groups (yes I grouped with awesome Druid - Courbis on Xev)I like their:<br />
<br />
1) resistance buffs.<br />
2) Regen<br />
3) SLX - series<br />
4) Damage Shield<br />
5) Spot heals<br />
<br />
On raids  tbh once they get me to the zone, after that I don't really care.<br />
<br />
Can't have it all. I suppose the Shaman downside is nerfed spell drops and a crappy class only skill.<br />
<br />
Actually in the new paradigm of EQ &quot;It's not the race to BEAT the MOB it's the race to get TO the MOB&quot;<br />
<br />
Druids are quite useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">What's your point? My mains are the three priest classes. I don't have to imagine anything.<br />
<br />
Clerics and druids have problems getting groups sometimes, but at least druids can leave to solo whereas clerics have a bigger problem doing that. There's nothing wrong with improving that situation.<br />
<br />
Last point, which you don't seem to get: It's called balancing, and that's what the EQ Live is attempting to do before PoP. Priests probably won't turn out equal in all areas, but druids need tuning for raids and clerics need tuning for groups and soloing. Don't deny it. Shamans have all three areas down, so again, what is your problem with clerics and druids wanting a little balance and not being so damn narrowly focused??? <br />
<br />
Sheesh.</div></div><hr />
