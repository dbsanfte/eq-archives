Why do you keep doing this to yourself?  The few times I've met you in-game you were a decent guy, but you continue to act like a child on the boards :/</div></div><hr />

Sure he can be nasty sometimes but seriously - this is a messageboard on the internet. As long as Eduin isnt trying to get your homeaddress so he can come beat you up or steal your money then I dont really care how he writes. If he didnt have a good/intelligent point of view most of the time people wouldnt care at all.<br />
<br />
Sure he made some offensive remarks about people on the monk board but did you see how stupid some of the posts he flamed were?</div></div><hr />

I ran into eduin a few times on TM.  He is a very unique person to say the least.   All in all, you cant help but like the guy.</div></div><hr />

****<br />
<br />
Anyone who takes anything written on a messageboard about an on-line game personally has bigger issues to wrestle with.  Not a Faern original )<br />
<br />
If Bodi pays for this board then it is his cyber-sandbox. He sets the rules. You want your own message board? Go buy one, set one up, etc etc. You want to play in his sandbox you abide by his rules. He can be as arbitrary as he wants.<br />
<br />
OTOH, censorship due to &quot;offensive&quot; language, material etc is a slippery slope. What one person finds offensive another may shrug off.<br />
<br />
Personally I find all Iksar offensive in the extreme and wish you would get together along with Halflings and Gnomes.<br />
<br />
So that one nuke would wipe you all out.<br />

<br />
He was right quite a bit of the time... he was also wrong fairly often.  The problem was he stated his &quot;opinions&quot; as absolute fact and flamed the hell out of anyone that said differently.<br />

Some people will wade through a pile of **** to find a quarter, but most of us don't bother.</div></div><hr />

I thought his leaving (along with Sam) was a very bad thing for the level of conversation.<br />
<br />
Whats really funny is we have different people making the same flames now, the only difference is they are more circumspect in their attacks.<br />

I much prefer Ed's brutal honesty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'll say this for eduin - I always read his posts, and almost invariably laughed and shook my head in wonder that people would get so riled up by him. He's very good at baiting people and he's also very persuasive. <br />
<br />
If you didn't know to not take him seriously I can see how you could be constantly offended. My theory on Eduin is either he views himself as some sort of wronged, too-inteligent-for-his-own-good martyr who's trying to spread the truth, or he's just a troll having a good chuckle about all the controversy he manages to raise. Never met the guy so I only know his msg board persona.<br />
<br />
Wonder what msg board he'll get asked to leave next. <br />

<br />
Nothing said in this thread is anywhere near as bad as most &quot;Eduinism&quot;.. so cry me a river, build a bridge and get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The trouble with Eduin is that both his barrels are on a hair-trigger, so even though he does unload on clueless nitwits who deserve it, he also unloads equally on people who don't in situations when he is actually wrong about something. I love to read his posts on various boards because they are usually both true and entertaining, but when he gets in a pissing contest with someone over an oversight on his part, it just makes you want to smack him.<br />
<br />
And his brutal, often rude delivery is a great filter for responses. People who can't handle stark honesty or controversy have nothing to contribute to a serious discussion anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gotesblud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I miss Eduin's posts. He made a lot of good points, albeit in one of the most confrontational and in-your-face manners I've seen. Since he was suspended (and subsequently stopped posting here) I think this board lost a little bit of color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I didn't  care much for Sam and Eduin.  But I have to admit, they were probably the single biggest factor in getting most shaman to even begin to believe that AC was more important than wisdom.<br />
<br />
Would I want to see him back?  Not really.  As i've come to notice with a lot of super-smart people in real life, Intelligence != (does not equal) wisdom and maturity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Didn't he predict doom and gloom for this board when he left?</div></div><hr />

He's right many of the time.<br />
<br />
But the way he speaks... gawd<br />
<br />
&quot;That's idiotic opinion&quot;<br />
&quot;listen up moron&quot;<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
His opinion is ok, but no reason to start out with flame. :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brisbanoch G'Alagrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Eduin, you mean the guy that endorsed Dex as the most important stat to help facilitate channeling? The one that called anyone that disputed him a moron? The one that got shot down repeatedly by parsed logs and data over his personal opinion?<br />
<br />
That guy?<br />
<br />
Yeah, big loss to the community. <br />
<br />
He knew how to flame, He occasionally was right (no more than most other prominent shaman) and he acted like a spoiled kid just out of reach of repercussions. He set about trying to be a jackass, and accomplished it. If you admire him for that, so be it.<br />
<br />
Most adults don't.</div></div><hr />

In his defense though the backlash flaming posts were almost always prompted by someone saying he's just a dumb**** etc etc. Most deserved it some did not.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Amazing how ungrateful folks can be /eye Morbad. <br />

I wish Bodi would spend more time having fun, raiding and leveling up than spending a good deal of his time in game researching quests for the guides on Monkly Business. But for some reason he seems to enjoy doing it, I guess some people must appreciate the effort.</div></div><hr />

Eduin, you mean the guy that endorsed Dex as the most important stat to help facilitate channeling? <br />
<br />
that was a LONG time before he left (about the time he wrote Shaman: King of Fighters iirc)  <br />
<br />
edit: yes it was here is an excerpt<br />
<br />
from Eduin's Shaman Article on Eqlizer<br />
To finish (and therefore not really a summary) a few words on stats. The Shaman needs two. Wisdom, for mana and Dexterity, for channelling.<br />
<br />
Most casters don’t realise the importance of Dexterity to channelling. Shaman, who have a good dexterity buff at higher levels see it plainly. When you add 40 to your Dex, your ability to cast through hits rises dramatically. For a battle mage this is vital, you must be able to cast DoTs and DD through two or three hits. With high Dexterity you can.<br />
<br />
For any new Shaman the recommendation I would make for the bonus points is 25 to Wisdom and 5 to Dexterity.<br />
<br />
However, and this is theory, for a twinked Shaman. I would suggest 25 Dexterity and lots of plus Wisdom items as the twink. Why? Well plus Wisdom items also tend to add mana as a bonus over and above the mana that the Wisdom adds anyway. Dexterity items don’t?<br />
<br />
http://eqlizer.net/eq/new/class/shamankof.shtml<br />
<br />
Reading through the article again (its written from a 1 to 50 perspective) I don't see a whole lot I disagree with other than the dex mistake.  You'll also notice he recommends 25wis and 5 dex and said someone with a twink MIGHT want to try 25dex and 5 wis as an EXPERIMENT.<br />
<br />
If you changed that to 25 wis and 5sta I think its a damn good guide for a newb shaman.<br />
<br />
too bad the old boards aren't available anymore so I can find the Shamans who post now and believed some pretty strange things at one time or another :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm in the same guild as Eduin and he's a very good player, IF he wants. I almost always disagree with his behaviour, but he knows more about the game (especially as Shaman AND Monk) then most of all players ever will.<br />
<br />
You can like him or not, but more often then not he's right in what he's saying. Not so clever people will then just overlook his good points and start flame him, and I really think that's what gave him the most enjoyment of posting on the message boards.<br />
<br />
Funny anectode:<br />
One time in guildchat he suddenly came up with the idea that no melees but those that should taunt should get a strength buff. As more strength gives more possible damage, therefor more possible taunt no melees should be strength buffed as it decreases the relative taunt factor of the maintank. Well a few days later he had to ask if anyone could remember the idea he had because he forgot :P<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I'm bored with all messageboards and all the new equipment or aa exp threads I wish he'd still post here as whenever he posts something not much later someone will jump the train and start a flamewar with very weak arguments. Shame though he doesn't recognize those on the same level as him, would make him even more valuable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gotesblud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I remember reading that guide WAYYYYYY back, and finding it accorded pretty well with things I'd picked up along the way as well.<br />
<br />
 A few things were wrong with it (like the &quot;Dex helps Channeling&quot; thing -- which was probably a rumor started by the EQ manual) but overall, it was a very good guide for its time, imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it makes you feel better, I've found him annoying since he was in Unseelie Court or whatever small guild he was in.</div></div><hr />
