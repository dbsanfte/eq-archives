I mean he really doesn't need to stick his head out so far, its not a race! Looks like he's trying to win by his nose or something.</div></div><hr />

I saw that animation today and I immediately thought it looked like I was pretending to be a bull charging a matador. Didn;t see anyone with a red cape though.<br />
<br />
Also, look at your sideburns and facial hair when you move forward and backward... Get a chuckle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ssshhhhh please, I don't care about the quality of the new animations: I just don't want to have to download another set of files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it suck, it look like you are ducking while running; or like some running at football/rugby game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dunno what you guys are talking about, barbies run the same way they have for the last 4 years. :p<br />
<br />
It could be me, but the new Iksar animations don't look much better either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got entered into a contest against my will...They stood me up tall, they pointed at me and said <br />
<br />
&quot;You MUST walk, everywhere you go! Not run, Walk.  But you must walk VERY fast!&quot;<br />
<br />
You must suffer the endless tells of people saying, &quot;Do you know you are walking?&quot;  &quot;Do you know you look like you have a corncob stuck someplace very uncomfortable?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's what my poor female barbarian went thru last night. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, my female Barb walks REALLY, REALLY fast now...lol...<br />
<br />
Gert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can sympathize with what your going through, Gildanni.  One of our guild leaders is a female barbarian and ended up being the butt of all our jokes last night.  Well, she started it. *grins* I thought she looked like she was trying to run with a book balanced on her head, but I like your corncob description much better. Thankfully I rather like the way my kitty runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">naagruz , perhaps you missed the patch yesterday afternoon as there was a new patch few hours after to correct some issues.<br />
<br />
all i can tell you is when my barbarian shaman starts to run...  his beard runs refore him :) the movement the kilt does would belong to an XXX rated movie and you don't even wanna see how the legs are moving..  curved to the outside :(  (you know... like a cowboy who would have stayed too long on his horse)<br />
<br />
should have taken a pic :) .. but that was so awfull i didn't even wanted to waste space on my HD for that :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Corncob + female barbarians = german p0rn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">new animations for running look horrible imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Horsefeathers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I petitioned it, and did /feedback, and said from now until we are &quot;Fixed&quot;, I'm gonna ride my horse....it's too embarassing to be seen walking.  At least only a few friends and guild members saw me ;p  Well, not to mention everyone in PoK that was around the PoT stone, and those in PoT that saw me when I ran...err walked really fast, to PoN..<br />
<br />
My character is married to the guild leader, and I had asked him in a tell what he looked like running.  He said he runs, but wth is up with him chasing his beard? *laughs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sylino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehe, I escaped the new animations at first by not checking the &quot;Luclin&quot; package download in the patch program (Advanced button), but I just had to see for myself...<br />
<br />
All I can say is &quot;Hahahahahahaha&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kyylie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I swear i'm almost running on all fours now. Hell that would almost be cool =P But I really, really miss the sexy butt wiggle that most of the females had when they walked.<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to /feedback and get the butt wiggle as well as all the old run/walk animations back and tell them to fix the real problems like the retarded 2hb animation and /dance which has always been lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Is there really a bunch of coders at SOE slapping themselves on the back and going: &quot;oh yeah, look at that sweet Barby run!&quot;? Did they even look at the animations before they put them live? How can they consider this an improvement?<br />
<br />
I didn't think it was possible, but these are worse than the originals. Maybe the coders are all thinking: &quot;You want something to complain about? I'll give you something to complain about!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe they should go outside once in a while so they'd see how real people move and try to emulate that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">anyone know the file name?<br />
<br />
I wanna see it but i dont wanna be stuck with it =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yep,   beard comes 6 inches off my face like eyeballs in a cartoon  and my shield does a 180 and my arm sticks through it.  H O R R I D ! ! ! <br />
<br />
Dont know what else they did  but Aary seemed to be having sexual relations with all the other named in ToV.  H ewas doing the in place run thing on top of Lory Vy for almost 2 hours.   We realized he was there by looking through the wall when you stand right in it.   A monk managed to get close enough to redirect and him and ran all the way over to the other dragon on the opposite side(cant remember his name).  Maybe the new animations pissed him off too???</div></div><hr />

------------------------- <br />
<br />
We apologize for this second download today, however, incorrect versions of these animation files were sent in the transition between test and live. <br />
<br />
We hope to have this matter straightened out in the next couple days, and will likely tweak a couple animations due to the community's reaction while we're at it. <br />
<br />
Once you've finished downloading, everything should be as it was before today with the exception of Dwarven Males and Gnomish Females. Those will not automatically revert if you updated EverQuest earlier today. <br />
<br />
If you wish to revert those characters by hand, please delete the following two files from your EverQuest directory: <br />
<br />
GLOBALDWM_CHR2.s3d <br />
GLOBALGNF_CHR2.s3d <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for all of your feedback! <br />
