<br />
for some reason since the last patch, our group stat buffs (brute, cat, raptor, rhino) no longer over write the single 50+ less single versions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I haven't experienced that yet, because I haven't tried, however, single Focus has overwritten Group Focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im pretty sure this happened before this patch.</div></div><hr />

Single target STA/AGI/etc... haven't ever been overwritten by their group Counterparts that I can remember.  It's always been a nuisance when that one latecomer comes asking me for RH instead of brute, then later I refresh brute and it doesn't take on one person.   Hence, why the lazy shaman just casts Brute on everyone since it's not THAT much more mana to cast it anway. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Group versions never have overwrited singletaget versions except for Regrowth, but I haven't tried G Focus.<br />
<br />
I started to think some about this. I think I will give old stat buffs to latecomers next time. They gotta be overwritten right?<br />
<br />
Mind if I use same Signature image Fatsow? I absolutely loved that image.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Talisman of the Brute has never overwritten Riotous Health. I don't know about the other group stat buffs, I never use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gfocus overrites the single and visa versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">my experience also<br />
<br />
grp agi/sta/etc does not overwrite single version.  Never has for me.<br />
<br />
grp focus overwrites single target focus<br />
single target focus overwrites grp focus<br />
<br />
I noticed that grp SoW overwrites single target SoW now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye group sow and group focus are the only group buffs I have that overwrite single target versions of the spell.  This could have something to do with the fact that RH lasts about 25 minutes longer than Brute.  That's annoying too.  Why not just make the group version equal or slightly better on all fronts, make it overwrite, and be done with it?  <br />
It worked with Gfocus, so why not with Gstam?<br />
<br />
When a warrior or monk asks for &quot;stam&quot; I just give them RH.  They'll likely be dead before it has a chance to wear off them anyway.  Sad but true.  <br />
Rangers as well heh.  SKs dont die often, neither do pallies.  Pallies of the 60th level sort I find to be immensely helpful in keeping the group alive, as they cast that nifty 580 point group heal when a major fight is going on with AE.  That helps quite a bit.  Rangers I put in the same class as rogues.  They are there to bow crit and stuff and do dmg.  Their spell help are preparation only (+attack, + AC), and they can't offer much support while the thing is happening.  SKs are just low maintenance.  You let em alone and they do their thing.  <br />
<br />
Rogues and monks are hard to keep alive sometimes.  Rogues get on the rampage list and get hammered.  Monks too.  My solution for this is TORPOR.  Tho they hate it, I torpor em and it moves them down on the aggro list quite swiftly.  If they bitch too much, I just let them die next time.  They get the message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">something i believe is new:grp sow wont stack with dance of the blade.<br />
well, stacks as in, click of dance, cast sow and youre fine, but this means you'll need to keep grp sow up at all times if you want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yep, you are right Blacklace.<br />
<br />
If DotB is up first, then our grp sow won't stack over it.<br />
If grp sow is up first, DotB stacks over it just fine.<br />
<br />
I group with a bard everyday and this has been the case for about 2 weeks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Group versions never have overwrited singletaget versions except for Regrowth <br />
nah same with regrowth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suzail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">must be that, ive never come accross it before then, a bit stupid when the group buffs are better lol, anyway i emailed verant about it, maybe they will fix it you never know.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">think its a left over from the times when the group buffs gave you less of a stat raise than the single target versions of the spell...    maybe they will fix it some day<br />
