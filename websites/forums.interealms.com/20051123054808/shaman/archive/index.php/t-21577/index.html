You take down your main and go running after his chicken friend.... round a corner and he is standing there waiting with like 6 of his friends. Doh!<br />
<br />
This happens often to my poor martial arts melee. Usually it ends ok with me taking down 2 more and then running for my freeking life... but it just sucks to know a computer got you as you round the corner....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've found that if you pick up taunt/provoke and use it as they're running off, they'll usually turn right back around and attack you again.  I use that to stop runners constantly with my tanker (running thugs are the bane of my CoH existence ;)).  Always makes me laugh, because I have this image of Tezrian (the ultra-cool-headed cop) yelling some 'Yo' mama' joke at the guy and pissing him off.<br />
<br />
On another note, I think it's cool that they run off to their friends.  That *is* the intelligent thing to do, after all.  It's another of those little things that I think are really cool about the game. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go for a Spines scrapper. They have Impale, which is a ranged attack, and quite a good one.<br />
<br />
The other thing to consider is that runners will (almost always) come back to be hit again. Also, they do NOT share aggro with other groups. They can run through 400 of their fellows, and none of those will come after you because of it. It isn't like EQ where a runner = a death train.</div></div><hr />
