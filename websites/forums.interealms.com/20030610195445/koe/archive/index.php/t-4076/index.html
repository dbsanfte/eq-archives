<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, quick question.  If say, I had written a whole big long thing, and all of a sudden it's gone - I am assuming i hit alt-d somehow, no clue how that stuff could have dissappeared.<br />
<br />
writing this on another computer, so the place where it was written is untouched.<br />
<br />
I would like to ask if anyone knows of a way to get that stuff back, so another hour or more of writing is not necessary.<br />
<br />
Anyone have suggestions pls - I can't seem to find an Undo button.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am assuming you mean that you were filling in a form on a web site, and maybe you hit the escape key, and all of your text poofed.  I have done this so many times it is unbelieveable (thanks to heavy use of the vi text editor in unix) and someone told me I could do CTRL-Z to undo my escape key.  So this might be too late for you, J, but for anyone who has lost their entire post by hitting the wrong key, try hitting CTRL-Z and it should all come back.<br />
<br />
***NOTE*** Had to edit, I said ALT-Z at first, I lied, it is CTRL-Z. :D</div></div><hr />
