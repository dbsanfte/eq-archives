<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We continue our assault on the ToFS. <br />
<br />
Usual meet spot is the Gnoll camp at about 7 CST.<br />
<br />
Level range is 29 to 40. Talk to me if you think you should be an exception. <br />
<br />
We will form up and see how far up we can go. Due to a lack of healers last week, we were restricted to the 2nd floor, but I would like to get to the 3rd and get some more keys for 4. <br />
<br />
I believe the patch will be in and it should result in no more hell levels!<br />
<br />
In game contacts are Calon/Klydon and Griss/Bearan. <br />
<br />
See you then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey Kly..got a now 31 monk and also some non-guildie friends that are interested in coming..let me know if that's a problem!<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Kly,<br />
<br />
this quarter is DONE after tonight:)...so if you guys could use the company of a level 32 druid for a little extra healing power or whatever I'd be happy to attend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, this event is a bit different in that it is open to all who have been invited or checked in. (This is usually limited to people who have been invited by a guild member, but includes petitioners, friends, etc). <br />
<br />
We just take whoever shows up, form up the best groups we can and have at it for 3 hours or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wanted to say I was sorry about last night. I had some RL events which kept me from being able to log on</div></div><hr />
