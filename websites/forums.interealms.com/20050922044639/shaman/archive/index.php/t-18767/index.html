<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any duo suggestions for a 65 pally w/ &lt; ToV gear and a 65 sham almost full ornate? I know we could duo HoH, but wouldn't have the dps needed for BoT. Looking for suggestions, not wanting to add another class except maybe if we have runner problems.</div></div><hr />

This should really be relocated to the hunting forums, but I would suggest any of the common 65 solo grounds.<br />

PoTactics, in particular, would likely be good loot and exp, as would droga.  You mentioned HoH, and I would think the undead there would be easy pickings.  If the shammie has bane and/or anethema and epic, you might also look into Veksar undeads; the only real difference from solo'ing would be that you would kill stuff 3 times faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You aren't going to find anywhere with better xp than HoH without several more flags.  Tactics is nice too.  I can't really see going anywhere else if it's xp you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Found CoD to be almost as good as Tactics tbh. Depends on the camp you get in the latter, but I often duo with a 65 paladin and once we're into the undead in CoD it's Slay Away time. SU3+FA+SLTW does some fairly meaty damage to those mobs.</div></div><hr />
