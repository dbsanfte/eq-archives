<br />
I know its not good to start asking for advice with post no 1 .-) But i have been reading this board more or less since i started my shaman 4 years ago. Just came back from EQ2 (no flames please .-)) and reactivated my Accounts. <br />
To my problem: I am playing a 61 Barb Shaman 2.5khp  3.8k manna unbuffed (magelo to come) and a 58 Monk 3.1k hp 31% haste baz geared like the Shammy.  Where to hunt with those both ? Been fighting on Oceancrasher, Luggald Caves, GE  etc. <br />
My idea was to keep the Shammy on 100% AA as the monk lvls up. <br />
Maybe i could tripple a 65 Chanter or 59 Druid to speed it up, but my experiences with both classes are very poor ... and then trippling might lead to chain dieing ;)<br />
<br />
Being from Europe the population on my Server is kinda low (at my playtimes), i skip dboxing for any group i could get (its an mmporg).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and i hope i could edit my magelos in when the updater is running again.</div></div><hr />
