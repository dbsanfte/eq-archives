<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>barmanham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just sold my Fungi tunic to get Torpor BAH but anyways I have no fungi or epic just jbb just lookin for a place with good solo exp Also have another question I need to kill Neh'ahirr and Lord Rak'ashir for my epic and its done anyone have any idea how many people classes I need to do both these guys thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can do them both with one group.  But if you can put that group together, why solo for xp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Friend of mine just did 59 in Permafrost at bear pits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I solo katta guards and in bw in 59. Xp is little better in katta but i find loot much better in bw. Thing i like about bw is mobs are easy as hell and never that hard to find pull. I gave up on looking for solely blue mobs and just kill anything thats not green. I get about mini bub every 3 hours in bw and bout every 2 and half hours in katta. Thats with my crap gear im sure with epic and stuff xp be faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Solo through 59?  Why?<br />
Go find people, group, get exp.. have fun!   Soloing is the most monotonous, boring, fastest path to burnout I've ever experienced.<br />
<br />
Go hit OS, Velks, Akheva, Grey.. somewhere.. bring a few friends and go to town.  Best exp I ever got in one night was about 1.5yellow in 59 in Velks.<br />
<br />
if you are intent on soloing (will take you 2-3x longer that way and bore you to tears) try:<br />
<br />
Permafrost bears/spiders/wolves(90% full blue at 59)<br />
Umbrous Toilers in ME <br />
Akheva aliens<br />
The Grey (just about anywhere but shissar revenants are the easiest)<br />
CoM skyway mobs (can be a pain to break up there solo) or pull goos down from the goo courtyard.<br />
KC basement (nice undead that don't run)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For fast xp in 59, find a 58-59 melee who also wants 60 fast and duo. Don't bother with outside zones, at least in old world/kunark/velious, go dungeons all the way for the zone bonuses. Don't know much about SoL for xp though, heard FG and the grey are good, yet to hunt there in earnest outside of raids/exploring.<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time in chardok from solo to full groups in 59, mainly because it was quieter than a lot of the xp dungeons, good loot and nice variety of mobs, I just like the place. I could solo zone in/out at 59 single pulls, or top ramp (the tunnel you lev into). You cannot single pull from gatehouse at 59 reliably so be warned, though I would tell nervous 'enchanterless' groups that I could then just CC everything ;)<br />
<br />

<br />
For Rak, I took 8 people -I found a rak up outside castle when I popped into CoM on the offchance (goin to seb), and just grabbed what friends I could. I was unguilded at the time so don't give up hope heh.<br />
<br />
My Rak force in the end was:<br />
<br />
me (58 at the time)<br />
56 cleric<br />
51 cleric<br />
57 mage<br />
55 mage<br />
51 mage<br />
52 enchanter<br />
60 ranger<br />
<br />
I just positioned one mage pet where I wanted rak to be pushed to, then handed the tear, got aggro, had first mage assist and moved rak to where I wanted him, then had the other 2 mages assist. Ranger let rip with trueshot when rak was at 70, then ran in and tanked him at the end. Fight was complete overkill (about 6mins), though I would suggest 2 mage pets to be safe in case of LD. <br />
<br />
If you need to reposition rak mid fight, ID then sit, and run to where ya want him after he summons you ;) I had about 2800hp with myself and 56 cleric buffs, was runed for hand in and took 2 immolates and lived to loot scale.<br />
<br />
If you have to open castle and kill reavers to get rak then just add a rogue and FD puller to the above group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NukuUnu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good place to solo is chardok exit. There is like 10 mobs there on 22 min timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Soloing sux.<br />
<br />
And it's not really faster, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are people who don't have 4 hour chunks to devote to the game and only to the game every night, for these people soloing is a great option.  For me, oftentimes being glued to the screen all night is not an option, and joining groups just to go AFK for long stretches every half-hour or so is just plain rude, so I solo a lot during those times.  When I do have a fairly uninterrupted stretch for gaming, I usually raid.<br />
<br />
I never found it to be particularly boring.  What makes EQ fun is the other people, and /gu and /tell work just as well when you are soloing.  The new chat channels make it even better.  Of course, any one kind of playing (solo, group, raid) gets boring for me if I do it too much.<br />
<br />
Also the xp is just plain faster solo than most grouping (not duoing), especially if you have any amount of set-up time. (log on, kill kill kill, log off vs log on, LFG, beg for port to another dungeon, LFG, get group, get to camp, leave as soon as you get there when 3 people have to log...). Even without that factor, a 6 person group is going to have to kill about 5x as many mobs to get the same xp over time as a soloist.  In lots of places, the soloist can sustain a kill rate of a mob every 2 minutes, but not many places can support a group killing a mob every 12 seconds without running out of mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to what this shaman actually asked.  At 59 I had very good luck in these 2 places:<br />
<br />
Katta is very very good xp, rarely camped, easy to go AFK if you gotta.  Easy.  No loot.<br />
<br />
SolB imps/freeti.  Harder, chance at decent loot (GEBs), stay on your toes.  I don't know that this camp would have been viable for me at 59 without fungi/epic, but you might be better than I am :)</div></div><hr />

...got an interesting death story to share with you when you login this weekend Uggok.  :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Soloing in 59 with no fungi or epic.   Well, I was 59 with no epic not so long ago and I found I could not solo at the same rate I could get exp in a group.   If you do have time to get in a group I really would try that.   If not, well, I would recommend HS, perma or solb I guess.  Perma can be exciting.. and it's fun to go whack Vox if you get in trouble.   <br />
