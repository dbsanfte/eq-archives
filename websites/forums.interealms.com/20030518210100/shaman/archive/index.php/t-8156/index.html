<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ragnhild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did exe when I was 61, but that was right after PoP came out.  There are some beneficial spells at 61 that help out, but I don't believe that you have to have those to pass the trial.<br />
<br />
I had AE slow and AE rain up as well as the 61 nuke.  AE slow off the bat and have dogdog assist the MA.  The first 3 rounds I did AE slow, AE rain and nuked.  The 4th round I just did ae slow and cann'd waiting for the boss to spawn.<br />
<br />
Your gear is fine for trials, you shouldn't be worried about that at all.<br />

<br />
I have yet to pass, but only tried 2 times.  First time I did AE slow, and Icestrike's with dogdog.<br />
<br />
We made it to second wave.<br />
<br />
Second time, I redid my memmed spell list.  Loaded both AE Rains, and Icestrike.  <br />
<br />
Stand right next to the MA, and AE slow HIM.  Then cast both AE Rain on HIM.  Heal yourself, and canni for next fight.<br />
<br />
We got to the end of third wave, and a nuker got aggro and mob ran across room, so we ran out of time.<br />
<br />
Was fun though, cant wait to go back.</div></div><hr />
