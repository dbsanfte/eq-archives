<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Over at the Safehouse Onetree, one of admins of Magelo, posted (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=28443.topic) about Maeglo being down:<br />
<br />
Magelo is currently down. An increasing number of IO errors on the application server's hard disk drive forced it down. Couldn't be helped. Jelan is also away on travel (in Geneva last he told me). Still, I'm sure he's working on it best he can.<br />
<br />
Folks, please be patient while services are restored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to be a combination of a couple things.<br />
<br />
1) i think alot of people where hitting the server hard.<br />
<br />
2) he posted on the website that it was rebuilding some caches on the server side and it would be slow till that was done.<br />
<br />
The 2 effects together seemed to make it pretty much unusable for me last night altho it was usable altho a little slow this morning.</div></div><hr />
