<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what a good path is to take regarding AA's , meaning progressivly what skills should i buy in what order and to what skill.. any suggestions would be great thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First tell us your play style. Do you solo or group? Do you raid a lot or are you a more casual player? What kind of weapons do you use? What level are you and how many, if any, AA skill do you have...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To answer your question viken, lvl 53 now almost 54, and have 2 AAs, for now i am only doing normal exp because it seems more important at my lvl.  I originally did 2 AAs just to see how quickly exp moved.  Both those AAs are unspent as part of the reason i came here to ask this question.  As for my play style, as of now I duel wield, and intend to do so till 59 when I am definetly going to pick up EQ/AM3, maybe before I hit 60, that i know.  I much rather prefer to raid then exp grind, however lately I have find myself doing that more.  So, I hope that I answered your questions sufficiently so that you could give me some advice.<br />
<br />
Also curious if you think AA's are not as important as leveling, as I have previously thought?  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Gee, and then I even noticed they are sticky at the top of this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">mage i did see those posts, and they weren't exactly what i was looking for, so id still appreciate any adivse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well my experience with AA's is that they don't really significantly impact your play style or relative power until you get into the Class aa's.  <br />
<br />
The 3 more hp regen might be noticable &lt;55 and chloro, but after that it's not really a noticable increase.  Runspeed 3 helps in dungeons and getting around in raids.  All the other options in general are pretty worthless.  <br />
<br />
As for Archtype... Crits are neat, but maybe give you an extra 100-200 damage a fight total.  Nothing to write home about.  (with CF1)  Mental Clarity 1 is marginally noticable, but if your paying to KEI to solo anyway, it's kinda pointless.  10 extra mana a minute isnt gonna save the world.    Basically all the archtype skills are like this.  The first level is marginally useless.  The 3rd level is marginally useful.  Natural Durability is the major exception to this.  First level is good, and 3rd level is great.<br />
<br />
As for class skills of course they're really good.  But as for getting them while your still 59, I don't really see this as a good idea.  Theres a significant power increase for rangers at 60 with WP, weaponshield, call of predator, etc.  If you can't xp in PoV, then just stay 60 and get class AAs.<br />
<br />
The most efficient method of advancement is Level to 60 or even 65, then AA until the cows come home.  But do it however you want to make the game interesting and fun in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Linara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As for your first 2 AA points, I would sink them into innate runspeed.<br />
<br />
For any indoor situation runspeed is a a lifesaver.  Infact, I might almost recommend getting run3 before moving on with your leveling.<br />
Once you hit 60 you can do 2 different things.   You can finish off your leveling or move to aa.<br />
<br />
The aa grind to am3 eq is pretty intense.  If you plan on using your bow exclusively for groupping/raiding, I would recommend this aa path.<br />
run3, regen3, combat fury3, EQ, AM3, Innate Camo<br />
<br />
If you plan on mixing up melee with archery for damage, put combat fury off to the side and invest in Natural Durability instead.<br />
<br />
I can't say for certain which path will be faster, levels or AA.  That's something that you will have to decide.  I went on long exp runs right before PoP came out so I wouldn't have to make this decision.  If I had to, I'd prolly level 60 then go straight for am3/eq, then get 65 then work on the rest.<br />
<br />
Happy Grinding :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would put both your unspent AA into run speed then forget about AA until you hit 60. Once you hit 60 you then have to re-evaluate whether is better to level to 65 or start AA. Either way you have a lot of work to do before thinking about AA points.</div></div><hr />
