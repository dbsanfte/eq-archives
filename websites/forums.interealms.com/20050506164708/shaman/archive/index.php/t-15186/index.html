<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone tried getting on a boat lately. I tried to get on the boat to OOT from Faydwer and I fell right through it into the water. I swam out, ran up on the dock and tried to run onto the boat, and fell through again. <br />
Anyone else experience anything like this lately ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You mean the boats are actually stopping at the docks again?<br />
<br />
Shortly after they &quot;fixed&quot; pathing issues I was camping AC for my Cleric. Was a real pain in the ass when I realized the path had changed and the boat from Freeport went straight through the zone without stopping at Sister Isle.<br />
<br />
It sounds like they fixed one problem only to introduce another. Typical I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They now have &quot;translocators&quot; at the various docks.  Just hail them and say the key words that pop up and they whisk you off to where you need.  Very convenient.<br />
<br />
Before they put them up along the Qeynos/Erud's Crossing/Erudin route I took some amusing Screenshots of the boat wandering randomly through the island before finally going on to Erudin.  And I still had to swim to shore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The boats have been buggy since release and don't seem to be on the &quot;fix-it&quot; list.  With PoK ports they might as well add some stones and mothball the boats.<br />
<br />
I had the great experience of having the IC boat 10K me while splitting my corpse into separate parts.  It took the GM over an hour to find both sections and get my equip back. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought they pulled the translocators when the boats started running again? I haven't seen any of them, but then again I never did. Where are they located exactly? I've been on several docks and never saw a single one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">God I hate the boats!! LONG LIVE THE TL GNOMES!!! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There was a translocator at the Butcherblock docks a couple of days ago, right where you would normally get on the boat.  Way WAY more convenient than that boat ever was.<br />
Abani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of course you have to keep in mind that the boats were not about convenience to begin with.  They really add to the sense of the world being &quot;big&quot;.  I love PoK, but there was nothing cooler than the first time I found my way through the sewers of FP to wait nervously before swimming out to catch the boat.<br />
<br />
Remember it taking an hour and a half or more to go from G. Fay to Toxx (assuming no deaths) before anyone was high enough level to port you around?? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I say leave the boats in for those that want to use them. But for please leave the TLers in =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The boats from Qeynos to Erudin on Brell are f'ed up.  They are on top of each other, but they are moving in a way that causes you to slide backwards on them because you keep getting pushed from one to the other as they move forward.  If you stay on them too long without running forward, you fall off the back.  That, and the pathing is messed up too.  They go right through the inside of that island in Erud's Crossing.  You see the mast and sails above the ground a bit and have to run over the land to get onto the boats on the other side to make it to Erudin.</div></div><hr />
