<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just so everyone knows, Sebilis was nerfed.<br />
<br />
Specifically, NG camp.  The scarabs now drop items once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
This may be an inadvertant nerf (they've happened before), but it may not be, given how on some servers people camp NG 24/7.<br />
<br />
Heh, now I have to find a new place to come for an hour or two and earn 2k plat...Droga maybe.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ill check it out :)<br />
<br />
Hope not, we shall see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You had to see this coming sooner or later.  When there is a good cash camp it will be nerfed.  They finally nerfed PoG to the point where no one goes there anymore so you had to see Seb being next.  The vision right now is not to farm in these areas, it is to play LNoD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just seen another thread that suggests that this is the case. Was at jail camp with the Iksar Necros and made 800pp in 70 - 90 mins, that was with a JB helm (333pp) and silver etched warhammer (171pp) dropping.<br />
<br />
Guess ill have to change my bind point lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Might wanna try doing Karnors. Theres a fair amount of nameds that drop the semi-sucky kunark armor that can be sold off for 300-400 pp to vendors, if you insist on farming lowlevel stuff for cash. Otherwise theres always hillgiants ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Inner Acrylica is the spot to go to farm cash or go to Dulak. With Inner Acrylica, you should at least get some exp and a few nice drops if the named spawn. i have had the sage spawn in at least 8-10 hours of camping there and only had the HP once and the Archanist twice. But i still can manage to make 4-5k in a few hours in vt and selling acrylica on my trader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can confirm the nerf.  4 hours at ng... 1500pp in the end, bugger was I pissed that my unwind area yields 1/4 of what it did.</div></div><hr />
