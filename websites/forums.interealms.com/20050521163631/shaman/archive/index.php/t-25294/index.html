<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Copied this from the message on the eqlive forums that I posted a few minutes ago.  Thought maybe someone here might be able to answer it:<br />
<br />
Alright, have a few questions about this subject.  I did not see a thread on it, but I did not seach much so if it's already been posted somewhere then I apologize. <br />
 <br />
Background, my shaman has his time key, as well as access to all elementals before today (as well as he's level 70)<br />
 <br />
Here's the deal, upon entering PoTranquility on my shaman, I received this message<br />
 <br />
[Sat Dec 18 02:14:12 2004] You have entered The Plane of Tranquility.<br />
[Sat Dec 18 02:14:12 2004] The cipher on your arm glows for a moment as the words of the history fill your mind.  The knowledge you have gained now grants you access to the planes of the Elemental Gods.<br />
 <br />
Now, this isn't a big deal for me, since I have access already to the elementals.  The problem lies in the fact that my beastlord did not get this message when I entered him into Tranquility.  My beastlord is currently flagged for time, and for earth/water/air, but has not done anything in sol ro for those flags.  So, I am not able to enter fire right now for him.<br />
 <br />
I had another guildee today that had his time key but did not have access to the elementals and this is what he said when I asked him:<br />
 <br />
[Sat Dec 18 02:19:52 2004] You say to your guild, 'lariatha.. let me ask you something quickly.. you said that you def did not have access to the elemnetal zones before today but you did have the time key correct?'<br />
[Sat Dec 18 02:20:00 2004] Lariatha tells the guild, 'correct'<br />
[Sat Dec 18 02:20:14 2004] Lariatha tells the guild, 'hedge maze - tz-vz uncompleted, and nothing in sol ro killed'<br />
 <br />
I asked him this while he was running around in PoFire because he received the emote when he entered tranquility.  He is level 70.<br />
 <br />
So, unless there is a level requirement, my beastlord should be able to enter fire because he has his time key (he's only level 65).  He does have some time equipment, so it's easy to see that he's been there.  This is also the case for a guildees twink monk, who's still level 65, with time gear, but was not able to enter fire either.<br />
 <br />
So the question is, what is the prerequisite for getting the emote.   Is the emote dependant on the character being level 70 (or even 66 - 70) or is there something else that I may have missed?  It's not a huge deal either way, but it's nice to be able to enter into a place like fire, where I know that I could get some exp where I know a few friends still hang out at often.<br />
 <br />
Oh, last thing is, I do think that this is a great concept.  It's something that although a bit late, it's something that I'm sure many people will enjoy.  I have seen people mention that the new time key drops from the phase 3 named, and that's a great idea as well (although the 85/15 wasn't working before this morning patch).  I do like the new flagging system, although with sites like Lucy being down, it's hard to tell exactly what will be required to finish up stuff like the qvic flag key and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, who knows exactly what got messed up in these last two patches...but for a long time now you've been able to have a char flagged for Time without having complete elemental access.  It sounds to me like the error(or change) is not with your BL, but rather with the lvl 70 guildmate(s) who could suddenly zone into places he wasnt able to before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, they talked about changing it during some of the backflagging changes, making it so that people that killed a god i a certain zone, could hail/loot something that would make them flagged for the zone.  So, it would only be natural that someone with their time key, would be flagged for all of the elementals.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that you physically receive an emote upon entering into tranquility saying that you now have access to the elementals.  That tells me that that is how it's supposed to be.  Now the question remains:  what are the prerequisites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there's a new mob in BoT. of course i don't remember the name nor did i have /log on but it was something like...Keeper of the Lore.<br />
<br />
i am guessing he has something to do with this new way of flagging. for which zone, mob, etc...no clue.<br />
<br />
was tracked by a ranger at south entrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty sure that msg means your flagged for all 4 elemental planes. Nothing more nothing less. They didn't change the old flagging route at all. You still need to kill all the same old stuff. What they did add was if you kill fennin you get access to fire, if you kill xegony you get access to air, etc as the backflagging route.<br />
<br />
Personally my lvl 67 bard and my 70 shaman both got the msg and they are both elemental flagged and have been for ages. Neither has done anything in the elemental planes for months and haven't even been to PoTime for weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got the message saying &quot;your body trembles...blah blah... and you are given access to the planes of the Elemental Gods.&quot; Didn't say anything about a cipher so I wonder if there are different messages depending on how much access you have? I haven't checked going into Fire yet, but I haven't done anything in Sol Ro before, which I still don't have access to.  I'll check it out again tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, taraddar, the point is that.. my beastlord has killed Fennin.  He has killed every elemental god, in fact he has loot from time.  But, he's still not able to get into fire, while other people I know are able to, even though technically they have less flags that my beastlord does.  the only thing that I never got for my beastlord is any of the Sol Ro minis/sol ro himself.  <br />
<br />
So, unless there is a level limit or something, there is no reason that my beastlord should not be able to enter into PoFire.  That is what i'm wondering about.  What are the prerequisites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Elemental god kills are not retroactive in flagging as far as I know. Go kill fennin again and your bst will be flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">right, i realize that.  However that still doesn't explain why some others who have less flags that I have, received the emote and are now able to enter into fire.  There is no glaring reason, except for their level.  If what you said was true, then they should have to kill fennin to get into fire as well, but they ddin't have to.  They can go into fire right now and exp around.  This is why i'm asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Like I said, something isnt working right yet  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I zoned into Tranq after the patch I had the text that you did, and also:<br />
<br />
'you feel yourself attune to the Plane of earth' <br />
<br />
Now I have full PoP flags for time, and have been earth flagged for a few millenia, so couldnt see why I had this emote.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of was arbitor was the last mob I killed before patch (backflagging new recruits)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also as of this patch maps can be used in EP's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just an idea, but a guild member was talking about the ep flags being linked to the time key pieces in his inventory.  When he banked the pieces he couldn't enter the zones.  This was between the first and second patch though.  Make sure the time key is in your inventory, try relogging and see if it recognizes and gives you the flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah I got the thing about being attuned to the Plane of Earth also. I am flagged for all the zones in pop including Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Im having the same problem Val, someone posted this from my guild message board but im not sure if its actually true as I havent had time to test it yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;hrmm <br />
Your body begins to heat up as you feel your body attune to the Plane of Fire. <br />
The ground settles and you feel your body attune to the plane of earth. <br />
<br />
ya so .. still dont have the requirements to zone into fire. Wonder if its still broken <br />
<br />
or... hmmm <br />
gonna play with it some. <br />
<br />
<br />
@@@ <br />
And I figured out the trick. If you are Time flagged.. and stuff it will give you the message period. <br />
<br />
<br />
For Fire, hail Ronar Flametip. <br />
<br />
For Water, I think its Jumark the Undertow to hail, he says a new text <br />
<br />
For Earth , Taq'aal Emerald Shard allows you entry <br />
<br />
I did not find a mob specifically for Air though, I have a suspicion that if you talk to any of the others, it will do it for Air.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK I just did this and after I hailed Ronar Flametip it didnt let me zone into Fire still but after I went back to PoK and did unlock memories and guided meditation with the seer and came back and hailed Ronar Flametip again it let me in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, got the new text on Ticking when I entered PoT just a few minutes ago (text was in white and not yellow like the other one was).  Tried to talk to Ronar Flametip and he didnt' really tell me anything different<br />
<br />
I went back to PoK and tried talking to the seer.  I did not get anything new from her either using both guided meditation and unlock memories.  Then after that I ran back to fire, hailed Ronar Flametip and still nothing.  However, at this time it did let me zone into Fire.<br />
<br />
So, overall once you get the message that you are attuned to the zone, you might just have to zone back to PoK and then zone back and hopefully it fixes your flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PoTime works this way now.<br />
<br />
You flagshare in according to the 85/15 rule np, in fact it seemed to let us bring more than that and at one point, it looked like almost 15 people made it in. Phase 3 drops no drop globes that flag the looter. Looters are instantly flagged as soon as they loot the item and have access to PoTime, but not sure if they need to keep it on them for it to keep working. There were a total of 9 drops for us in phase 3, but no other phase dropped them. All looters could zone into PoTimeA w/o flagsharing after that without having to do anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hmm WTB loot rights to PoTime Globe PST<br />
<br />
wonder if getting flaged for time using the new system will also allow you to do the unlock memories thing for ele access. Since it seems that if your flaged for time you get flaged for any ele zones you were not flaged for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I just had something similar happen to me .. zoned into PoT, and got the message that my body was now attuned to the PoFire.  Originally wouldn't let me zone in, so I hailed the 2 named NPCs there, and still wouldn't let me zone in.  Went to PoK, did unlock memories, nothing happened .. did guided meditation, nowthing out of the ordinary.  Yet, when I zoned back to PoT and tried to zone in to fire again, it let me.<br />
<br />
Not flagged for Fire from SolRo, however I DO have the fennin shield for Time.  It's banked, but I do have it.  And when it let me zone in, the shield was NOT in my inventory .. it was banked.<br />
<br />
The only thought I have is that after you zone into PoT and get an emote, try to zone out and back in to see if it lets you zone into the place you got the emote for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If I'm correct, Time access used to be KEYED, not FLAGGED. You could be 85/15'd into the four elementals, obtain your Time KEY, and forvever-more have access to Time. At that point you would still not have access to the elementals because you havn't yet been FLAGGED for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cipher on your arm glows for a moment as the words of the history fill your mind. The knowledge you have gained now grants you access to the planes of the Elemental Gods.&quot;<br />
<br />
I recieved this message last night also for the first time, but I believe I can explain why. Prior to last night I was missing only Xuzl, Dres, and Sol Ro for Fire (and also full Elemental) Access. We killed all three last night and upon zoning into PoTranquility via PoFire I got the above message. Maybe those of you who were 85/15'd into the elementals to get your Time KEY would have to go back and do all the proper FLAGS for Elemental access to get the above message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You are correct in that time used to be a keyed entrance and not flag.  However, my beastlord can now enter all the of the elementals (despite having never stepped foot into sol ro) and a few of my guildees include one who has time key, but never did anything in sol ro, VZ, or hedge maze can also now enter into all of the elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sorry, I thought your original question was why you were getting one message upon entering PoTran and your beastlord was getting another. Guess I misinterpereted your question.</div></div><hr />
