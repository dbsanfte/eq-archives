<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been playing off and on for the last several months.<br />
<br />
Kind of annyoed about the you kill an entire plane and only get 1 shot a Tunare before someone else who didn't spend X amount of killing the plane, gets a shot at it.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the subject... I thought a new spell line (even though I would probably hate it) might be suggested.  Kind of like the mage items that are summoned that add abilities to people.  Maybe we can get spells that adds 10% to the backstab skill or 8% to tradeskills.  Or that actually gives/raises someone stealth skill by 25 points.<br />
<br />
I think I saw someone say in another post that STR increases Attack and AGI should increase Archery the same way.  Why not just have a specific warror buff that increase 1/2 handed slash by 10% with an add Str/haste component to it.  And then add ones for casters that actually add Int/Wis with either a damage/heal skill increase with a spell casting haste (or a better chance at a critical).<br />
<br />
Only major problem is it could throw the classes more out of balance.  But it would make sence since we are the &quot;king of buffs&quot; to be able to increase the base power of a (all the) class(es)<br />
<br />
Just a thought</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We always welcomed other guilds to queue up in PoG and watch us slap Tunare like the Biatch she is!  If they wanna waste their time..............<br />
<br />
Tunare's pretty easy if you,<br />
1. kill every other mob in the plane<br />
2. MA must have TONS of aggro<br />
3. have three ogurs behind MA so that when he gets kicked back, he doesn't go anywhere<br />
4. have everyone else attack her from behind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tunare doesn't even knock back any more.<br />
<br />
I'd bet money that the person that was supposed to be kiting ali the elder wasn't doing his job and pulled him over the raid, thus silencing everyone and causing a wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sirenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">good line of buff items<br />
<br />
something that uses alchemy<br />
<br />
maybe a lvl 30 spell that does 500 damage to you and gives you an alchemy item then you combine it with a 2 or 3plat alchemy store bought item to give you a lore potion that heals 400dmg no cast time one charge targetable only on self. so you can give one to each tank and one to your self on raids<br />
maybe make a 30lvl one that takes 800hp and gives 60hp back<br />
a 50 that takes 1200hp and gives back 900hp<br />
and a 60 that does something similar<br />
<br />
either that or a weak dot like 10dmg a tick for a long time like 4 minutes but put a stackable debuff spell on it like neg (10, depends on what lvl spell is) to all resists and all combat stats give it nice long cqast time like 7.0 or 6.0 make a maybe lvl 40 44 and 49 spell for it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">erm, I hate to mention this to you Sirenna, but those potions that take HP &amp; give you back less HP, do seem a bit rubbish. Unless you mean mana :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
free heals = rubbish?<br />
not in my book<br />
say 2 hours before a raid me and my tank friends are hanging out<br />
i can sac hp right then and brew the potions handing them out and keeping one for myself<br />
<br />
then 5 hours latter mid raid were at [insert uber boss here]'s room and one of the clerics is whiped due to agro or an add or something and the raid is down to maybe 2 or 3 clerics and a boss that aoe stuns and aoe dds the raid with these instant manaless heal potions i made 5 hours before were able to keep the tanks and maybe even a cleric up long enough to finish boss mob<br />
<br />
not that it will be an awsome spell<br />
but it will be decent enough<br />
<br />
and i say we put alchemy skill into it<br />
maybe 70 for the first one 100 for the second in the line and 120 for the third and so on<br />
<br />
this brings life to alchemy in raid situations and also gives people a reason except just to waste plat to gain alchemy over 36(sow potions)<br />
<br />
lemme hear some more feedback on this spell line<br />
i think it would bring life to alchemy and be a decent and fun spell<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only thing we need is a Spell Slow for casters. Something that increases their cast time by 10 or 30% depending on level of spell, or maybe a curse line to make the bastards fizzle more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
sounds like a decent spell line<br />
what lvl would we make it start at?<br />
34maybe for the first one like the 10pct one<br />
and then raise it in the line every spell set or 2<br />
<br />
-sirenna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, that's an overpowering line against caster MoBs. You're gimping them (although they already melee better than any melee anyway) and it wouldn't affect procs or AEs. Which may make it hard to implement. So I'd ausme if ever implemented, SOE would make it an AA ability, easily resistable, short duration and long recast.<br />
<br />
Although I do believe we need a curse line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well they have weapons that increase skills for 15% which would be the upper limit.<br />
<br />
So ...<br />
at level 34 it could be a skill mod at 3%<br />
at level 44 it could be a skill mod at 6%<br />
at level 54 it could be a skill mod at 8%<br />
at level 64 it could be a skill mod at 10%<br />
<br />
And since you have all the trade skills and basic skills you could have different spells for the skill mod.<br />
<br />
Maybe Whistleing Blades which would increase 1 and/or 2 handed slash skill.<br />
Greater Striking which would increase the blunt skills.<br />
<br />
Admittedly trying to figure out what to cast on who could be a nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Any improvement for shamans that is inputed though alchemy is just asking for a gimped and useless ability.<br />
<br />
Just make it a damn spell and be done with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
jenguran=pissed he dont have good alchemy) jk<br />
but i think we should have to somewhat reliant on alchemy<br />
its a skill only WE have<br />
why not use it<br />
i know so many people who go to 36 or a bit higher just to do sow potions<br />
<br />
i think a alchemy reliant spell would be a fun idea)<br />
just my 2 nickels<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wasn't asking for alchmey to be used, just raw spells.  We can buff up people's stats why can't we now buff up skills and stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wasn't asking for alchmey to be used, just raw spells.  We can buff up people's stats why can't we now buff up skills and stuff?<br />
<br />
Because your missing the roleplaying aspect of the class.  The shaman's powers are based on the alteration of the physical state.  Every spell line we have is based on this, from our stat-enhancing buffs to our debuffs to our DD's and DoT's to our shape-shifting powers.  <br />
<br />
If anything, buffing skills would be more of an enchanter-based spell line, with their powers to manipulate the mind.  <br />
<br />
Back to the subject, one thing I would like to see (as I've mentioned before) is a group-based spell along the Avatar or Rage types, which has high cost and low duration, but is MGB'able and will stack with standard enhancement buffs of ALL classes.</div></div><hr />
