<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can anyone confirm for me whether or not MALO drops off of juggers or not? i have heard both yes and no, but have read several spell drop threads that state more no. been hunting for this spell for darn near ever :\<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have never seen Malo drop off juggs, both mala and malosini do.  Malo might drop off the sebilite protector or jumpy.  Malo definitely drops from outdoor Kunark dragons, Kunark boss mobs (like the Overking in Chardok) and VP dragons (probably not very helpful).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hrapollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a great thread in here that has a little spreadsheat that lists all the drop shaman spells and where they fall and off what mobs.  i found it very useful.<br />
<br />
But to answer your question.. NO malo does not dropp off of  Seb. Juggs.<br />
<br />
However... Malo DOES drop off of the Named Jugg &quot;sebilite protector&quot; and off of the named Froggy both are which are down by the Track lair.  Mind, like every other Mob, it is not a common drop.  But those are the 2 mobs that it can drop off of Down in the Juggs/Lair Area.<br />
<br />
I belive Malo Can also drop off the Real Trakkanon...not the bard epic spawed one.  <br />
<br />
There are other mobs that will drop Malo.  Emp in Seb, King in chardok, Sev, Gore , Sontalek, Klandicar... etc...<br />
<br />
Refer to that thread i mentioned earlier.  I have found it to be accurately compiled and a good reference.<br />
<br />
Good Luck to you and every other shaman.... its a brutal ordeal trying to get it.   =/<br />

<br />
_________________<br />
<br />
seb mobs it can drop off of are : Sebilite Protector, Emperor Chottal,Tolapumj and i think real Trakk . <br />
<br />
Chardok: Chardok Overking. <br />
<br />
EJ: Sev <br />
<br />
VP: Silverwing (only heard this one ... dont know it for a fact)<br />
<br />
WW: Klandicar, Solantak. These are always your best bet as they can drop as many as 8! spells on a kill. (but man i was on a Klan kill once and the sodding dragon still dropped a mala..bleh)<br />
<br />
TD: Real Faydedar. <br />
<br />
DL: Gorenaire. <br />
<br />
SF: Talendor and Guardian wurms.. (although i'll believe it when i see it with the Guardian wurms.. but supposedly its so) <br />
<br />
And im sure in some sick world it dropps off of randon Orc Oracle #011956734899039991 =p <br />
<br />
<br />
needless to say.. i tried and stil try  going to about every Fay, Trak, Gore, Chardok, Talen, Sev raid i possibly can.. but they dont happ like every day...  =/<br />
<br />
This list you can basically use for all the &quot;ubah high end&quot; shaman spells be it Malo, Torpor, Avatar, Pox etc.<br />
<br />
Good luck... out of those 4 i only have malo and torpor myself... but i keep fighting the fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks. a few shaman on my server was saying juggs dropped malo and i never saw it or had any kind of confirmation. on a side note, i was finally able to trade straight out torpor for malo, got a second copy of torpor off of a GW about a week ago , and i now have malo in my book :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Torpor drops off Druushk in VP and Malo drops from Phara Dar.  I expect that spell drops for these dragons are random and every one has a chance of dropping them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, Malo dropped off a random jugg last night on Xev while we were getting in position for the triggered Trak. Wasn't the Protector or the toad either (one of them dropped a Raptor, but that's it as shaman spells went from those two). <br />
<br />
So, yes, Malo *can* drop from the Sebilite Juggernauts... you probably have a slightly greater chance to win a national lottery jackpot though than get malo through the Juggs.<br />
<br />
Made for one very happy level 53 shaman, now highly motivated to hit 60 :D Both myself and Gloredhel already had it, pillaged from Sev and Gorenaire, respectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>hrapollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WOW.. that is something else... well there ya go... in did drop off a Jugg.<br />
<br />
I believe the odds stated are about right , but HELL it dropped =)<br />
<br />
gratz to the lucky shaman.  heres to hopin it rubs off on some others! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I seriousely doubt that it dropped of a Jugg. Seeing as a juggernaut is about lvl 58 and malo is 60.<br />
<br />
Never heard of a spell dropping on a mob lower than the spell level.<br />
<br />
Then again, I might be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I m tired of those &quot; malo drops of a_random_VP_Dragon_02&quot;.<br />
60 kunark shaman spells drop of every 60+ kunark mobs . you have 1/14 chance it drops for you.<br />
<br />
As for droping off regular juggs i don't know, i will just believe it is possible.<br />
<br />
No particular 60 mob drops a particular 60 spell only, it's bull****.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm.... What level do you think Mala or Dictate, both fairly common drops from the Juggs, are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I beleive Yeldema in WW can drop Cann4 or Focus, tho I can't confirm that, I heard it from a very reliable source.  She's not 60 (or even 58).  So yeah, some mobs can drop spells less than their level, but that doesn't hold true for every mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ALL the spell drops in BW are off mobs much lower in level than the spells themselves. Mobs 45-48 drop 51-54 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got Cann IV and Focus from a guild bard who got them soloing WW dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aragos Innoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got Malo and Torpor the other night in Sky fire off of Ancient Wyverns.   There were two of them up and first one dropped Malo and second one dropped Torpor<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There are certain level 60 spells that only drop from the level 60 loot table.  Mala is not one of them.  <br />
<br />
The level 60 loot table can actually drop from mobs that are level 58 or above.  99.9999999% of all juggs are exactly level 57.  Once in a great while there is a level 58 one though.  That is why malo can drop from juggs.</div></div><hr />
