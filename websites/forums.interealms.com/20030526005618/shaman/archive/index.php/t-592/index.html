<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sir Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, Torpor is as rare as hell.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any luck in convincing verant to add a purchasealbe mini-topor?<br />
<br />
L 56, 600 HPs for 125 mana (with the snare &amp; slow &amp; duration code).<br />
<br />
4.8 ratio instead of 6, and 2x as slow healing.  It would reduce the presure for Torpor &amp; let Shamans heal with something better than Chloroblast. . .<br />
<br />
Or, am I dumb?  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Would be great. They probably won't do it. Why? It would drasticaly increase the power level of 56-59 Shaman (and of level 60s who haven't managed to aquire Torpor). Serious increase in mana recovery in those levels if this idea were to be implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they added Harnessing of spirit, which is a mini-focus.<br />
<br />
There is no reason they don't come out with a mini-torpor, just to content the masses.<br />
<br />
Verant has no clue :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sir Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just peering at it. . .  150 mana for 600 HPs would probably be better.<br />
<br />
Arc, you object to this idea?<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Ahh, how about this tweak:<br />
<br />
-100% meditation skill while the spell is up.<br />
<br />
This will prevent meditation, and reduce the usefulness of this spell for cannidance purposes.<br />
<br />
It will also keep the spell a serious notch below Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i object to anything that makes reaching 60 not god damn worth it.<br />
Harnessing and the creation of a mini-torpor would make me feel like i lvled for nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I could settle for a Mini-Torpor buyable at level 60!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Adding Harnessing did not substantially increase the power of the Shaman class. It was a small (but very nice) addition for the 49-59 shaman.<br />
<br />
Adding a mini-Torpor would substantialy increase the power of any Shaman who has the spell but doesn't currently have the real thing. Unless the HP-Mana ratio is put down around 2.5-1. And that would make it pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i don't give a damn **** about power. I don't want 60 spells to be generalized into lowbie spells everyone have access to (and this has nothing to do with the rarity of torpor, im talking about the principles).<br />
Harnessing is such a spell, i don't want a mini-torpor.<br />
WhHat next? a mini-malo at lvl 50? ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We, uh, have a Malx line our entire career.  So I guess the answer is YES.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Malo is unresistable... sigh.<br />
Your Malx line is highly resistable.<br />
I just feel like adding a HoS , a mini-torpor, would end in adding a mini-unresistable debuff in the 50.<br />
<br />
pre luclin lvl 60 was unique. it is still,  hope it remains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Arc - arguements like &quot;I had to wait till 60, so you should too&quot; don't carry much weight with anyone. Especially not with Verant - after all, that is almost exactly what many Clerics said a few weeks ago about the expansions to the rez line when they were asked about the idea before hand. If you want to shoot the idea down, come up with an arguement against it. One that doesn't sound like elitist whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the &quot;i had to wait 60 you too&quot; argument, while i second it, is not my point here.<br />
Lvl 60 has unique spells, it's an accomplishment.<br />
Seeing it banalized pains me.<br />
<br />
And i can turn your criticism the other way around : the &quot; i am jealous of lvl60 (because it's envy, nothing else) and i want their spells at lower lvl&quot; argument also doesn't stand...<br />
<br />
little edition:<br />
i am lvl 60 for a long time, i had to wait 5 months for torpor, 6 for malo ( sorry i am not ubber :))<br />
If i can buy mini-versions of those 2 spells, if lower lvl shaman can do almost the same stuf as me, i don't see the point to keep on playing. I'd rather lvl my monk and his aa points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tiqua Sunrise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I actually agree with Arc.  I've been wanting level 60 b/c of the spells that I get.  I see it as a reward for all the hard work that I have done.  Why put in all that work when VI turns around and grants &quot;mini&quot; versions of it to players who haven't put in as much work?  It sorta is a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
There is also a difference with the rez line spells.  Clerics aren't made a more powerful class b/c of the added rezzes.  In fact I know all my cleric friends strive to NOT use the rez spells.  Those added spells do not help them keep a group alive or kill mobs faster.  Mini-torpor would do that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldnt mind a mini-version of Torpor purchasable from a Vendor at 60, but I wouldnt want it before that.<br />
<br />
Like Arc and Tiqua, it is Malo and Torpor that are my main motivation to hit 60.  I think it wouldnt be quite such a big thing if I already had them in a lesser version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>hrapollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Both arguments are fair ... just a diff of opinion.<br />
<br />
Its all good and dandy to say.. well i dont want to see lev 60 banalized ... neither do i.  but lets face it .. how many shaman work SO hard to hit 60 and then have to wait another year and or spend 100 K to get spells like Torpor and Malo.<br />
<br />
Its just not right.  <br />
<br />
I agree with arc in that i think hitting 60 should be the main focus of every shaman and you dont want to give to much away .<br />
<br />
but what the hell is the point if peeps fight and claw to get to 60 and never get those rare 60 spells and get to realize the potential of the 60 shaman.<br />
<br />
Although its not the right solution, who can blame someone for wanting a mini torpor.<br />
<br />
IMO i think HoS (mini focus) is a great spell... only thing i dont like about it is that they let it stack with the str dex etc...  seems like a nifty lil easter egg at first but it takes away from Focus and I dont like that.<br />
<br />
VI could solve this problem for eveybody by upping the drops on those spells and or the mobs they can drop off of... and not just saying they are =/<br />
<br />
Then we wouldnt need mini focus, mini torpor...<br />
<br />
And i doubt &quot;very very much&quot; that they would ever put a mini malo (unresistable) into the game.  That would make the class way too powerful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Introducing a new spell line [Torpor] when a class reaches the end of its development is a real bad idea in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
The jump in power from 59th to 60th is so huge that there needs to be something to smooth out the development curve.<br />
<br />
A 50th level 600 hp heal over time would definetly be appropriate, and would be consistant with how shaman eventually end up playing for the majority of their play span, assuming most people eventually get to 60th.<br />
<br />
Consistency in the spell list should be a goal of the development team.</div></div><hr />

How many milestones do we want to bash?  I can remember the pain for Hell lvls  and the Satisfaction of that hard earned Ding.  I can remember how I felt when I hit 35 and did not have to stare at the book.<br />

I say torpor for action last night and an oricle in our guild was looking for it so I sent a tell...  40k....  ok let me check.....  how about 30k...  got offer for 35 if yoo go more it is yours....  let me check....<br />
<br />
Our guilds oracle got his copy last night for 18k....  mez got 40k but it came from selling my jbb so I need to replace it.  Passed on the Torpor but it was the first one I had ever sean in auction.<br />

Mini  Torpor  no thanks....  I want to know the joy of scribing the real thing :)  WooT WooT WooT<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Verant made a mistake putting a load of great spells at 60 and mostly filler from 56-59. The power jump at 60 is unnecessarily large. <br />
<br />
That having been said....I think the best reason for getting 60 is Malo. Even if that were the ONLY spell we get at 60, it alone makes 60 worth busting my ass for. Some of the other spells could have been spread around a bit over the lower levels more. Certainly Torpor could have been level 58 or 59 for example.<br />
<br />
HoS is a great spell and in no way takes away what a level 60 shaman can do. When I am in HoT and there is an Oracle there...do the melee all want HoS? Hell no. Does the maddly buffing oracle wish they did? Hell yes.<br />
<br />
Do we need a mini Torpor? Not really. Group HoS (say at 56) would be a better idea. Being the only shaman putting HoS on twenty melee is the suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mind you, if your oracle has group focus, HoS is hardly used except by special request, by those tanks who realize that str and dex stacks with HoS and not with focus.<br />

<br />
Conas, I could not disagree more.   <br />
<br />
We need more emphasis on our healing, not on our buffing.  The long term health of the class will be tied to our ability to heal and prevent damage, not to add more pointless buffs faster.<br />
<br />
I figure when planes comes out, everyone will be pushing 255 in all their key stats anyway, so buffing will become even less relavent than it is now.  The further mud-flation that is coming will further dimishish our role as buffer in a very short time.<br />
<br />
Before getting a group Hos, we can use alot of other things: lure based slow; buffs that add to intelligence/wis; a smart pet; double attack; fixed alchemy, improved invis, etc.  Giving us the ability to give buff crazy melee classes more of what they dont really need is not going to help us.<br />
<br />
We simply need more healing, and a dumbied down version of torpor, even if it is self only will be much more useful. I dread the idea of being a worse healer than a pally at L60.  And many shaman are finding they are just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">While we would all WANT more healing, the fact we can slow a mob significantly reduces the amount we NEED to heal. That is where they have us balanced out. Put a druid and a tank then a shaman and a tank and see which comes out ahead on total mana spent healing adding in the cost of turgur for the shaman of course. Yeah some mobs are immune to slow but thats the exception and not the rule for experience groups. If your raid is dependent on the shaman for healing it is doomed already anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">When PoP comes out they'll likely jack the lvl cap and bugger everything up ... AGAIN.  Lvl 60 is a great achievement and should not be belittled, but doesn't guarantee Torpor or Malo.  Having access to lesser versions with poorer ratios doesn't lessen your achievement but gives it more life by allowing you some of the utility of that spell while you hunt down the real prize spells.  Shaman with the upgraded spells will always be in more demand and soloing will always be easier with the the better spells.  I fail to see how anyone looses from offering lower alternatives.<br />
<br />
On another note, I wouldn't be suprised if VI offered this solution over fixing spell drops.  Hell, they did that with bear form and focus.  Seems easier to add a spell, toss it on a vendor, being lesser than its namesake causes little in the ways of balancing issues. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the jump in ability from 59-60 sorta echos the transformation we go through from 48-49 in the old world.  VI likes the shaman to finish off strong, but makes us bust a gut to get there.</div></div><hr />
