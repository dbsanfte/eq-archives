<br />
I am an ULTRA NEWBIE in EQ (L5 Wood Elven Ranger) and I spoke to Maesyn the Bowmaster last night about the Trueshot Longbow quest.  I have a few questions, if I may.<br />
<br />
1.  Is it too early for me, that is, will I get absolutely smoked in the &quot;real world&quot; outside of the forest at such a low level?  <br />
<br />
2.  I have a bunch of skill points saved up, what do you recommend I use them on?  I am currently building 1h slash, tracking, foraging, taunt and archery skills.<br />
<br />
3.  Should I find a group to hunt with instead of trying to quest so early?  <br />
<br />
Disclaimer:   So far, my experience in EQ has been a great one, I've played probably only 12 or so hours, and I love it already :)  The community is probably the biggest plus for me, very friendly and accomodating.  Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Probably, but part of the fun is exploring. Since you don't have to find your own body any more under level 10, go for it. <br />
<br />
2. Save them, or put 10 into fletching and start making your own basic arrows. <br />
<br />
3. Group and solo, both teach you differnt things.<br />
<br />
You really cannot finish this quest for a while. I failed the combine 13 times with a Fletching skill of 135, which will take you a while to get and cost a lot of coin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, level 5 is a bit young - especially with your first character who probably doesn't have much in the way of money.  Better to just do some basic fletching and get the hang of it, make a basic bow and some arrows to start with.  But you could easily go to Freeport and Kaladim and do those two parts of the quest, although for the Kiola Nuts you'll need a bit of coin and a few containers to carry them in.  You should be able to get the Spiderling Silks, too.  Only tough part at your level, come to think of it, will be getting the Clockwork gears.  And having the money to spend on Fletching, of course.<br />
<br />
For training points, general advice is to only put one point into new skills as you get them - Kick, for example, at level 6 or whatever.  Put one point into it, and then use it - it will go up naturally.  Same for Sneak, Dual Wield, Double Attack.  Then, when you get to a higher level, you can use them for trade skills or for a weapon skill you've neglected.<br />
<br />
At your level, as far as grouping or soloing, I'd just hang out in Faydark and take the groups as they come.  Maybe solo until you get some spells at level 9, and see what you can do with them in a group situation (Snaring, for example).<br />
<br />
Welcome, and enjoy the Rangering life.</div></div><hr />
