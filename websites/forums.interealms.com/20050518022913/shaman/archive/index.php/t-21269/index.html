<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why do we get Brenlo?   :mad:  <br />
 I am sick of his one sentence responses which do not resolve anything.  He never takes the time to let people know what is going on.  <br />
If you look at all of his responses, it seems to be more of a hassle for him then anything else,  While Kytherea takes alot of pride to try the best to satisfy everyone.  <br />
 <br />
Perfect example ;<br />
<br />
First Line &quot;Oh, geez&quot;  (like hes just sick of everything)<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=6940#M6940<br />
<br />
First line &quot;  :) Happy to help  &quot;    (Tries very hard to keep people happy)<br />

They should make it so the customers that play EQ can rate our &quot;Community relations reps.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
{I wonder what it would take to get Kytherea to take care of us instead ?}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, but at the same time, we don't know if Kytherea and the other will be very effective at actually getting things done.  People who try to keep others happy are NOT good at pressing developers to look into certain issues.  Whereas with people like brenlo, some people's first reaction is just to give him what he wants so he will go away.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Overall, I'd say wait a little while and see which rep gets things handled first before deciding which is the best to get stuck with.  I know of a couple issues that each of them have reported sending up to the Devs, and I am watching the patch messages eagerly to see who wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He is a Customer Rep.  His job is to keep you as happy as possible with no authority to change anything in the game.  What do you expect?<br />
<br />
Customer Service is hardly the forte of SOE.  They are worse than trying to get a claim resolved with an insurance company.  When SOE starting making cuts...Customer Service is what they chose, not the dumbass Devs who continue to keep this game screwed up.<br />

And waiting and hoping for the best did help us how again during the past 2 years?</div></div><hr />

I have to say that this comment is not accurate.  While I agree that I dislike most of the devs as a whole.  There are some who are wonderful people, who take the time to communicate with the community on a decently regular basis, who listen to the community, and then make changes that on the whole most people agree are good for the game.  So please, don't bash devs as a whole, bash them for not communicating, or for seeming to have no clue about the shaman class, but don't just bash them as a whole.<br />
<br />
(This post is dedicated to Tanker and Maddoc, my two favorite devs! &lt;hugs Tanker and Maddoc&gt;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  This is an entirely different waiting.  I am not waiting for them to acknowledge a problem, or notice how a class is broken/neglected.  I am waiting to see the reults of action already taken.<br />
<br />
  And I am not waiting for something that I NEED or WANT.  I am waiting for academic curiosty.<br />
<br />
  Overall, it is my suspicion that Brenlo's changes will see light of day much quicker than the others.  He already knows pretty well what can and cannot be easily coded, he has a longer standing relationship with other Devs and he chooses his battles much smarter.  Sure, he doesn't talk a ton, but that is not something I can easily slight a person for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Me, I'd be a HORRIBLE PR rep when dealing with the community.  Just look at my rep and how my sarcasm bites me in the rep pool :)  But I dont care and I keep responding the way I want to with jokes and maybe a bit around the bush.  BUT I take my job very seriously, I have always been told &quot;If you are going to be a garbage man and it makes you happy, be the best damn garbage man around&quot;  So if I were in the position of Brenlo I too might be a jag off to the community and come across poorly time and again but I might really be fighting for the Shaman behind closed doors because that's my job.  To impress upon the developers, that are stuck all day in their little cubbys typing in code, what folks really think of their code and how it plays out... might not be what they had planned.<br />
<br />
Other side of the coin, Ky might be blowing sunshine up the community arse while then going behind the doors and saying &quot;Oh I agree with you dev they should like what you are doing&quot;<br />
<br />
This isnt to say this is what is happening... just giving a bit of devils advocate here.<br />
<br />
Edit: cleaned up some crap.  was typing fast probably still doesnt make a lot of sense :)  damn work getting in the way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I mean really, you just want someone blowing smoke up your....tail pipe?<br />
<br />
Short and sweet is the way to go. He doesn't have the answer most people are looking for. He doesn't have the power to make the requested changes. He is paid to be the communication link to the dev in letting them know what views the Shaman class have. As far as I'm concerned, just acknowledging our posts is enough. A simple &quot;k&quot; would be enough. He should be communicating much more with the DEV's. We will see the results in the patches...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Worlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In that first link, Brenlo's 2nd reply was &quot;shaman board is mine.&quot; I find that extremely hilarious considering he has admitted he hasnt ever played a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree, a simple acknowledgment that our concerns, suggestions and yes, even our gripes are seen would make many Shaman more patient.  No, it wouldn't make them happy, but it would go a LONG LONG way toward cutting down the sheer volume of material.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we aren't even getting that acknowledgment regularly and therefore we are &quot;forced&quot; to continue posting in hopes that by sheer volume our concerns are seen by someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually his comment on playing a shaman was along the lines of ... &quot;I played a shaman to lvl 50 and understand shaman issues.&quot; <br />
<br />
So ... yeah, in terms of the issues shaman have, he has, in effect, not played a shaman.<br />
<br />
Regardless, whether or not he has played a class, especially shaman, those who do have taken the time to post logs, do parses, etc. that detail the problems enough that he can either edjumakate himself or, at the least, pass the information on to those who are already edjumakated. This aint rocket science.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brenlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually all I said was I played a Shaman to level 50.  I don't claim to understand the issues as well as you folks do and I never will.  You folks are the masters of the game.  You know all the ins and outs.  I don't.  I know alot but not nearly as much as the collected wealth here.  So I ask you folks for answers and I don't offer them. I take your feedback and concerns to the guys who make the changes and when I have news, I post it.  Yes I have posted a couple of short messages, with sighing and such in them lately.  Sometimes you folks frustrate me just as much as I frustrate you.  I still love the community in spite of it all, I love this game and I love talking to you folks about this game.  No matter how frustrated I may get when seeing a post that,&quot;Brenlo visited the SK board 5 times more than ours!&quot; I will still be back here talking to you folks.  <br />
<br />
Oh and all of this talk about what classes we have played is not really relevant.  It is not I nor Ash and Ky that makes the decisions.  We just compile and pass along the information.  We get the scoop from you experts out there.  So please do not let the fact that I have not played a shaman past 50 somehow disuade you.  Tell me your thoughts and ideas and we will see what the designers think of them.<br />
<br />
By the way, it is not a race between Ashlanne, Kytherea and I to get things done.  We are a team.  We work together and take your issues to the designers and programmers and try to get answers.  Their responsibility currently is with the official EQ boards and to communicate their, which leaves me some more time to communicate here and to do the multitude of other tasks the community team deals with.  They are great folks though and care about this game and you folks more than you know.  So be nice to them, if you need someone to gripe at, please gripe at me.  =)  You may get an Oh Geez or a /sigh in response but that doesn't mean I don't luv ya!  =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry Brenlo, I hadn't noticed this thread. Since you have responded, I will not delete it.<br />
<br />
The Crucible is no place for posters to attack SOE representatives. You guys have your own boards for that. :)<br />
<br />
I am closing this thread since it's apparent that you are making big steps to hear us and respond to our issues. Thanks for taking the time to post on the boards.</div></div><hr />
