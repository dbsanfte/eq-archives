<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">basically new to everquest, about 3 months been playing. this is my first character, 39 shaman. just made a magelo profile, the equipment is accurate, some of the stats might be a little off. since im new i dont have access to a lot of plat, but i have maybe 1.5k in bank. i log on at off peak times and usually solo, so farming for some plat is not too difficult, so i could get more if needed. from reading through these boards, seems 800 ac is an important threshold. im currently at 774 or so unbuffed, so i was looking for ways to get that last 25 or so unbuffed, as cheaply as possible, without sacrificing too much on things like hp. any suggestions please? also, any general equipment advice that might not work on getting the ac to 800, but is something i should do, please suggest as well. thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spend the rest of 39 tanking in the face and your defense should go up enough to take you over the 800 AC mark.  That would be my main suggestion for you.<br />
<br />
Not too many upgrades to boost your AC at a reasonable cost without giving up a lot in stats.  You might want to look at Decayed Chain Links for your legs (runs between 1 and 2k on my server) and Crystal Chitin Gauntlets (you would trading a lot of stats for AC with these though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your in pretty good shape :)<br />
<br />
I would try to get a wee bit more wis, 180 atleast<br />
<br />
A few ideas, not sure how much some of this is worth Im not a big bazaar hawk.<br />
<br />
Feet: Barbed Dragonscale Boots 19ac 9sta 30hps<br />
Back: Acrylia Studden Cloak 7ac 10wis 3str 5dex<br />
Ear1: Earring of Solstice 5ac 5sta 8wis 8int 55hps/mana 5mr/cr/fr effect:FT1  (costs probably 7-8k for components i think)<br />
Ear2: Glassy Frog Eye 2ac 5dex 5wis 5int 40hp/mana 5cr/mr<br />
Shoulder: Imbued Granite Spaulders 20ac 10cr/fr/dr/mr/pr<br />
<br />
Some of these have higher level recommendations than 39 so you wouldnt get full benefit.  If you have a few buddies to help ya you should be able to do the quests to get you these:<br />
<br />
Kromrif Military Leggings 14ac 6str 5wis 5dr 5cr or save up and do the faction work and buy a MQ of Thurg Legs (Rune Crafters) like 5k ive heard.<br />
<br />
Coldain Military Wristguard 10ac 5str 6wis 5mr 5cr<br />
<br />
Well just some ideas!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seeing as you dont have huge plat here are some cheapish upgrade ideas:<br />
Ears: Earring of Cleansing, Earring of Purity, Earring of Twisted Leaves, or slightly more expensive, Silver Hammer Earring, Skull Charm.<br />
Wrist: Replace totemic with jarsarth bracer. Try to get a level 50+ player to help you and do the Coldain bracer quest<br />
Shoulders: Camp for Elder Wolf Hide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some suggestions although keep in mind I'm a primary cleric not a shaman so not all of these may be good ideas.  I'm sure someone will tell me I'm wrong if I am and since I'm the first to admit I'm not an expert I won't take offense. :)<br />

For short term, you might want to bank one of your rings for later and switch to Fine Antique Ring.  Until you get your level 49 spells it will save you mana on all your spells and you are only losing a little AC and HPs.  In a few levels you could switch back and resell the Fine Antique - on FV it is droppable and sells for 250-300p.  <br />
<br />
Fine Antique Ring<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: FINGERS  <br />
AC: 3<br />
HP: +30  MANA: +20  <br />
Focus Effect: Mana Preservation II<br />
WT:  0.1    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Another possibility is this cloak.  I'm usually not big on wisdom items - mana and HPs better - but 10 wis in one slot is nice and you would only lose 1 AC from what you have.  <br />
<br />
Acrylia Studded Cloak<br />
Slot: BACK  <br />
AC: 7<br />
STR: +3  DEX: +5  WIS: +10  <br />
WT:  0.5    Size: MEDIUM<br />

Race: ALL<br />
<br />
I recently bought this bracer for 500p on bristlebane.  Not sure what it goes for on FV but it would be a nice upgrade for you I think:<br />
<br />
Rust Encrusted Wristguard<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: WRIST  <br />
AC: 12<br />
DEX: +5  WIS: +4  MANA: +20  SV FIRE: +4  <br />
Recommended level of 32.<br />
WT:  1.0    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: RNG ROG SHM <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Spider fur cloak has slightly better AC and although it doesn't have the +10 HPs it does have sta so I think it would be close to the same HPs.  They used to be very inexpensive although not as many hunt in velks anymore so I'm not sure if that has changed.<br />
<br />
Spider Fur Cloak<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: BACK  <br />
AC: 10<br />
STR: +4  STA: +4  SV COLD: +6  <br />
WT:  0.0    Size: TINY<br />
