<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SQoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wonder if this guy is doable with 3 person? Just slower me , tank and cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's unslowable.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the Shaman(you) is a waste of a slot, since you will have a hard time doing damage due to resists. However, I'd switch the tank with a mage and let the earth pet tank. <br />
<br />
The pet won't get banished and with an average pet focus and your buffs, it will tank just fine. I'd go with Cleric, Necro, Mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.  Since, if I recall correctly, he's immune to slow . . . probably not!<br />
<br />
Also, there are 2 versions of him.  I believe the dual wielding hammer version of him is far more beat-ass than his other version.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some others can confirm--it's been a while.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know ther are people far more uber than me that might have a better idea, but I would find it hard to imagine 3-boxing Dain.  Unslowable, hits pretty fast, and has a lot o' HP.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yeah, he banishes, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He's definitely doable with 3 people. I'd bet 3 Mages chain casting pets would win easily. Anyway, as I said, I'd go with Necro(good sustained damage, FD to drop the aggro, pulling), Cleric(healing duh), Mage(earth pet tank and damage via DDs and DS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SQoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where would be an idea place to pull him to? Zone in? or under the well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ideally I'd pull him under the well, just in case somebody else than the pet ends up tanking and gets banished(banishing point is under the well). I don't know if it's still possible to pull him down there, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL this is what they are talking about when they talk about mudflation. My first Dain raid was in 2002 and we had like 50 people there and got wiped LOL cant believe that he can be trio'd now :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">there's two versions but has nothing to do with what he's wielding, either spawns with max hit 350 or max hit 425</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If i remember right the DPS of the two differ quite a lot. One is really gimp and the other is quite nasty. That is ofcourse a comparision done when Luclin was new and the toughtest nut around was AoW/Vulak...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He rampages too btw. So try to stay away some, its range is rather small.<br />
<br />
There's indeed a 425 hitter and a 350 one. I'd guess the 425 Dain will have a DPS of less than 400 on a good earth pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is a 350 htter and a 425 hitter, and both can duel wield, if they have two of the hammers. Fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I tried Dain about a month ago with 7 people.. shaman, chanter, and warrior(3 boxed by me), necro, necro(both necros well equipped), cleric(crappy gear), druid being 2 boxed by cleric(druid with decent gear) We tried him about 5 times and wiped because of the banish. We were actually doing great with me rampage tanking on my shaman and the warrior main tanking, but the last time the warrior got banished, repops had happenned and we got a lot of agro from above. If I had thought about it, the 2 necro pets could have easily tanked dain and could have done away with the banish, but i wasn't thinking.<br />
<br />
The best we did was getting him down to 37%, that was the last attempt when the warrior brought a lot of adds back.<br />
<br />
He's definitely 1 gruopable with the right people, and 3 people could probably kill him also.</div></div><hr />
