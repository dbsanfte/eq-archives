<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate my bracers,<br />
<br />
NOt only are they crap, but i have had them for the last 30 levels :)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you guys knew of any upgrades (my profile is linked to in my sig) for my bracers.<br />
<br />
I am kind of time limited so i would probably have to buy them, and i can afford around 3 - 4 k all up<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have good coldain and giant faction (both dubious+), I would say replace one with coldain military bracer, not a hard quest really, and it makes dots do more dmg...maybe after that go to kael and group in arena (could prolly get a group at 50) til ya get a chain bracer and do that quest, saw 3 chain bracers in 1 day once so couldnt be too hard hehe.  But as you say your pressed for time and all, I dunno if these are viable for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go raid the plane of hate.  Shaman bracers drop from both the golems, as well as the treasure chests.  9ac 5wis is a good upgrade to totemic.<br />
If you want to buy something, or hunt for it yourself, go to Skyshrine and kill the Sentry mobs near the zone (Don't kill the 2 sentries AT the zone.  They never drop anything).  Sentry bracers are 9ac 2wis 2int 15hp 15hp 5dr 5pr 2mr non lore tradable.  I think those numbers are right.  If not, they are damn close.<br />
Also, dragonhide bracers from WW have stats like 11ac 8wis 6cha or something similar in stats.  Better quality bracers from WW have bigger numbers on them.  You can probably buy one for about 3-4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ubiqu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, what Koraden said.  I have worn sentry bracers since level 15 ;&gt;.  If you can find them for cheap on your server though, barbed rubicite bracers are nice, 13 ac 5 wis/int 30 hps.  I got one of these for 2k the other day and it helps a bit ;&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks a lot guys<br />
<br />
I am ally to the coldain, but kos to the giants, it must be all the giants i killed, hehe.<br />
<br />
I am kind of stuck in maidens helping some friends get some gear, so i might try and get barbed ruby.<br />
<br />
I am also thinking that the hate raid sounds fun :)<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sell the RMB to a peridot eating cleric and buy one of the bracers that drop off dragons in WW.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Being an Iksar I can't use JBB so I have Dragonhorn Bracers.  Peerless and Reinforced.  <br />
<br />
Peerless is,  14 AC +11 Wis +7 Cha +1.80 Wt <br />
Reinforced is,  +12 AC +9 Wis +5 Cha +1.80 Wt  <br />
<br />
The best one in the Dragonhorn line of series bracers is the Matchless with +15 AC +12 Wis +8 Cha +1.80 Wt  .  Never seen that one for sale.  This stuff mutch better than Sentry and Hate bracers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was gonna post a question about how to use all the bracers I have now - need an extra arm or 2.  Supple Scale from Karnors gives extended range 3 (good for pulling), JBB or course, and now Coldain Military Wristguard (quest is pretty easy BTW)gives enhanced affliction 3 (makes dots last longer).  <br />
