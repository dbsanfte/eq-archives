<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My UI is set up so that all the information I need is in one corner of the &lt;BR&gt;screen and all stuff I might need is off to the side. ^_^ My hotkeys&lt;BR&gt; are set up so that I can control my character with my left hand as well as &lt;BR&gt;cast all mem'd spells. Spells 5 thru 8 are Hotkeys 1 thru 4. So if I want to cast &lt;BR&gt;one spell and then another all I do is hold and then release the ALT key &lt;BR&gt;(all spells are keyed to ALT 1-8). I keep all my text spam and such to &lt;BR&gt;Hotkeys 7 through 10 and keep my bracer on 5 and my drum (I mount &lt;BR&gt;dismount alot for pulling and interupting) on 6. Since I got my horse I've &lt;BR&gt;replaced the Canni hotkey (did the canni dance) with my pet back off hot &lt;BR&gt;key as my pet seems to get into more and more trouble lately. ^_^<br />

There's a few things that aren't current (for example it doesn't have the little LFG tool button in the party screen.. but then, I don't have LoY :p) but it works good enough for me.  There also should be a listing of new research components in the story window (alt-N) but I'm not sure if the text files for that are in the UI directory or another one.. if it doesn't work you can get that at eqtraders.com.</div></div><hr />

I shrunk the size of them down to 900x720 so it didn't take up a screen and a half for everyone.  I use 1280x1024 in game so I can put as much info on the screen and still be able to see hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Here is the interface I use.<br />
<br />
My hotkeys are :<br />
<br />
1 - Slam<br />
2 - My %t is slowed hotbutton.<br />
3 - My /who all friends button.<br />
4 - Hotkey to my spellbook so I can quickly switch out spells.<br />
5 - /whotarget - yes, I do it a lot for some reason lol.<br />
6 - My /assist Main Assist key.<br />
7 - My sit down/stand up key so I don't have to go all the way over and click the button.<br />
8 - My /who all guild hotkey.<br />
9 - My clicky sow boots so I can sow on the run.<br />
0 - /pet attack.<br />
<br />
I plan to edit this interface to replace the compass window with a spell window that fits so nothing is blocking the view. The compass window starts just about the compass to just above the hotkeys. I'm not totally sure how I could do that but I usually learn things as I go. :cool:<br />
<br />
BTW, it's for 1024 x 768, maybe lower. I also attached it 'cause I'm lazy. :p</div></div><hr />

I don't think I could get used to windows along the bottom. I also just use the default UI with a couple of windows borrowed from other skins. All my windows are along the top &amp; down the sides all 100% transparent.<br />
<br />
Quick question tho, of the custom windows I am using everytime I log off then back on the EQ patcher re-downloads the default windows &amp; I have to wait until download is complete then go into my EQ directory &amp; paste the XML files I want loaded then proceed past the patcher window to log on.<br />
<br />
What could I be doing wrong that these files keep getting re-downloaded. The file names for what I am replacing &amp; replacing with are identical, but somehow patcher knows there's a difference.<br />
<br />
Anyway a peeve now since I have been using these windows.<br />
<br />

You're not supposed to put the files in the default folder...make a new folder in the uifiles folder and put your interface files in that one. DON'T copy the default ui files in there either, it'll break every time they change the UI. Once you're in game type /loadskin and select name of the folder you put the files in.</div></div><hr />

4 is spell gem 5 SLOW<br />
5 is PET ATTACK<br />

8 is SUMMON DROGMOR<br />
9 is /pet health<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">http://berlie.com/eq/UIkaesha.jpg <br />
<br />
Hotkeys:<br />
Assist (/assist)<br />
Assist MT (/assist maintanksname)<br />
Malos debuff call<br />
Quiescence call and cast hotkey (&quot;casting Quiescence on %t&quot;, /cast 2)<br />
Malosinia Debuff call<br />
Slow call<br />
Virulent paralysis aa hotkey<br />
Spirit Call aa hotkey<br />
Sit/Stand<br />
Can V<br />
<br />
I switch some of these out with:<br />
 /target (whoever i need to keep an eye on for heals)<br />
Cripple debuff call<br />
&quot;%t has been Root Parked, please back away&quot; hotkey<br />
<br />
I also have the 0 number on my number keypad set to target nearest mob and the 1 on my number key pad to call and cast malos. This is usually my role on raids and its easy to just hit 0 and 1 when mobs are inc. I made my malos hotkey call when I cast it, not when it landed. (/cast 8, &quot;%t will be struck with malos in 5 seconds&quot;). Since it can't be resisted it makes it easier and gets slows landed faster if the person slowing (or for anyone waiting for malos to land before they cast something) can time their cast to land right after the malos lands instead of waiting for the land message before they start to cast their spell. <br />
<br />
I like to keep all my hotkeys, spell gems, right clicks, group and target areas all close together. Makes it easier to quickly click one then the other, less mouse travel, etc.</div></div><hr />

I especially like ease of read on your spell icons and hit points, as well as their location.  Really easy to glance at your screen to see if Torpor is still up, and when it fades if you need to re-apply it.  Also good for Can V.  <br />
I'll try to figure out how to post mine when I get home.  Everything is default (less laggy for my 64mb graphics card) except for the spell icons and personal information box.  That and my screen resolution only goes up to 1024X768 (darn monitor!).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">A little bit outdated. Buffs box is different now and inventory was reworked slightly to add a couple buttons and a charm slot but otherwise give the general idea. In the action window the bag is always on the right but the slot on the left varries based on what tab your on. Have boots, primary weapon, bp and earring there currently. In the inventory screen the class animation is also the autoequipe drop box and it fades out when you mouse over it to autoequipe something. The _00 thing for the target is long since fixed too =( Kinda just a combination of different things from eqinterfaces with some modifications of my own and a few custom things like the action window.<br />

this is a rip off of Drakah's UI using black and gold textures from Grown3. Modded slightly to add spheres next to group members that go from green to yellow as they lose health and finally blink red when near death.  Has a few other mods you can't see like merchant window that shows all his slots at once and a mod for the loot window to show all slots.  Could be more modded but I've been playing with this one for so long I can't keep up with 'em all; hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Mine is based on Shoggoth's 1280x1024 version, with a custom buff timer added, and replaced his small hitsmode windows with one bigger secondary chat window.  One of the things I like most is the integrated use of the Actions menu, which I like to use as a secondary bank of hotkeys that work during casting.<br />

Wow Roxx I really like that one, is it available for download as is?  And do those timers automatically set when you cast the spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">The timers run constantly;  you move the arrow slider to whereever the bar is at the time you cast the spell, if you want to track it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Here's Mine: Kaal's UI (http://pages.sbcglobal.net/geek/EQFiles/KaalUI.jpg) <br />
<br />
The Mod is called Delta Blue, and is available at: EQ Interface (http://www.eqinterface.com) , Just run a search on Delta, there's several available. I have yet to have a patch make it not function!!!<br />
<br />
The Storyline Mod for Slowable Mobs is available at: Science of War (http://www.scienceofwar.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7122) , Do both option A &amp; B for it to work, their instructions aren't clear. A) is the content and B) is the UI Mod.<br />
<br />
(Not Shown) All Maps (http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=191.topic) , for the ingame cartography system.<br />
<br />
And of course the wonderful timers as explained above, but with some notes:<br />
1. Take into consideration your Ext Buff % when setting up your timers!<br />
2. If you want the timers stretched out like mine, not in a block, use the 3x1 or 6x1, not the 1x3 or 1x6, etc. (Higher number first.)<br />
3. I use the Notes Window for my timers. You can make a key for it, tap it once when you log in. It doesn't poof when you zone or hit the ESC key.</div></div><hr />

I run 1024x768 desktop, so I wanted to write my UI to fit everything I wanted into an 800x600 window.  I chopped off a lot of the frills and extra stuff, condensed down just the raw data I was interested in, and went with it.  I can stack 2 windows on the same PC and dual-box (or quad-box with my notebook PC too), plus when it's just me playing one char, it's a neat, tidy interface with all the facts you need.<br />
<br />
Mostly I'm old school, I keep up with dots in my head, and use a clock (immediately in front of my monitor) for slows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">What I use is mostly Vert...but with a few mods from various people.  The newer versions of Vert have a different inventory, but I prefer this from his older versions so I just keep transferring it.  The spells are TKing, and the chat windows have no &quot;title bar&quot; to save space.  The selector window is from Envigor (I went searching and can no longer find that UI on EQInterface)<br />

LOL. A perfect example of someone who thinks of eq as one big giant IRC channel with pictures-</div></div><hr />
