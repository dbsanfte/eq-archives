If I was looking for a thread on the new expansion, I'd look under the title &quot;New Expansion&quot; before I'd look under &quot;New Patcher Picture.&quot;  Just sayin....</div></div><hr />

The Number One problem with that is that no matter whether you slaughtered them or left them alone the outcome would be the same which is whatever the developers felt like doing.</div></div><hr />

No thanks sony keep your dung pile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm buying it for sure.  Loving Everquest even more after LDON.  Started playing in 2000 and though I did take a longish break think EQ is still the best thing going, even with all the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Unearth arcane spells, mighty weapons and other hidden treasures! <br />
<br />
Arcane spells? is this like the marginally better spells that dropped in sleeper tomb that only one person per server ends up getting?<br />
<br />
I just bought ldon like 2 weeks ago, im not sure if im ready for a new expansion. Sadly, i know im going to buy it eventually. I cant wait for WOW so i cant stop playing this game :/</div></div><hr />

But SOE is like an old pimp trying to sell a tired hooker one last time for the night. <br />
<br />
It is getting old More zones more AA more more more. Except for one thing. More fun. <br />
<br />
The game for me is burning. Guttering out now. More arcade features than you can shake your wallet at. Little story left. And the care and polish of yesteryear is gone. Also this is in part my fault. because I went with the flow and shifted to more of a powergamers stance. Started duel boxing. Started min maxing to a degree, <br />
<br />
I just cant seem to get excited in yet more zones. With no real soul to them. Few gems or unearthed polish that someone lovingly put in. &quot;Just in case&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinks like when Fippy gets to the South Queynos Zone line. the shout he does. (Try charming him to get him past the guards.)<br />
<br />
Or puzjin. The elusive gnome. Or the flavor of howling stones. the risk. The tension. The rewards. not just of loot. but of accomplishment. <br />
<br />
The barfight in Thurg. Or many other little things. The skelaton band in Paineel. <br />
<br />
The responses in MAny zones from the followers of sanctus seru when you said some rude things or mentions he who would not be named! (One of the only cool things in Luclin that actually worked)<br />
<br />
The feel of watching the stampede go by. (Pretty much the last and only cool as hell thing I saw in PoP.)<br />
<br />
No the game isnt dying. and yes I am probably burned out. And no noone can have my stuff and I am not quitting. <br />
<br />
But I can't help but feel a large measure of disgust at a company. that so blatently sells the old lady across the street as a virgin. When it will be the same old tired bones. Wearing a mask of caked on makeup. All fire and innocence lost in the wear and tear of years gone by.<br />

Familiarity breeds contempt.<br />
<br />
Frankly I still enjoy it, I'm way past bitching about every little nuance of the game and just enjoy playing with my friends. Simple strategy I know but works for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree entirely.  I think as long as there is fun to be had (and there is) then the game shouldn't be called broken.  I think there is something in our competitive mindset that makes the game more stressful and more work.  Like we need to get the next expansion or else we'll be left behind and subpar.  Just take a real break, and I'm sure you'll come back and have alot more fun.  I've been playing since 2000 and the times I've had the most fun, besides playing my main from 1-20 were times when I came back to the game after my computer broke down or something else came up.  When you come back, yes others will be farther along than you will, but you'll catch up, (actually whenever I came back I was usually surprised that my friends hadn't gotten too far) and you'll be better off for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its overkill (<br />
<br />
guess sony realises that thers better stuff coming online form other companies, and is deperately trying to screw the punters as fast as it can.<br />
<br />
I may buy this in march, but not before.</div></div><hr />

You say they are screwing the punters, yet you bend over for more?<br />
<br />
Why wait till March, bend over in advance.<br />
<br />
Honestly some people here would bitch if they won lotto.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What SOE forgot to mention is that instanced content is made for 48-54 man raids. That's right, after having guilds channeled into 72+ man zerg armies thanks to Rathe, Coirnav and Time, they are basically doing an LDoN 1.5. Not to mention only half of the expansion is instanced, and the rest is again perfectly open for guilds to grief eachother, cockblock and race for entertainment content in a PvE game! Yay! SOE designers are stupid monkeys. They never learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, im not bitching about SoE, i have had alot of fun in EQ. I think i have just seen it all. Its all the same thing, grind grind grin for levels and AA. Just new areas to do it in. I have no where to go with my shaman unless its raid encounters and i cant get into a guild that does the level of content i need cause i dont play 5 days a week.<br />
<br />
Seriously i cant pass a guilds minimum raiding requirement, that raids RZ and elemental level, so im stuck just before elemental and i have no way to progress unless i want to forfiet my nightly life to this game. Ive seen all the lower levels and LDoN is nice and all, but its just another way to grind.  <br />
<br />
Ive always been a explorer, i like going into uncharted areas and finding new things, doing fun quests, but there is none of that in EQ for me anymore. Sometimes its just time to move on and i think for me the time has come /shrug<br />
<br />
EQ is a great game though and im sure will be giving many people pleasure for a logn time and i dont think its broke... its just old ....<br />
<br />
Thats why i want WoW, its completely different, the style of animation is more fantasy based, the lands and lore are completly new, its a new world for me to conquer :)</div></div><hr />
