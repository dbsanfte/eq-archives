I have a 53 Barb shammy and I would say I solo about 99% of the time.  I am going to try to get a new expansion but not sure what one to get and want your input.<br />
<br />
Like I said I solo most of the time and I have all expansion up to and including POP. Now money only lets me got 1 expansion for now so I'm call on all you experts to lead me in the right direction. Also a something to keep in mind is that is important to me is trying to get desent drops or good farming places. I'm trying to get some money in the bank to equip myself a bit better and get a horse.<br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance<br />

As a soloer at your level, I would imagine you could get the most mileage out of OOW. Dranik's Scar should be right around your level, if not a touch higher. I don't think you'll be able to handle any of the expeditions or Noble's Causeway for awhile, but they're there for when you level up. My next choice would be GOD ... you can solo in just about any of the non-keyed zones as you level up. Natimbi and Qinimi are good places to start out in.<br />

I have to agree that GOD would be a good place to level overall, given its wide variety of mob types and places to exp either solo or grouped, but I have to disagree (you know me Tordail:) ) on OoW as a good choice for a solo player in their 50s. DS mobs are nothing to play around with, even at light blue/green the Kyv can occasionally proc Chaos Claws on me with resists in the 150s....its a 400ish point nuke, nothing to sneeze at when your level 53, Virtue or no.<br />
I would have to vote LoY as a most excellent solo expansion...MULTIPLE spots for single pull loot camps, exp bonuses in most if not all the zones, decent cash loots, if somewhat mediocre items (at least in comparison), and to top it all off the mobs arent that hard at all.<br />
You can go from 53 to 56 or so in Dulak (more if you arent in any real hurry), then move to the Mines and go to near 60, get your LoY level 44 heal Stoicism which would help your solo power immensly till you get to 60 and maybe acquire Torpor (thank God its cheap these days).<br />
LoY is a oft overlooked expansion, but it shouldnt be :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Helf is right though, LOY is a great expansion for soloing at your level, and he's entirely correct -- I overlooked it. I would have to put it at #1 for your level then ... and after that GOD and then OOW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I second LoY. still farm there at 64, &amp; soulstrippers still sell for 4k. You should check out the EQ platinum pack. 7 expansions in a box for the price of one downloaded one - probably less at Frys or Best Buy.</div></div><hr />
