<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is it with the spell?  I have turned in about 10 parchments to the BL spell chic and the only spells I have been rewarded with are 1 x Spirit of Arag, 1 x Spiritual Vigor, and like 8 copies of Scorpion Venom. Scorpion Venom must be a crap spell as I can't even give them away.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else trying to get Infusion of Spirit and getting similar results to mine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far I just made one attempt and got a Spirit of Arag.  I sent tells to the handful of visible 58+ beastlords that were on at the time and was told alternately that Infusion is really rare, it's really common, and it's average.  I was also told that Spirit of Arag is really rare, is really common, and is about average.  I think it's just plain random.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*update* turned in 3 more to receive 2 more copies of healing of sorsha and 1 copy of scorpion venom /rude</div></div><hr />

Description: This spell increases a range of melee statistics.<br />
It's quite a nice buff if you don't have a Shaman around to raise your overall ATK rating and hitpoints.<br />
 <br />
It is 61 Bst spell (means yu have to turn in ethereal prachments for it) but it is 49 shm usuable. If I could sell the other crap BL spells I might actually turn in all my parchments for IoS and sell it for 5k to lower level shamans. Bet I could make a ton of money.<br />
<br />
Stacks with everything but FoS and HoS. My clerics love it because it adds 200 hps and doesnt overwrite their self mana buff. So at 55 you could use Kragg and IoS for more hps than FoS. I think I had 150 more than FoS, but it is a pain to keep both up really.<br />
<br />
I got it on my first parchemnt turn in. I also got True Spirit on my first turn in too. Anyone wanna rub my belly for luck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Noruff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got the Spell for 1500pp in the Basar... <br />
Nice for Clerics as stated above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this spell had its slot assignmentss changed an test according to lucy. Doesn anyone know what this will do to the stacking issues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 more parchments...2 new copies of Scorpion Venom.  Naturally, that same night, 2 copies of Arag and 3 copies of Venom appeared on someone's Trader, so now what I haven't isn't even much to trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PE+Sta+IoS = happy cleric<br />
<br />
Some caster classes like it too, but melee don't want it over focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IoS does not stack with Yaulp 5, so if your cleric melee's or uses Yaulp 5 to get mana back - the IoS is useless. Other then that, I one day figured that why not try to get it. I had all 61 and 62 spells and still had 5 etheral parchments in my pack. Went to BST vendor, turned one parchment in and ding! Received IoS. Fast and nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/scowls at Banadan, ready to attack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Finally got it on my 5th parchment turn in :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All's well that ends well.  My sweetie, also a shaman, got me a copy on his very first parchment, and got himself another one with his second parchment.  I think that beastlord wench was kissing up to my man!<br />
<br />
Gave away one of the Scorpion Venoms to a beastlord who was very helpful in my quest for IoS, sold another in Bazaar for 1.5k, and gave the Arag and last SV to the guild bank.<br />
<br />
Course then I dinged 60 last night and now have Focus :rolleyes: but it'll still be nice for clerics and soloing, methinks.</div></div><hr />
