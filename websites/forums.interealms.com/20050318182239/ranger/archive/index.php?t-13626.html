<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dlaritan</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With Ferocity 3, and combat fury 1.  I am parsing my melee damage to be equal, and somtimes even more than my AM3 damage... especially when I dont have a shaman in the group to get my dex over 255.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seeing this in their parsings?<br />
<br />
Im using a Bow of the Silver Fang with Shadow Acrylia Arrows (/rude Tunare) for archery and<br />
<br />
Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana/Swiftwind for melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage tables for melee go up, but not for archery.  As a result I was outdamaging my primal bow by about 10% with melee using a AHB/claw of vyzh`dra.  When I got a bow of shadows from VT though archery was in the lead again.<br />
<br />
I think you have to have a damn good bow now to outdo melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telerion Cuthalion</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed a number of fights in PoV the last days on golems and spiders.<br />
<br />
With archery AM3 (not maxed dex btw) and Twisted Longbow I got from 110 dps to 140 dps, only trueshot run I had was on a rare and parsed to 236 dps.<br />
<br />
Melee (ambidexterity, no pop aa skills yet) with Braided Strands of Corrupted mana/Swiftwind parsed to 85 to 90 dps.<br />
<br />
Only level 62 though, so my melee damage will scale up with my leveleling and the melee pop aa skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montecrizto</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ermm my archery damage table went up some I think?  Just maybe not enough to be effective compared to the increase in melee, but max hit went up about 20 points.<br />
<br />
Actually thinking about it, max hit really only went up about 5 points (about the same as melee went up) but turns into 20 with x4 bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max hit on archery scaled up also.  New max hit is about 40 pts higher than it was before if I'm remembering right.  From like 536 to about 570 with primal/champion.  Would be surprised to see melee outdo archery in PoP.  Very surprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed the same thing, actualy my melee was higher than archery with only ferocity 1, while my bow may not be the greatests bow, neither is my melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bow / weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dlaritan</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So with melee outdmging archery again?  Should I go get a good stat range item? or use some merit on a hand of the master?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing that should be taken into consideration is that most Rangers are using 33/35 bows or even 30/36 bows for a long time, while there are better tier meele weapons readily availeable from either easy encounters, or from the market.<br />
<br />
Good bows in SoL are still sparse, there isnt much between bow of Doom, and Bow of Shadows/Bow of War is MUCH harder to obtain than lets say improvement weapons to Doomshade's Shadowheart/Mithril Short Sword<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider is the max dex variable, it seems that at Maximum, Archery still does better damage, but thats the condition, 255 dex or more (depending on level and cap change)<br />
<br />
Id like to see the Dps comparison on lets say the Elven Bow of Mysticistm Vs comparable Rng meele weapons.<br />
<br />
And regardless, AM3 still murders mobs when Trueshot is applied to it.<br />
Am3 + EQ being roughly equivalent to monk dps seems about balanced as its a royal pain in the butt to use Archery, and some fights, well it aint useable in.<br />
monk - 120 Dps<br />
rng - 100-110 dps AM, 90-100 meele, seems about fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziguld</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While grinding away in PoV we ran some numbers.  Had a high DPS group 2 rog, rng, war, brd, shm and a cleric/enc outside group being twobox'd<br />
<br />
All at max haste, all with Rizola's, DotB, SotP, SoT, WS of Zek.<br />
<br />
Both rogues where using Khalhaszar and Massive Heartwood Thorn.  They averaged aprox 183DPS with procs included.<br />
The war was using Scepter of Destruction and Vyha'dra Render of Souls.  He averaged aprox 139 with procs.<br />
I'm not even gonna list my duel weild melee DPS... Emp's been a stingy bastard, no AHBS for me too ashamed of the numbers.  Using a Windblade for 2hs I was averaging 117.  With Primal/Blessed I was doing aprox 159.<br />
<br />
One of the rogues only had ferocity 1, crit 3, and ambidex(172dps), the other had ferocity 3, crit 5, and ambidex(194dps).<br />
The War had Flurry 1, Ferocity 3, Ingenuity 1, Crit 3 and ambidex.<br />
I had AM3/EQ, Crit3, Ferocity3, Punishing Blade 1.<br />
<br />
These are just round numbers being posted, all rounded up/down to nearest number.<br />
<br />
Trueshot disc definatly works out much better since most if not all mobs in PoP have no AC.  Best run was an Aerin'Dar run, hit 344dps ^_^  but I cheat, I had a bard for the first 30 seconds of it.<br />
<br />
edit: for some stupid reason i keep calling Punishing Blade Unstoppable Force, dunno where i originally got it. dont mind that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what is unstoppable force?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaem</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bow of the Silver Fang is, evidently, going to have a much lower DPS value than say, a Primal Bow - over any melee weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vermillion</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done some casual parsing in PoV vs the Razorfiend's and Golems in the cave area. I'm at 270 str 270 dex 1600+ atk EQ + AM 3 with War Bow of Rallos Zek and only CF 1 .. looking at 200 dps average, sometimes over 300 a few times below 100. All depending on the Tank positioning the mob in a ranger friendly way.<br />
<br />
Melee DPS for Braided Strands/Elphorn's CLeaver is about  100 - 110 dps.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Icye</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Archery and Melee the same well GREAT hehehe that sucks alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About two points from Fero3 now, hopefully after tomorrow I'll be able to do some parsing and see if this bs really is true...  Gonna be quite unhappy is 9 pts of Fero ends up being a better return than 27 pts of archery skills.  I mean, ya, more dmg will be cool on mobs where we can't use a bow, but still...<br />
<br />
Edit - Oh, and btw, anyone know what our double attack percentage is supposed to be before training this skill?  I ran about a 7 hour log of it last night and out of about 15k cycles of atk, I only dbled 3k of them, so like 20%...  which seems *extremely* low.  Would say its just a bad run, but a 15k sample size... heh.  Dunno.  Was with 170 dex btw.  Did it while I was sleeping, so didn't have avatar up or nothing, if that even matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanilya</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read a table long ago, which at lvl 60 gave the following results:<br />
<br />
30% chance for single attack<br />
40% chance for double attack<br />
20% chance for triple attack<br />
10% chance for quadruple attack<br />
<br />
It was meant for 'melees', but dont know if its still up-to-date.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BanyenXev</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting discovery Dlar, would be interested to see someone with Endgame Bow and Weapons run a test like this.  Even if Fero 3 comes within 10 or 15dps of AM3 thats for 1/3 the AA.</div></div><hr />
