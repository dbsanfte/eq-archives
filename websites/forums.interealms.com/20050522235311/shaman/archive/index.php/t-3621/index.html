<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, just recently hit lvl24 with my shaman.  I just came back to the game after quitting for a little while, so I started from scratch and created a shaman as my new main.  I got a few questions...<br />
<br />
Now that I'm getting into the mid-level game, I'm noticing that shamans and enchanters share a few similar abilities, when it comes to debuffing.  My question is: what stacks with what?  Are the debuffs of a equivolent level chanter better than my debuffs?  I always thought shaman slows and debuffs were the best in the game, but I've learned that if a chanter is in the group that I can't override their slow... and what-not...  so how do I work in conjunction with the chanter?  And when do shaman debuffs exceed chanter debuffs, if ever?  <br />
<br />
Also, I'm really interested to know what a Troll looks like in Form of the Great Bear, the lvl 55 version.  I've only seen barb shamans in polar bear form, but I hear that Trolls turn into a huge black bear.  I've never seen one.  Does anyone have a SS of that so I can see it?<br />
<br />
That's it for now :)  I'm loving regen and cannibalize!  Can't wait 'til lvl 29 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my personal experience I found that at lvl 24 anything that wasn't canni, regen, or the new dot was pretty useless and ineffective for the mana cost. <br />
<br />
I pretty much just stuck with root dotting, hardly ever bothering with the that slow or debuff. I found the next slow pretty gud though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enchanter slows occasionally are better than shaman in the mid-level range, but it's always just a few %, nothing to get too worked up over.  If the chanter is a higher level than you, you won't be able to overwrite their debuff.<br />
<br />
The slows weren't all that significant yet, wait a couple more levels for those enchanters to slap the mob and the mob comes back &amp; slaps the enchanter hard.  They'll be more than happy to have you slowing.<br />
<br />
Bear form:  Nope, everyone is polar-bear shaped at lvl 55+  Sorry to break the bad news to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haste:  enchanter haste is better.<br />
<br />
Slows: Shaman slows are better at the high end, during the midlevels it fluctuates a bit depending on the various levels.  we get our best slow at lvl 51, chanters have to wait until lvl 57.  <br />
<br />
Debuffs: both classes have identical melee debuffs (str, agi, AC, etc).  Enchanters get a unresistable Magic Only debuff.  we get a resistable Magic, Fire, Cold, Poison debuff.  So generally ours is superior.  But at your current level it's not a big thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, the color of the bear with Form of the Great Bear (55) is dependent upon the race of the caster.  As a troll, I'm black in bear form.  Barbs are white, ogres are brown.  I forget what color cats &amp; lizards are since I don't run into many of them...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In most experience group settings, it is expected that:<br />
<br />
1)  the shaman will slow, not the chanter, because we can take the beating from an aggro'ed mob much better than the chanter<br />
<br />
2)  let the cleric AC buff, because his are better, but shaman covers all other stat buffs (our HP buffs stack with cleric ones, even where his are better)<br />
<br />
3)  the chanter will haste because his are better, but you must haste if no chanter unless bard around, then discuss with the bard who will haste.<br />
<br />
4) discuss whether shammy, druid or ranger will keep up SOW, until you get group SOW then you do it for added ATK buff on ours<br />
<br />
5) consensus is that the disempower/listless power/incapacitate/cripple line, shared at same levels with chanter,  is a waste of mana until you get to high level (50+) mobs that flurry, etc.<br />
<br />
6) discuss with druid who will keep up regen/chloroplast/regrowth on the tanks taking damage, where needed<br />
<br />
7) where magic resist debuffing needed, chanter will lead with their unresistable debuff (tash line) then shammy or mage (discuss, but try to get mage to do it to save you mana) will hit with malise/malisement/malosi/malosini line. <br />
<br />
8) finally, best tip for working with chanters--never DOT a mob which may need to be mezzed!  You just made the mob unmezzable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cool, thanks for the info.  Roxxanne gives excellent advice for working with other classes.  And evidently I'll be a black bear :)  I like that, but I want to see one still....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oki... sometimes this pretty troll transforms into this terrifying creature<br />
<br />
http://www4.tripnet.se/~feline/eq/mumssig.gif <br />
<br />
and runs around scaring all the froggies in da swamp<br />
<br />
<br />
Lizards look the same as us trolls when in bearform<br />
<br />
Ogres and Vah Shirs are not fat and brown and OOGly as some misinformed you about earlier... but rather brown and cuddly the teddybear way :p<br />
<br />
...and finally we have the Barbs that gets turned into rectangular bears after a coordinate transform (polarbears, for those with slow minds at this early hour)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Awesome!  Thanks, that's what I wanted to see :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Roxxanne sums it up pretty well, but I'll add a caveat - what she says is the IDEAL way, but depending on mana and your other responsibilities, you have to be flexible.  i.e. if there is no cleric and you are acting as healer, by all means let the enchanter slow.<br />
<br />
And do touch base with the enchanter, mage, cleric, whatever where you know your abilities overlap to make sure that THEY understand where the line is, too.<br />
<br />
Also, if there's no chanter, you will generally be on root-park duty (or kite-park if there's room).  Your slow spell is a good taunt to get the mob on you, and if that doesn't work, DOT them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For additional taunt, to get a mob into a position where it can be rooted, sit down.<br />
<br />
Stand up before it hits you though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Huh...   Color me learned.  We have an Iksar shaman in the guild and I could of sworn he was a polar bear also.  Learn something every day.<br />
