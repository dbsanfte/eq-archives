<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if it is normal for me to get as many tells as i do to go do a single group exp hunt in POG.  I get asked nightly, by people i dont know, twice even on some nights.  Hmm maybe i should consider myself lucky???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Perhaps they just want to tap into your abundant supply of question marks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been asked a few times, and the xp is decent.  Always been a lot of fun doing single group in there so far.<br />
<br />
Certainly haven't been asked nightly though.  Maybe once I ding 60 here soon, but Quellious also has an abundance of shamans.  What server are you on?</div></div><hr />
