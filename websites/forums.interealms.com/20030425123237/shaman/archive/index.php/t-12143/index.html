<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">bowling for columbine (lower case for no respect) won an academy award this year for best documentary. michael moore (fat piece of shet) used his 45 seconds to exercise his freedom of speech (however ignorant he may have sounded) to lambast the President, and criticize the war.<br />
<br />
Fair enough. Sadly mr. moore is woefully oblivious to the irony that if he criticized saddam hussein he would be quickly dead in iraq. But I digress.  The point of this thread lies elsewhere.<br />

<br />
While I personally don't agree with Bush's political views, I still have to accept them as an American citizen (what else can I do?  They will happen regardless of what I say or do).  Arguing about them and lambasting him will do no one any good, regardless of how much I oppose certain decisions.<br />
<br />
I personally feel everyone just needs to chill out, rationally decide what their true views/opinons are, and defend them without spitting fire.<br />
<br />
As for the Michael Moore article, well that's some pretty heavy stuff, but still he's got the right . . . /shrug</div></div><hr />

 I read that, is pretty silly. I don't think anyone respects this idiot, when it comes to hollywood I have to just giggle sometimes, it is a bunch of people with low educations, huge amounts of money, sure it is easy to bitch when you got nothing better to do.<br />
<br />
Like or not, Bush is a good man, and a good president. Everyone seems to love Clinton, and Clinton was a horrible president compared to Bush, Clinton sent forces wherever he felt like it, with no UN discussion, and peace activists praise him, Bush tries to go with the UN, goes alone, and now he is turned in to a villian?<br />
<br />
<br />
Some people are just stupid, and peace activists are just that, idiots with little to no formal education, speaking out of their butt crack with tons of cash.<br />

Well, even after an 8 year presidency, he never managed to gain a majority of the US vote either Mill - maybe just LOUD people liked him. :D  I was in an especially tough position during the Clinton administration - officer in the military with an idiot like Clinton as my Commander in Chief.  I didn't particularly like to tell my troops, &quot;Do as I say, not as HE does!&quot; :(<br />
<br />
I didn't think Clinton was a horrible president, just well below average.  However, Clinton was clearly a horrible individual by almost any standard you apply.<br />

No Artical 88 for you :).<br />
<br />
Clinton was a dispicable person lacking any moral character, and he has not changed.<br />
<br />
Bowling for Columbine is clearly a work of propaganda / fiction but don't dismiss the impact of the film.  I recently came across a story that reported how popular this fill is in some foreign markets and is quite a hot ticket in Japan.<br />
<br />
America bashing has become a profitable enterprise.  All you have to do is lie and fabricate and you will find a compliant audiance in lots of nations and our own universities.  It is amazing how well you can do if you just provide slop to the intelectual pigs of the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Guess I just hate Clinton. He didn't care for the military much, nor did his fat pig of a wife, and that pisses me off, he was a draft dodger wasn't he?<br />
<br />
Bush flew fighter planes in the guards didn't he? Not that he was not a party boy, heh I respect that, but once you get in the White house, shouldn't be like a frat party.<br />
<br />
Look at Somalia, if Bush did that he would have been killed.<br />
<br />
Also, people place too much blame on economic woes or good times on the President, he really doesn't have a whole lot to do with it. Bush didn't inherit such a great economy, it was already sliding, and 9/11 really screwed it too.<br />
<br />
I think it was columbia university that recently ruled it's students could not fly american flags out fo their window, because it would offend anti-war protesters, **** what is this country coming to!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Moore is a self-promoting creep like a guy on the right that I will not mention.  It is freaks like this guy who have almost ruined the Democratic Party.  Yeah I am a proud Democrat.  Harry Truman is my hero.  And before you right-wing types start wooting and jeering, think for a second; would you want a single party system like Iraq, Nazi Germany or USSR?  As a patriotic American I want the people to have a choice between two candidates with differing but intelligent viewpoints.  I want the Congress populated with Bob Doles and Dan Inouyes.  These two guys have been friends since they met up in a rehab hospital after literally giving their right arms for our freedom in WWII.  I know that it is possible for Democrats and Republicans to be friends.  I have a few Republican friends that I rather like.<br />
<br />
I have a real problem with Hollyweird, but much to their credit Moore got more Boos than cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Moore may not be the sort of person that you would invite home to meet your mother. I havent seen &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, but I read &quot;Stupid White Men&quot;. You don't have to be Albert Einstein to realise that he has put a certain amount of &quot;spin&quot; on his work (some would say enough to make it self-standing, just from gyroscopic effects). Neverthless, I think it is fair to say that some of what he says is the (painful) truth.<br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks that there is not corruption in upper levels of geovernment is naive. Anyone who thinks that industry does not purchase political favor (both legally and illegally) is naive. Bush and many of his administration's connections with the oil industry, and other big industry are public record, and one may draw ones own conclusions as to the morality of their racord in thse matters.<br />
<br />
So, while much of what Moore says is blown out of proportion,  and much is hyperbole and half-truth (and some of it is probably pure invention and/or speculation), there is some truth to it. I would argue that we need the Michael Moores of this world. We don't have to like him. We don't have to respect him, but we do need people like him to remind us that politics is, almost by definition, corrupt. Given the &quot;hollywoodisation&quot; of journalism, Moore is almost the logical progression from the guys who brought us Watergate, Irangate, Whitewatergate, etc.<br />
<br />
So, while I don't much care for Moore, nor his methods, I would not have him silenced. Having said all of that, his outburst at the Oscars was tactless and in poor taste and showed serious lack of judgement or empathy with public opinion. He gets no kudos from me for that - and you know my stance on this war.</div></div><hr />

If I walked out in the hall and starting blurting racist things, boom, fired instantly, yet a Columbia U. professor wants american troops to shoot their officers, hopes america loses, says Iraqis are heroes, and 103 members of congress write a letter to the head of CU asking to fire the guy, they refused.<br />
<br />
Sometime, you should kill your fellow man when they are evil. Evil = bad.<br />
<br />
If I saw Michael Moore, I wouldn't kill him, as I don't want to go to jail, but I likely would smack him around some, maybe take a pee on him. Something minor, simple assault aint too bad, would be worth it.<br />
<br />
If somone happened to blow his legs off with a shotgun, then put them in a meat grinder in front of him so he knew they could never be put back on, well, I would stand by and watch, and give a big smile. He deserves it, the piece of garbage.<br />

 Like I care why? You one of them wussy crunchy types too? Then maybe your legs should be blown off with a shotgun too, if you actually are defending a human piece of refuse like that.<br />
<br />
 Look, if I wanted respect, I wouldn't try on a  message board. Especially one with a strong crunchy presence. Yes, I would honestly love to see michael moore's legs blown off with a shotgun, does that make me a bad person? What the hell else you gonna do with those damn fine american double barrel shotguns?<br />
<br />
It is people like you that will be eating their words someday soon, only a friggin retard from the deepest pool of stupidity thinks being a traitor to your country should be defended, and that war solves nothing.<br />
<br />
Traitors should be killed, and I would happily be the hangman, if the govt. would allow it.<br />
<br />
Death to all traitors, and a pox on all message board tards!<br />
<br />
Oh by the way, probably something way above your level of intel, but read my posts closely, besides some strong pro-americanism, I also tend to put alot of things in there that shouldn't be taken literally, and are for humor purposes.<br />
<br />
I DO think that traitors, convicted by trial, should be killed. However, unless they have been tried, I was joking about blowing legs off with a shotgun, even I think it is kind of gruesome and a little over the top. Would be funny for the person watching, but prety crappy for the stumpy guy. Use your head and try to differentiate between seriousness and dumbass message board bluster.<br />
<br />
And, at least give a reason why you don't like somone, would be cool to debate that, can't really debate &quot;i have no respect for you&quot;, is a two year old's insult mentality.<br />
<br />
I don't like you because you said you don't respect me, there, and you seem to want to defend michael moore, a piece of trash that should be tried, convicted, and hung.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Michael Moore has a lot of gumption. He isn't afraid to go up to public figures and make settings of normalcy spin into chaos. I gotta give him props for that.<br />
<br />
But I don't think he's intentionally trying to undermine America. I think he's given into temptation. He one day realized the power was in his hands. He had all the cameras, the editing rooms, the film expertise, and no one else to mitigate what he can do. With everything in his control, he realizes the temptation of propoganda is to control people's outlook, however false it can be. If he finds it within his power to convince people that the earth is flat as a pancake and the sun is a big zillion watt bulb orbiting it, he'll do it. NOT because he thinks it's right, but because he has the power to do it.<br />
<br />
Contrast this with the news media: they have even more power to mislead. The most successful ones realize at some point that credibility equals ratings. Thus, more corporate sponsorship and more money. The less credible ones sell the National Enquirer to trailer trash. Not as much revenue there.<br />
<br />
Michael Moore doesn't have this system of checks and balances. He's not in it for the money. He's in it because he sees himself as somebody who has the ability to influence the thoughts of millions. It's not for any political agenda that he's doing it. He just likes the attention it gets him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Moore may have been extreme leftist, but don't generalize the rest of liberals.<br />
<br />
Not that many agree with him in making such action in the ceremony.  It was just inappropriate.<br />
<br />
Clinton was a talented president, although severely lacked in discipline.  He was willing to meet halfway between liberals and conservatives to pass many bills.  <br />
<br />
All Bush has accomplished so far is in military.  Very few, or none, of his major controversial agendas got through.<br />
<br />
And the excitement, the action, the audience, the popularity, etc. just love crisis president.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">AvalanchW,<br />
<br />
 Clinton ignored the UN completely, Bush tried to go through the UN and failed, and got killed for it by the liberals. All the hollywood crunchies supported Clinton, for doing the same damn thing Bush is doing, but without trying the UN.<br />
<br />
Clinton wanted to bomb somone, he just did it.<br />
<br />
What did Clinton really accomplish? Do people really, honestly think the President really does alot with the economy? Clinton sure as hell didn't help me as a middle american person. He embarrased me.<br />
<br />
Clinton hated the military as wel, and his fat pig of a wife was super anti-military, talk about unamerican.<br />

It is easy to be a dumbass when you make alot of money in hollywood, if michael moore was a steel worker or something, he wouldnt be such a douche-bag, his co-workers would beat his ass and he would be fired.<br />

He did lessen Budget deficit, get into healthcare, welfare, social security, medicare.  He's involved in several international trade agreements, NAFTA, WTO, etc.<br />
<br />
There's his effort for peace between Israel and Palestine, and it looks almost damn possible at that time.<br />

So far Bush is creating the largest deficit in history.  Those money you are getting back are severely hurting the government.  Of course,  no one care.  <br />

Oh, and it is NOT the biggest defecit in history, if you go by actual %, it is just the biggest because of inflation.<br />
<br />
And do you not think 9/11, enron, the struggling economy contributes to this? You think Clinton would have done any better? How? By screwing another intern and badmouthign his military?<br />
<br />
Clinton could have nailed Bin Laden too, but supposedly he was too busy playing golf to bother get involved in an operation that would have nailed him.<br />
<br />
Clinton sucked, Bush has nuts, and he is doing damn good in a time where our country is being hurt by terrorists and corporate greed. Clinton had the helm during a peaceful prosperous time, none of which was his own making.<br />

I had to pay assloads amount of money for Health insurance, much, much worse % wize then early 90's, thank you Clinton!! Not!<br />
<br />
How many uninsured americans do we have? How rampant is the cost of health insurance? He may have tried, but he has accomplished about 0.<br />
<br />
Clinton had NOTHING to do with our economy in the 90's, if anyone did, Greenspan did. But still, presidents take the rap for failure or success of any given economy.<br />
<br />
Clinton is rated middle of the pack in terms of overall effectiveness, yet 5th in economic success, good for him. I haven't seen any benefits. Even before 9/11 the job sector sucked, that sure wasnt bush.<br />
<br />
People get so stupid about touting somone's success when they had nothing to do with it. Presidents dont effect economies, business does.<br />
<br />
No, bush hasnt done a whole lot right now, he is still a fairly yougn president, who had other things to think about besides himself, his interns, and harrasing the military.<br />
<br />
Bush leads, and is decisive, Clinton let the feds handle the economy, he didnt &quot;lead&quot; anything there, which is as it should be.<br />
<br />
Presidents make policy, and can take charge militarily, but they can't do jack about the economy, they are simply blamed, or touted when an economy fails or succeeds.<br />
<br />
And you say outside military, like that is a side thing, it is the most important things a president can do, period. History won't remember Clinton, he didnt do anything that matters. Reagan(fall of communism) Bush Sr.(Gulf war) Bush Jr.(now), Kennedy(Cuban Missle crisis) FDR(WW2)  etc.<br />
<br />
Who cares about a womanizing hillbilly? Suppose you think Carter was a good president cause he loves peace and failed militarily?<br />
<br />
President is commander in chief and charged with security of the country, thats all I care about, because nothing he does or says can influence the economy with any real signifigance. Even when the economy does not do well, Presidents who kick ass are remembered highly.<br />
<br />
If anything, I would blame the economy greatness of the 90's on the advance so quickly of computer technology. I suppose clinton did that to eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now the critics are rating Kennedy at the grade of C+.  Because missile crisis is literally his only major accomplishment.<br />
<br />
On the other side, Carter is being looked at in different light.  He did end the hostility between Isarael and Egypt and won the Nobel for that, without the use of military.  The attitude from Latin America got better a bit because of the return of Panama Canal.  And also initiated Energy policy, this term is being brought up by Bush Admin.<br />
<br />
He's getting ranked around Reagan right now in term of accomplishment.  I'm too lazy to find links right now.<br />
<br />
So now you're saying President should only be judged in term of military accomplishment.<br />
<br />
GOOD GOING!<br />
<br />
You're right, no one will remember Clinton.  I have no doubt.  It's unfortunate only crisis president get the fame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">IT may be sad, but unfortunately, untill we give presidents more power in internal issues, they won't be remembered for much, when is the last internal thing you remember a president doing? They are so mired in political bickering and one-uppance they rarely can get anything done. I am surprised the US is as good as it is considering the totally retarded democrat/republican system. Greedy, ass-kissing back stabbers all I say. Ya I like Bush, but only in comparison to others.<br />
<br />
And believe it ro not, I was going to mention the kennedy thing, if not for the Cuban missle crisis, and his assasination, he would be forgotten by now. Military things just impact harder. Carter though, he way screwed up that hostage thing, people look down upon that. He is way too anti-war right now, borderline treasonous I think.<br />
<br />
I must admit though, I do not know much about Carter, I never really cared, I was a little too young back then to really take an interest. I liked Reagan because he was a strong man as well. But still, I was too young to have any impact on my life, bush, clinton, bush is all that really mattered personally to me.<br />
<br />
I, personally, like a president who is strong, even in the face of international politics, and who I believe to be a morally straight person. I do not think Clinton was, I thought he was too much of a weasel. And I strongly hate him for the crap he pulled with the military, I gotta dig some of this up. You would be amazed at the flagrant disregard for military and security Clinton had. He used the military when he needed em, but crapped on em all the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
I also admire bush for pulling out of the treaties he has, I would feel great with an anti-missle defense system, and I am sick of the USA footing the brunt of the bill for global enviornmental issues.<br />
<br />
Alot of presidents don't have to deal with much in terms of security to the country, but the ones that do, need to be strong. I am very glad Bush is there, he will defend us, being isolationists will not work forever on a planet with exponential population growth, remember, US at least attempts to use birth control, we will be a tiny, tiny minority because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I am constantly amazed that people are so stupid as to credit Clinton with the economy of the 90s and the balancing of the federal budget.<br />
<br />
If Clinton was responsible what did he do?<br />
<br />
The normal response to this simple question is that that Clinton's 93 &quot;stimulous package&quot; ( tax increase ) saved the economy.<br />
<br />
Clinton took office at the end of a minor resesion and then held office through one of the longerst and largest economic expansions in American history.  If you want to give Clinton credit then you must demonstrate casality.<br />
<br />
Presidents can have some impact on the economy through budget and tax policy and the Fed can have some through monitary policy, but Clinton raised taxes and also raised spending.  The only reason the budget balanced is because the economy whent through a huge speculative bubble in internet / high teck stocks and tax receits to the treasury grew at a rate slighty faster then new spending.<br />
<br />
Some 3 years ago this bubble burst and prices of stocks in the most speculative part of the market have lost 90% of their market cap.<br />
<br />
The current bear market is a large as the one that started in 73 and to find one that was biger you must go back the great crash of 29.  The crash of 29 was followed by the great depreshion.  The bear market of 73 was followed by huge inflation and double diget unenployment.  Considering current economic conditions,  Bush / Greenspan (mostly Greenspan ) have done a great job on the economy even without considering the economic impact of 9.11.1 and our military operations.<br />
<br />
Is the budget in trouble?  You bet it is and only a moron would be surprised by this.<br />
<br />
We are in a historicly large bear market and we are at war.  <br />
<br />
Great men are forged in times of crisis.<br />
<br />
Clinton will go down in history as one of the worst presidents in we have ever known.  Bush may very well rank as one of the best.<br />
<br />
Clinton was perhaps the smartest man to hold the presidance in modern times.  What a dam shame that he was so flawed of character and so devoid of substance that he wasted his opertunity on blow jobs and focus groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Enough with this damn &quot;what if&quot; game.  This can be used on both side of the argument, and it's not gonna prove anything.<br />
<br />
Bring up some facts and prove something.  I KNOW for a fact budget deficit was undercontrolled under his admin.  I KNOW for a fact that USA just faced the biggest deficit in history under Bush's admin and he lost millions by withdrawing from treaties. I KNOW several bills were passed focusing on environmental issues and education.   <br />
<br />
I ask again, what did Bush accomplish beside military.</div></div><hr />

g) during his last days in office he gave more pardons then any president in history including a group of terrorist from Portorico and a number people that made large donations to the DNC or gave his bother in law cash LoL.<br />
h) He reluctanty signed welfare reform on the third time it was sent to his desk and at the same time promised to fix it ( I saw it live on c-span).  When the bill proved to be a great success he took credit for it.<br />
i)  he got H. Clinton to shut up about socializing health care after he lost the house in 94 :).<br />
j) he signed more executive orders then any other president in the history of the united states.<br />
k) he drank java in the white house with more people then any other president in the history of America.<br />
l) by exacutive order, he moved the power to review certain contracts between comunist china and Loral from the state department to comerce where the contracts where aproved over the objections of state.  Loral then helped China solve sertain balistic missle guidance problems while the DNC receive a 400k donation for Loral's CEO :).<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Pres Bush:<br />
<br />
a) had the carpets cleaned in the oval office.<br />
b) he has provided superb leadership in a time of war.<br />
c) had acomplished the largest restructuring of the federal goverment since the departments of the army / navy where replaced by the department of defense.<br />

g) he has stoped the department of Housing and Urban devolepment from harasing gun makers and distributers via law suits.<br />
h) He has alowed drilling of nature gas wells in some coastal national lands where it was once prohibited.<br />
i) Distpite the **** that was done to the White House at the end of the Clinton administration,  he consistantly takes the high ground and does not coment negativly on the former occupant of the oval office.<br />
j) he has done an increadble job in international relations and deplomacy where he takes on problems directly instead of just brushing them under the rug for some future generation to tackle.<br />
k) he is learning how to pronounce Nuclear :).<br />
l) he has restored honor to the office of the President.  No more casual dress in the oval office much less any dick slurping.<br />
m) he has restored pride and morale to our men / women in uniform.<br />
<br />
Clearly Avalach you are just a ****ing liberal and will not agree with any of this but you should at least understand how some on the other side feel :).<br />
<br />
Bush has done a lot of things that I personaly don't like including his education bill and all the money sent to NYC post 9.11.1.  No way in hell should the federal government be making payments to poeople that are targets of terorism and the federal governant has no reason to even have a department of education.  I am also not particuraly pleased with the tax cut becuase it gives way to much money to the poor in the form of tax credits who don't even pay income tax and delays any significant releife to upper income people untill far down the line.  The child tax credit is now stacked on top of the earned income credit and is making april 15th the biggest pay day for a large number of American poor.<br />
<br />
I was also not very happy when airport screeners where federalized.  All we need is another huge group with a vested interested in a large federal budget.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few things that I would like to see him get done....<br />
<br />
a) open ANWAR for oil exploration<br />
b) remove CAFE standards so that I can drive a bigger truck.<br />
c) privitize SS so that the democrats can no longer use it to scare my Grand Mother.<br />
d) appoint a large number of honerable men / women to the bench who will refrain from judical activism.<br />
e) reform campain finance so that people and corporations can spend their money in any maner they see fit.<br />
f) withdraw the US from the UN<br />
g) send the French diplomatis home :).<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that I am unlikley to be satified in my requests but that is fine.  I just dream of an America that is safe and free and where I don't spend the first 5 months of each year in bondage to the tax man :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">l) by exacutive order, he moved the power to review certain contracts between comunist china and Loral from the state department to comerce where the contracts where aproved over the objections of state.

<br />
 If that bothers you then you must also have a major problem with the bush administration's ex-chairman and current member of the Defense Policy Board - Richard Perle.<br />
 &quot;Labaton reported that Perle, while chairing the DPB, had also advised Loral Space &amp; Communications as it contested U.S. government charges that it had improperly transferred rocket technology to China.&quot;<br />
 Also, &quot;A member of Congress asked the Department of Defense inspector general to examine Perle's work on the behalf of the bankrupt telecom company Global Crossing, which is trying to sell itself to a Chinese concern. (The FBI and Defense Department oppose the deal on national security grounds.) &quot;<br />
<br />
he has restored pride and morale to our men / women in uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;George W. Bush did everything he could to avoid military service during Vietnam. He used family connections to sleaze his way into the Texas Air National Guard, from which he went AWOL from 1972 to 1974. (Some military law experts believe that he should still be tried for desertion.) Perhaps this despicable personal history explains why Bush seizes every chance he gets to praise the hard-fighting men and women of our armed forces .... his 2003 budget proposes a piddling two percent raise for low-ranking soldiers, hardly enough to keep up with inflation. More than 2,100 servicemen currently collect food stamps, and no one expects that to change .... Then, when our troops come home--if they come home--they face a lifetime of medical care in the overburdened, underfunded Veterans Administration hospital system. (To help fund Bush's $1.5 trillion tax cut for the ultrawealthy, House Republicans just slashed the VA's budget by $25 billion. They also slapped a $250 annual fee on every veteran who needs to see a doctor--even those who are homeless.)&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I would feel great with an anti-missle defense system<br />
<br />
 Oh that's freakin fabulous that you would get nice warm fuzzy feeling. Too bad the system doesn't work and costs an about 40 billion dollars. At least that much has already been spent on missile defense in the US and we have nothing to show for it. This current system can only hit the target when it is broadcasting a message &quot;I AM THE TARGET&quot;. Otherwise there is no way to find and destroy the real payload instead of a decoy. Not to mention not even N. Korea is suicidal enough to fire a missile at us, we'd know instantly the exact spot it was fired from. We need that money badly to install radiation detectors in our ports and for border security. The absolute last thing in the world the terrorists are going to try to do is build a huge inter-continental ballistic missile to shoot at us when they could just ship a bomb to any city in the country.<br />
<br />
 But hey you guys keep listening to Rush Limbaugh and supporting republicans, I'm sure the huge dividend tax cut is gonna be great for you?? As for me I don't have any stock that pays dividends, so I'm just gonna have to pay higher state taxes because my state is flat broke and there is no federal assistance coming from Bush.<br />

i)  he got H. Clinton to shut up about socializing health care after he lost the house in 94 :).<br />
--He can't rely on Republican controlled congress to pass some of his traditional democratic agendas, so he pursued popular bills that appeal to both sides.  This is not an excuse, it's rationale.

d) he passed the largest tax cut since RR :).<br />
-- debatable, bad thing in time of war.  300 in deficit is not a good time to cut tax.<br />
e) he rejected the international carbon treaty WooT<br />
-- Hi, USA just lost millions in contract because of this.  Criticism from every other countries participating, especially when it got its start from Bush Sr.<br />
f) he has apointed new administration to the department of the interior which is much more busness friendly and much less tree hugger friendly :).<br />

<br />
Now let's talk.<br />
Clinton's d, g, l, j are debatable.  I'm not gonna try to defend him on these.  You also missed how he improved the relationship with China and the Arab world, including his involvement in Haiti and Kosovo.<br />
<br />
I'll say it now Bush is a good president.  But so far, he hasn't done anything worth mentioning outside military.  Most stuffs he got pass I disagree with.<br />

first of all, Radag is dyslexic, why he spells like I type.<br />
<br />
Second of all, you freak, 40 billion is a drop of water in the ocean compared to what alot of our weapon systems have cost  in tersm of R&amp;D and construction, it will work if we keep funding it, and when the crazy haired pygmy guy does take a shot at us, perhaps we can shoot it down rather then take a nuclear hit and have to reduce NK to ashes.<br />

Are you really that retarded? You one of them hippies that thinks waving a peace sign and flowers is going to stop people from wanting to nuke you?<br />
<br />
We are the best country on earth, and the most powerful, people will always hate us, and they breed like rabbits, we need to be strong, offensively, and defensively.<br />

<br />
And, are you hippie fellows really so in to these stupid treaties, that penalize the US in comparison to the other countries that are in it? Screw them, they wanna play with the big boys, they gotta step up to the plate.<br />

I notice other countries want our money when it helps them, but where are they when we need support? Oh, thats right, they are in league with the evil Frenchman.<br />
<br />
Clinton screwed up our position in the world by being a jackass frat boy with no balls, morals, or sack. He was a slime ball, kissed ass, and Bush had to get an office that was expected to lie down and take it in the ass, well thankfully, unlike most catholics, he wasn't in to that.<br />

I am sure you can find all kinds of things in print concearning Pres. Bush service in the guard.  Considering how much the liberals of this country hate him I am not surpised to find &quot;opinions&quot; the reflect negativly on his term of service.<br />
<br />
You, howenver, will not find letters to the draft board.<br />
<br />
You will also find widespread and general affection for Pres. Bush amongst those that put on our nations uniform.  Clinton, on the other hand, is widley held in contempt by those same men and women.  There is a very good reason form V.P. Gore tried very hard to keep military absantee balots from being counted in the state of Florida.<br />
<br />
You are free to hate bush all you want but you are a moron if you think the hate you feel is shared with our people in uniform.<br />
<br />
You may be right about Richard Pearl....  I have never heard of him.<br />
<br />
How about Terry Macalif (not sure how to spell his name ) who heads the DNC.  Considering that he maid a small investment in that same Global Crossing which subsequently turned into 18 million.  He sold at the top.  Or how about the 1 million that the CEO of Global Crossing gave to the Clinton Presidential Library.  And who did Clinton barrow the cash from to purchase his house in NY?  I am quite sure the democrats will not enjoy a close look at the dealing of Global Crossing.<br />
<br />
ABM system,  an ABM system may very well provide some security from a limited ICBM attack but in general I must agree that such systems suffer from horible tecknical problems and it is much cheaper to make changes to delivery systems to defeat an ABM system then it is to update the system to protect against those changes.  An ABM system is also of little use against such safisticated dilivery methods as pretending that the Nuke is a shipment of cocian and just driving across our southern border.<br />

Also,  thanks for removing whatever coment you had about my spelling.  I did not read it but that was a kindness and I think you.<br />

I am personaly do not count our actions in Haiti or in Kosovo as acheivments.  I saw Haiti as a way of apeasing black factions in congress that pointed out that the US does little or nothing in Africa to stop genocide.  I was also against our intervention in Bosnia / Kosovo in that the US has no national interests in that mess either.  I have consistantly oposed the US entering into &quot;humanitarian&quot; conflics where we have no statigic or security interest.<br />
<br />
You view of our nation and mine are much different.  I view you as a stupid liberal moron that trades his / her freedoms and responsibilies for the yoke and security of a beast of burden.  To me the democraty party exsists by exploiting the most horid of human emotions; envy, hatred, averice, lazyness.  The social contract of the deomcrat party is that if you give ous power so that we can live in huge houses and be rich,  we will tax you fellow Americans so that you can live in dependancey and lazy security.<br />
<br />
When this country was formed it was clearly a republic with some democratic forms.  Over time it has become more and more democratic in nature as suferage has been extended to more groups, and by events like the election of senators instead of their apointments of by the states.  The bigest problem of democracies is simply that in the end the majority will vote themselves benifits from the publick coffers.  Over time fewer and fewer people fill the treasury with their taxes and more and more people vote themselves benifits.  Such a system degenerates in to socialism and opreshion and America has clearly traveling down this path.<br />
<br />
How are you free if you labor most of you life just to pay your taxes?<br />
<br />
I personaly think most democrats are such out of nieve desire to help their follow man.  Some are just lazy pigs slerping up slop at the public pay window.  Some are truly evil people that do not care what kind of damage there policies cause if they can keep and hold office.  I personaly think the clintons fall into this final catagory and that perhaps you fall into the first.<br />
<br />
Just look have a look at 40 years of welfare and and program such as food stamps, wics, hud, and such.  Look at the destruction of the Black family in our American cities.  One half of the Black men in America will spend time in prison.....  ONE HALF.  Only 1 in 9 black children born in an city will grow up with both of his / her parents.  The dependancy of Blacks on the demoractic party is so compleate that they are the most monolithic voating block but the destruction of the Black family is all but total.<br />
<br />
A man gets up in the morning and puts his pants on.  He gives his wife a kiss and then he goes to the job so that his wife and kids will have what they need in life.  When he gets home he spends time with his family and does his best to bring his children up so that they will aslo be good people.  The democratic party is a direct and pervasive threat to this basic nuclear family.<br />
<br />
Each individual social program may apear on the surface to do somthing good.  It is hard to argue that giving food to children is a bad thing or that providing a home for a family in need does social harm.  In the long run, social welfare does far more harm then good.  Black America is a case study of just how horibly wrong good intentions can go.  Welfare reform was a major plank in the 1994 republican contract with America and it has braught a great changes ( the economy also helpd a lot ) to a lot of poor American families.  Social activitst hated welform reform and still do but it has helped to break the cycle of dependancy for millions of Americans who now have a truly independant and dignified life.<br />
<br />
When I look at people like the Clintons what I see are evil monsters that exploit the fundamental flaws in the democratic form of government for personal gain and personal power.  I think it is evil to tax one segment of the population into bondage in order to keep another segment of the population in a state of depenadancy, humilation, and fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Welfare system is a horrid, horrid thing. It rewards lazy people for reproducing, and penalizes single working people and responsible patrents.<br />
<br />
I was out of a job once, my dad just died, I was boozing, owed the IRS money, things were looking bleak, welfare system basically told me to go screw myself. I didn't want much, just some help for a couple weeks while I get a decent job, but nope, sorry, you are white, single, no kids.<br />
<br />
I was out of a job for a matter of weeks, yet could get no help, while some irresponsible schlup knocks up his fat hairy pepsi drinking pig of a wife and gets money as far as  the eye can see.<br />
<br />
 That, is wrong. You should only get welfare if you have paid taxes in proportion. If you have never worked, then we should re-institute government work programs, to give the poor a chance to work and make money.<br />
  Birth control should be widely available, even in schools.<br />
<br />
Black people will be in prison, well, sorry, there are more opportunities out there for black people then any other right now, college funds, affirmative action, you name it. It all boils down to bad parents. Colon Powell and Rice chick, they are prime examples of what anyone can do if they put their minds to it.<br />
<br />
I am tired of people using the racist card, you don't see me claiming special status because I am a &quot;Norwegian American&quot;, I am an american, I am a mutt. I have some indian in me too(Not native American, Injun), so what? That give me the right to open a casino and bitchy and cry about opression that hasnt existed for 100 years?<br />
<br />
People would rather blame the system or made up oppression than get off their asses and do something. I have never owned a slave, why did I almost get fired at work because an asian immigrant who could barely speak english, wouldnt return my phone calls, then told his manager I &quot;didn't want to get over the language barrier&quot;? If I didn't document everything, I would have been fired, no ifs ands or butts, think I could turn around and get somone fired like that? Nope, I am just a white boy.<br />
<br />
Double standards, the only real racists left in this country are those very same people that claim to be oppressed. Jesse Jackson ain't got nothing on the KKK, they are one in the same.<br />
<br />
Look at the Michigan state law school case in the supreme court right now(it is michigan isnt it?) two white women who were more qualified then minority candidates are denied enrollment, because the university gives 20 points out of 150 for checking the &quot;minority&quot; box. 4 points are given for an outstanding essay. 20 points amounts to a full grade point average. So a white woman who busted her ass to get good grades and do well is told sorry, you are not black, we don't want you. There has never been a single study either that shows a diverse campus is more meffective then a non-diverse one.<br />
<br />
Why is there &quot;Black&quot; colleges? People herald these as incredible symbols of freedom rom oppression, well, can you imagine if there was a white only college? Once again, double standard.<br />
<br />
Can't get any more racist than that. If people want equality, start showing that you are equal, and stop relying on hand outs to justify some ancient racism.<br />
<br />
I have been a victim of racism, I am white(plus some injun) but look white, when I got in to a bar fight with my brother, 8 against 2, guess who they tried to blame? Oh, must be the white guys, god forbid it is 8 thugs trying to act like MC Hammer in a  bar and lipping off, trying to intimidate, show how gangsta they are, in Vermont of all places. Well, we smacked them down hard, cops were on their side, till we threatened legal action.<br />

 One of the homeys was harrasing him, calling him fat bastard, frankenstein, crap like that, and told him &quot;what are you supposed to be, some kind of cowboy?&quot; in a  really mean way, with 7 of his buddies backing him.<br />
 My brother responded with &quot;what are you supposed to be, a &quot;n-word&quot; they tried to start a fight, my bro came to my house and got me, we went back to the bar, as soon as we went down the stairs, they jumped him, he started backhanding people left and right, I was on the stairs and punching and kicking, we kicked the crap out of them. Sorry to say it, but this is fact, get a group of black men together and they can eb very violent, well, this time they misjudged their victim and got their **** ruined.

 Officers after apparently heard the N-word and started asking us if this was a hate crime. Come on. Ya 2 against 8, smart.<br />
<br />
 before you try to blame my brother, must tell you, I have seen time, and time again, he is so big, as soon as he goes in to a bar, people try to make him fight, I do not know why for the life of me, he tries to be nice, and puts up with alot, but some people just do not quit. They usually end up unconcious or in the hospital. Little man syndrom I guess.<br />

he didn't start it, not at all, and just because of his choice of words, cops tried to pull the hate crime thing, what a crock of crap.<br />

Typical gang mentality trying to scare somone, well, that may work in LA, but for crying out loud don't try it in Vermont, us farmers will beat ass.<br />

Don't use LA man, try Philadelphia.  It's a better example.  LA is just a Hollywood product.</div></div><hr />

Must be all the booze talking. Little 5'8 guys even try to fight him. Why? He is a nice guy, and usually will ask the person nicely to stop it, ask several more times, then tell them they are going to get their ass kicked. He told the black guys he was from florida, he just wanted to have a good time, can they leave him alone please, nothing. They deserve it.<br />
<br />
If he instigated fights, I would never support him, I hate people that do. Bars are for fun, gettin drunk, and getting women.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Wish I'd have been there with your brother - coulda helped out with my 6'4'' and (until recently) 340 pounds - I'm a svelte 250 pounds now - like a vegetarian! :D ).  A little wit might have diffused the situation (although probably not since most drunks lack wit!), but I was thinking a response like the following from your brother would have made it harder for the overly-PC cops to pick sides: &quot;Yeah, I'm an @$$hole cowboy - I herd @$$holes like you guys all day long.  Now git back in your pen.&quot;  Or something like that.  It won't stop a guaranteed fight, but it might force the ones with a few brain cells to stop and scratch their heads a bit.  Once your bro let the N-word out, he essentiallly elevated the &quot;debate&quot; to the social equivalent of WMD use! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">See I don't believe in the N-word thing. Was a story, real story, about a photogropher woman who was taking pictures at a sportin event. A black referee told her to stop taking pictures, and to hand over the film, she refused. He grabbed the camera strap and starting choking her, well, her husband got way pissed, the ref ran in to the locker room and wouldn't come out. The husband was screaming the N-word and he was going to kick his ass, never laid a hand on him.<br />
<br />
The state tried to charge him with a felony hate crime, for using those words, yet never so much as arrested the ref for attacking the woman.  Fair?<br />
<br />
If 8 black guys in a  sea of white want to be idiots and act like puff daddy to try and impress the white women, well, they better expect to get their asses kicked. They normally do this up here because most Vermonters have little to no experience with blacks, and they think they are gang bangers or something, are afraid. VT is like 97.6% white or somethin, is crazy. The black guys up here act crazy, they don't act like that in other places, I have been everywhere.<br />
<br />
At what point does a word become more important than threats and violence? Never. Should we lock up all the black comics for using the N-word?<br />
<br />
Double standards man, they suck.<br />

<br />
Such double standards are just discrimination and should be condemed regardless of the color of the person who is doing it.<br />
<br />
I was in a resteraunt with a friend from china some time ago...  he had speach habit where he would say &quot; niga niga niga niga... &quot; very rapidly in the same way we say things like oh, um um or such vocal pause.   The groups of blacks in the booth behind him where so damed ignorant that they could not understand that he was not saying anthing about them at all.  He was just confused and his english was not very good but it did not stop the buch of black racits pigs from smacking him in the back of the head and jumping on ous.<br />
<br />
In the end the police arrested the black and I only suffered a fractured cheek bone.  My friend spent about a month in the hospital from the kicking he received because he spoke a different language in the wrong part of town.</div></div><hr />

I kid you not, if that was a white person atatcking a black, the NAACP, ACLU, would be involved, federal chaerges would be brought, civil lawsuits probably in the millions, all backed by tax payer dollars.<br />
