Any help?&gt;  It used to be all on crucible main page but now that's gone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Casters Realm still does a breakdown of the races for each class.  Will list their starting stats, so you can choose which you think would be better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think one of the main reasons people usually advise others to play what they like is because the choice is so dependent on play style.  If you hate playing evil races, for example, then someone advising you to play an iksar would be giving you some very bad advice.  So the best you can really do is find the pros and cons of each race and make your own decision.  <br />
<br />
I don’t know a lot about the different shaman races, but as far as gear is concerned I know of a couple of issues.  One is that there are several armor pieces that most shaman can wear but iksar cannot.  And if I remember correctly, trolls can do a quest that gives them a necklace with a snare effect on it.  And let me tell you, after playing a ranger and a druid I really miss being able to snare.  <br />
<br />
If you want to look at general pros and cons, here’s the link to Caster’s Realms Shaman Creation Guide:  http://eq.crgaming.com/creationguides/Shaman.asp</div></div><hr />
