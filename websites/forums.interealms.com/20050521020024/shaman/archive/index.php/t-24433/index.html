<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, 10 kills here, no TA so far... I'm beginning to think its just a myth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">12 Saryn's with no TA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">0/20 with 9 mage veils here. But there's always gotta be someone worse off, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We arent doing to bad. 3 for 15ish (havent counted lately). Thing that chapped my ass is that TZ has dropped 3 Chanter sticks in a ROW! BAH! <br />
<br />
Oh well, I have burned my DKP up on gear anyway. I just want TAs to drop so the other shamans in my guild can get one, bringing me one step closer to picking mine up cheap. I have an emergency Turgurs spell-set on Page One of my hot-keys now, but I have found Nihil alone is adequate in 90% of the content I do. TA would be nice, but its become less of a &quot;must have&quot; for me lately. Maybe I am just trying to justify it all in my own head though, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We had one off our first kill then got 4 in the next 20 kills or so. 0 for last 9 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Magister on Emarr was 1 for 30.<br />
<br />
We have 0 mage veils after 20 Saryrn kills (and no bard weapon yet either).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The random number generator is weird sometimes... We had 4 Shinais in a row from the 4 first Vallons, then 4 Dark Blades in a row from Rallos, but only one TA so far from 12 or 13 Saryrns. Just hoping for the TA streak to begin soon. :P</div></div><hr />

Looks like 15 is our record between drops.  1 drop in 29 kills is our worse for 1 in X.  1 TA drop in 9 months  :mad: <br />
<br />
Never did get mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">0 for 18  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">3 for 28.  Had one drop last week to break stretch of 16 weeks w/ no drops.  The shaman who got it was maxed on dkp (150 points, very rare occurance) and paid the cap (100 points; average high end item goes for 20 points)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The loot tables are far too large to get a good sample with any reasonable amount of kills. We're nearing a dozen clearings of time and still have several items that have never dropped. Silk gloves from saryrn, chain legs from bert are a just a couple off the top of my head. On the other hand we've gotten an absolute ton of plate bps from RZ. We've actually got more plate bps than we've got RZ kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We've had 6 TAs drop since we entered time in April. We hit time once a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We are currently 4/20 on TA's, but of those 4, 3 dropped 3 weeks in a row, starting with our very first Saryrn kill. I thought maybe it was bugged since we had such great luck, but then didn't get another one for like 2.5-3 months iirc. Here is our little post we started a while back keeping track of what is dropping. I don't think we have every single thing since we started time, but tried to get as far back as loot logs kept. We still have 0 Whorls from Quarm :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First TA drop for us was on Saryrn #23. Then we got 4 more in the next 8 kills. The loot tables in Time can be real heartbreakers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Quarm 10 Kills<br />
<br />
Whorl of Unnatural Forces X0<br />
We've had 5 whorls in 7 kills, this zone is Wiggity Wack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok, so I guess 0-10 isn't so bad. I'm hoping for a lucky streak of 4-5 in a row however.  Nay, I demand a lucky streak of 4-5 in a row hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>NereasAequitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">22 kills now since last drop and with time's priority rapidly falling due to gates and oow there is often a month or more between time runs for us.  The last drop was 04-15-2004 so we're up to 6 months and 5 days since the last TA.<br />
<br />
We've had somewhere in the neighborhood of 8-10 mage masks rot in that time.<br />
<br />
I've been next in line for all 22 of those kills, so at this point in time I can officially say I hate SoE with all my heart for making this item so pathetically rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I imagine if you killed any god in Time 1000 times, you would end up with a fairly balanced loot drop list, but with such large loot tables, there is always going to be streaks and spurts in a limited sampling.</div></div><hr />
