<br />
TRANSSEXUAL FOSTER CARE BILL PASSES COMMITTEE HURDLE<br />
<br />
AB 2651 Would Teach Foster Children to Embrace Transsexual, Bisexual and Homosexual Lifestyles <br />
<br />
<br />
Sacramento – Controversial legislation to promote transsexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality throughout California’s foster care system was passed today by the Assembly Human Services Committee on a party line vote. Democrats voted yes; and Republicans voted no. Governor Gray Davis has yet to announce his position on the bill. <br />
<br />
<br />
AB 2651 by Democrat Assemblywoman Judy Chu of Monterey Park would indoctrinate foster children to embrace and experiment with transsexual, bisexual and homosexual behavior. Under the guise of “discrimination” and “harassment” foster care staff would be forced to put a priority on finding homosexual men and lesbian women to be foster parents. Foster care staff and foster parents would be forced to accept homosexual behavior and cross-dressing by foster youth, and all foster parents will be required to undergo “sensitivity” training on homosexual, bisexual and transgender issues. <br />
<br />
<br />
In an attack on freedom of conscience, AB 2651 requires foster parents and foster care staff to be “sensitive” to cross-dressing by foster children and homosexual behavior. Today in the committee hearing Assemblywoman Chu stated that the word “sensitive” means “supportive” of foster children engaging in these sexual lifestyles. <br />
<br />
<br />
Supporting AB 2651 are the ACLU and CAPE, the state’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organization. Opposing the bill are Campaign for California Families, Committee on Moral Concerns, Traditional Values Coalition, Capitol Resource Institute, the Association of Christian Schools International, and the County of San Diego. <br />
<br />
<br />
“We feel sorry for the vulnerable children in foster care who are being targeted by homosexual and transsexual activists hungry for new territory,” said Randy Thomasson, Executive Director of Campaign for California Families, a statewide nonprofit, nonpartisan family issues leadership organization. “A large number of California foster parents have a sincere religious belief on raising children to respect healthy sexual relationships. By requiring foster parents to participate in pro-transsexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality “sensitivity&quot; training, AB 2651 will drive conscientious, caring parents out of the system. These offensive requirements will significantly reduce the available foster care homes for needy children. This outrageous bill's overly broad language coupled with these far reaching requirements could actually require foster parents to allow a boy to wear women's clothing in front of other foster children and schoolchildren.”</div></div><hr />

We might consider allowing homosexuals to be foster parents!  Goodness knows there are so many foster parents now that we certainly can't use anybody like that!  And we might actually ask them to be &quot;supportive&quot; to foster children with gender identity and sexuality issues?  How can anyone think that might be good?  Everyone knows the role of foster care is to teach kids proper thinking and behavior.  Being sensitive to their needs should never be allowed to interfere with that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
More over this bill is VERY close if not outright breaking seperation of church and state issues as its promoting behavior which is fairly universally opposed by most major religions and making those members of those religions disallowed to be foster parents.<br />
<br />
Today in the committee hearing Assemblywoman Chu stated that the word “sensitive” means “supportive” of foster children engaging in these sexual lifestyles.  <br />
<br />
That statement right there breaks the laws based upon not discriminating against persons for their religious/idealogical choices.<br />
<br />
So if this bill passes which I hope it doesn't I hope someone takes it to the court system and smashes this thing to pieces.</div></div><hr />

I'm concerned with this implication that they will be forcing anything on anyone.  I see nothing wrong with placing children of either sexual orientation with foster parents of either sexual orientation, provided that those parents are sensitive to the needs of that child.  This is a 2 way street.  Homosexual children should not be subjected to hell and brimstone sermons from ultra-conservative foster parents any more than Heterosexual children should be forced to try and be gay.  However I think that straight foster parents can raise a gay child just as gay foster parents can raise a straight child.<br />

<br />
I think this is perfectly fine, provided there is a need for those foster parents to have these skills.  ie. if straight parents are going to be fostering a gay child, they should be educated on how to deal with them and their sexuality issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Amazingly enough I somewhat agree with this.  It seems to me that the state should put more emphasis with placing children with the correct foster parents, than attempting to force a gay foster child onto a ultra-conservative anti-gay foster parent.<br />
<br />

<br />
Again, if the child is transgender or a crossdresser, I don't really see that there is going to be much harm in this, provided the foster parents are trained to deal with the issue.<br />
<br />
I don't see any of the bill actually quoted here, so it's impossible for me to comment on the wording of the language.  It would not, however, surprise me that it is overly broad.  Very little legislation comes through these days without being way too broad.<br />
<br />
As a final comment, I support what seems to be the main idea behind this bill and that is providing a good caring home for children who are transgender/gay/lesbian.  It would be unconcionable to me to attempt to place such a child in an ultra-conservative home where they would be continually told they were evil and going to hell.<br />
<br />
However, it also seems to me that this is making a mountain out of a mole hill.  I can't imagine that there are throngs of transgender/gay/lesbian children in the California foster care system who need specialized homes.  Further, I have to imagine that there are plenty of transgender/gay/lesbian adults who would be willing to be foster parents for such children.  I also have to imagine that there are some straight adults who would be happy to be foster parents for such children as well and would provide a loving accepting home.<br />
<br />
I would also point out that this bill is most likely really targeted at older foster children (14+) who have started to experience the beginnings of sexuality.  I can't really see what relevance any of this has to a 6 year old...</div></div><hr />

I really don't want to get into the religious aspects of this, but I can't let this one go.<br />
<br />
What do you think HAS been done for the last, let's see what's 2002 minus 1776, years?  You always talk about how this is a country founded on Christian values.  How can you not believe that those values have been forced on everyone living here?</div></div><hr />

If you mean sexual abuse, I think the RCs have more than enough of that to be worrying about, that they should tend to their own yard before going and meddling in someone else's.<br />
<br />
Besides, we all know that this bill is wrong because homosexuals should be cast into a lake of fire and never be let anywhere near small children. Rightttttttttt?<br />
<br />
*points out* I think giving homosexuals top priority for becoming foster parents is a bit much, and I'm a bit curious as to what this 'indoctrination' really is. The only thing I see this bill doing is that it allows children who believe they are to be gay or whatever to allow them to be gay....am I missing something with this? *looking for clarification*<br />
<br />
I'm curious what reasons there were for posting this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see how, at all, that this bill is doing the opposite of what you just typed. If a child chooses to be gay, it's their decision to do so, and the parents have to cope. Conversely, if the child wishes to be Roman Catholic or Baptist or whatever, that's their choice, and thegay parents have to cope. <br />
<br />
It seems as though you're clouding 'supportive' with 'forcing this belief onto the individual'. Just because you're born in a right wing house, doesn't mean you have to be right wing. Or vice versea for a liberal house hold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Supportive isn't just tolerating... its actually being &quot;for&quot; whatever lifestyle the child chooses even if you personally don't believe that lifestyle is correct.  <br />
<br />
Its essentially the ULTIMATE step in removing ANY ability of the parents(in this case foster parents) to discipline or shape a child.  If the 14 year old boy was a bisexual and was sleeping around with 5 others boys and girls the parents would have their foster child license removed if they told the foster child they disapproved.<br />
<br />
Sorry but that is precisely what Nitefox is saying is wrong about this bill.<br />
<br />
If the bill were to replace all references of Homosexual/Transexual/Bisexual with a religious title or even replace them with Heterosexual you folks would be all against it Cause its forcing gays and such to be subjected to supporting straight choices.  However we live in a democracy and if you have not been clued in yet MOST people in this country favor Heterosexual relationships, and as such that is consider the &quot;proper&quot; way to have sex and thats not even bringing in any sort of social studies, religious, or other types of arguments.<br />
<br />
Its amazing how liberals will tout the word democracy when it fits their ends but then when the majority speaks against them they continue to insist that their method should be forced on everyone whether they like it or not.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope enough stink about this is raised in California to get these sickos ousted next election but knowing California I'd have more luck hoping it falls into the sea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that is certainly your right.<br />
<br />
I also think it would be very wrong to try and place a gay foster child with you as a foster parent, and would be wrong to attempt to force you to take the sensitivity classes they are talking about.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, it also seems to be to be very reasonable to try and find a supportive foster parent for a gay child.<br />
<br />
As for your 2nd point, it has been my experience that the ONLY arguments against transgender/gay/lesbian sexuality are based on religion.  Therefore it strikes me as very unconstitutional for a government based system to prevent a transgender/gay/lesbian child from receiving proper loving support.<br />
<br />
I fully support the intent of this bill, however without actually reading the wording of the bill, I can't comment on if it's implimentation is worth anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the quote the WRITER of the bill stated... sensitivity = support so how is a foster parent to show they disaprove when its now illegal for them to do so and punishable with their removal from the foster care system.<br />
<br />
When I see a copy of the bill I'll go find the langauge in there that says the same thing since the writer seems to indicate its in there.</div></div><hr />

Do you have a link to it?  So far we haven't seen the bill, we've seen a conservative position paper opposing it.  What amuses me is that, even in the rhetoric of an opposition argument, there's still a lot to make this bill seem like a good idea.<br />

No, it isn't.  Being supportive of a child doesn't mean that you can't correct them.  It means understanding the child's situation and motivations, and correcting them in a way that doesn't teach the child that they are an evil person for making a mistake.<br />

OK, let's try... &quot;Foster care staff would be required to recruit Christian foster parents...  Foster care staff and foster parents would be forced to accept Christian fundamentalist behavior and standards of dress...  and all foster parents will be required to undergo “sensitivity” training on conservative and fundamentalist Christian issues&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds reasonable to me.  I'm in favor of understanding, even towards Christians.  I also think we need all the foster parents we can get, even Christian ones.<br />

So what?  The reason we have a Constitution is to protect the minority against the tyranny of the majority.  The right of privacy clearly extends into the bedroom.  You can't tell me what is the &quot;proper&quot; way to have sex, no matter how many other people think the same thing.  The same thing applies to children in the foster care system.<br />
<br />
Remember what we're talking about here.  We're not talking about adoption, we're talking about court placement of children in safe homes for a temporary need.  Yes, in some cases kids can stay in the foster care system for years, but most of the time they will be back with relatives in a few months at most.  These kids come to foster care traumatized, with their lives uprooted and their future in doubt.  It's not a time for teaching or criticizing their beliefs.  If you adopt a kid, you can and should teach him what is right and wrong, but if you take in a foster kid, you should be worried about making them feel safe and accepted.<br />

You hit the nail right on the head.  Please read the original post and replace Transexual, Bisexual, Homosexual with Catholic.  Imagine the Uproar that would happen.  I wish the Political Left would stop trying to force their agenda.  <br />
<br />
I have no problems with the above issues (Homosexuality, Bisexual, transexual and whatnot) but they will infringe on others rights if they try to force their rights on them.  There are classes that future and current foster parents have to take anyway.  Just touch on it there.  End of story.</div></div><hr />

That's actually a pretty good idea. But in regards to this bill, I fail to see how the sexuality of a foster parent has anything to do with their ability to provide a caring home to a child in need.  Why make a priority to find a homosexual foster parent?<br />
<br />
I think California, in it's over-zealous efforts to promote tolerance, goes beyond the norm and tries to elevate homosexuality above heterosexuality instead of trying to make both acceptable.</div></div><hr />

Here's the text of the bill:<br />
16014.   (a)  It is the goal of this state that foster parents, including  , but not limited to,  gay or lesbian adults, shall be identified who are interested in caring for gay or lesbian youth in foster care.<br />
also<br />
(b) Discrimination based on the sexual orientation of foster parents and other foster household members,  in licensing, approval,  and placement decisions, is prohibited.<br />
In other words, the bill makes it a priority to find foster parents for homosexual kids, and makes it illegal to discriminate against homosexual foster parents.  &quot;Forced to put a priority on finding homosexual men and lesbian women to be foster parents&quot; is the rhetoric of the opposition, I don't see any basis for that in the text of the bill.</div></div><hr />

It is the same concept in my eyes. People do need to be supportive of whatever lifestyle a child choses to partake in (or if they are genetically inclined), especially when that person is the primary caregiver for a child.  What if Christianity were considered a deviant lifestyle? How would you feel about childrens attempts to understand and explore their Christianity were limited or discouraged?<br />
<br />
What I do not like is the implication that gay and lesbian couples would be favored for the foster parent program (at least to &quot;catch them up&quot;) their odds of being selected as foster parents should however be the same as any parents. <br />

First off, those stupid links you posted need to go.  Why is it if I post something contriversal, it's a joke like in those links, but if you post something it's to &quot;broaden&quot; our minds.  Give me a break.(but since you brought it up http://www.winternet.com/~mikelr/flame72.html)<br />
<br />
Secondly, the issue of if sexual preference is  the main reason for concern here.  Believe it or not Kullaas, but there are millions upon millions of people who believe that being homosexual is not natural.  This is why we have different opinoins on the matter.<br />
<br />
The press realease is not an attack on homosexuality.  It is to make people aware of what is going on(I thought that was something you thrived on).  Foster parents who do not agree with the homosexual lifestyle will be forced to accept the lifestyle if they want to continue to be foster parents.  That is not right no matter which way you cut it.</div></div><hr />

Nice jab(way to stay mature Kullaas) there but you should be smart enough to know that the pushing of a belief or agenda takes on many, many forms.  One though is that if you disagree you are labled many things(homophobic, intolerant, bigot, do I need to go on?).  It goes both ways.</div></div><hr />

I would argue, in fact, that it is even more so wrong, as religion is something not determined at birth, as homosexuality is*.<br />
<br />
Gay people do not, in my experience, ever try to turn other people gay.  My gay friends (online, mostly) and gay men irl I have seen never even joke about things with me like I joke about with girls, because they know I'm straight.  Gay guys do not hit on straight guys anymore than straight guys hit on girls who aren't interested in them. I don't see them pushing an agenda at all. You always have your types who won't take 'no' for an answer. :) <br />
<br />
&quot;This outrageous bill's overly broad language coupled with these far reaching requirements could actually require foster parents to allow a boy to wear women's clothing in front of other foster children and schoolchildren.”<br />
<br />
/shrug I have a straight male friend who wears dresses.  Why is this wrong?  If you had been growing up with men wearing skirts and girls wearing pants it wouldn't seem any different to you. It's all in perception and preconcieved notions that 'that does not belong on a person of this sex'.<br />
<br />
&quot;By requiring foster parents to participate in pro-transsexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality “sensitivity&quot; training, AB 2651 will drive conscientious, caring parents out of the system&quot;<br />
<br />
So teaching the foster parents not to demean their child's natural tendencies is wrong?  <br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks either the left or right is 90% right while the other is dead wrong is only fooling themselves.  Both sides lie, propogate and try to go at it like it's some sort of game, instead of reaching a compromise and actually considering the other side's views.  Politics r teh suk.<br />
<br />
*I do realize you think homosexuality is not natural.  I am curious, why do you think this, other than religion?  Now, not to bring religion into this any more so than absolutely necessary, I am interested in the science of it.  If it's religion, just say so and I will leave it at that, not debate the religion, ala Sunmoon's wish to keep that off the Glade.<br />

Take  a good long look in the mirror Nitefox, you weakly attempt to force your view on others on a constant basis.  The majority of your posts center around the idea of your religious and moral views and how they should be respected with no care or concern whatsover for those of your fellow posters.<br />
<br />
You should have been banned right along with Taly.  People have the right to their gender specific sexual preferences, I feel pity that you do not grasp this concept.  Being gay is not infectious.  Being around someone who is gay will not make a straight person gay.  <br />
<br />
You make way to big a deal of homesexuality Nitefox..you know what they say about people who protest so much.  Maybe some day you will meet the right guy, and will be able to come out so you can feel better about yourself and stop trying to persecute others.</div></div><hr />

Which sounds perfectly reasonable. Find Homosexual foster parents for homosexual kids and similaraly Christian foster parents for Christian kids.<br />
<br />
I mean how would you like it as a Christian if you were put with Pagan Foster parents. Why shouldn't gay or lesbian children be given the chance to be put in home where their beliefs will be respected and not ridiculed.<br />

<br />
   (a) By June 30, 2003, promulgate regulations that ensure that<br />
whenever removal of a child from his or her home is contemplated, the responsible social worker shall ask the parent or legal guardian whether the child has a religious affiliation, including an affiliation with a particular religious institution.<br />

Under the guise of “discrimination” and “harassment” foster care staff would be forced to put a priority on finding homosexual men and lesbian women to be foster parents.  <br />
I don't know waht I think about the law in total. I've been thinking about it, and I'm not really sure what would be best for the kids, but THIS propaganda outrages me.<br />
<br />
When the so-called &quot;amendment 2&quot; was proposed in Colorado, they used the same argument to get it passed. The gist of the amendement was to say that sexual orientation would not be considered a protected status as a minority. Since there were no laws in CO stating that it WAS, and no proprsed laws to make it a protected minority, there was, at the time, no problem. The law was unnecessary. However, it was passed by propaganga stating that if it DIDN'T pass, then homosexuals would start getting all the &quot;good&quot; jobs, and there would have to be quota laws for homosexuals, etc.<br />
<br />
Such scare tactics cause me to almost immediately want to join the other side. What, exactly, is wrong with trying to place foster children with parents who share their beliefs? What is wrong with placing foster children with a homosexual couple? I know homosexuals who would be MUCH better parents than most of those children's natural parents. If the home they came from was bad enough that they had to be taken away, then I think it's better for them to have a stable, loving place to live, even  if it's with two people of the same sex.</div></div><hr />

There is NO language in it that talks about forcing the &quot;gay agenda&quot; on you or anyone else who disagrees with it.  What it does do is attempt to provide gay/lesbian/transgender foster children with foster parents who are understanding and tollerant of their situation.<br />

Why would you be against providing someone with a parent who is sympathetic to your views?  What you rail against would be the same as putting a Christian foster child with Christian foster parents.</div></div><hr />

Why is it that people take such delight in trying to ascribe &quot;latent homosexuality&quot; to anyone who opposes gay and lesbian behaviour?

Ahh, the last, most desperate ploy of someone who cannot understand that not everybody accepts homosexuality, to accuse someone of being homophobic. It's sad, really. I ask you this: If you're an atheist and you do not accept that God exists, does that make you afraid of anybody who is religious? Does that mean then that you are so deeply afraid of people who are religious it is because you yearn to be religous?<br />
<br />
Doubt it.<br />

Maybe someday you'll understand that if someone doesn't agree with your view of the world, it doesn't mean they're wrong, afraid of admitting they belive like you, or afraid of you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with it, but I think that was most people are arguing here (with the exception of Nitefox) is that the giving preferential treatment to gay/lesbian/etc foster parents is unfair, which it is.<br />
<br />
They may think it's better for the children overall, but giving an advantage to gay/lesbian/etc. parents is basically affirmative action, which most people here probably disagree with because it gives heterosexual couples a lesser chance of becoming foster parents.</div></div><hr />

Therein lies the problem. Foster parents are to be SUPPORTIVE of CHILDREN engaging in SEXUAL lifestyles, be they homosexual or otherwise. Sorry, but last time I checked &quot;Statutore Rape&quot; included ANY SEXUAL acts peformed upon CHILDREN below the age of 18. <br />
<br />
On a side note re: crossdressing. I was always confused as to why if a girl dresses like a boy, it's socially acceptable, but if a boy dresses like a girl, it's branded &quot;crossdressing.&quot; Does this seem like a double standard to anybody else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a Christian and so I understand where Nitefox is coming from: homosexuality is wrong because the most important book in our lives says so.  It therefore dissapoints me (us?) when our government--which is an extension of our political voice--gives creedence to the homosexual lifestyle.  How could we feel otherwise?<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
I also understand how, to a person who views the Bible as nothing more than a comic book, a differing lifestyle is just that: differing.  This lifestyle should be banned no more than eating meat should be banned (as a few individuals would like).<br />
<br />
I don't know the answer...really I don't think there IS an answer.  An irresistable force has met an unmovable object.  I know that if this bill came up for a vote in my state I would vote against it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you give the answer in your own post Deeger.<br />
<br />
Your objections to homosexuality (and presumably Nitefox's as well) come from a religious basis.<br />
<br />
Forcing these views on others within the country by way of the government becomes the defacto establishment of a state sponsored religion.<br />
<br />
And that is something that is expressly forbidden by the constitution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nitefox, and others of the Christian faith and viewpoint, I ask you to consider the signs of the times, my friends. We can read the signs of the weather, but can we read the signs of the times?<br />
<br />
Please read 2Timothy, chapter 3, verses 1-9.<br />
<br />
My point is this: This is not a forum sympathetic to us, and I suggest that energy spent trying to change hearts and minds here is wasted energy. People here who agree with the Christian viewpoint on homosexuality don't need explanations, and people here who don't are HIGHLY unlikely to change their minds.<br />

Of course, i believe that if they do this, sticking a devout, by the book, christian in a homosexual household is just as bad. <br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
While I have my own beliefs, and I have very strong feelings about the rightness or wrongness of certain lifestyle choices, I am also an American to the core. Our country was founded originally for religious freedom. For those who do not follow The Bible, I have to allow them the right to follow the lifestyle of their choice, even at the expense of their immortal soul. It can be a real conflict, but at some point, I have to force my care for someone's soul to submit for my love of my freedom and my coutry.<br />
<br />
Heck even though say I follow The Bible, I don't follow it to the letter. The Old Testament is filled with edicts that I ignore, such as eating pork, working on the sabbath, wearing clothing of two different threads. To a devout Jew, I am breaking rules daily. Even the New Testament says things that I don't follow - a woman should submit to her husband's judgement, while my marriage is a partnership.<br />
<br />
If a child from a devout Jewish background were placed in foster care, I would say that priority for that child's placement should be given to those who are Jewish, then to those who live near a temple, and lastly to those who have no experience or nearby temple, but have enough education in Judaism to allow the child's faith to be as uninhibited as possible. Why wouldn't I want to see the same preference given for a child who identifies as homosexual?<br />
<br />
I don't see how, at least in Colorado, this would make it difficult for non-gays to become foster parents. There has been a shortage of quality foster homes in this state for years. <br />
<br />
I reitterate that a stable, loving homosexual household would be better for most of these kids, gay or straight, than the houses they have been taken from.</div></div><hr />

You're right, Taamar, what happens in your bedroom is none of my business and you won't hear a peep out of me regarding it.<br />
<br />
However, the issue we are discussing is government regulations.  This government represents you AND me. <br />
Fair enough, except that the issue *I* was dicussing is whether a persons bedroom habits affect their ability to parent. Do you think I am a bad mother because of what I chose to do in private, with my son not present? Do you really think that a child with homosexual proclivities, a child who has already been traumatized, would be better off in a home that condemns him for what he feels? And finally, do you WANT to be a foster parent to a gay kid? Could you deal with his/her issues adequately? <br />
<br />
Child Protective services has a duty to the children and the parents to match up those with similar lifestyles AND religions. I am pretty sure that Nitefox, if something were to happen to him and his wife (knock wood it doesn't) would be quite uncomfortable with the idea of me raising his children. Similarly, I wouldn't want him raising mine. This has NOTHING to do with not liking him as a person, I do... but his views would make my son feel very... unsupported if he were subjected to them on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
So... why not allow the state to place children with people with similar sexual preferences? I have seen NO data to suggest that gays are more likely to abuse children, in fact, data suggests that men are the most frequent abusers, so shouldn't a lesbian household be one of the safer places? Especially for a girl who may have been traumatized and is now afraid of men?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some good questions Taamar.<br />
<br />
First off, I do not believe you to be a bad parent because of your sexual beliefs.  I believe that two parents, in a loving relationship, are better than one (I will guess that some will disagree with this).  How you bring up your child is up to you, provided that the rest of society agrees that you are not hurting your child (yes, what constitutes &quot;hurting&quot; is open to debate but I'll ignore that in an attempt to stay focused.)<br />
<br />
However, the regulations we are discussing affect Public policy and that's where my differences lie.  If I may make a somewhat faulty analogy, what if the language was changed to &quot;racist&quot;, eg. racist kids will be put in racist homes so that they feel more &quot;comfortable&quot; and &quot;accepted&quot;?  Would you have a problem with that?  I would suppose so.<br />
<br />
I would like to go on record that I'm not totally against these guidelines.  I do understand (no, really :b ) why they make sense to many of you.  That said I am uncomfortable with Government making decisions based on sexual preferences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I hadn't though of that, and while I am tempted to say 'but racism is WRONG' that would lower me to the level of saying 'its wrong because I don't like it'... so what I will answer is that racism is not biological, the way homosexuality almost certainly is. I think a closer comparison would be that while diabetic children need not be placed with diabetics, they certainly should not be placed with people who are phobic about needles or who do not believe in medical care.</div></div><hr />

I disagree with the &quot;people are born gay&quot; theory.  My beliefs are based upon serious conversations I have had with gay men (I don't know many lesbians, too bad for me :))  I don't really want to get into it here.<br />

Homosexuality is almost certainly biological?  I'm sorry, but where does this theory come from?<br />
<br />
Most recent studies show that a gay man exposed to estrogen will respond to it in the manner a woman does, not in the manner a man does. This will occur even in double-blind experiments and thus is highly unlikely to be a placebo effect. There have been several other studies, most of them pointing to a biological basis for sexual preference. I can't cite sources from work, but I'll grab some when I get home and post em. <br />
I wonder, though, if being gay is proved to be genetic and we locate the gene, would anti-gay, anti-genetic-modification people change their stance?</div></div><hr />

Yes, I would prefer that foster children be placed in Christian homes, whatever the circumstances.<br />

Having said that, however, I acknowledge that many will disagree with me, and that's fine. I also know that this is no longer a Christian nation, and so placing children in Christian homes exclusively is quite unrealistic.<br />

While it is true that we don't have stormtroopers attacking churches, as occurs in China and elsewhere, the freedom to exercise our religious beliefs have been seriously eroded in the U.S. (In violation of the Bill of Rights, I might add, but with the blessing of the present-day courts)<br />

Take  a good long look in the mirror Nitefox, you weakly attempt to force your view on others on a constant basis.  The majority of your posts center around the idea of your religious and moral views and how they should be respected with no care or concern whatsover for those of your fellow posters.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those of you who have managed to stay up with this post I apologize for regressing to an earlier page, but I disagree with this strongly.<br />
<br />
How you can claim that Nitefox's points of view are being forced upon you is beyond me.  You have the choice on whether or not you read his posts.  Choice is the key in whether or not something is being forced upon or you are listening (or reading) to it of your own free will.<br />
<br />
In many schools, particularly here in California, there is an agenda being taught regarding the homosexual lifestyles that many parents are not comfortable with their children hearing. Parents who's religious beliefs conflict with that agenda.  It's a double standard that says that we must respect those who's religious (or non-religious) upbringing prohibits prayer in school but does not respect those who's religious upbringing says that homosexuality is wrong.<br />
<br />
Basic anatomy, including sexual organs, is the preview of schools. Dealing with a childs sexuality is the preview of parents. Parents are not given much of a choice on whether their children are taught these items. That's having an agenda forced upon you, not reading Nitefox expressing his point of view.<br />
<br />
That being said, there are a great many passages in the Bible that people who call themselves Christians pick and choose to follow as it suits their needs. Why does homosexuality have to be any different? <br />
<br />
If the only argument that someone can find that homosexuality is wrong is that it says so in the Bible then I have issues with that. For instance we can all agree that murder is wrong. It hurts people. But who gives a damn what two consenting adults do in their bedroom any way and who cares if they kiss and hold hands in public. They are hurting no one.<br />
<br />
After actually reading the bill, it makes sense to me.  Gay children should go to foster parents who are going to be able to understand and deal with those issues. I can't see taking an already traumatized child and giving him to a foster parent who is going to do him further damage by telling that he is wrong and may go to hell because he attracted to a member of the same sex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deeger, how is your freedom of anything affected by the fact that other people are permitted to excercise their freedom?  Unless they are forcing theirs on you or placing their religious/sexual/other personal agenda/idea on a government institution or property, which is the government advocating that, then they are not infringing on your rights.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a double standard that says that we must respect those who's religious (or non-religious) upbringing prohibits prayer in school but does not respect those who's religious upbringing says that homosexuality is wrong.&quot; - Tolyn<br />
<br />
I respectfully disagree.  They are being taught about homosexuality, not that they should be homosexuals. If they are, then that is wrong. That is also the government telling someone what to do in their private lie.  But I have never seen this happen.  What has happened is they are taught what exactly homosexuality is, not whether it is right or wrong.<br />
<br />
In fact, the schools which have these classes in my state (Ok) are required to have the parent and child sign a slip to attend such classes.<br />
<br />
Glad to see the discussion back on a civil note.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't so much that they were teaching children what homosexuality is, it was a great deal more involved than that.

That was where I was drawing a line and maybe I didn't articulate that very well.<br />

The way I understand it, Christians believe they are hurting their soul by practicing homosexual behaivor.

No, Taamar, I would not rent to a Pagan, either.<br />
<br />
My point is this: Your rights end at my nose, to use the common example. <br />
<br />
You have a right to be a pagan, and my not renting to you does not infringe on that. It simply allows me to exercise my religious beliefs. By not renting to you, I have not stopped you from being a Pagan, you can find somewhere else to rent. But, by the government forcing me to rent to you in violation of my 1st Amendment rghts, my right to freely exercise my religion is eroded.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon, I'm trying to give reasoned responses, without calling names. I hope I'm still ok, rule-wise.<br />
<br />
Edit. But to be consistant, let's look at the reverse. I can honestly say to you that if the roles were reversed, and I was looking for a place to rent,and a Pagan refused to rent to me, I would be fine with that. It's the right of that Pagan to exercise his religion his way, under the laws of the U.S., and my rights end at his nose.</div></div><hr />

The government is attempting to do something that I'm not happy with.  It doesn't matter why I'm against it.<br />
<br />
Since this question was directed at me:<br />
Deeger, how is your freedom of anything affected by the fact that other people are permitted to excercise their freedom? Unless they are forcing theirs on you or placing their religious/sexual/other personal agenda/idea on a government institution or property, which is the government advocating that, then they are not infringing on your rights<br />
I am not arguing on the basis of freedom.  My point is that the government--MY government--is doing something that I don't approve of.  It is my right, my duty, and my privaledge to state my opinions and to vote the way I see fit.  Just as it is your (collective &quot;your&quot;) right, duty, and privaledge to do the same and to debate the issue in the &quot;Public Square&quot; to get more people to agree with your point of view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to some extent you are right that you should and have a duty to vote how you see fit.<br />
<br />
However, what I find so sad is that the ONLY reason that I've seen anyone state for why they feel this law is bad is due to religious reasons.  So, by pushing so hard to go against something that does not force any ideal on anyone, other than allow gay/lesbian/transgender foster parents and children the SAME rights that Christian/conservative foster parents and children already enjoy, you are in effect forcing your religious proclivities on the rest of society.  Via the government.<br />
<br />
That's where the problem is.<br />
<br />
Now, were this bill actually forcing Christian foster parents to spout pro-gay information and go against their religious beliefs, than believe me, I'd be right beside you saying it was bad legislation.<br />
<br />
However, everything that I have seen of the bill thus far just attempts to give gay/lesbian/transgender children a chance to get a foster family that is supportive of their lifestyle and condition.<br />
<br />
This is not forcing anyone to do anything, only attempting to allow everyone the same rights.</div></div><hr />

Let's take a non-religious topic: legalizing drugs.  I oppose legalizing drugs and it's not based directly on my religious beliefs.  If our government created a bill to legalize drugs, shouldn't I oppose it?  Isn't that what democracy is all about?

Your objections to homosexuality (and presumably Nitefox's as well) come from a religious basis.<br />
<br />
Forcing these views on others within the country by way of the government becomes the defacto establishment of a state sponsored religion.<br />
<br />
And that is something that is expressly forbidden by the constitution. <br />
And this is where you and I continually butt heads. One could argue that any issue brought before any level of government ultimately stems from a religious belief and as such &quot;is expressly forbidden by the constitution.&quot; Using that argument, we would have to eliminate virtually every law on the books.

<br />
This isn't a religious issue anyway. This particular bill and article deals with a state agency actively promoting the homosexual lifestyle to minors. They don't currently actively promote a heterosexual lifestyle to minors because psychologists and government both have determined that actively promoting ANY type of sexual lifestyle is detrimental to the health of the child. Now you want to go ahead and FORCE foster parents to PROMOTE homosexuality? I don't think so. &quot;Won't SOMEONE think of the children, Marge?!?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Homosexual, heterosexual or neutral, that would be wrong. However, before I believe in the truth of this occurring, I would have to see documentation. This is not an example of a &quot;gay agenda&quot; or violation of anyone's religious rights, it's an example of a really bad idea, period.<br />

Vader, as far as &quot;good Christians&quot; not trying to save souls that are none of their business, in a very real, dogmatic sense you are wrong. Christ taught that it was the duty of believers to prosteltize and try to convert as many souls as possible. <br />
<br />
It would be more accurate to say that the more practical Christians realize it isn't prudent, not that one side is good and the other bad. IN fact, in a strictly defined sense you would be more accurate to reverse the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; adjectives.<br />

(Yes, I realize that places me in the &quot;bad&quot; category, but that is a discussion for another time and place.)<br />

I would respectfully submit that stating one's viewpoint is in no way an attempt to force one's view on others. I have never seen Nitefox, myself, Taamar, or anyone else say &quot;you have to change your mind to agree with me or else...&quot;<br />
<br />
There is more than one side to any debate, just because Nitefox is always on the same side doesn't mean he's forcing his views on anyone - it just makes him consistant. I would submit that Taamar, Kullaas and others are simply consistant as well. <br />
<br />
I don't see one viewpoint as open-minded and others as closed-minded. You would call Nitefox and me closed-minded because we are Christians who do not want to understand or experience homosexuality, while you would call Taamar open-minded because she would. On the other hand, she would not convert to Christianity, nor change her sexual habits, how does that make her more open-minded than me? IMHO, it doesn't. it just makes us different.<br />
<br />
(Taamar, no offense intended toward you at all - I'm just using you as a handy example. In NO WAY am I intending the imply you are closed-minded.)<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that each of us has been saying that we want what is best for the children. The disagreement, religiously-based or not, is on what actually defines &quot;best for the children.&quot; I think that's a legitimate topic, though religion invariably comes into play. <br />

Wow, now THAT'S a good question. I have to say &quot;yes&quot; I would be opposed to that, but then I have to try to justify why I would be opposed to that language and not the actual language of the bill. <br />
<br />
My best reasoning is that a racist person tends to have a negative effect on the society around them through their actions, while a homosexual would not. Racism doesn't tend to be something you practice only in the privacy of your home, while sexual activity does tend to be. <br />
<br />
That's really not a very good argument, but it's the best I can come up with for the moment. I'm really going to have to think about that one and get back to you. All I can say is that given the information I've seen here, I'm glad this isn't up for a vote in my state, because I would have a very hard time knowing which side to support.<br />

These quotes you use are a conservative groups take on the legislation.  After the actual legislation was posted there was NO SECTION that indicated that anyone would force a foster parent to take these classes.  They would only be required to take the cources if they were trying to foster a gay/lesbian/transgender child.  It would be no different than requiring a foster parent to attend parenting classes before becoming eligable to take a child.  I see nothing wrong with that.  If you don't agree with that lifestyle, then you shouldn't be fostering a gay/lesbian/transgender child in the first place.</div></div><hr />

If that is indeed the case, then I agree with you. However, the bit about &quot;sensative&quot; = &quot;supportive&quot; was a quote taken from one of the legislators, not merely rhetoric by the organization opposed to the bill. That's the same flaw as confusing &quot;tolerance&quot; with &quot;acceptance.&quot;<br />

I think that what makes this interesting is that religious tolerance is an implicit part of the pagan religions... thus a 'pagan' who refuses to rent to Christians isn't really a pagan but is using the religion as more of an 'anti-Christian' stance... this is similar to people who hide hatred of Jews behind a Christian facade. I have no problem at all with Christians in general, but my religion tells me that there is one supreme being who reveals himself in many ways, and that you worship one and I worship a different one... I can't understand why you (this is the plural, impersonal you, I am not singling anyone out) seem to think that I need to change to save my soul. My soul, by all I can see, is in pretty good shape. I am kind, thoughful, generous. I am reverent of my deity and he (she, it, they.... All are One) shows me that I am following what is, for me, the true path. <br />
Anyway, we have digressed again. If I am a foster parent and they place a child in my home who was raised a devout Christian, please give me sensitivity training and a basic understanding of his beliefs so I don't accidentally offend him. Let me know what Christian church is nearby and of his denomination so I can support his spirituality, and remind me when a holiday is coming up that I ought to prepare for... I'm not going to know them, someone will have to prepare me.<br />

Myrea, use me as an example any time you want :) As I see it, the difference isn't whether I would convert or change, but the fact that, while I disagree with your religion, I feel it may be the perfectly right way for YOU to live, while you consider me to be a sinner. I do not expect you to become bisexual to fit with my beliefs that love is a gift that we should never turn aside (not 'sex is a gift'... LOVE. I can love another woman without ever touching her sexually), but you expect me to hide MY sexuality to fit your beliefs (thats another impersonal plural you. I hate this language). Yes, I DO think I am more open-minded... If you came over to my house on Dec 25th I would certainly know and respect that it is a holy day for you... if you visited you on August 1st would you wish me a blessed Lammastide? I will be happy to go to church with you, knowledge is good. Will you come celebrate the next full moon with me?</div></div><hr />

I think what makes that interesting is that most of the Wiccans I know (and I know quite a few of them) turned to Wicca because of their disillusionment with and subsequent hatred for the Catholic church. I think if you were to separate those who are religous from those who claim to be religious, across all religions, you will find that those who actually are religious are in the vast minority.</div></div><hr />

My issue with peoples opposition to this bill is that they are preventing children with a particular need from getting support based on their own religious proclivities.  It's not that their own views aren't being respected, it's that they are in effect forcing those views on others who DON'T share them.<br />
<br />
All this bill does is provide those individuals with the same support structure that more mainstream children enjoy.<br />
<br />
There are PLENTY of areas where the vast majority of all religions and secular thought overlap, and that is where the laws should be placed.  Things that one set of people believe in, solely on a religious basis, without any secular data to back it up should not be put down as law.<br />

This bill does not FORCE anyone to do anything.  It PROVIDES a supportive home for minors that are gay/lesbian/transgender.  There is a difference.  If you think that children haven't descovered their sexuality before they are 18 you are amazingly niave.  What this bill provides is a supportive home for children who for the most part to this date have NOT had a supportive home.  This bill isn't trying to take kids and make them go have sex, it's trying to find parents who understand and can relate to their sexual urges and desires which I guarentee you they are experiencing well before they become legal adults.<br />
<br />
To look at it another way, the current system with respect to gay/lesbian/transgender children is exactly the same as taking a devout Christian foster child and placing them with a Pagan foster family where they are denied the ability to pray their own way, and forced to perform Pagan rituals that they don't agree with.  All this bill in effect would do is provide a supportive home for that Christian child to be able to grow up in.</div></div><hr />

Easy there, Aizle. Let's not resort to making baseless assumptions about one another and resorting to personal attacks, huh? Disagree with me, fine, but try to keep it civil. I've never stepped on your toes or belittled you. Why start on me again?<br />
<br />
I am well aware that children's sexuality awakens long before they turn 18. I simply feel that it is both the parents' right and responsibility to introduce their own children to the topic of sexuality. Sadly, many parents don't. Unfortunately, and there's no sugar-coating who's behind the drive, liberal and often-times anti-religion organizations feel it is the government's responsibility to raise children, not the parents'. (There ya go, Vader. More conspiracy stuff for ya.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
She generally had 2-3 foster children at any time, and two children of her own. She took her foster children and her own two kids to church each Sunday. If they were raised in a particular belief, she would drop them off at their church. If they were not, she would send them with my parents to our church. She felt that children who had been abused or abandoned needed the feeling of community, love and forgiveness that our small-town churches could offer. <br />

She was a terrific influence on those children. To me, that's what sensitivity and support are about. I can't bring myself to believe that showing that kind of sensitivity and support for a child with a different sexual preference or non-Christian religion would be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Quite simply I think the US government should not use any &quot;label&quot; of a person in any law. Black, white, gay, transgender...whatever the case may be the government has no reason to use the law to direct any group of people any special right. Or, in reverse, the government has no reason to take away a right of any group of people. In this case the government seems to simply want to place &quot;apples with apples&quot; and &quot;oranges with oranges.&quot; (Forgive the simple analogy but, I think it illustrates the point well) <br />
<br />
On the surface that may seem like a simple and reasonable thing to do but, in the end it won't be the law that directs which child will go with which foster parent. It will be whomever is working with that agency who makes that decision. This is different then a police officer being directed to arrest a murderer (I think everyone can agree that murder is wrong). <br />
<br />
My argument would be that this should not become a law (has it yet?). It should be the choice of the agency and the duty of the social worker to find a loving and caring family who will take care of the needs of the child. In my opinion it would be wrong to try to legislate such action.</div></div><hr />

Homosexual, heterosexual or neutral, that would be wrong. However, before I believe in the truth of this occurring, I would have to see documentation. This is not an example of a &quot;gay agenda&quot; or violation of anyone's religious rights, it's an example of a really bad idea, period.<br />
<br />
The reason though this made into the schools was that it was pushed through under the guise of teaching tolerance of the homosexual lifestyle. I concur fully that it is a bad idea, regardless of whether it was homosexual, herterosexual or neutral. But it seems that as long as something is packaged to teach tolerance, it's acceptable.  <br />
<br />
While I was raised in a Christian household and celebrate predominantly Christian holidays, one of the people who means the most to me in this world is a Wiccan. I was asking her assistance in the gift shopping arena and realized that I  had never bothered to ask her what holidays she celebrated. It was an eye opening experience for me. I was so intent that my beliefs were the right ones that I had an almost total disregard for her beliefs. Fortunately for me she is one of the most caring and forgiving people I know and she spent a good part of her day helping me to learn. :)  <br />
<br />
Also, while reading this post, I discovered that I have an issue that I can not resolve. I'm something of a constitutional purist and therefore I strongly support the right of freedom of association guarenteed under the First Amendment which would extend in my book to some of the ideals that Bery is talking about, however, I also feel very strongly about discriminating based on someone's race, sex, sexual preference or religion.  I've discovered a hypocracy in my own belief system. Go figure.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to one of the most volatile yet predominantly civil general discussion boards on the 'net. You'll learn the ropes and the personalities quickly enough. Pretty much all that we ask is that personal attacks and flames not be used and that certain topics such as comparing religious belief systems not be discussed.

My issue with peoples opposition to this bill is that they are preventing children with a particular need from getting support based on their own religious proclivities. It's not that their own views aren't being respected, it's that they are in effect forcing those views on others who DON'T share them. <br />
But Aizle, if somebody consideres homosexuality wrong how could you expect them to support this bill?  If my ficticious &quot;racist&quot; bill was up for a vote, would you accept it?  Would you write it off by saying &quot;I'm against racism but others are not so I think every racist child should be in a supportive home.&quot;  I doubt it (at least I hope not .)

&quot;all foster parents will be required to undergo “sensitivity” training on homosexual, bisexual and transgender issues. <br />
<br />
AB 2651 requires foster parents and foster care staff to be “sensitive” to cross-dressing by foster children and homosexual behavior. Today in the committee hearing Assemblywoman Chu stated that the word “sensitive” means “supportive” of foster children engaging in these sexual lifestyles.&quot; <br />
<br />
If you want to go the &quot;religious freedom&quot; route, how about a government agency FORCING US Citizens to engage in an activity that directly goes against their religion? They HAVE to undergo &quot;sensitivity&quot; training on issues that are diametrically opposed to their religious beliefs and then have to turn around and support their own (foster) children engaging in those activities. That is practically the very definition of a restriction on the freedom to practice one's religion.<br />

<br />
But it only requires a parent to attend that 'sensitivity training' if the child they are going to foster is a homosexual. If someone doesn't think homosexuality is right he shouldn't be fostering a homosexual child, unless they can let that child alone about the homosexuality and not tell them they disapprove.  Would you want a Muslim family fostering a Christian child just to convert him and tell him Allah loves him?  In my eyes, it's the same.<br />
<br />
Your rights as a Christian haven't been eroded, your rights as a landlord to discriminate are the only thing that have been eroded.    When you're a landlord they're not suing you as a Christian or a person, they're suing you as a landlord who is discriminating based on sexual preference, the same as a black person would sue if a white supremist family wouldn't let him or her rent because of the color of their skin.<br />
<br />
And as to the teacher who was encouraging students to engage in sexual activity, assuming it's true, that is something I would oppose also.  She should just teach them about sex, not to do it.  Teaching them to do those things is against the law also. It's not the 'gay agenda', it's just stupid.</div></div><hr />

Easy there, Aizle. Let's not resort to making baseless assumptions about one another and resorting to personal attacks, huh? Disagree with me, fine, but try to keep it civil. I've never stepped on your toes or belittled you. Why start on me again?<br />
<br />
I am well aware that children's sexuality awakens long before they turn 18. I simply feel that it is both the parents' right and responsibility to introduce their own children to the topic of sexuality. Sadly, many parents don't. Unfortunately, and there's no sugar-coating who's behind the drive, liberal and often-times anti-religion organizations feel it is the government's responsibility to raise children, not the parents'. (There ya go, Vader. More conspiracy stuff for ya.) <br />
<br />
I didn't make that comment to try and attack you, meerly making a statement of my opinion.  The overwhelming feeling that I was getting from everyone against this legislation was that they somehow envisioned gay parents holding same sex orgys to help their foster childrens love life.  A concept that is just plain silly.  It was meant as a royal you, meaning that anyone with that opinion was naive.<br />
<br />
I couldn't agree with the 2nd paragraph more.  It SHOULD be the parents who introduce their children to that topic.  Remember that the foster care system is there to try and provide parents for children that don't have them in the true sense of the word.  So therefore they should be able to provide suitable parents for the child that becomes a ward of the state.</div></div><hr />

The difference here is that if someone is racist they actively and aggressively try to infinge on others rights.  To be gay does not infringe on anyones rights.  No more so than being of any other non forceful (rape) sexual life style.</div></div><hr />

Not really, this is about foster parents, not adoption.  It's making sure that the state has the resources of foster parents to adaquately take care of those non-mainstream children.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course they would be suing you as a person...a person who is a landlord who is also racist. As I said earlier, the government shouldn't have any say in race or any other label they want to put. In this case the law would, in effect, be saying that your beliefs are wrong and you will be punished occordingly. <br />
<br />
The Law shouln't be there to direct anyone toward or away from any way of thinking. If you want to be a racist or a bigot that is your right. It is your property so, it should be up to you if you want to be racist in who you choose to live on your property. However, if you care to think this way then you are severely limiting your ability to find someone to fill your vacancy. <br />
<br />
To get back to the original point...I generally believe that people who choose to become foster parents would be open minded to most beliefs...it is only realistic in such a diverse society (that America is) that children of different beliefs might be placed in your home. What situation was it that initiated this bill? It would eb my bet that there was an incident which is causing legislators to react in such a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thorneblade, thanks for posting (re-posting?) the link to the actual bill. One thing I did notice is that virtually everything that was stricken from the bill when it was amended talked about making all of this training and information about homosexual lifestyles mandatory to not only the foster parents, but to the foster children as well. I'm glad to see it was stricken from the bill, but in its original form, the bill would have literally forced the presentation of homosexuality as perfectly normal, moral, acceptable, and &quot;right&quot; directly to the children, regardless of age. <br />
<br />
I would like to know what the difference is between &quot;State mandated&quot; and a &quot;declaration of Legislative Intent and State Policy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
However, the bill itself is contradictory:<br />
<br />
&quot;Discrimination based on the sexual orientation of foster<br />
parents and other foster household members, in licensing, approval,  and placement decisions, is prohibited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is the goal of this state that foster parents, including  , but not limited to,  gay or lesbian adults, shall be identified who are interested in caring for gay or lesbian youth in foster care.&quot;<br />
<br />
They say you can't make placement decisions based on the sexual orientation of the foster parents, then they turn around and state that their goal is to actively seek out gay and lesbian foster parents or foster parents who are interested in caring for gay or lesbian youth. I.E. they are making placement decisions based on sexual orientation.<br />
<br />
&quot;'A' is prohibited by enactment of this law. Furthermore, the State agency will make every effort to ensure that 'A' occurs.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
From my interpretation of the text I take this to mean they will not discrimintate against someone who wants to be a foster parent because of their sexual orientation, but they will try to place gay/lesbian youth with foster parents who are interested in looking after children of that nature whether the foster parents are homosexual or not.<br />
<br />
So if you are striaght you can still foster gay/lesbian youths so long as you have been identified as being interested in looking after youths of this nature.</div></div><hr />

Going back to your point about a change in the bill talking about Racism... admitedly I don't know the laws over there but in this country the difference is that Racism is illegal and however much some people might not like it the majority of society has decided that Homosexuality is not illegal. <br />
<br />
By saying the majority of society I mean that by who is voted into government, if the majority of society actually wanted homosexuality to be illegal I am sure there would be some way to get the laws changed, that is how a democracy works....</div></div><hr />

There is also part of the bill that covers religious beliefs and trying to make sure that youths are placed in homes with foster parents who are either of their belief or accepting of their beliefs.<br />

I know the answer might seem obvious but do the religious members of this board at least agree with those parts of the bill.</div></div><hr />

Again, where my disappointment comes from is that they are basing their opposition to this bill on a religious basis only from what I've seen.  That is the cruxt of my issue with their stance.<br />
<br />
There is a rather large body of scientific, secular data that shows that gay/lesbian/transgender issues are genetic, not a &quot;choice&quot; per se, and even occur naturally in other species.  There is for instance a type of monkey that masterbates, has homosexual encounters and heterosexual encounters.<br />
<br />
Now, there are many people who dismiss this data because they feel the Bible says that it's wrong.  That is fine, their constitutional right and I have no problem with them expressing that opinion or having that idea, even as wrong as I think it is.<br />
<br />
However, because we are talking about wards of the state, and the states ability to support and nurture those wards, the state has to make a reasonable effort to support and nurture ALL children.  The state should not be hindered in it's ability to provide compasionate support because of a religious argument.  I suspect that this bill is being written because there is a significant number of gay/lesbian/transgender children within the system that the state is having difficulty properly helping.<br />
<br />
As for your racism argument, racism is not one of those protected areas in law.  It is illegal for instance to discriminate when you either rent to or hire someone based on: gender, age, race and sexual orientation.  It seems to me that those same rules should apply the states interactions with foster families as well.</div></div><hr />

Even if we grant that the issue may be a genetic one or that it occurs in nature, that doesn't in and of itself validate the issue as &quot;normal.&quot; Looking at it from a purely Darwinistic approach, it is highly un-natural, seeing as it cannot further one's genes through the creation of offspring.

I'm not saying that gay/lesbian/transgender people are &quot;normal&quot;.  They are too much of a minority to be called &quot;normal&quot; in the true sense of the word.  I'm saying that they have just as much of a right to decent, loving care as everyone else does.  Preferably from someone who understands about their &quot;condition&quot; and can help them understand it and live with it.  Just because someone isn't &quot;normal&quot; doesn't mean that they are evil.</div></div><hr />

Hardly. I never said it was &quot;evil&quot; and I certainly never said they should be &quot;killed at birth.&quot; I don't know where you got that from. All I'm saying is that I'm sick and tired of people assuming that just because some studies seem to indicate a genetic correlation doesn't make it &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;natural.&quot; Scientific theory predicts that it cannot logically be assumed to be either, and all of the major world religions consider it to be immoral. If you don't believe in a god, then the latter half of that statement is irrelevant. If you do believe in a god, then why do you suppose he went to so much trouble to make it perfectly clear that homosexuality was against his plan? Contrary to popular belief, (true) Christianity doesn't teach that sins and sinners are evil. I simply don't feel it should be promoted and glorified. Call me old fashioned, but I also don't think that heterosexuality should be promoted and glorified to children either.<br />
<br />
I agree that everybody, regardless of ANY condition (violent felons and the like being an exception), has just as much of a right to &quot;life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness&quot; as anybody else. I am completely against descrimination of any type.</div></div><hr />

Racism is wrong because we, the people, say it is wrong.  Most people agree that it is wrong.  We have voted into power representitives that have made certain actions of racism illegal.  This happened because people in our past (eg. Frederick Douglass) took moral stands and went against the grain.  This is precisely what Nitefox is doing.  It is also what Tamaar is doing.  So we hash it out.  We try to come to some consensus.<br />

So it's OK to be argue against something as long as the moral grounding has nothing to do with the Bible?</div></div><hr />

Even if we grant that the issue may be a genetic one or that it occurs in nature, that doesn't in and of itself validate the issue as &quot;normal.&quot; Looking at it from a purely Darwinistic approach, it is highly un-natural, seeing as it cannot further one's genes through the creation of offspring. If it was natural and not an abnormal genetic mutation, the gene simply would not have survived through hundreds, if not thousands of generations. <br />
Not true, hemophiliacs are highly unlikely to reproduce, but because the gene is rare and recessive there are plenty of carriers who ensure that we continue to have people with the condition. Meanwhile, with the amount of overcrowding and the usage of resources I think it is about time we started searching, as a species, for a means to limit our population. Look at it this way: if being gay IS genetic then by allowing them to indulge thier nature they will be less likely to enter 'fake marriages' and pass their genes on.<br />

Some good stuff here...<br />

<br />
Racism is wrong because we, the people, say it is wrong.  Most people agree that it is wrong.  We have voted into power representitives that have made certain actions of racism illegal.  This happened because people in our past (eg. Frederick Douglass) took moral stands and went against the grain.  This is precisely what Nitefox is doing.  It is also what Tamaar is doing.  So we hash it out.  We try to come to some consensus.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love when people post while I'm writing a post.... My basis is actually that racism is wrong and homosexuality isnt because racism harms people OTHER THAN THOSE INVOLVED. If you want to sit at home and quietly hate, thats fine by me, it is your right. If you want to prevent someone else from excercising their rights because you disagree with them on an issue of morality, THAT is where I have a problem. In any case, I see racism and homophobia as the same thing... hating someone for who they are.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even talking about 'hating' homosexuals or pagans. I don't hate them, I don't hate anyone. I am simply talking about religious freedom, and the fact that some laws in the U.S. are infringing on that right, in violation of the First Amendment, and I used the rental thing as an example, to answer Buntar's question.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the proposed law in California, it seems to me that it's just a symptom of a much larger social phenomena.<br />
<br />
It is growing more and more popular in this country to try to legislate away consequences. This bill, in my opinion, is another attempt at that.<br />
<br />
It's an unpopular idea to tell anyone, anymore, that there are consequences to actions. Society hasn't been totally corrupted, obviously, because we still see that there are consequences to crime. However, on personal matters, we can see many examples of consequences, which are attempted to be pooh-poohed away.<br />
<br />
I can (and have) taught my daughters that there are consequences to pre-marital sex. Here comes the schools, handing out condoms, which in effect tells my daughter there are no consequences. Of course, they don't bother to mention that sometimes they don't work, they break, etc...<br />
<br />
So, a girl uses the condom, it fails, and she gets pregnant. There's the consequence, staring her in the face. But, here comes our government, who tells her there's no consequences! We can just abort the baby. Of course, they don't mention the many women who've spent years in therapy because of having an abortion.<br />
<br />
This is just one example. There are others, and if you think about them, they all have the same root: Most people in the U.S. want to have their 'good time', without paying the consequences.<br />
<br />
To me, this bill is another symptom of that mentality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was a very good interpretation of the problem. I hadn't looked at it quite that way. My take has always been that the problem lies in the fact that the government continues to pass legislation that effectively states the government is responsible for raising children, not the parents, combined with additional legislation designed to prevent child abuse, but effectively removing the ability of parents to discipline their children and/or eroding the parent's perceived authority over the child from the child's point of view.</div></div><hr />

Giving out condems isn't going to tell them theres no consequences.  There was a debate about this in my school a couple months ago and there was a pretty uniform consensus that A. Giving out condoms is not going to make people have sex more, and B. It would be better to have them and not be needed than not have them and someone needing them.<br />
<br />
So Deeger, you would rather have homosexual kids put in highly anti homosexual households?   Thats suicide material right there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's my point. I teach my daughters that pre-marital sex is wrong, and that if they choose to engage in it, there are consequences to be paid. This isn't something I set up, I don't cause the consequences; this is God's rules. I.e., 'whatsoever you sow, that also you shall reap'<br />
<br />
But now, here comes the schools, handing out the condoms. Whether you acknowledge it or not, the underlying message is'If you have sex, this will protect you.' Which is not true. It may protect you some of the time, but not all of the time. The ONLY way to avoid the consequences, 100% of the time, is to abstain.<br />
<br />
Handing out condoms has a subtle, underlying message, that you can have your good time, without fear of the consequences.</div></div><hr />

Not to a person of color, certainly. In the same manner that I wouldn't want you fostering a gay child. In fact, if you intend to teach your attitudes I personally would rather you didn't pass them on to anyone, but I won't interfere with your right to do so. I also would hope that if you were to foster a child you would request one whose lifestyle choices were compatible with your beliefs.<br />
<br />
OK, those of you who remember the source of thay Monty Python song... it goes on to mock protestants as well. The members get away with it because they ARE Christian... in the same way that it is OK for a black man to call another 'nigger' or for me to call my girlfriend 'butch'. <br />

All I'm telling you is that you should be prepared for the consequences that'll come your way when you least expect it. Like it or not, deny it or not, actions often have consequences.<br />
<br />
You may have sex with a condom 10 times, and get away with it. Or a hundred times. But it only takes one time of the odds catching up with you, for your whole life to be changed.<br />
<br />
This concept doesn't just deal with the one example I've used. It's true of all human activity. You may get away with adultery 50 or 100 times, but the one time you get caught, there's the consequence. You may steal 100 times and not get caught, but once you do, you suffer the consequences.<br />

Life's like that, for a reason.</div></div><hr />

What I mean is, 100 in 100. You may get away with it for awhile, but eventually it catches up with ya. Count you as the 1 in 100.<br />
<br />
Number 2 in 100 may get away with it for awhile, but eventually it catches up with the 2. And on, and on.<br />
<br />
Now, before you say to me: You mean that every girl who has sex using a condom will eventually get pregnant? Not necessarily. Consequences aren't one size fits all. Some will get pregnant, certainly. Some will get an STD. Some will be found out by their parents, who are deeply hurt. So on and so on.<br />

<br />
I assume if you don't agree with it you would rather (were you to be a foster parent) not to have the chance of getting a gay/lesbian youth. Surely that would just end up causing this poor child who, (by the very fact that they need to be removed from their own family) has had a pretty hard life, more stress and pain. And surely this isn't the time in this youths life to be told that the way of life they have chosen is wrong and will end up putting them in hell....<br />

I have to agree with Beryllin there. I have 2 friends who had been in a long term relationship and had never slept together but decided to, she was on the pill and he used a condom, and she became pregnant it was awful :(.<br />
<br />
However unfortunate they were though the odds of that happening are about as similar as walking out of your front door and being run over by a car... <br />
<br />
I am not against premarital sex (I don't agree with that term I know of couples who have been together for 20 years and have never married) but you take the risk and you have to be ready to take the consequences of your actions and if you are not prepared for that then you shouldn't do it.</div></div><hr />

What if I constantly try to force him onto same-sex relationships? If I foster a Catholic child and contantly remind him of the evils of the inquisition is that going to help him heal? What if I forbid him his church and punish him for celebrating his holidays? Perhaps I ought to take in a Hispanic and call him a 'wetback'?This is what you are talking about... people having total freedon to force their chosen lifestyles and views on foster children. If you don't approve of homosexuality don't foster a gay child. If you are anti-pagan, dont adopt one.

My sex-ed class in the Los Angeles area was very clear that ONLY abstinence was 100% effective in preventing disease and pregnancy.

I can't imagine that teachings would've changed so much since then, considering the risk of HIV has only become higher.<br />
<br />
What I'm hearing the government &amp; school system say is that if you really just have to have sex, then use a condom.  By making condoms available to teens, I don't feel it promotes teen sex - if a teen's going to have sex, he/she is going to do it whether the school provides condoms or not.  At least with condoms being available, they're less likely to get themselves in trouble.<br />
<br />
On the issue of the bill in California, I'm not sure I understand the problem . . . I scanned the text of the bill and it seems to me they are only requiring that foster parents take a course to understand the implications of being homosexual in our society and what special needs a homosexual young person might have.  There's no requirement written in that a foster parent morally opposed to homosexuality must take in a foster child of that sexual orientation.  The bill doesn't seem to be forcing anything except education.  I don't see how simply having to learn about the topic and be sensitive to homosexual individuals is a threat to anyone's morals or rights (remember, learning about it doesn't mean you have to agree with it or accept it as a normal lifestyle).</div></div><hr />

I don't see where the government is forcing anyone to do anything.  The government represents homosexuals, and has an obligation to provide services for them.  In acting as a foster parent, you are an agent of the government.  It may be possible for CPS to choose certain placements for certain children, but in many cases it won't be.  If you're not prepared to take in a homosexual child, and offer them the support and understanding that they need in order to feel safe and welcome, whether you agree with their choices or not, then perhaps you're better off not being a foster parent.  The same thing goes for skinheads, drug users, habitual criminals, and other kinds of behavior.  Foster kids come from messed-up situations, so it's no surprise that a lot of them are messed-up kids.  The job of the foster parent is not to teach them right from wrong, or comment on their actions, it's to provide them a safe place to live.  That doesn't mean foster parents can't provide some discipline, or that foster kids shouldn't be held to some standards of behavior while they're in foster care, but judging them for their actions outside the foster home is totally inappropriate.<br />
<br />
I don't see where this is telling anyone their actions have no consequences either.  What action and consequence are we talking about here?  Are you saying that kids who &quot;choose&quot; to be gay should understand that the consequences of their &quot;action&quot; will be that they will be ostracized, criticized and condemned?  Trust me, gay kids understand that consequence very well.  The foster home shouldn't be a place for continuing it.  <br />
<br />
In fact, part of the bill says that foster parents who care for homosexuals should be trained in the health concerns and consequences of homosexuality.  To me that sounds like they're well prepared to talk about it with the kids.<br />
<br />
I like the racist comparison, very challenging thinking.  However, I think that we need to focus on the kids.  If the government were to pass a bill saying that we need more racist foster parents, I'd wonder about it, but as long as it's clearly understood that the foster parents need to keep their beliefs to themselves, and allow kids to feel safe regardless of their race, then I'm not going to judge them based on what they believe.  If the government says that foster parents need to take training on racism, and be prepared to take in a racist kid and understand their concerns, I say darn right they do.<br />
<br />
I don't see where this is giving special rights to a particular minority, either.  All kids who need foster care have the right to decent foster care, that meets their needs.  For some kids, the average person is well prepared to accomodate them.  For others, the average person needs some training before they're ready.  I don't see anything wrong with providing it.<br />
<br />
At the heart of this debate is the question of whether or not homosexuality is &quot;normal&quot;.  (Transsexualism, I think we can agree, is abnormal at least to the extent that it requires medical treatment.)  If homosexuals are &quot;abnormal&quot;, then maybe we shouldn't have them taking care of children.  If homosexuality is an abomination, then any government action which recognizes or legitimizes it is objectionable.  Again I say, think of the children.  Are these gay children so awful that we shouldn't offer them safe, comfortable environments?  Are gay people such terrible people that they shouldn't be allowed to offer their homes to kids in need?  Is there something in their sexuality that inherently makes them unfit?  I say no. <br />
<br />
I say we need all the foster parents we can get, and that foster parents need all the understanding they can get.  If the government wants to enhance that, I'm all for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, so much to disagree with, so little time. ; )<br />
<br />
Firion, I disagree with much of what you said. Surprised, I bet. = )<br />
<br />
First, you assume that some kids are born homosexual. I disagree. I will always think of homosexuality as a choice made, not something uncontrollable, as in genetic.<br />
<br />
Second, I agree with you that if you don't want to take in a foster child who is homosexual, you shouldn't be a foster parent.<br />
<br />
Third, I TOTALLY disagree with you that foster parents shouldn't teach children right from wrong. A large percentage of children who enter foster care are there precisely BECAUSE nobody ever taught them right from wrong.<br />
<br />
Fourth, I agree that all kids who need foster care deserve a foster home that meets their needs. (Not sure about the 'have the right' wording you used, but it may be simply a semantics differentiation). Where you and I would probably differ is in defining what the needs of the child are. I would say that children need guidance, and that includes spiritual guidance. As a Christian, I would even go so far as to say they need Christian guidance. But, I also understand that many folks here would disagree with me. If I understand the inference of your post, you would say that children need a home that provides shelter, but no guidance.<br />
<br />
I'm not attacking you, don't take this post as such. Just stating my views on what you said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kullaas, I explained my point of view on a different thread awhile back, and I am loth to re-hash it. So, I'll say it once, and I'll refrain from saying more about it. No offense intended to anyone on this thread.<br />
<br />
I equate homosexuality as a sin against God, in the same way that adultery is a sin against God, or stealing, or murder.<br />
<br />
A man can be tempted to have sex with his neighbor's wife. He can give in, or he can resist.<br />
<br />
A man can be tempted to steal a car. He can give in, or he can resist. <br />
<br />
A man, for whatever reason, can want to kill someone. He can give in, or he can resist.<br />
<br />
<br />
A man can be tempted to have sex with another man. He can give in, or he can resist.<br />
<br />
What causes  the temptation is irrelevent, whether the temptation is adultery, theft, murder, or homosexuality.<br />
<br />
I understand very well that my view will be offensive to some here. It is not my intention to offend any of you. I hope you'll understand that, and not be offended, even though you disagree with me vehemently. Understand that i am not going to be offended by your dissenting point of views, I respect your right to disagree. <br />
<br />
I use those as examples of sin against God, though the list is certainly not all-inclusive.</div></div><hr />

As in, it's not only gay men who won't take no for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;If person &quot;P&quot; is against action &quot;A&quot; then it makes all the sense in the world for P to actively fight against any laws or guidlines that promote or nomalize action A.&quot;<br />
<br />
False analogy.  I can be 'against something' and not think others shouldn't be allowed to do it.  Let's take two instances.  <br />
<br />
1) I hate baseball.  It's sickening other people should enjoy baseball.  Nobody should be allowed to enjoy baseball, because I think it is wrong, for whatever reason.  Baseball is bad, those who play baseball should not have the same rights as those who play baseball and if you play baseball I will not rent  or sell to you, I will not be in the same room as you, and I will most definitely not let you enjoy the same rights I do. I think the government should ban baseball, because, even though other people enjoy it and it doesn' thurt me when they play, I personally hate it.<br />
<br />
2) I think baseball is immoral.  It is very wrong.  However, I respect other people's rights to play baseball. You can rent from my land, you can marry another baseball player, you can do whatever you want. I fully realize just because I do not like baseball it is ok for others to do it.  It's not my job to police other people's morals.  When they die, the Big Umpire will judge them himself and I don't need to. It's his job, let him do it.  <br />
<br />
Kullaas also never said actions don't have consequences, nor did anyone else.  <br />
<br />
Don't even talk about schools distributing condoms being wrong, provided they are known to the students to not be fool proof. In my high school a youth pastor comes up and gives religous and pseudo-scientific reason on why abstienence is the only way to go.  He won't hand out condoms because he says if you have sex you're just asking for an STD or pregnancy.  My school also has a pregnancy rate something like 2x the national average.<br />
<br />
Wow, Firion.  Not often do I agree 100% with what someone says on a message board, but I love your post.  /golf clap<br />
<br />
To Beryllin, on your first point, provide evidence please.  Just because you 'think' someone isn't born homosexual and just because you weren't doesn't mean nobody is.  <br />
<br />
Your only views on why homosexuality is not natural seem to be religious and antecdotal evidence based on conversations you have had with gay men.  While I respect your right to religious evidence and I won't comment, as here is not the appropriate place such discussions, I will say antecdotal evidence can not be trusted.  For example, in every conversation I have had with a gay man they have always been attracted to males, some even finding the naked female body as repulsive as you no doubt find a naked man's body.  However, if those are your only reasons your stance is frail.  A religious reason should never be a reason for a government to do anything. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying to punish religious people, I'm saying the day the government starts basing laws of any religion is the day that religion dies.  Look at England.  They have a national religion and are (governmentally) a very religious nation. However, the population of their country who attends church services is very, VERY low.  Also, whose religion? The majority's?  No, then a majority would be keeping a minority down.  The minority's?  No, then a minority would be oppressing a minority. It's a no win situation.<br />
<br />
Wow, long post...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firion is right. The Real question is what constitutes an acceptable minority?<br />
<br />
Example: I can be a jerk. I know, I know, you're thinking &quot;No way!&quot; but it's true. While we aren't really a minority per se, we have no voice! Wait, that wasn't really related, never mind.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know, there may be legislation to protect evil people. I'm sure some christians feel this way, as they view homosexuality as wrong, and any rights given to protect them are infringing upon their beliefs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin Rainbow</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point is this---<br />
<br />
You can't change the skin color you are born with.<br />
Hence, we protect all ethnic backgrounds against discrimination.<br />
<br />
But if we get into the human psychy, where do we draw the line?<br />
<br />
Sexual orientation is voluntary. You may have some kind of chemical imbalance, sure, but you can decide to have sex with a woman, a man, an animal, a dead person, etc....or not at all.<br />
<br />
Now if we start treating someone special on what kind of sexual preference lifestyle they have, where do we stop?<br />
<br />
What about that guy that murdered other people saying he was born that way? Well, we do see some of this in a slant way, take temporary insanitiy I guess. Workin the system.<br />
<br />
What about the guy who like to have sex with underaged girls and boys? Well you say that is unlawful, but what about when enough say it's okay to lead this lifestyle, like say homosexuality was at one time. Does he get special rights because he likes to do these things? He can claim he was born this way too.<br />
<br />
The list could go on and on.<br />
<br />
I like to think of normal sex as this. In tools you have female and male parts. They fit together. You try to put a male adapter with another male adapter, and it just don't work. I guess you could drill a hole into one adapter and make it fit, but that wouldn't really be the way they were intended. hehe, kinda weird example I guess huh?<br />
<br />
I also like to think that we humans are seperated from the rest of the animals on Earth because we can &quot;think&quot; about what we are doing and make choices. <br />
<br />
Now, anyone out there reading this that IS homosexual, I am not saying I personally condemn your way of life. I strongly disagree with it, as it goes against everything I believe in morally. So you could understand my stance. That doesn't mean I can not treat you as any other human being though. But I hope you can try to understand my stance on &quot;special&quot; rights given to people for anything other than physical handicaps or skin color.<br />
<br />
BTW, I have known several homosexual women and men in the past, so I while I don't live in San Francisco, I am not completely naive about the issue.<br />
<br />
My point, this really isn't about your sexual preference to me, but more about special treatment. I think anytime special treatment is given, it is usually just someone trying to milk the system somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoa whoa Samin, I don't believe anyone said who you sleep with is not a choice. Of course it is, you choose you have sex with, but the argument is that you don't choose who you're attracted to.<br />
<br />
You see homosexual men or women get involved into heterosexual relationships, and have kids, because society tells them that's how it's supposed to be, but now as society evolves and more and more things are learned about homosexuality, more and more people are coming out of the closet, and have stopped living a lie.<br />
<br />
(Run on sentence strikes again, haha!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buntar, it's well known that almost all of the laws of man have its roots in morality, which goes hand in hand with religion.<br />
<br />
It's against the law to murder, because it's morally wrong to do so. (Thou shalt not kill)<br />
<br />
It's against the law to steal, because it's morally wrong to take something that belongs to someone else. (Thou shalt not steal)<br />
<br />
It's against the law to lie in court, because it's morally wrong to falsely accuse someone. (Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor)<br />
<br />
So on and so on.<br />
<br />
I would submit that it's precisely when the laws of a nation stop being based on morality that the real problems set in, not the other way around, as you seem to suggest.<br />
<br />
My take is that there should be no laws on the books that are pro-homosexuality, or anti-homosexuality. What people do in their own homes should be between them, and is not the business of anyone else, including the religious people. But making law regarding what they do drags it out of their bedroom and into the public arena. <br />
<br />
While what people do in private stays private, it's just a matter between them, and God.<br />
<br />
When it's dragged out into the public arena, then it becomes a matter that's between a nation, and God.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, God judges nations as well as individuals. History is on my side on this one, history is littered with the corpses of nations that God has judged, and found wanting. This is not only recorded in the Bible, but in secular documentation as well.<br />
<br />
History records that Babylon invaded Israel before the time of Christ, and it's also recorded in the Bible. Of course, secular history does not record that Isaiah warned Israel that if they did not turn back to God, that God would bring this upon Israel.<br />
<br />
Whether you agree with my stance on homosexuality or not, you can't argue with recorded historical fact.<br />
<br />
Of course, you can argue that Babylon invaded Israel on it's own, without it being caused by God, but to do so means you have to ignore part of recorded history. I wouldn't want to argue any stance if that stance ignored part of the evidence.<br />
<br />
Now, you can say to me: &quot;but your stance on homosexuality ignores studies saying it's genetic&quot; or whatever. Not true. My stance on homosexuality dismisses the cause of homosexuality as irrelevent. So what if it's genetic?<br />
<br />
Let's suppose that science finds a genetic variation that makes a person tempted to steal. Society would expect someone with that genetic variation to resist the urge to steal. I don't think we'd toss out our laws on theft, just because a certain percentile of people are genetically predisposed to steal.<br />
<br />
It's been documented that there is a mental illness that some men have (And I think it's genetic in origin, but I could be wrong) that causes them to get their sexual excitement from violent rape. Violent rape is unacceptable behavior, whether genetic, mental illness, or any other cause you wish to name.<br />
<br />
The difference in theft and forcible rape, and homosexuality, is that homosexuality is (usually) between consenting adults, so there is no victim. Which is why I think there should be no secular laws against it. But there should also be no secular laws that try to make it acceptable to people who find it morally wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bery, most of the laws of man are just common sense, not given by god. Please don't say the moral compass was given by god, please.<br />
<br />
For the most part I agreed with your post, and though you acknowledged it in the end, it still felt kind of weird that you compared homosexuality with theft. Being gay doesn't hurt anybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vader, I wasn't trying to compare homosexuality with theft. I didn't say that scientists have discovered a 'theft' gene, I merely said 'suppose' one was discovered.<br />
<br />
As to whether God gives us our moral compass, I'm undecided on it. On one hand, it would seem so. On the other hand, if God gave us our moral compass, it would be logical to expect all the needles to point in the same direction. Hehehe, if this thread proves anything, it proves that our compass needles point in about every conceivable direction. = ))<br />
<br />
You would think that some of our morals are universal, but even some of the most basic ones are different from one society to the next. For instance, it would seem that cannibalism would be universally abhorrent, yet in some societies it's acceptable.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think morals goes hand in hand with religion because both concepts recognize there's 'something' out there that's loftier than the mammalian beings we are. God, and morals, makes us higher than the animal world around us.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to another thought. I saw in an earlier post that someone said homosexuality is natural, because certain animals have some homosexual practices. I don't think it's a good idea to make such comparisons. Man has morals, animals do not.<br />
<br />
For instance, take a lion pride. It's ruled by one male, and there's several females in the pride, plus whatever cubs. Now, if a larger or younger male comes along and drives away the male of the pride, one of the first things the new male does is kill all the male cubs in the pride, and eats them. It's the 'natural' thing for them to do, yet I doubt anyone on this thread would recommend that as a 'natural' way for a stepfather to behave when married to the mother of a male child.<br />
<br />
Hehehe, just food for thought.<br />

<br />
From a purely historical point of view homosexuality was a perfectly acceptable part of a lot of cultures who have had a massive influence on the way we live our lives today, for example in Greek culture, where we got our influences on Democracy, medicine, philosophy and many other things that our now parts of our culture, homosexuality was a totally acceptable practice.</div></div><hr />

At the height of the Roman empire, they were the dominant civilization around. <br />
<br />
Where are those civilizations now? Trampled into the dust of history.<br />
<br />
Sodom and Gomorrah had a high tolerance of homosexuality, and look where they are now.<br />
<br />
The Greeks were conquered by the Romans. The Romans were conquered by a bunch of barbarians, of Germanic/Celtish origins, if I remember.<br />
<br />
Israel was conquered by Babylon. Within just a few decades, Babylon was conquered and destroyed.<br />
<br />
In all these examples, at the height of their civilization, they were the dominant peoples of their era. In all these cases, they had, or adopted, societal practices that are offensive to the God of the Bible. And all of these civilizations are now pages in a history book somewhere.</div></div><hr />

There were so many underlying reasons that led to the collapse and fall of the roman empire. The government had weakened through all the power shifts, attack from many fronts by barbaric tribes just to name a couple.<br />
<br />
Our society is headed on the same downward spiral, there are so many parallels. But I highly doubt tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality is a cause. Christian hatred, wait, not hatred, dislike is better of homosexuals is also dropping. Tolerance is becoming the majority, and for once in a long while intolerance is the minority.

Just because their civilisations no longer exist that is no reason to completely ignore what they taught, without the Greeks there would be no such thing as Democracy.

<br />
I do not see Christianity fading into history, but I can certainly see it happening to the United States.<br />
<br />
From the earliest days, the U.S. was considered a Christian nation. The Puritans were Christians, who fled to the New world to escape the Church of England. Even one of our most revered documents say that we were endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<br />
<br />
For most of the first 200 years of our national history, we've trusted God, and understood well that God has blessed America.<br />
<br />
Now, in the last few decades, we have drifted further and further from our Christian identity. It used to be that one of the school textbooks was the Bible. Now, you can't post a copy of the Ten Commandments in school.<br />
<br />
It would not be difficult to cite many examples of us turning our backs on God, as a nation. The debate here, and the law being considered in California, are examples. Acceptance of personal behavior that's in conflict with Biblical teachings is another.<br />
<br />
So, while in the past it's been generally recognized that God has blessed the U.S., I can easily see that blessing being withdrawn, just as the blessing of Israel was withdrawn, when they turned their backs on God.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, if it hurts other people who have not done anything to you* then it's bad. Hurting yourself isn't a sin, it's just stupid.<br />
<br />
Please don't bring religion into this.  Sunmoon has said it's not the place, so don't talk about it anymore.  I do want to respond but I won't.<br />
<br />
You keep on arguing that the government is telling people to be pro-homosexuality, yet you have cited no sources when I have asked more than once for non-religious reasons why homosexuality is wrong.  I'm not going to continue this discussion any further unless you do so.  <br />
<br />
Also, the government is only telling foster parents who wish to foster homosexual kids to learn to support homosexuality, just as a white supremist family should not be allowed to foster a minority child.<br />
<br />
Read the bill itself, it's not about making everyone love homosexuality.<br />
<br />
Reading further along on the posts I missed while sleeping last night, I see you want to tout Christianity as America's religion.<br />
<br />
They say Creator. Why do you assume this is the Christian god? Considering Jefferson and Paine were deists, I'd make the logical assumption they do not mean the Christian God at all.   <br />
<br />
Why was 'In God We Trust' only added to our coins in the 50's, under the McArthy scare?  Why was 'under God' only added in the same decade?  Why did Thomas Paine stop his own wedding when the preacher said his bride and himself should live 'by the laws of God' and demand that 'God' be changed to 'Nature'?  Why is there no mention of 'God' or 'Christ' in any of our nation's founding document? <br />
<br />
Compare an actual theocracy's (say, Afghanistan) to our foundin documents.  They mention Allah specifically by name more than 10 times. Ours has no reference to 'Christianity', 'Christ', 'God', 'Satan', NOTHING.<br />
<br />
It's a secular nation, because our forefathers were smart enough to realize if you put in an official religion the only thing to come out of it is bad (i.e Look at Ireland now, and the hundreds of years of fighting between protestant and Catholics in England over the title of official religion).<br />
<br />
If that was too much, I'll edit it, Sunmoon.  I didn't think it would be, since it wasn't debating the religion, just the effect of a religion on our society.<br />
<br />

I agree with Buntar though, if we start bringing religion in, this thing is gonna come apart at the seams. If your reason for disliking homosexuality is religion, then fine, but it may not be a good idea to elaborate.</div></div><hr />

Kullaas, I explained my point of view on a different thread awhile back, and I am loth to re-hash it. So, I'll say it once, and I'll refrain from saying more about it. No offense intended to anyone on this thread.<br />
<br />
I equate homosexuality as a sin against God, in the same way that adultery is a sin against God, or stealing, or murder.<br />
<br />
A man can be tempted to have sex with his neighbor's wife. He can give in, or he can resist. By your contintion the urge to have sex with women a man finds attractive is natural.  Its what he desides to do with it that counts.  Correct?<br />
<br />
A man can be tempted to steal a car. He can give in, or he can resist. <br />
<br />
A man, for whatever reason, can want to kill someone. He can give in, or he can resist.<br />
<br />
<br />
A man can be tempted to have sex with another man. He can give in, or he can resist.I see the comparison here and Im glad you brought it up because.....<br />
<br />
What causes  the temptation is irrelevent, whether the temptation is adultery, theft, murder, or homosexuality.<br />
[i]Yes, WHO you choose to have sex with is a choice of right and wrong, But who and what features you are ATTRACTED to are mostly out of your control and ARE still relevant to this discussion.  If your preffences are pretedetermined than how can that be a choice?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also you said above:<br />

To me, this bill is another symptom of that mentality. <br />
<br />
I had to laugh at this, not to pick on you, because this is kinda the way I have always view many peoples reason for hanging on so strongly to religious bliefs.  As a way of not paying consequences.  A get out of jail free card. <br />
<br />
Many people think they can be &quot;saved&quot; or repent their sins and all is forgiven no matter what.  So its ok to commit the sins/crimes whatever, in the first place.<br />
<br />
This is the same comparison as the condom issue is to you.  To me many religions say  &quot;Because God forgives us of our sins its ok to do X&quot;.<br />

<br />
To wit:<br />
<br />
There are gay/lesbian/transgender children within the foster care system.<br />
<br />
Being gay/lesbian or transgender is NOT against the law, and more to the point, it is ILLEGAL to discriminate against someone because of their sexual orientation.<br />
<br />
Therefore this bill is only attempting to provide those children with the SAME level of support and care that other children are receiving.<br />
<br />
Religion has NOTHING to do with this.<br />
YOUR OWN moral belief system has NOTHING to do with this.<br />
<br />
This only has to do with providing foster children with care that they deserve.</div></div><hr />

And I only said I was done with the discussion on homosexuality if you didn't provide evidence because if you don't we could go rounds over and over with you saying your religion tells you homosexuality is wrong and that's it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buntar, I thought about it quite awhile before I decided to reply.<br />
<br />
My first inclination was to drop it, but you are so glaringly in error that I can't.<br />
<br />
First, your statement 'don't talk about it anymore' is shutting down a dissenting view. Implicit in that statement is that someone will report me, and get me silenced.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you dismiss my beliefs on this matter as invalid, when they are not. Because what I believe is based on my faith, you apparently believe it has no bearing on this, as a secular issue. And yet I say to you, my position is as relevent as yours is, because your position is based on what you believe, every bit as much as mine is.<br />
<br />
You believe religion has no bearing on this issue, but you cannot prove it doesn't. It's just what you believe. You believe it's strictly a secular issue, but you cannot prove it. It's just what you believe.<br />
<br />
You cannot prove that God's law is not supreme, any more than I can prove it is.<br />
<br />
You cannot prove that what the Bible says about God's attitude toward homosexuality is false, any more than I can prove it's true.<br />
<br />
I can't prove God created the world. You cannot prove He didn't.<br />
<br />
I cannot prove that the U.S. has prospered because of God's blessings on us, you cannot prove the opposite.<br />
<br />
I cannot prove God will judge our nation for tolerating behavior he finds abhorrent, you cannot prove He will not judge us.<br />
<br />
My belief that religion has a bearing on this issue is based on my faith, and can't be proven. You stated 'Please don't bring religion into this', thus showing you believe religion has no bearing on this issue, yet you cannot prove that to be true, either.<br />
<br />
And yet, because I can't give proof of my position, I need to not talk about it, when you can't prove your position any more than I can, yet you can talk about it? Excuse me, but that's wrong, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon has shown he has some tolerance for religious views, so long as it's not a case of name-calling, claims of superiority, putting down other people, however you'd care to phrase it. I have done none of those things. I don't flame you, or ridicule you, using my faith. The closest I came was saying you are 'glaringly in error', and I think I've backed that opinion up sufficiently.<br />
<br />
And now, that IS my final word on this issue. Respond, or not, I've posted my last post on this thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your very discussion of religion, specifically christianity, puts off a condescending tone to homosexuals just because they know you disapprove of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A long time ago, when I first started, I think I got into a little argument with you that turned into name calling in RnR. I don't remember it and you say you don't either. If you do or still do, I assume you've let it go.<br />
<br />
But then again, all you do, is respond to my posts with &quot;he's a troll, ignore him&quot; no matter how valid my opinions are. Maybe you will see that this behaivor doesn't help just as much as &quot;trolling&quot;. It does absolutely nothing for me, and nothing for you.<br />
<br />
As I've said many times before, 90% of my posts are just jokes and the occasional (sp?) jab. I'm not quite sure you see this, but maybe you will. If you see me &quot;trolling&quot;, call me on it, I &quot;may&quot; understand it, don't classify ALL my behaivor as such.<br />

I love dissent. It's what nations are made of.  It's how America was formed.  I just didn't want get into a religious argument here, and I still don't, as I'm just trying to abide my Sunmoon's rules. If you want to converse elsewhere on such a matter, I can point you to the approriate forum in a PM.<br />
<br />
Pretty much my refutation of your point is this:<br />
<br />
You can't prove there aren't pink monkeys on Mars who hang out with Oompa Loompas and ride the Wonkavator all daylong, so it must be true! I can talk about the pink monkeys all day long, and I can even use it in a debate on facts and logic over and over.  I'll even try to vote against brown monkeys, because surely the pink monkeys are superior and brown is not natural!  I can not back this up with hard facts, but I am positive the pink monkeys would not approve. Then, when I realize I have no real proof, I'll accuse the other side of censoring me because I disagree and hide under the guise of my religious beliefs being oppressed!<br />
<br />
You can't prove your best friend isn't really an alien sent to spy on you from another planet, so it must be true!<br />
<br />
You can't prove reality is not just an illusion, so it, too, must be true!<br />
<br />
The list could go on.  The burden of proof lies on YOU, the asserter, not on the asertee to prove such a thing wrong.<br />
<br />
I never berated you, nor you me (as far as I can recall), so don't take this the wrong way.  <br />
<br />
I don't care if you want to believe in Pink Monkeys, I'm all for it. The only times I care are few and far between, two of them being when you vote against homosexuality or a non-victim situation, when you try to force those beliefs on someone else (not saying you have), and when you try to use the concept of faith in the Pink Monkeys to prove something to someone who obviously has no faith in Pink Monkeys.<br />
<br />
The difference in my position and your position is that mine is not a matter of faith. I take very little on faith.  The sun coming up in the morning, the fact that I will die someday and the fact that I will never, ever find that damned Waldo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buntar, that was pretty good. Now, if you'll just tell me the name of the 2,000+ year old book that sets out the tenets of the Pink Monkey belief, plus all the secular historical documents that provide a measure of verification. I'd like to read them, so I can make an intelligent, informed decision as to the validity of of the merits of worshiping Pink Monkeys on Mars.<br />
<br />
My point should be obvious. While I cannot actually prove anything, there is a large body of evidence to support my beliefs. I didn't pull my beliefs out of the air, as you pulled your example.<br />
<br />
if you don't believe me, read some of the writings of Josephus, who was a secular writer in Judea during the time of Christ. Much of what he wrote confirms, as much as any secular source can, that the Biblical accounts of those events during that time are accurate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kullaas, I'd like to answer your question this way. If the Bible was written by men, without God directing them, then certainly what you suggest is possible. Some homophobic priest could have dug out the whiteout, hehehe. However, if the Bible was written by men, without God directing the writing, then it would be useless as a guide to gaining knowledge of God.<br />
<br />
If God directed the writing, as a means of teaching us knowledge of God, then I would say that God himself would prevent the priest from getting out the whiteout. <br />
<br />
Since the Bible is to teach us knowledge of God, leading us toward eternal life, let me make a secular analogy:<br />
<br />
Let's suppose you own a company that makes fire extinguishers. Now, along with every one sold, there is supplied a users manual. Suppose when the printers sent the manual back to you, you discovered a mistake in the instructions that will cause the extinguisher to explode, if followed. Now, would you allow that manual to go out? Certainly not!! <br />
<br />
Now, if you equate you with God, and the users manual with the Bible, you can see how there would be no mistake in it. I would suspect God is able to do a better job of proofreading his instruction manual, than any of us humans would be. = ))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But by your logic, since God can prevent the priest, than wouldn't God just go smite all the homosexuals.

<br />
I can only explain it this way, with apologies to Sunmoon and anyone else who might be offended.<br />
<br />
Two of the most widely revealed parts of the nature of God is his love for us, and his love of justice.<br />
<br />
Now, God does not differentiate between a homosexual, or a thief, or an adulterer, or any person who commits any other sin.<br />
<br />
If God was to smite all the homosexuals, as you say he can, then he would have to smite all the adulterers, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
In short, since we ALL have sinned, and fallen short of His standard, he would have to smite all of us, each and every one.<br />
<br />
The actual explanation is far more complex than that, and I just know Sunmoon is gonna smite me if I get any more detailed on this board.<br />
<br />
But, that should explain something else to you, as well. Vader said something akin to my posts are condescending to homosexuals. I certainly don't intend that, since I'm as guilty before God as any homosexual. There is NO possible way I can live my life fully to God's standard. It's not possible for any of us.</div></div><hr />

But God is opposed to any unrepentant sinner, and it matters not what the details of the sin is. <br />
<br />
Dunno, but I think that perception is there because it's so visible.<br />
You don't see adulterers out in the public arena, demanding that we accept their choice as natural, at least not in the way homosexuals are in this day and age.<br />
<br />
Therefor, when Christians speak out against it, it's more visible.<br />
<br />
Now, before you jump on that, I'm NOT trying to get homosexuals back in the closet. I'm simply speculating on why the perception is that Christians make a 'special' sin of homosexuality. Mind you, it's only a perception. Christians know that all sin is a stench to God. That is at the core of our beliefs.</div></div><hr />

Josephus's work have been discredited by many more than this. For one thing, unless Josephus outlived the average life expectancy by 2-3x and then also recorded his sightings of Jesus when he was a small, small child, he didn't even live when Jesus did.  <br />

I do agree on the peanuts thing, and I do applaud you not getting angry over this.  I was once a Bible believing Christian, and every member of my family and my real life friends are (except 2), so don't think I'm actually berating your faith in any way.  Who knows, if we were on the same server we may have been good friends.:) <br />

Is this the Glade's first flame free thread got onto the subject of religion? ;)</div></div><hr />

Beryllin, Christians make a &quot;special&quot; sin out of homosexuality because (while I'm not sure exactly where,) there are passages in the Bible that declare in no uncertain terms that &quot;sins of the flesh&quot; are the most damaging and therefore the &quot;worst&quot; of all possible sins.<br />

Sunmoon, please feel free to edit out the following or delete this post if you feel its out of line.<br />

The best way I've ever seen the whole issue of sin/forgiveness as pertains to Christianity explained is as follows. I'm posting this as information because I think many people attack Christianity simply because they don't understand, not as an attempt to prostyltize. To put it bluntly, most &quot;Christians&quot; have it as wrong as most non-Christians.<br />
<br />
1) We are all sinners.<br />
2) We have all sinned.<br />
3) We will all sin again.<br />
4) Jesus paid the price for our sins, past and future, and asked only that we acknowledge him, love him, and thank him in return.<br />
5) &quot;Salvation&quot; within Christianity comes not by saying &quot;I believe in Jesus, so I can do whatever I want and still be saved.&quot;<br />
6) &quot;Salvation&quot; within Christianity comes not by saying &quot;I believe in Jesus. Jesus says not to do these things, so I'm going to try not to do them.&quot;<br />
7) &quot;Salvation&quot; within Christianity comes with understanding who Jesus was and more importantly, WHY he did what he did for us. Once that realization, or belief if you want to use that term, sets in, the true believer can't help but try very hard not to sin.<br />
<br />
In short, it's about intent and desire. With understanding comes a desire to avoid the things that Christianity calls sins. They're called sins not because they are evil, but because they are harmful, be that to the individual, another individual, or the community as a whole. Jesus wants for us to not do those things because every time we cause harm to ourselves or others, he greaves just as you greave when your own child falls off his bike and skins his elbow. Multiply that by 6 billion.<br />
<br />
The problem lies in those areas, like homosexuality, where the harm caused is not readily apparent. It is my own personal belief that the &quot;harm&quot; in those actions termed &quot;sins&quot; is not physical harm, but rather spiritual harm (or psychological harm if you don't believe in the spirit). I've never claimed to know the mind of God, but I will tell you this: He's been right about so many other &quot;sinful&quot; things that are harmful that I'm not willing to take the chance of doing harm, be it to myself or to others, simply because I don't understand what form that harm may take. That is every person's right, freedom, and responsibility to decide for themselves. I smoke, knowing that I am causing harm to myself. That choice is my right. If it makes God sad or angry with me, then I will have to face that when I die. Christianity further calls on its members simply to spread the message and make people aware that even if they're not readily apparent, there are negative consequences to certain actions and activities. Beyond that, it is each individual's choice what action or inaction to take. It's too bad that many (in all likelihood most) Christians have that wrong, too, and try to force religion on others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryllin</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tevyn, you stated it FAR more eloquently than I could have, although I was avoiding saying that much. I am newish to this forum, and didn't wish to risk Sunmoon's ire any more than necessary.<br />
<br />
Try Galatians 5: 19-21, Tevyn, for one reference.<br />
<br />
Also 1 Corinthians 6: 9-10, for &quot;sins of the flesh&quot;. You'll see that not just homosexuality is mentioned, but a large number of things. My point being that God doesn't differenciate between homosexuality and, say, adultery; both are equally as bad in God's eyes.<br />
<br />
That said, Tevyn, I truly wish I could have stated it as well as you did.<br />
<br />
Buntar, I freely admit I know little about Josephus. I am aware that there are 2 schools of thought about what he wrote. My point was that there is at least a little, if controversial, secular evidence that supports the Bible as fact. It proves nothing, but it provides evidence. My beliefs are rooted in what the Bible teaches about God, plus the personal experiences I've had in my life that proves beyond any doubt (to me) that the God of the Bible exists as stated. There is no such 'bible' or supporting secular evidence for Pink Monkeys on Mars. ; )<br />
<br />
I hope this proves that we can disagree without being disagreeable, and I have not become angry. I'd rather be civil, because only in civil discourse can understanding grow. <br />
<br />
If I may be permitted, I'd like to end with a quote from Paul of Tarsus:<br />
<br />
&quot;For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ, )that I might gain them that are without law.<br />
<br />
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.&quot;<br />
<br />
This explains FAR better than I could why I try to discuss, without becoming angry, and why I try to not make folks angry with me. You are far more likely to listen to my arguments if they are presented with civility, even if you vehemently disagree with me. On the other hand, if I'm shouting, name-calling, or such, not only will you disagree with me, but you won't listen, either.<br />
<br />
I hope I'm clear with my meaning here. = ))</div></div><hr />
