Just had to vent. I decide to start a shaman and my computer has a terminal illness. Having to wait more then a week to play him. On a side not, what is the cheapest/best way to get a second account? <br />
<br />
Well, if you want I have a completely empty account that has no characters on it that I don't use at all. It has all of the expansions including Luclin.<br />
<br />
I only want $50 for it, I will give you all CD Keys and whatever else you want for you to be able to claim ownership. I didn't use a CC to pay for the account, I used a Pay Card. <br />
<br />
I had intended to split off a few characters from my main account but changed my mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
At risk of getting ragged for selling an account... if you want it let me know.</div></div><hr />
