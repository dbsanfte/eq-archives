<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just created a new Shaman a few days ago and was hoping someone could offer some equipment advice:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146476<br />
<br />
I have about 10kpp to spend and I can also farm stuff with my Druid.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That has to be the most druid looking shaman I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Sell all that crap except the spear...<br />
<br />
Buy Jaundiced bone arms/hands/boots/helm<br />
A clay guardian shield<br />
Iksar regen BP, or some other BP with more than 13AC<br />
Get the tribunal earrings that have 3ac 4wis(or something like that)<br />
Get a Arctic Wyvern mask..<br />
and two 65hp/6ac rings</div></div><hr />

Funny stuff..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I see your AC is 104 -- given the 100 AC softcap you're wasting 4 points.<br />

P.S. What Eoin said ... exactly ... lmao!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Holy TreeHugger Batman ! <br />
<br />
Is that a druid I see on my scopes ? <br />
What is your AC in all that stuff 100-200 ? Druid gear on a Shaman equals = DEAD SHAMMY ! <br />
<br />
First off ditch the Paw and the Testament (Yikes!)......and the BS Tunic. Replace Tunic with Ikky BP (if you can swing it), or some JB Armor. <br />
Get a good poker..Spine Chill Spear, Slimey Harpoon, Jade Prod, you may not have enough for Rune Etched Icewurm Fang (best poker till epic) Or use Howling Harpoon as main weapon and get Slimey or Medicine Totem for Range slot.<br />
200 Wisdom at 25 is doing you no good, mana regeneration is much more important to a Shaman than a extremely large mana pool. We can regen our own mana with Cannibalize. Swap out some of that Wisdom gear for AC/HP gear. You should go more for AC/HP's than Wisdom. <br />
Replace Testament with Charred Guardian Shield, Sarnak Battle Shield, or Clay Guardian Shield. Good Wis on Charred plus AC, killer AC on Clay, killer AC and resists on Sarnak Battle Shield.<br />
Get some Platium Veluim Rings 6AC 65Hp ones.<br />
Forest Loops would be even better for you than the earrings you have...Forest give +3 wis and AC.<br />
From the looks of it you're a Barb so go with JB armor where you can (minus the bracer) can't use that till 45.<br />
<br />
Either way ditch some of that Wis gear for AC/HP gear. Wear it when you need a larger mana pool..like when you're grouping.<br />
<br />
But we're not druids, let's leave the tree hugging to them. <br />
That's my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not bad.<br />
<br />
But Ill use Molten Cloak and Ulthork hide tunic :)<br />
<br />
edit: Black iron medallion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">PLEASE, make this sticky!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">AvalachW, thanks for the suggestions. I got a Molten Cloak (some sucker traded it outright for my Lizardscale Mantle, but no loss there for me as I had the 3rd Coldain Shawl in the bank) and a Black Iron Medallion for my Shaman. The extra Int from those two pieces should help with working on tradeskills for the Coldain Shawls.<br />
<br />
However, I don't understand your recommendation of an Ulthork Hide Tunic, as it has 1 less Wisdom than my Bloodstained Tunic. I mean, I see that the Ulthork has some +Mana, but I need the Wisdom to cut down on my fizzles when nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Also, don't forget that, like the bonus necros and SKs get for Fear with low CHA, shaman roots and DoTs last longer the lower your AC is.<br />

Bleh House, you got me.<br />
I need to come around more often...<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">90ac?! How is that possible? <br />
<br />
Get some 65hp rings, 35hp 25mana earrings, a stick, a shield and a bunch of black alloy armor and go from there. Sell all of the rest of your stuff except the spear, paw and testament. Bank that and your 10K. By the time you hit 35 or so you should have another 10K saved up. At that point either buy a fungi tunic or buy an iksar regen BP and some other high end gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">/ooc<br />
 In case you guys havent realize.<br />
This thread is a blalant joke.  House is a regular in this board.</div></div><hr />

Heck, I'm impressed he has an attack of 10 with a Paw of Oppolla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think 10 ATK is for the sheer gross-out factor of having a guy chase you around waving a severed hand. Not much, but it's very effective against those little girl mobs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gotesblud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">One of funniest parts of all this is that about two years ago, House's &quot;shaman&quot; would've been considered ub3r|_33t.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think that was my exact gear on my cleric at about level 30 (many moons ago),  with that equipment you get a multicolored Dark Elf that looks a bit like a clown.<br />
<br />
it was great, I actually liked that look</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Most of the gear is pretty funny, but there's nothing wrong with a paw of opalla! (carried in main, not secondary).  <br />
<br />
I have an SS of myself the day I got my epic...I'm wearing a runed mith bracer! ha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Made one of these for my shaman when I saw this post. Pretty cool. It doesnt seem to allow you to show things like tink bags or rallic packs in the inventory, though. Also the velium diamond wedding ring shows up as the non-magical version instead of the +8 to all saves one. :confused:<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, here's the link if anybody was curious.<br />

Of course, those stats dont factor in buffs. My self-buffed hps, AC, ATK, and stats are higher. And, yeah, I dont have Malo either. :( And I didnt overlook the AA stuff, I just havent worked on it because I'm trying to get to 60th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Actually what surprised me, Rathelon, is that there's a shaman actually using Rune Etched Helmet!  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Squishy is a FAR better name for that than crunchy /nod<br />
<br />
And aye, for the groupy shammy, the paw is a fantastic primary slot piece tyvm =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yep, Avalanche, I wear the helm (unless I'm wearing resist gear set). It took me about 9 months to get my full set of RE back when I raided Hate, so I'm gonna wear it. :) <br />
<br />
I went from banded in my teens, to full totemic in my mid 30's, to full RE at 50 (actually, dont think I finished it until Kunark, so I was probably 51 or 52). Next step is finishing getting ally with them dragons so I can get full Wolf Caller's. :D<br />
<br />
You know what is kinda sad, though? I've had 50+ shamans ask me what armor I was wearing and where it comes from. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Heee.   What sad is that Im wearing Jarcrap leggings instead of my Rune etched.  <br />
<br />
Talk about risk.vs.reward<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I had some of those jarsath legs. They arent bad...dont remember the exact stats, but I remember they were comparable to RE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Got a new hat, Avalanche. :D<br />
<br />
Edit: Doh! It didnt post my new signature. Got the Wolf Caller's helm now to replace the old grey hat.</div></div><hr />
