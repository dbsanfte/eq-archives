<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I am curious.<br />
I don't have the tear yet, hell, I don't have anything yet.<br />
I am 55 and I'd like my epic.<br />
Does anyone who has done this recently know how many times one needs to do the drunken shaman part in Freeport before the faction is sufficient?  Has anybody done this from scratch recently?<br />
<br />
With all this crap about the faction window, I should probably just do the quest normally, but my guild lacks the forces to do any of the battle parts and 5 shaman ahead of me in the epic rotation.<br />
<br />
So, I can either try it the quick way, and enjoy shammie life, or wait a year for a chance to do the harder parts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just did everything once and in order from the guide and had no problems - even a time of two when people told me my con was too low (think they were trying to steal my adventure the buggers).  It is well worth doing - the boots, you get along the way, are nice, as is the epic itself - wonderful stats and nice dot that you can use on almost everyfight you get in - do NOT hesitate!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The drunken guy part is a very small faction hit.<br />
<br />
Hits don't increase everytime you run the quest.<br />
<br />
Did the drunk part, indifferent at start. Indifferent when done. Indifferent is only a 100 pnt spread.<br />
Did the Edurdin Xing part ( Next step ). Start - Indifferent, end - Indifferent.<br />
I didn't get Amiable until I completed the next step.<br />
<br />
Fyi - Indifferent to Amiable is 100. Indifferent to ally is 1100. Max ally is around 2000, I think. As you see, reruning the Drunk over and over again woun't be a good idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your guild has 5 Shaman above you (your 55), yet you lack the forces to do any of the battle parts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kinda have a few large race lovers in the guild.<br />
We could probably get the forces, but I'm not exactly an epic prioirity, being both a shaman and the 6th in line was more my point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The harder parts of the shaman epic (Hole and CoM final encounters) can be done for multiple shaman depending how long you and yours are willing to stick around.<br />
<br />
Once you kill Kirn the first time, you and only a handful of others can easily hold the other room while you wait the 2 hours for another Kirn (hell at 55, I bet you can even do it solo).  Others can log to alts or camp out for a couple hours, or if you have a Mage with CotH it's even easier.<br />
<br />
We always stick around for a second shaman each time we do the Hole for whoever.  The time flies by with a good group of people.  Getting to the tower is the hardest part of the Hole...might as well stick around for the easy stuff if you can.<br />
<br />
Same goes for CoM pretty much.  By the time you finish killing Rak after Neh, you can nearly head right back up and keep doing that rotation over and over again.  It's not too hard to convince people to do this since someone always needs to keep at it for a Jade Reaver.<br />
<br />
Our epic is quite easy, and although it doesn't repeat quite as nicely as some other epics, with just some minor patience you can go through a whole swath of shamans for the tougher sections in one day on the weekend.<br />
<br />
<br />
*If* you're still wanting to try the faction method, most people do the Envy/Woe/Shield section over and over whenever they can until well ally.  Make sure you at least get yourself the Black Wolf Boots though.  One of my favorite pieces of equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think I could be in a guild that didn't recognize the importance of each individual's epic quest.  My guild has long had a goal of 100% epic completion...due to attrition and recruiting, the goal keeps constantly moving, but we never stop trying.  Currently, we are at 89%.<br />
<br />
The shaman epic can easily be done in conjunction with other epic goals.<br />
<br />
The hole - Kirn for shaman, Kindle for enchanters, Jaell (sp?) for rangers, ratman guard for SK, paladins need something too, but not sure<br />
<br />
CoM - Neh for shaman, Jaxiom for enchanters, Neh for mages, reavers for druids/rangers<br />
<br />
Fear - Tear for shaman, gloves for necro, oil for wizards, sword for SKs, something for pallies<br />
<br />
Maximize and consolidate effort to accomplish more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is also a portion of SK epic in CoM.   big guy in a building, I figure probably just a turn in, but nonetheless, it is there ;)  (on that note, also a turn in spot for enchies on the way down the Hole.   Plus SKs need a key from the Mimics.   In fear, warriors need a Ball of Golem Clay or somesuch off the Golems we kill for the tear.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The SK mob in CoM is Lhranc, I think he's the final encounter. Last night while I was happily smacking snakes around in the Grey, a friend was telling me how his guild were having their backsides handed to them by Lhranc. And they're not a soft guild either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most SKs say that Lhranc is the toughest epic MOB in the game.  I went on a Lhranc raid last week, and I could only stick around for the first half dozen failed attempts.  A couple of times only the MT died because they were killed so fast no one had a chance to even Heal them.  They finally brought him down after summoning some reinforcements.  Early in the raid a guide walked up to Lhranc and spoke in the /say channel, it aggroed Lhranc, and he insta killed a level 55 guide with a double harmtouch.<br />
<br />
If Lhranc is not the toughest epic MOB it is a near run thing with Nortlav the scalekeeper in the Hole.  In Yael's room near the Tower.  Nortlav is for the warrior epic, and he does a nifty little thing where his first attack on a target is a 1500 pt lifetap.  So Ping Pong litterally kills.  If the MT loses agro someon else is most likely wasted..and then the MT takes an extra 1500 point shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Say someone has...well....done Woe/Envy/Marr like, more than twice? Am I SoL, or can I just keep doing it until I eventualy hit max ally, or am able to turn in my Ghisok books. I did everything normal up to the boot turn ins. I got aggroed in EJ and forgot to say the last line which makes him gimme the container for CoM. SO, I did el twiddledee and twiddledum in RM a few times, and turned in a set of Ghisok books. The Spirit gave me the message of not aiding nor abetting me and this was prior to the patch where the NPCs give back items the don't need/want. I recently acquired another set of books, and am wondering if I should just shoot for max ally with smaller steps, or farm RM and hopefully come in the right range for each piece. My guild isn't hardcore, we play just to have fun, and raid sometimes once in a while. I dunno if we have the force, we lack clerics, nukers, and such, although we are flooded with druids :rolleyes:. Anyone else having this..dilemma?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The hardest part of the quest is getting your tear.<br />
If you try to cheat it with the faction exploit, you still need a tear.<br />
If you want to do it the right way, you still need a tear.<br />
If your guild is not strong enough to break fear and kill the golems, you cannot get a tear.<br />
<br />
See what I am getting at?  Trying to cheat the quest won't help you because you will still be hung up on the tear.  You can do the hole raid and kill rak in com, I promise you.  If the group of random schmucks that I recruited (very nice random schmucks, though :D) can do it, you can do it.  Just do the quest the way you are supposed to, and wait for the tear.  Your time will come.  See if any other guilds are raiding fear and ask to tag along.  That's how I got my tear.  I went with a guild on my server and got a tear from the first broodling to pop.  I don't know what happened to the second broodling, because we left her standing there since I was the only shaman on the raid.  The second time I went to fear, I had completed my epic and got a second tear which is waiting in my bank for some lucky shaman (are you on solro, by chance?).  The tear from the second broodling of that raid rotted.  Ask to come along on raids with other guilds, and you'll get your tear.  Your guild can do the rest I promise you.</div></div><hr />
