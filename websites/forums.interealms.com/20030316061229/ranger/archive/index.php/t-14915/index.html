You'll need to pull, to get singles, but with a good DS, and whatnot, the XP will fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deviator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the hole entrance starts to light blue out at 52, i pled there with my ranger and 60 shaman, you could go deeper since you have the druid to evac, the mobs get harder the further in you go. you might try neriak commons guards, druid have nicer complete heal then shaman and im getting 1 aa every 3 hours or so there with my combo(not grouping, just pling). the cash is failry decent as well, tho not soloable for ranger. i dont use slow with my shaman since they resist alot, but if you have nice ranger gear plus the heals you should be ok. be sure to line of sight agro, dont just run into a room and pull everything else you get in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ZzeldaAkuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried hole ent and the exp wasnt to thrilling.. i went deeper by castle ent but i kept getting adds and adds if i didnt have c3 on my druid i would have died lol.. it was to scary for me so then i went to jaggedpine and plvled my ranger off the gnolls there... my friend grouped with me the 52 ranger and he said exp was okay but not the best.. so we did CS and he left early so i was just plvling my ranger off of wyverns and othmirs peretty decent exp.. got her to ding 49 and 50 and 2yellows from 51 now..<br />
<br />
about her gear.. its not the best of the best but i think her total ac unbuffed with nothing is 901ac and hp is around 1843.. with potg i forget what it all is lol.. i'm using a shilieag spear thing 9/19 poisondamage:2 in primary and LSoEE in secondary and using a cloak of flames as haste item.. i would love to try to the neriak guards but was curious what lvl your ranger went? i have permenant C3 since i made my ranger on my brothers account and he has a 64enchanter on there so just my druid can get c3.. thanks for your help guys<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Neriak guards are great XP up through 54. The dual wielding ones suck, but with the healer it shouldn't be so bad. At 50 the ranger may require quite a bit of additional healing.<br />
<br />
The Hole does suck. AE group or something, wonderful. Solo or duo, hell no. It's wonderful till you get adds you didn't know were there, and die somewhere in the castle, making for a wonderful halfling brell CR.<br />
<br />
Although it might be a little tough, if you have a swarmcaller you could do Velks. Most the time it's pretty empty, especially if you play at odd hours. The XP rocks solo up through 56, although you could stay longer (I started to go nuts).<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, just make sure the ranger is ungrouped. Playing the druid, just make a hotkey to target her again if you need to deal with adds or whatever. It will make the XP go much much MUCH faster.</div></div><hr />
