<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where are some prime spots to PL a rogue (44)?  Grouping in GD was not that bad since the faction hits were nice, but I really want to find some spots where we can ungroup and fight.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that maybe GD would work because it is easy, but the giants are only dark blue and I would like (if possible) to hit some yellow con mobs.<br />
<br />
HHK is probably the frontrunner atm.  I know we can do that with ease, but where else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">City of Mist - Easy mobs, easy pulls, huge exp bonus, and usually empty.  I PLed my beastlord here from low 40's to low 50's.<br />
<br />
Also:  Your prime target for powerleveling should be high blues.  You might get more exp per kill for a higher con mob, but the extra time it takes you to kill it makes it not worth your time.  A lot of people think that soloing reds is the best exp, but it isn't.  It takes you forever to kill them.  Reds are only good if you're very low level with a high level DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Jin...also Dawnshroud isn't too bad, I actually liked grouping with a ranger and we would fearkite hoppers...always get nice backstabs that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aslo strongly agree on CoM, been a long time, but I think I took my rogue from high 30s to almost mid 50s there.  Xp are good and almost nothing runs (maybe even nothing), and you can bind the rogue there.  Started at the front when I first got there, moved to the temple, then worked my way back to the castle, with the rogue you can easily pull out of the castle as well without agroing the reavers.  Cant speak for newer zones, may be something better out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll add to the City of Mist list.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have the cash, buy damage shield potions and tank the mobs rooted (and unslowed) while your rogue backstabs.  The stuff dies ultra fast that way.<br />
<br />
Acrylia is nice too when you can get it, the skeletons near the high priest event have low hps and hit like wimps.</div></div><hr />
