<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get your WIS over 200, then just worry about HPs / Mana Items...  while AC does matter (mostly for tanks) hps/mana own for shaman <br />
<br />
Long story short, dont worry about AC if u have it great if not fine, focus on wisdom over 200, hps, then mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scardrak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The delimma shouldn't be &quot;wis vs. ac&quot;...the general consensus here is, HP HP HP.  Wis is probably secondary, but you have to do what is best for your playing style.  I personally don't think ac is a big deal.  Sure ac may help, but I think HP's are more important.  You gotta have HP's to canni...and canni sorta negates the need for high wis.  <br />
<br />
My advice would be to find a suitable level of wisdom that makes you feel comfortable with your mana, then work on HP's...ac will sort of come on it's own.  As you level up and your mana pool becomes larger, you'll probably find yourself dumping wis gear for HP gear.  This is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Don't listen to a druid, they'll get you killed. Try to mix and match, get a good balance of AC/HP/WIS. <br />
I would ditch anything that didn't have AC on it. Druids are a whole different beast and play alot differently than a Shaman. It's a good idea for them to go all out with wisdom, because they're useless without it. Since we can regen our own mana, having alot of HP's and AC might be a better road to travel down. I'd say whip out the +wis gear when grouping, replace some of it with AC/HP gear when you solo. <br />
Having a comfortable balance is what I aim for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was about 230 Wisdom a few weeks ago and then went on an upgrade spurge. I lowered my Wisdom and it's now sitting under 200 but my AC skyrocketed and I gained about 400hp. Though a lot of the items I got came with + to mana (Which seems to go a lot hand in hand with bonuses to HP) and my mana pool is only a tad smaller than it was with 230 wisdom.<br />
<br />
However the extra HP plus the fact that I'm not taking as much damage when a mob attacks me gives me a lot more HP to play with. I honestly can't remember the last time I was oom.<br />

HP - AC &gt; Wisdom<br />

Druids shoot for 255 wisdom, Shamans shoot for AC and HP that will make most Rangers cry. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's a couple of slots there that I'd switch out for hp/ac items if I had the cash. Paw for a sarnak battle shield, rings for 6/65 version, probably the tunic if you can find something decent in your price range. ... or save up for an ikky BP,  probably the best 5k you could spend. Also take a look at some of the chardok earrings like twisted leaves. They tend to be pretty cheap and have a nice mix of ac, hitpoints and mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ditch the rings, get Velium Fire Opal Rings (6 AC 65 HP)<br />
Ditch the earrings, get Electrum Black Sapphire (2 AC 25 Mana 35 HP)<br />
<br />
Actually... just look at this:<br />

Not sure how much money you have but it shouldn't cost much to get the rings and earrings.  Shoulders aren't that expensive.  Get your Black Fur Boots, and start on the Planar Traveler's Manual.  The first ones you can do by just buying the drink or meal needed.  Eventually you can work your way up and get better items as you go.  Final ones (ones not needing Elemental Access) aren't bad at all:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your lvling up as a char with no funding it can be hard.  But you can do to lose some wis.  the rings are what really jump out at me.  get a lot more out of 6/65 rings.  other than that remeber to have fun.  youll know you need to change your gear when your getting you rbutt kicked. or feeling useless cause you arent able to be your full potetional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your defensive skill is only 147. You should work hard to get it to 200 ASAP. This will give you a nice boost for your AC without any changes on your equipment.<br />
<br />
I would prefer a shadel bandit ring over a 6/65 ring if you can afford it. Sure 10HP less but you get 55mana, some DR and a focus effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You haven't done too badly, you are selling yourself a little bit on the hp but you have some decent pieces already.<br />
<br />
Like they said, lose the earrings for elec bs, 6ac/65hp rings(no shadel, save yourself some cash...you'd end up needing to replace them later too), sarnak shield instead of paw. Get rid of the chipped bone bracer, get a sentry bracer. Switch out your boots for tribal war(actually gain some wis on that one), ABSOLUTELY get rid of the acrylia stuff. Iksar bp would be good for you since you're an inferior race, and the dragonwing cloaks are a good replacement. Get rid of those shoulders and grab an elder wolf hide. I also prefer the shissar scale gaunts over leaf, 10 more hp and 40 mana tacked on(no level restriction either).<br />
<br />
Overall, it shouldn't cost you too terribly much more than what you could sell the stuff you're replacing for to beef yourself up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">don't get rid of the paw, if you solo use a weap, if you group hold the dolly mainhand.<br />
<br />
another option for earings are the imbued whatever thingies. 3ac 4wis each.<br />
<br />
I think at this point hp isn't all that nessisary since canni isn't going to kill you with low hp, yet.<br />
<br />
do pay attention to ac, wis and third hp.<br />
<br />
just through trying to raise my ac and keep my wis up around 180 my hp went up about 300hp.<br />
<br />
the rings make almost half of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Let me throw my opinion in with most everyone else here.  Shaman and Druids play very differently, they don't have to be equipped the same.  Your slow spell draws a lot of agro, you *will* have to tank a mob for a few rounds, might as well be prepared for it.<br />
<br />
Get your defense to 200, go solo, slow a mob and tank it while your pet beats on it from behind.  The exp will be slower that way but as you get into your 50s and 60s you'll appreciate the extra AC (which is free).  Get used to seeing how much damage you can take and how long before you have to root &amp; back off.   This will get you used to tanking a mob for a round or two until your MT gets agro off of you.<br />
<br />
Once you get into your high 50s and 60s your gear will have all the stats and your wis will naturally increase, worry about keeping yourself alive and that means AC &amp; HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm in your shoes, this is my first character and my highest, with no help from higher level friends. So, I'd say my stuff is quite doable (only thing I was given was the arms, which I got during a Kael Arena raid recently). I'll be honest though I spent a lot of boring nights plat farming, still do (by the way at your level, while you still get decent xp from the HG's in Rathe, I'd hunt there awhile, if they are not too rediculously camped on your server). You just have to know what you want, be patient, and check the bazaar every time you login, to get the best prices. I have been told I needed some more wis, which I agree with for the most part, but I solo alot, and grab a kei if it's available, so I rarely have a mana problem, but it's better than a hp problem, as you can't cast when dead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, the #1 question you should ask yourself is....<br />
<br />
&quot;How often do I run out of mana?&quot;<br />
<br />
The #2 question you should ask yourself is...<br />
<br />
&quot;How often do I run out of hit points?&quot;<br />
<br />
These are what you should base your gear choices on...<br />
<br />
If you run OOM all the time, you probably want a bit more wis... where as if you're dying with 75% mana every single time, you want more HP/AC gear.<br />
<br />
More HP = Less deaths = more Canni = more mana.<br />
<br />
More wis = More mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Look at the profile....  I'm a level 65 Elder Shaman, ready to do my first VT raid, and fairly formidible on my server.  My WIS is 4 points higher than yours is.  My HP's are more than 3 times what yours are.  Go for HP's, intelligently replacing your WIS items until you get down to 180 or so.  Then you'll slowly start getting items that have a bit of mana and WIS on it, as well as HP's.<br />
<br />
Oh, my manapool is more than adequite to cast the single highest-mana Shammy spell out there (MGB Fo7)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Curare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wow - thanks for the all of your time and advice. I will now start buying HP's items. I like the black sapphire earrings and velium fire ring idea's. I know I need a new breastplate and I'm saving up for an Iksar BP. I will also try to get my Black fur boots now. Thanks a whole lot guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Curare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A quick note about mana. I do seem to run out of mana when I'm grouped in DL with a real good puller even if I have clarity and the only spell I use is Togor's Insects - I still have to canni - with KEI I'm fine but I don't like using KEI unless I'm solo'ing giants - well now I'm off to the bazaar for new earrings and rings and start pricing Iksar BP's - then it's off to Rathe Mountains hehe.<br />
<br />
BTW haw many people keep different items on them and depending on your group use different items? I have different items for different situations is this going to far? I can't believe that only one set of armor is good for everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Until  you are really well equipped I think most swap out gear especially for resists when needed.  One you get REALLY good stuff, like elemental planes or VT then you dont do as much swapping.</div></div><hr />
