<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Who else thinks that this is a sad excuse to truely escape from your life because you feel your life sucks. I mean honestly EQ and other similar MMORPG's are at least fantasy and some people use it to escape from their lives because it sucks, but honestly who would play the life of another joe shmo going to work, paying bills, cooking, cleaning, and going out, flirting, making out, etc, etc. I mean how dirty do they think this game is going to get. It's eventually gonna turn into one giant cyber session. I've played the SIMs before when it first came out, don't get me wrong. But it got old after oh, a week playing it. WHY would I want to do the same old crap that I do every day that I want to relax FROM in a game?!?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dunno, when about 75% of the player audience for that game series is teen and younger, yeah I have a problem with one big cyber session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually most of the people I know who are Sims fans are adult women.... I am thinking this is a good thing hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe some people really like that game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I kind of like the offline version... Don't think I would pay to play the online version unless it was really special.  Like if they let me export the house where I rounded up all of the women in the neighborhood with my manly seduction skills, then gave them all rooms with vibrating heart beds and zebra skin walls, yeah maybe I'd play it :)</div></div><hr />
