I'm not knowledgeable on PvP servers, but assuming you want peace and quiet I would suggest CoM, nadox elementals (thougher before 49, but awesome to see that exp bar move). You can do solB from some of the zone ins from SolA, depends on how much you like soloing the kobold shamans though.<br />
<br />
Lguk is normally full of faction farmers, I set foot only in the DL once to try a group, left after 30min never to return. The skellies in DL are supposed to be a good camp, fast spawns, single pulls. Lguk would be fun if you could get some help to get a room split up.<br />

<br />
Get your Snare necklace if you don't already - it'll be a big help in Dulak.<br />
<br />
Try CoM as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Faction...and 100 hp 12 sta 30 vs magic helm on PvP = Better than Ft3 : P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One more vote for City of Mist.  On the smurf (thats blue) servers it's relatively dead unless a raid is comin.  A couple people soloing but I'd imagine they're more inclined to group with ya if they're within range than kill ya or just chat it up :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garet_Jax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DL skelly camp is great for solo xp you can squeeze out 51 there =D just pull to the back so you dont get any adds and the mobs are cake I play on pvp and never once had anyone come up to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Braemar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm lvl 45 and I've hunted in Dulak, Hole,  Nadox elementals, HHK and COM. My favorite ones so far in the mid-40's is HHK and CoM. I'm getting almost 2% exp per kill in both places.  I'm getting my A$$ kicked solo by the elementals in nadox and in the hole, but good exp grouped in both places. I can take the elementals down in the hole and nadox but not without losing my dog and alot of mana/hp. It's too much effort at this point. CoM is a nice quiet place (plus epic drops) and HHK is kinda hard to find open but good exp and decent loot when camped. I'm going to wait till 48 to do try the Nadox Elementals, one of them dropped a set of boots for me that seem to sell well in the Bazaar (800p or so). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My favorite zone for this level range is jagged pine forest.  If you pull to the river (staying a good ways away from it--nasty potemids), you shouldn't have any trouble.  Can EASILY make it to 51 doing this; the downside is you are a troll, and druids/rangers tend to like this zone too...<br />
<br />
If you do go here, I would avoid the griffons, panthers and anacondas until level 49+, and even then I don;t advise pulling them unless nothing else is nearby (shouldn't happen).  THe other advantage of not pulling these--these are the mobs the high level rangers/druids are here for.  I suppose you could set up an ambush for an unsuspecting druid or ranger this way :)<br />
<br />
On my server, this zone is usually pretty much deserted at all times thanks to LDON i assume.</div></div><hr />
