<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anybody been there in the last few days? Cause today, I couldn't even make it past the first gate with the two mobs and the one in the corner. I zone into IA fine, take out the two roamers.....then I get to the gate...take out the one in the corner, then go for the 2 at the gate. Got 2 more roamers in the middle of it. The first one was no problem, was handling the 3 ok, then the 4th one comes in, had to gate. This happened twice in a row on my two attempts to get there. From reading the other threads, seems like there should only be 1-2 roamers tops, was annoying the hell out of me. Should I just invis past them all? The other threads say to just take them out, but damn I can't handle 4 at once....3 is pushing it lol. Any thoughts? Maybe I'm not just geared/aa'd enough and should grab a partner? Level 63, average-below average equipment, had about 4300 hps buffed and virtued, no canni5, no epic no torpor.<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW, they should not have been repops, as it was not even 15 minutes after the first kill, and others have said 30 minutes respawn on all mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Firstly check the other post in this section. Also, I think that a partner maybe beneficial for you. I think there are 3 wanderers. I killed these as they could be ph for priest. Secondly for info, names hit for 300-400, which should be easy enough once slowed but something to take into consideration.  <br />
My personal style was invising past a lot of spawns once I found which after I had previously killed the see invis ones. But I have suspend minion which is pretty nice for use in here. <br />
Respawn is around 30 mins, at 65 grimlings seemed to have pretty low aggro range. For the Anarchist spawn, I basically killed 2 wanderers, then killed one just  in on the left, then pulled the ph/anarchist.<br />
The mobs have pretty high hp which I have guess you have found, so to prepare for this get some mage weapons for pet, and maybe a ba4 item if you don't have. I could stack Bane+blood +ancient. But this uses a fair bit of mana. I have a pretty good mana pool though and had Kei. Watch out also as they will dispell and can run, so either root or give a snare weapon to pet possibly.<br />
I think it would be most beneficial though you had a partner so you can learn your way around and discover the key areas here and where you fight etc.<br />
A consideration also is there are 2 names which pop in outer Acrylia, primalist and ritualist if you want an alternative.</div></div><hr />
