<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes I took the time to make sure that I couldn't find what I was looking for. But then I could be still asleep and not have full control of my mind.<br />
<br />
This is another what hybrid or tank is good thread, however this is OVERALL best. Meaning from start to finish (if there is a finish)<br />
<br />
So out of Pally, SK, warrior, and Ranger.<br />
What would you Elect as the most usefull from start to end and to help bring an offensive edge to the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Bear with me I am going to try to use the polls.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are times when you just Need a warrior...for all other times theres Shadow Knights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I owned warriors with my Pally.  I owned SKs with my Pally.   Never lost to either class.  I've played both, Paladins and SK's, and I find Paladins just a bit more fun.<br />
<br />
Offense and Defense skills/caps are, in theory, identical.<br />
<br />
SK:<br />
Can pull/FD split (usually)<br />
Fear kite<br />
Nice aggro spells for taunt<br />
Invis<br />
Can squeeze more HP's from them in the early game, since ogre/trolls have more sta<br />
Snare<br />
HT<br />
<br />
Pal:<br />
Resses (That should be enough right there)<br />
Backup heals<br />
Backup buffs<br />
Unique buffs<br />
Self regen<br />
Stuns<br />
Once stuns become useless, they make for excellent taunt<br />
Did I mention resses?<br />
LoH<br />
High Elf Paladins can quest for a 2hs in PoG at 55 that is of epic quality<br />
<br />
So, it's personal taste.  Rangers are bad, too, as well as bards.  It all depends on what role you want to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's nice to see SK's getting some respect these days. Lord knows they needed help before, now I'm proud that my SK is almost 64. I duo a 62shm (1 more AA till canni V!!) and 63sk all the time .. I love the combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I lvled warrior and shaman together to 60 without much trouble. Not sure how well i'd do in pop kinda stopped playing the warrior right as pop was going. <br />
  My pally is 61 and i do quite well with him and 62 shaman. I duo with a friends sk who is 60 and we do just fine also. Pally keeps us alive on overpulls , SK keeps less overpulls from happening and both keep mobs off me. The warrior was doable but not sure i can get a glowing report heh. Not enough experiece with ranger. But i'm more than happy with my pally/shaman combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all this info and input guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have a good stuff and all defenses aas maxed, ranger become the most efficient, at high end game of course !<br />
<br />
So the best tank is SHAMAN!!!<br />
<br />
You tank the mob with quiessence up, have awesome aggro with dots<br />
Ranger deals awesome damage with their bows (EQ, AM3), snare, DS, Harmo pull, and dont really need mana to keep killing mobs...<br />
<br />
So far ranger / shaman was the best duo i made, just for exp grinding of course. You can also try a rogue, or a mage, but i prefer rangers really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had to vote Paladin, they are probably the lowest on the DPS list for the classes you provided, but are out right, hands down, no arguement the hardest tanks to kill that I have ever grouped with. They have great ac/hit point buffs that, for the most part, stack with ours, and if worse come to worse they can rez pretty well too.<br />
I have 2 RL friends that I have grouped with quite a bit, both Dwarven Paladins, and when I am with them and my other RL friend the dwarven cleric (see a pattern here?) I have no fears, no worries and never sweat it unless the MT (/wave Tharaxus) one says &quot;zone&quot;. Hehehe<br />
Rangers however dont make good tanks; now dont go thinking I am dissing the ranger class, I have a level 51 ranger myself and really love the class, but they are basically a dual wielding DoT and a speed bump. They have a great assortment of utility spells and have great DPS, but lack the toughness they need to be tanks.<br />
SK have a lot of DPS, especially for a plate class. They have NO trouble holding aggro and are better pullers in certain situations than monks are. They also have some of the best offensive items in the game available to them. Sadly though, they dont offer a whole lot to the group; their self buffs, for the most part, blow; but they do have some nice drain line stuff that grants them some nice bonuses.<br />
Warriors; the tank class that all others are compared to. Nothing can beat warriors for taking a beating on boss mobs. Defensive pwnz.<br />
In exp groups, they arent really all that great, I have seen gimp gear paladins steal aggro from uber geared warriors and not even mean to do it.<br />
Paladin first for me, then SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pal ,ranger ,war ,sk (yeah sk in last).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tip for warriors: look up your friendly troll GM smith for Honed Blade of the Ykesha. 12/22, proc stun+75 pt DD, guaranteed to piss of the mob and keep aggro on you. Even better if you worship Rallos Zek. 12/21, ac5 plus the above. The RS warriors who've bought 'em from me send me tells of RAR! and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Just call me France, I sold Iraq weapons of mass destruction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tank, as defined - keeps aggro, takes damage well.  Ranger doesn't belong in that list.  ;)  Hell, I'm a better tank than a ranger until I get Q.<br />
<br />
Warrior - ability to gain (and keep) aggro depends 100% on gear (and possibly aa) - or having an SK in the group to give them f'ugly buff.  Bleh.<br />
<br />
SK or paladin as MT - I never have to worry about keeping aggro.  Never.  Not unless they well and truly suck.  Which, lucky me, I haven't had to deal with in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For me, Its Paladin all the way.<br />
<br />
My 2box Paladin is now up to level 45.  Before this char, I tried a warrior to 47, a monk to 48 and a sk to 30.  I know that none of these ended up into the &quot;end game&quot;, but I definatly had enough to get a taste for all of them.<br />
<br />
My final decision was based mainly on:<br />
<br />
1.  Frogs - Chance to play a frog &gt;&gt; the rest :)<br />
2.  Rez - Its a lousy feeling to realize that all of the raids rezzers are dead.<br />
3.  Buffs - Unlike warrior/sk, a paladin improves the Shaman by adding a significant amount of hps through buffs that stack with the shaman buffs.<br />
4.  Snare/Feign - My shaman is an inny troll.  If its really needed, I can snare for myself, and someday I have hopes to camp plane of sky long enough that I can feign if I need that too.<br />

<br />
Haha, hope you have about 2 years to camp Sky....the ring parts are ANYTHING but common.<br />
<br />
If you want to kill hard 1 group mobs, you need a warrior and defensive; any other time a sk or pali is better.</div></div><hr />
