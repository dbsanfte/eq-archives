<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solairs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have my ring from the Hole.  I need to to now take out Neh'Ashiir.  I was wondering if anyone could provide me with information on pulling her and where to fight her?  I have done the Black Reaver a few times without any problems.  My question is shuould I take the raid party all the way up to the sky house?  Also I need to hand her the ring, from the maps I've seen it looks like there is a big gap between the end of the sky bridge and the room where she spawns.  Do I need to levy across the gap and can I pull her back across to the bridge.  Any info on this fight would be great.<br />
