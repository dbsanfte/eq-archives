<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, since the Wars clearly aren't going to make a fuss out of it, I say that we should do it for them.<br />
<br />
Example.  Was doing forboding guards in PoN the other day with a pally as MT.   Due to a rather lame chanter who didn't tash very often, I was forced to cast slow an average of 5 times just to slow the buggers.  Now, I did rather a lot of cringing while doing this, because I know you couldn't just slow a 65 mob 5 times and expect to live.<br />
<br />
But much to my continuing suprise, the pally never lost agro to me!  I started stacking on some seriously heavy DoTs on top, and still no agro.  Amazing!  All seemed well until pally had to leave and was replaced by Warrior.  Warrior pulls, I cast slow once........LOADING PLEASE WAIT!<br />
<br />
Now, unless I've been very much mistaken, a Warrior's job has always been to be the MT.  They serve one purpous, which is of the meat shield, very little class role bluring here.  Until now that is, where they couldn't hold agro on bixie!  I've been observing this over and over again, Pallys and SKs are the new tauntmasters.  The one's who SHOULD be the tauntmasters, the Warriors are a grim susbstitute.  Was this an intentional change to make the hybreds useful?<br />
<br />
These poor dumb bastards need our help, if only to help ourselves.  We shouldn't be dying because they couldn't hold agro on a tub of superglue!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well it really depends on the warrior that you party with.  From what I have found some warriors that have the weapons that require an uber guild to get or mid uber, with enraging blow and such generally will let the warrior keep aggro.   There are a few weapons out there that do the job but I agree that warrior taunt should be upped substantially.  A warrior shouldn't require weapons that are fairly unatainable by most warriors to keep aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warriors tank best, that doesn't mean they can agro best, though it sure would be helpful.  Provides a little spice, you can't go all out on a mob that is going to pound you down, or eventually it will.<br />
<br />
You're better off having him tank 5 seconds unslowed, than dying on a resist on inc, and wiping everyone out because it never gets slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Warriors are screwed these days a bit I think.<br />
<br />
Taunt does need to be upped just a bit.  AE taunt is great, but still...<br />
<br />
Paladins and Mages, most underappreciated classes of all time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The original poster is right, though. A warrior should be able to hold agro. My main is a 55 warrior. With two constantly proc'ing weapons (Scim of the Yak and a Veno Axe... Yes, it's low budget...) and a Dex of 200+, I will  lose agro to Paladins, Shadowknights, Rangers, Shamans and nearly anyone else that decides to take a swing at a mob.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do taunt. It's capped for my level. Yes, I try to disarm everytime it's available. And yes, I kick, everytime it's available. Yet it seems that nearly anyone can pull a mob off me. I can regain agro pretty quickly IF whoever stole my agro sits still and gives me a tick or so to beat on the mob to get it back. I've SA'd for a 60 warrior and seen mobs pulled off him by Slows as well.<br />
<br />
That's probably the most frustrating thing about being a warrior... All I really have to give a group is my AC and hit points. If the mob keeps beating on the shaman, I'm just a DoT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did those giants a ton with a warrior friend.  We were both 60.  Had no tash.  I pulled with my monk, he healed with his cleric.  Warrior tagged when monk FD'd.  <br />
<br />
We found a huge increase in ability to hold taunt when her warrior got the AE taunt AA ability.  We could use it about every other giant or so.  I really like this AA skill; it can make a big difference even on a single mob.<br />
<br />
When it wasn't up, I let her warrior build up aggro a while.  To make sure slow would stick, I would cast malo and malosini first; sometimes it was a hard decision to whether to cast a slow immediately or to keep casting malosini if malosini failed to stick.<br />
<br />
Anyway, casting malo and malosini gave the warrior a few seconds to build up some aggro, and generally that was enough, combined with the cast time of slow, to give me a good chance of not getting summoned after slow.  There were definitely times I had problems landing slows, but I didn't have a chanter for tash either, and we never had a giant we couldn't take down sooner or later(maybe after a rez).  <br />
<br />
As I remember, I did my standard root-the-summoner deal on the giants when summoned, and slowly backed away until I was further out of range than the warrior.  As long as root stuck, I was fine; sooner or later the warrior inevitably had more aggro than I did.  <br />
<br />
From that point on it was all about torrent of poison and the occasional heal for the warrior to keep aggro on the cleric low or fill in when the warrior got dangerously low health.<br />
<br />
Since warrior taunt is far from perfect, sometimes you just have to let them get beat up for a while as they build up aggro.  I think they should have better aggro too; it's nice that hybrids are great at aggro, but the gap between how well they do it and how well warriors do it shouldn't be quite as wide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">-just become?<br />
<br />
I think not, Pallies and SKs have always had high taunt abilites.<br />
<br />
With a Warrior its all about control .... in that situation, as soon as the Warrior joined, I would have swapped to MALO first, then TURGURS.<br />
<br />
Why?  <br />
- Well, the Warrior was unknown (and therefor tauntage unknow)<br />
- MALO give WAR time to build aggro and is ultra low taunt.<br />
- MALO will help slow, thus only needing 1-2 casts instead of 5 (thus keeping your aggro lower).<br />
<br />
If no MALO, then I would try a Malosini first (3 secs cast, lower aggro then Turgurs, still allows WAR to build aggro) then Turgurs.<br />
<br />
If you still insisted on doing slow straight away, cast a Torpor on yourself (or have a cleric Elixer ya) as the Incoming is called ... effectively gives ya 1200 more HPs ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
I agree Warriors ought to get a boost to their taunt values.<br />
<br />
It is very saddening to see my guild's strongest MA reduced to frustration and deprecatory remarks when a paladin several levels lower (and in poorer weapons/gear) is the MA in a grind session.<br />
<br />
Grind sessions aren't about a meatshield staying up.  It is about max killing fast with zero downtime and smooth pulls.  So my good warrior friend sublimates his proud Tank ego and assists the paladin several seasons his junior.<br />
<br />
The fact that he's always our fatty in front on big mobs is probably some consolation, but we aren't a heavy raiding guild.  We raid a few times a week if we're lucky, and they are usually epic or old world planar farming sessions.  Except for the mini-bosses &amp; big bosses, a pally works fine as MA.<br />
<br />
A pally/sk/ranger (with good gear) is a better groupmate for me.  That's sad.  Otherwise I end up tanking the mob Torpored half the time if we want to kill it fast with a warrior MA.  Sure, he can hold the aggro after slow, but I can't do much more damage or it comes right back to me.  That isn't efficient.  I'd much rather be going full bore with Bane, Torrent, &amp;  Torment after slowing, and using Canni5 to its max capability.  I can do that with the other classes as MA.<br />
<br />
We aren't able to get our warrior a Blade of Carnage.  He does have his epic, and he still can't taunt worth crap.  He doesn't (to my knowledge) have the AE taunt ability.  He has a Windblade too.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind Warriors getting a boost to their /taunt.  Poor fellows were really given the short end of the spear for upper 50's, low 60's. <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I totally agree on this. War taunt suck ass badly, if they dont have some uber weapon (BoC, willsapper and so on). That the reason why i always ask Pal / SK as MT, and screw war for exp group. (if i have the choice). Rogue and monk can only agree with that ;)<br />
<br />
Still dont understand why most still prefer war as MT, in exp group... nearly everyone can tank once slow on... (not speaking of big named where defense is needed, or some mana drain proc mobs of course)<br />
<br />
So yes, VI should help war taunt a lot !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*shrug* I pull alot for my xp group and the warrior doesnt have a problem either taunting off of me, or holding aggro(barring multiple slow resists) off of me or anyone else in the party 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
I think in tanking the best warriors give up the best ability to aggro(hybrids have this cornered), and that thats how it should be. Controlling aggro should NOT be a cakewalk in the park, it should take teamwork to keep mobs focused on the warrior. That means rogues use evade, monks fd once in a while.. wizards use their wizard jolt.. rangers use jolt sometimes. Its just the way it is, and the way it should be.<br />
<br />
heck.. if all else fails, root the rootables.. what better aggro control can ya get =p Unrootables *shrug* learn to time your slows and damage better.<br />
<br />
Warrior taunt is fine. SK/Pal taunt alot better with spells, and dont tank as well.. its a tradeoff. Live with it =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Frekkels, I still manage to get in a ton of torrents.  I can do them to a virtually unlimited extent it seems, as long as I don't cast them right after slows.  But one bane of nife, and I'm perma-summoned.<br />
<br />
I usually add in JBB's and sometimes ice strikes while torrent is going off.  It's only when I add in too many ice strikes that I tend to get aggro.<br />
<br />
It's not as mana-efficient as DOTs, but it adds up and still lets me get thousands of hitpoints off the mobs pretty quickly.  <br />
<br />
I guess I find the aggro issue more important when I'm trying to slow than when I'm doing damage.  Warriors definitely need more help here, too.  But later on, I think the burden is on the casters as much as the tanks or Verant to make sure aggro isn't lost.  Just like wizards, we can sometimes put out a decent amount of damage, but we just have to be careful how we do it or we'll mess up aggro or even die, or wipe out a raid.<br />
<br />
I'd like to use more DOTs sometimes, but considering that the aggro is so low from torrent, and the aggro from JBB is so low, and that mobs often die before my DOTS wear out anyway, I'm pretty content to not DOT too much.  I don't think the game is really designed to let us DOT too much and get away with it no matter who the tank is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm a little biased but warrior taunt should remain as it is. <br />
<br />
I duo a 62shm and 60sk. Shadowknights have to have some benefit. Warriors still do a fine job, it all depends on weapon selection - and they have the best weapons for the job (taunting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Look at all the upgrades Pallies and Sk's have had. Warriors function is to tank and be the best. Are they? Depends and it shouldnt depend they should be able to always taunt better than SK and Pally if they are similarly equiped. But thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The warrior will hit his taunt button and it's your job to control your aggro.  You have to walk a thin line between letting the tank get beat up too bad, or risking the mob's anger and ping ponging him to you.  If you're gonna aggro, stand up and do it in the begining, so the tank will always know where to run.  The taunt aggro is well set up, so that we have to pay attention to what we're doing and practice our skillz.  Remember, baseball would have a lot more double plays if the bases were 10 feet farther apart, but then they wouldn't be very exciting, would they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well SKs and Paladin taunt make Warrior taunt look like a child in comparison. Unless the warrior has a pretty damn good weapon I will be tanking at least for a bit after a slow, with a Paladin or SK who is paying attention, I might never tank once. Doesn't seem equitable. And Knights get tons of other utility besides taunt; Pet, LoH, HT, Heal, group heal, snare, FD, and so on. Wars get none of that. Shouldn't they be able to taunt without having to be dual weilding high end equipment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with anything that gives warriors more taunt.<br />
<br />
tip for original poster: spam malosini . . not slow.  If THAT lands, slow is easy to land.  If it's resisted, there's no aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Warriors just need an improved taunt AA, a minor little tweak mostly to help non uber warriors do thier basic job in an xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If I'm grouped with a warrior that has no EB/TB weapon, easiest way to make him hold agro as well as a pally = Malo as the mob is inc, slow straight of the bat followed by cripple, it means I tank for the first few seconds yes, but once the warrior passes a taunt skill check, no one else in the group will be able to pull it off him without making some serious mistakes.  Remember how warriors generate taunt compared to pallys/sk's and use that to your benefit.  Taunt = the highest person on the hastelists hate value + 1, so if he/she hasnt got Enraging blow, I'll provide it for them =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They hold aggro fine when they need to; can't really expect them to compete with hybrids. I tank well enough to live through a slow resist or two on PoP exp mobs before our regular War gets the mob(s) off me.<br />
<br />
Just adjust how you're doing things according to the group tank's class and/or skill. Skilled SK/Pally means you can just slow on the pull without bothering with Malo/Malosinia. Skilled Warrior means you can Sinia on the pull and go stand by the Warrior to slow. If the mob hits you more than one round, replace Warrior or request he put a point into Taunt.<br />
<br />
Not a huge deal, just requires the group to be aware of their tank's capabilities. Personally I prefer a Pally/SK for tanking exp mobs over a Warrior any day, and taunt has little to do with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My main used to be a warrior, and yes, warriors DO suck at taunting now (in general). I used to give pallys and SKs the bird, and think they wernt really all that useful.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Funny thing is that EVERY other class but the warrior can get a decent amount of agro whenever they want.<br />

ONLY the warrior relies on his weapon to proc because he has no other means of getting decent agro (taunt is a joke if you look at other classes). Yet again the players have learnt to adept where VI screwed the game.<br />

Conclusion:<br />
It's not the warriors job to taunt, it's everyone elses job not to get agro in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As usual I'm a bit lost here: I thought that the big difference between a warrior and SK/Paly is that the warrior had significantly better damage mitigation, and more hps for whatever damage got through.  A warrior could build aggro up for longer without the need for other classes to intervene with slows or healing.<br />
<br />
On the other hand an SK/Paly is going to need a slow and healing far sooner and therefore hasn't the time to build up aggro.  SKs and Palys had their aggro capacity increased because of that.<br />
<br />
Have I got things wrong, or are we saying that the balance has now shifted because PoP mobs have different characteristics (their HP to damage ratio, and slow mitigation)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">just wait few second before cast slow, warrior don't lost much hp in few second while you can beaten to almost dead if agro<br />

for PoV, I rarely use malo, and tanking is not problem; other higher zone is difference hence alway cast malo before slow</div></div><hr />

Not true. In fact completely false. The only problem is no one listens when they do. Definately not verant, who has made 1 single post on the warrior board total, ever. <br />

I'm not exaggerating, want to know what it was? Absor said &quot;Hang in there.&quot;. That was it, the entirety of the dev team's communication with the warrior class board.<br />

These are just a few of the threads on warriors atm. The issue's out there, there just isn't enough support for soe to take notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The simple factoid that warriors need to rely on procs like EB to hold agro at all just shows what poor state they are in.<br />
<br />
Add the fact that most of the top end gear does not distinguish between war and the other two tanking classes pal/sk, and you get a situation where pal/sk reach almost the same hitpoints as the warrior. Also, both pal/sk have BETTER survivability than a warrior thanks to their spells. As I see it the only clear plus that the warrior has is defensive disc. Add the massive taunt that a pal/sk can achieve.<br />
<br />
What do you get? A clear preference of using a pal/sk in almost all non-raid situations. In PoP the only place the warrior shines above the other two is tanking the really high end content where absolute max hps and defensive are required.<br />
<br />
As a shaman I will choose to group with a pal/sk over a warrior any time. Grouping with a pal/sk I can slow mobs even as they are running into camp, and not get hit a single time even if I get resisted. Doing that with a warrior means I'll take a serious beating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Conclusion: <br />
It's not the warriors job to taunt, it's everyone elses job not to get agro in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is 100% accurate. Everyone can out aggro a warriors if they want to. When they do it's that characters problem to deal with. The strength of a warrior is soaking up damage. The challenge for any group/raid is to make sure the warrior is the one that is soaking up the damage. Sure you can use other tank classes as MT but I have fought many a mob that is damn near impossible to tank without defensive. And fully buffed my 61 warrior has 800 more hps than a 65 SK in my guild. <br />
By the way if SKs and Pallies are so good at holding aggro lets see how they do with a wizzy chain nuking or a shaman chaining cripple/turgurs. Would you be saying SKs and Pallies suck at holding aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree. Warrior taunt stinks.  Any paladin can hold agro nonstop in a PoV pickup group, but I've yet to see the warrior that can hold agro with me slowing within the first few moments of the fight.  So I either have to time my slow with a malo first and a jbb shot or I have to run my horse up beside the melee to slow to keep from ponging.  With a paladin, I can slow and even use bane at the beginning of the fight without getting agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The gap between Warrior and the other tanks HPs and ACs has closed so much it's almost nonexistent in a lot of cases. 800 hps is one hit nowadays. I always malo first so it gives me the greatest chance to survive when I pull aggro off the warrior with one slow. Then I stand around until the mob is half dead before I start nuking. Yes I nuke because I have to wait so long or else I pull aggro. And even if I wait till it's half dead and I lay a blood of Sarynn on the mob it's a 50/50 chance of catching aggro again. With a SK or Pally I can slow right off, then Blood, then Bane, then nuke and not get aggro. Only thing a warrior has over a Knight is defensive. And defensive isn't necessary in 99% of the cases if you have a cheal chain that is on the ball. Well with anything I have encountered anyway, I'm not not in the elemental planes so I can't speak of what happens there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>skyhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">i don't know if warrior taunt should be upgraded, but it definatly makes a difference what weapons the tanks have.<br />
<br />
Our guild tanks pretty much all have 1 EB weapon, quite a few of them 2 by now, and i notice a definate difference when doing a guild group as compared to a regular pick up group with lower tier guild tanks.<br />
<br />
on most mobs in PoP debuffing is a must before slow, if u only have malo, tash usualy helps, malos alone is sufficient 99% of the time. funny thing is the higher tier u get the less resists u get (well so far) - as PoN and PoV almost always needs malo(s), HoH, BoT and CoD u can do without really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact is, you`ll see more posts titled &quot;Taunt is broken!!11&quot; than &quot;Malo is too rare!11&quot; on any given board. This is because /gasp  taunt doesn`t work very well. <br />
<br />
No class should need to have a certain weapon with a certain proc to be effective or desirable to have in a group.<br />

When I am assigned as the MA in anything I have to load at LEAST 5 stuns. Basically to GET aggro, I have to chain cast my stuns, along with Taunt n Bash. To KEEP aggro I have to cast a stun prolly every 5 swings, along with Taunting and Bashing the whole time. So what does this mean? The Warrior in the group/raid PWNS me as far as damage dealing. Now if I just am there for DPS, and the Warrior is MA, he/she will PWN me on damage anyways. I've had this happen with warriors 5 levels lower than I am, and some of them had not so fancy gear, too. So I really don't see the Warriros side of the taunt/aggro issue here. They are superior tanks/aggro holders. The only way a Paladin (can't speak for SK's) can take and keep aggro with a Warrior around is to burn mana like crazy, and not get in many swings on the mob.</div></div><hr />

I 2 box a 61 warrior and shaman, and yes, i'm fed up with the crap.  The only reason my shaman doesn't get aggro is because i'm playing the warrior and know when it's safe to do certain things.<br />
<br />
The Warrior in the group/raid PWNS me as far as damage dealing.  <br />
<br />
The main tank isn't there to do damage, period.  No one cares if the MT does ANY damage at all, as long as he can keep aggro.  Warriors would be more than happy to do no damage if it meant that the mob could stay glued on them....which is why some warriors tanked mobs in Ssra with dual EB weapons other than bane.<br />
<br />
i don't know if warrior taunt should be upgraded, but it definatly makes a difference what weapons the tanks have.  <br />
<br />
And therein lies the problem.  This should not happen.  At any level in the game, a warrior should be able to pull his own weight, without having to resort to 1 or 2 specific weapons.  A warrior is 100% gear dependant, and that gear is far too rare.  Aside from that fact, basing an entire classes main ability around a specific line of weapons that 90% of warriors will never see is wrong.  They need to scrap EB, and fix the goddamned taunt.<br />
<br />
This is 100% accurate. Everyone can out aggro a warriors if they want to. When they do it's that characters problem to deal with. <br />
<br />
The problem is that you can only do so much when you have a warrior for a tank...pretty much everyone knows that.  Swap that tank for an SK or a pally and you know that aggro isn't going to move.  That means you can nuke more, you can debuff earlier, and the cleric has to waste less mana on healing other people...which by the way is a major problem.  Notice how the cleric &quot;Oh ****&quot; heals are now 400 mana or more?  That's what's causing the new problems now.  When a warrior loses aggro, the cleric immediately spends as much mana as a CH on spot healing someone else, making having to CH a paladin or a SK once or twice more than a warrior a total non issue.  Healers save mana when the mob isn't ping ponging, and that has nothing to do with the HP/AC of the tank.<br />
<br />
just wait few second before cast slow, warrior don't lost much hp in few second while you can beaten to almost dead if agro  <br />
<br />
Ah yes, the bandage fix.  Warriors can't taunt well, so just don't aggro so much and you won't have a problem.  Well, duh.  The problem is that you dont' have to wait a &quot;few second&quot; with a pally or SK who establish aggro almost immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
As usual I'm a bit lost here: I thought that the big difference between a warrior and SK/Paly is that the warrior had significantly better damage mitigation, and more hps for whatever damage got through. <br />
<br />
The warrior no longer has better damage mitigation. They raised pally/SK defense caps to 250 (which is the same as warriors) and the HP difference is negligible these days.  Add in the fact that with a pally stunning, he is taking less damage, because the mob isn't swinging, and you have an issue.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason to be a warrior these days..they are total charity cases.  Hybrids can do our job better than we can, and can contribute more to the group while doing so.  The fact that a class has to rely on weapon procs shows how completely ****ed it is...and contrary to popular belief, no...warriors are not silent about it.  It's just that no one gives a ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Realize guys, if you boost taunt too much, you've just rung up pallies and SKs. Right now, on raids, warrior MT. In exp groups, pallies and SKs dominate. They both have a role, but at least warrior CAN MT in exp groups where pallies-SKs cannot. Don't mess with this balance lightly.<br />
<br />
First off, the difference between pallies and warriors is NOT 800 hp. My guild does Cursed, AoW, Tunare etc, and our tanks run around 1400 ac 8000 hp; our best pally is 1400+ ac 6600 hp. That substantial. And note, that's FAR from end-game gear but it is OK stuff.<br />
<br />
Second, as has been said, what you give up in taunting ability, you gain is more HP + Defensive, which is huge. You lose aggro, you can better tanking ability. Raid focused, yes, but it exists.<br />
<br />
Third, warriors are very gear- and AA-dependant, moreso than most classes. The need BoCs, hatebringers, AE taunt etc. That 65 baron warrior is nothing like a 150 aa pimped out warrior. <br />
<br />
Finally, as has been said, keep aggro is everyone's job. If a warrior loses aggro but he/she's playing well, is geared up and nothing odd is happening, it's not just his fault. It's everyones.</div></div><hr />

Warrior pulls, I cast slow once........LOADING PLEASE WAIT! <br />
 <br />
  Sure the paladin didn't have the sword from Tunare that seems to proc root every damn swing?  ;)<br />
 <br />
  Seriously though warriors need to do more damage, that should be their taunt.  Mobs should be AFRAID of them because they're mean, vicious and destructive, not because they can cuss out your mother in 25 different languages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Warriors are always the main tanks on raids. If warriors taunt gets increased, then I'd want the gap to be lessened to enable SK's/Pali's to tank on more raids. Right now we NEVER use an SK / Pali to tank a raid, maybe because our guild is getting quite large (70ppl attendance+ at some raids) but it still sucks knowing as an SK/Pali that while you are a tank - you will never do your true job on a raid.<br />
<br />
What's wrong with the SK or Pali being able to grab aggro faster than warriors. I could be mistaken, but for Shadow Knights atleast - this is one of their class defining roles, not to mention they have a whole spell line devoted to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">On another note I agree with some of the above posters, if your group can't control themselves and let the warrior get aggro first - then it is YOU that has the problem.</div></div><hr />

Warriors can still taunt well, just not as good as a SK. Where as SK's can tank raids well, just not as good as a Warrior. <br />
<br />
If you have a Warrior tanking then you just have to realize you can't go as gung-ho from the start of fights casting as you can if you had a Shadow Knight / Palidan. While Shadowknights may need the slow sooner and have spells that enable Shamans to do so, Warriors need a second longer to get aggro but can handle taking that couple of seconds more of brute punishment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As has already been pointed out, pallys and sks match wars in almost every way now.  I was grouped with an SK who had 6k Hp today, that's more then enough for just about all groups.  They are preferable to Wars in every way when it comes to groups now.<br />
<br />
Another point is, most the time you can't throw a bane on top of the mob you've slowed, without it agroing.  I was doing this in PoV, and 80% of the time, the mobs would be on me and not the war.

It's definitely time to either upgrade warrior taunt or put a ton more taunting weapons in the game for them.<br />
<br />
The other thing is, the aggro on Bane of Nife is insane.  That really should be toned down.  It makes it impossible to use in xp groups generally unless you've got an SK or Pally for a tank.</div></div><hr />

I don't play a Pally, nor do I know squat about them... I did want to share a tad of experience in PoV...<br />
<br />
I've group with 60+ Wars and do experience my days of resist agros(hell sometimes successfully slowed mob agro) with Wars.. I love the whole rollercoaster ride of HP loss vs Cleric healage.. /sigh<br />
<br />
I've done alot of groups, some as small as 3 peeps &lt;Pal/Shm/Clr with Chnt outside for charming a pet.. read DPS only NO mezz&gt; with the MT being a 65 Pally (assume a few AAs).  Rarely did I have to worry about agro... slows being resisted or not AND I was throwing a BoN on the mobs.. Hell, that Pally was so good we had 2 mobs in camp and still no worries... Whack, Whack, whack main mob... stun add... whack whack main mob, stun add...<br />
<br />
Not sure what that boy was doing, but I rarely was able to take agro using &quot;normal&quot; spells... Don't get me wrong.. I didnt go loading the DoTs on THICK... just your average slow, BoN, Epic, JBB cycle.<br />
<br />
Would I do that with a War.. Hell no.... Something about those stuns just elevated Pallys in my book!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tebin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Paladin here..<br />
<br />
Why is it so bad that now we are wanted in groups? There are plenty of groups recruiting warriors, I have even been turned down before because the group wanted to wait for a warrior. I have seen this alot in several different boards, people seem to think its not right that knights are preferred sometimes over warriors, but I do not get what is so wrong with that.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we are preferred, sometimes they are, thats the way it should be. Knights cant do anything but tank, sure we get spells, but I have never been invited into a group before so I could heal and attack the mob, I only get invited to tank. Therefore, if warriors did not have a problem with aggro, plus they tanked slightly better than us, im out of a job. <br />
<br />
I remember when I had to use my friends druid to 2-box because I could not find a group. I guess people got used to the idea that warriors are THE tank class, and now that the other tanks are actually worth their weight again, things seem off.<br />
<br />
I would understand upgrading warriors if you needed a knight to tank, but that is not the case. I know plenty of warriors who hold aggro just fine from the few times I have been in the same group as a warrior. I am not sure what they do different, but it works.<br />
<br />
Anyway, not much of this really concerns me anymore, I have not played EQ in a while, im getting kinda bored with it. However, I wanted to add my little bit of input in an attempt to help out my fellow knights a little before everyone started screaming nerf paladins. Also take what I say with a grain of salt, since I have not played in about a month, things may have gotten worse since I last saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I only read the first post. Here's the lowdown: Warriors are the best tanks. The challenge? GETTING THEM AGGRO. Yes they are best tanks if they can maintain aggro. That's the whole reason other class get aggro better. COS YOU DONT WANT ON THEM~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>fjkreller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">So if what you say is correct, Vaaxx, then any warrior worth his salt will destroy any weapons hey may have on him when the taunt/aggro issue gets fixed for them. Since all he/she has to do is stand there and take the beating, and NOTHING ELSE, weapons are unecessary. The only purpose for a warrior, according to what you are saying, is to keep aggro. This is bull**** of the purest distillation.<br />
<br />
And you also stated that &quot;The problem is that you dont' have to wait a &quot;few second&quot; with a pally or SK who establish aggro almost immediately.&quot;<br />
Again, I go back to my personal experience with this. It takes me AT LEAST 3 stuns to be cast (and land) on a mob, along with taunting (which is maxed for my level) to get aggro on any given mob. Making this even more difficult is if there IS a warrior around. At that point I am lucky to EVER get aggro over him/her. Even if all i do is try for aggro and forget DPS altogether.<br />
<br />
Please note this is nothing directed at you personally Vaaxx, just the comments you made. I have to agree with others who have posted here about the need to let whoever the tank is have a few seconds on the mob before cutting loose with spells, etc. Ask anyone in my Guild, and they will tell you the same thing. Heck ask anyone I've ever grouped with.. Anyways, just my 2cp, twice, lol</div></div><hr />

First, my disclamer..... I am not &quot;UBER&quot;, I have ok gear for my level (55th), but nothing great. My guild isn't either. We are a bunch of eternal newbies for the most part :D :D <br />
<br />
Anyway, yesterday, I had my first forray into PoD, had a blast load of fun (also won a parchment :cool: ). My duties were fairly standard; slow/buff and keep an eye on caster hp's. The only time I was below 50% mana was during re-buffing phase. During my tenure there (about 4 or 5 hours) my group had 3 different MT's. <br />
<br />
1st) a mid/upper 50' warrior. He held aggro fairly well. I was able to slow without gaining aggro except when multiple resists occured. I could dot after a few tics as well with little problem.<br />
<br />
2nd) upper 50's Paladin. OMG. Nothing else to say. I could do anything and not get aggro. Multiple slow attempts, dot, nuke, whatever.<br />
<br />
3rd) was a 60th SK. Don't know if it was that he didn't know the tools of his trade, but I would get aggro nearly every time I slowed, resisted or not. I stopped dotting. JBB'ing was safe, but nothing else was.<br />
<br />
From that one experience there, give me a Paladin everytime. My guildmate in that group is of the same opinion. Paladins friggin' rock as MT's...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not ever, almost without exception. <br />
<br />
Not because the warrior sucks, but because the tanking ability of a knight is that much better due to aggro on demand with no downside on mitigation. <br />
<br />
It's amazing people carry this hate for warriors because they were far superiorfor one expansion - Kunark. That's like not wanting rangers to get any improvements because they could tank best before kunark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Malo + Tugurs + epic dot + Bane <br />
<br />
I've cast those in that order on each and every mob with 0 aggro problems with a warrior tank, and not just 1 time.. or 2 times .. but every SINGLE day since pop has come out, in tier 1, 2 and 3 zones<br />
<br />
Learn how to use the tools you have avalable to you to moderate aggro, The casting time on malo lets the warrior get initial aggro built up, it allows for slows to land with virtually no resists in PoP (i'm level 61 btw and slowing yellows in HoH/PoS). It also allows Bane to land with virtually no resists (other than Forest Giants in storm */rude*). The epic dot lands on everything and gives you time between slow and bane for the warrior to get even more aggro <br />
<br />
What you have, is a period of about 20 seconds of continual spell casting with 0 aggro with a warrior tank. With canni IV and V .. we can keep this up forever</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I'd have to agree that the gap between Warrior and SK/pally taunt is too large, especially in PoP where the main limiting factor to the damage that many a group does is agro, not mana regen. In that situation, an SK that can hold agro at will might well enable the right group to double their damage output compared to having a warrior as MT. <br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what the solution is, if warriors taunt too well you trivialize raids but it just seems wrong when a warrior is the distant 3rd choice for tank in an exp group. The sad thing is, even if a warrior taunted at well as the hybrids, at 60+ he'd still be 3rd choice for an exp group tank. <br />
<br />
Pally would still have: Rez (good enough to go anywhere without a cleric), Root, stuns, lull to pull, decent healing. <br />
<br />
SK would still be the best pullers in the game and my preferred group tank because of everything else they bring to the table. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you're a shaman it ain't all that bad with a warrior MT in an exp group. Sebazny covered it on the first page, I get the feeling almost everyone else in this thread is ignoring it. Stand beside the warrior, Malo on incoming and slow as soon as as the mob is in camp. You've just given yourself massive agro and if the warrior gets a successful taunt he now automatically has one more agro than you and far far more agro than anyone else in the group. He won't have any trouble holding agro for the rest of the fight even with ****ty weapons. Admittedly it can get a little hairy if slow is resisted AND the warrior misses his taunt check but that just keeps things interesting.</div></div><hr />

before the last patch emp was bugged, basicaly his curse could not be removed. which meant that our MT was slowed for the whole fight. now a slowed MT does have a hard time holding agro, specialy considering the agro reducer part of emp DD as well.<br />
<br />
my guild still managed to avoid agro (for the most part) and maintain agro on our MT. i did the whole debuff thing and DoTed quite a lot - not once did emp even look at me.<br />
<br />
same thing goes for an xp group i think. if the warrior is not geared well (EB weapons or other high agro proc weapons) then u just have to adjust. malo(s) definatly helps - as was said before it will give the tank time to get more agro before u cast slow. then just look at your cleric and tank (hp wise) and time your slow accordingly. chances are the tank can take a few hits before u need to slow the mob. the other advantage is with malo your slow will land 99% of the time - and then who cares if u have a slowed mob agro on u hehe with PoP buffs pretty much every shaman 60+ should get over 4.5k HP, which means u can tank a few round on as slowed mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pallys and SK's have always (well for arguments sake) been able to produce more aggro much faster than a warrior and at any given time.  One of the drawbacks is that it costs them mana, which is limited and can take time to replenish.  This drawback doesnt seem to have been mentioned so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Hmm , intresting debate. Right off the bat you wanna say warriors should have the highest taunt , that a SK or pally should not be able to eclipse a warrior in fast taunting , but you know , how often do you really see a warrior take the back seat on a raid. when it comes to sheer HP and the ability to take a hit , i believe the warriros solidly control this field.<br />
<br />
Granted its nice to slow right off the bat in a XP group with a SK or pally , but again , the highest HP melee in every guild i know and highest AC is the warrior in every case. through AA and gear they have a edge .<br />
<br />
So what we really talking about is situational tanking. SK and Pally have a hard enough time being realized for just how strong they are , im not so sure i think the warrior really needs it. Like i said , in the day to day grind they might not be the BEST , but when it comes down to what REALLY matters , taking down thwe BIG dogs , the warrior is the go to guy.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the new weapons poping up with built in taunt are REALLY helping them and also kinda ncie that these weapons are ONLY for warriors.<br />
<br />
I dunno , in the big picture , are they really that bad off ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Tebin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">[Am I mistaken to think that in an xp group without a chanter, the Pally or SK will run out of mana from using spells to keep aggro?<br />
<br />
Correct. I almost always have to have KEI to keep up constant aggro. I have some flowing thought items, and gave up some hp for those, so if need be I can stun sparingly, and use our lvl 9 blind spell flash of light to hold aggro, but that can lead to problems, and I still need downtime after a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">just like to point out , im in a group with a warrior right now using , not UBER but good weapons , she is yanking them right off me <br />
<br />
malo/slow  mob turns to me and before it even htis me its right back on her.<br />
<br />
so maybe its not broken taunt , maybe warriors just need to  re-evaluate their weapons. Infact as im talking to her and typing here she is informing me that she feels that warrios that mash the taunt button all round end up with less aggro in the end and that she infact onyl hits it when the mob isnt facing her.<br />
<br />
i gotta say , heh , she is doing it , im not getting hit at all</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to clear something up I said that seems to keep getting misunderstood.<br />
<br />
I can control aggro with a warrior groupmate.  Wait a bit, don't dot as much, etc.  That isn't the problem.  I can control aggro with a Pally/SK/ranger groupmate too.  But I don't have to wait, and I can do more DPS myself.<br />
<br />
It isn't that I have trouble controlling aggro with a warrior.  (That's easy)<br />
<br />
My point is that for an exp grind session a paladin/sk/well-equipped ranger is a better groupmate for zero-downtime and faster killing.  I don't have to worry about aggro as much, because they keep it much easier.  So I can cast more and do more damage.<br />
<br />
Mana is NEVER the issue w/ a warrior tank groupmate.  I have to control aggro &amp; restrict my casting, so I always have plenty of mana.  Mana is a controlling issue w/ a different class tank in front, because I can do MORE damage w/o worrying about aggro issues.  The management of my DPS is now based on mana and not on aggro.  I don't have problems with mana management  here either, but I am free to cast what I want based on my mana level instead of always being restricted by aggro issues as I am with a warrior.  (I generally rarely ever have mana problems since I gained Canni5.)<br />
<br />
There is a major paradigm shift for a grind session w/ a warrior compared to other tanking classes.  THAT's why I prefer a non-warrior groupmate.  I can and do group with my guildmate Warriors, but it is because they are my friends.  I personally only know one Warrior (in an uberguild) with enough AA to overcome that, and he's hunting in zones I'm not flagged for.:p<br />
<br />
Throw the poor warriors a bit more aggro.<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">but when it comes down to what REALLY matters , taking down thwe BIG dogs , the warrior is the go to guy<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahhh yes, and how do warriors get from blackburrow to there? <br />
<br />
Does it make sense if you take the most group dependent class in the game and make them the least wanted tank for exp groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Interesting point.<br />
<br />
I think that it applies to PoP more than lower levels though.  At lower levels, a warrior is still easily up there with the other plate tanks, I find.  Even if he doesn't acquire aggro quite as fast as a hybrid plate tank, it really doesn't matter as much either, because relatively common mobs in the pre-PoP worlds aren't going to be meleeing for 650 and 700 and casting 1000 point DD's.  If aggro takes a second or three longer, it's not going to cause as much discomfort -- especially when you have buyable armor these days that gives so many hitpoints that even warriors who have never raided a day in their lives can possibly have very good hitpoints at a low level -- you don't slow right away, who cares?  And of course mudflation has made pretty darn good weapons very obtainable these days too.  <br />
<br />
All in all, warriors in lower levels/zones aren't hit as hard as high level ones.<br />
<br />
But the difference between a warrior with uber weapons and without is pretty huge.  I've seen warriors who lose aggro constantly, and some who never seem to.  The difference in weapons is often the clear explanation.  I can definitely understand, though, the problems of warriors who don't have their enraging blow weapons, etc.<br />
<br />
Oh, and on the mana issue with hybrid -- yep, they run out of mana pretty frequently.  It can take a LOT of mana to cast those spells. The pally friend I often hunt with seems to want KEI as much as any one in a group, and often seems nervous that we want to pull and be assured he has aggro every single time -- when he thinks that because of his low mana he could fall short and not be able to hold it sometimes.  Mana loss is a very real issue on hybrid tanks, of a certain level of uberness at least.  Some of them make damn sure they're sitting or have a horse going every possible second, just like a caster.  Frankly, my pally friend worries about mana a helluva lot more than I do.  For every time he wants to hurry up and pull, there are four times as many times that I want to hurry up and pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I think it's ridiculous to say knights can tank better than warriors, when you have 1 example from all 30+ servers. Nevermind that it isn't true in 99% raid encounters, if it can happen to one extremely well equipped knight, then it can happen to everybody, right?<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
PoP is a lot like early Velius, where warriors reign supreme in the tanking department even though they were far worse at keeping agro back then compared to today. Just like the way it was in Velius, Knights are just like everybody else (read, non war) when they get agro--they live 7 secs instead of my 5. <br />
<br />
Some would like to argue that it is about raid efficiency, that knights can hold agro better, so the raid can spend less time worrying about agro and more time dealing damage. This is an extremely one sided view, especially against PoP mobs. Yes, a paladin can hold agro better than a warrior while tanking--if you have 19 clerics healing him instead of the 6 required for the warrior. Which is more likely? To take down a mob with 40 people and a warrior tanking, or to take down the same mob with 60 people (20 being clerics) with a knight tanking?<br />
<br />
If people are referring to past expasions... why bother at all stopping at knights? We've had bards and wizards tank stuff in NToV... they sure as hell hold agro better than a warrior, but that doesn't make them more desirable tanks for obvious reasons. New expasions make past mobs obsolete, but if people want to talk about old mobs, here's something for thought. We've had 1 cleric keep up 1 lvl 65 war with extremely crappy gear (6k hps, 1200 ac) against Vindi without any issues. A similarly equipped lvl 65 knight woulda died at the 7th second into the first CH.<br />
<br />
Giving warriors ultra taunt brings the game back to the Velius era where knights were low DPS warriors with crappy spells and can't tank, therefore useless. Paladins at least group healed and buffed to pretend to be useful, where SKs could have just FDed in a corner and waited for loot and nobody would have noticed. <br />
<br />
Warriors are unparallelled raid tanks, knights are better than warriors for exp groups. That's an inherent balance issue in the game. If warrior tanked better than knights AND gained agro as well, or better, then why have knights at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think i speak for every warrior when I say that I don't feel the need to be superior to the knight hybrids, but I want to feel equal.<br />
<br />
They improved knight defense considerably since velious, and now with knight only weapons and armor, the gap between knights and warriors defense wise NON DISC (which means I don't want any of you goddamned retards bringing defensive up here) is pretty even.  The biggest difference between the 2 is aggro control.  Any knight with a spell book can assure himself aggro, whereas a warrior is reliant on procs.  The other difference would be damage, and I think that with the ridiculous amount of knight 2h weapons, that any theoretical bonus the warrior has because of skill caps/dual wield, etc would be easily offset by their spells.<br />
<br />
The aggro issue these days is ridiculous.  If my shammy gets 2 slows resisted, I run over there with my warrior and occasionally it'll take 3 taunt cycles to remove that mobs foot from my shaman's ass.  18 seconds....that's bull****.  100% bull****, when a hybrid can do it in a fraction of the time.<br />
<br />
I don't want my warrior to be superior necessarily.  I would really like it if the game was set up so that Warriors, pally's and SK's could all be interchangable tanks..you'd just get a bit better damage/disc tanking with the warrior, some buffs and heals with the pally and some taps with the SK.  Right now, that's not happening because every class is bitching about the aggro generation issue warriors have.  You don't have to scale up knight taunt if you bump up warriors a bit.  Put them on a higher taunt table so that maybe 50% of the time it works rather than the ridiculous 25% now.  I'm not asking to be a god, i'm asking to be viable, and i don't think that's so wrong.<br />
<br />
You can spout all the **** you want about how warriors are still viable tanks..but if you have to pay closer attention to what you do to the mob because you have a warrior over a knight, then that proves we're not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Here's a thought, read what you wrote again, then read the following.<br />
<br />
They improved warrior taunt considerably since velious, and now with EB weapons, the gap between knights and warriors agro wise NON SPELL RELATED (which means I don't want any of you goddamned retards bringing Stun/Hate spells up here) is pretty even.<br />
<br />
Now, tell me how much sense your statment made?<br />
<br />
Defensive/Evasive are MUSTs if you want to tank high end PoP mobs. Any warrior with a disc can be assured that he is at least 4x more efficient at tanking than ANY knight. Agro is irrelevent if the person who gains it die in 2.14 secs to 2k quad rampages.<br />
<br />
Try to understand this simple fact: When you are facing mobs with 2000dps, and you are faced with a choice to use a tank who makes your raid do 80% of it's DPS potential because of agro issues, or use a tank who can make your raid do 100% of it's DPS potential, but will only live for 2 secs. Which one would you choose?<br />
<br />
Warriors are not just supieror raid tanks, they are the ONLY raid tanks for current expasion content. Knights HAVE to be able to do SOMETHING better than warriors in exp groups, else they have no value, except sub par DPS. Yes, if a SK burns his mana, he can do more DPS than a warrior--until he runs out, and don't even TRY to suggest similarly equipped paladins can out damage a warrior vs anything other than undead.<br />
<br />
You can spout all the **** you want about how knights can out agro you with both arms tied behind their backs, but if you actually bothered to count the seconds a knight stays alive after getting agro against a current expasion uber mob, then you'd realize how ridiculous is the claim that knights tank as well as warriors.<br />
<br />
In the end, you simply fail to see the other point of view--you just want what you think you should have, regardless to how it'd affect TWO whole classes if you get your wish to be the only raid tanks, and the best exp group tank.</div></div><hr />

Was it me the Pally at Guards camp you talk about ? Dunno, one thing to consider is the weapons/equip the warrior was using. I saw warrior holding agroe very nicely without EB-weapons...<br />
<br />
Or maybe he wasnt really concentrated, or lacked the skill to hold agroe.<br />
<br />
And yes i love to hold agroe better than warrior, they got more DPS, better defense, better discs, we got some heals and better agroegenerating, thats ok for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Hi<br />
<br />
I normally just read these boards to find out more about other classes, but I thought I would throw in my 2cp here, given that I am a warrior.<br />
<br />
To the original poster, thanks for speaking up for us.<br />
<br />
Theres been a lot of points said here but I just want to make a few of my own.<br />
<br />
First off, no one can really dispute that in a situation against a extremely high DPS uber mob, then the warrior is your man, thanks to defensive. <br />
<br />
However, looking at the overall situation nowadays, with SKs/Pals being able to tank as well in exp group and gain aggro better, I don't think it was VI's intention that a level 55 disc would become our one and only class defining aspect, or at least I hope not.<br />
<br />
The fact is, the percentage of warriors who go up against uber mobs is small. Factor in that even then, the majority of your time is spent exping, and really, our &quot;class defining skill&quot; is not all that often used or relied upon. <br />
<br />
Ive always accepted the fact that my taunt sucks. I've had on  occassions to suck it up and give up my place as MA to a SK/pally because they can hold aggro better.<br />
<br />
As a result, I have done what I can to upgrade to weapons which help me hold aggro a bit better. Currently i have a wavecrasher, frosty and narandi's lance. More of less, they seem to work okay in exp groups. I have found that good shamans will adjust their spells to suit us, so not often have i had shamans die on me in groups. So, by and large, I get by. EB weapons are simply out of reach for my and my guild and will be for some time.<br />
<br />
But that is not the point. I don't want to be a basket case and I don't want to have to be babysat. I have also been lucky in making money and there are a lot of warriors I know who have even poorer taunt getting weapons.  <br />
On the other hand, I accept the SKs and pallys arguments that if we could taunt as well as them, then they would be pretty much out of work.<br />
<br />
Taunt is definitely broken. There have been many good suggestions as to how it should be fixed and I am sure that there is a middle ground that can be found for it to be improved a little, but not to put us on par with SKs and Pallys. That is all this humble warriors asks.<br />
<br />
Gulug<br />
<br />
PS. The one thing no one has mentioned here is shield. Everytime I join a new group I will hotkey my cleric, shaman, ench so that I can help a little if they get aggro by taking some heat off them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Gutrippar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">being a 56 shaman with my main being a 62 shadowknight, i would like you people to think about what you request.<br />
<br />
atm, the only reason a group wants a sk or pally in PoP is because of their superior taunting abilities, taking that away would make it so that there is *no* reason at all to take a pally/sk as MT. <br />
<br />
let it be like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Put them on a higher taunt table so that maybe 50% of the time it works rather than the ridiculous 25% now.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know before the taunt upgrade, that taunt button worked 8% of the time for a warlord(parsed on steel warrior). Now, I think it's hovering at about 15% or so.<br />
<br />
I think some people need to step back and realize that warriors are not asking for the same aggro as a knight, just better than what they have-and instant aggro. Please note, EB weapons are in NO WAY any fix at all for this unless they intend to put them on yard trash in every 50+ zone. <br />
<br />
Currently you have paladins and shadowknights mitigating 95% as well as warriors, and warriors taunting 30% as well as knights- if you want to have it work so that it's balanced, you'd have to give warriors 95% of the aggro ability knights have. In truth, warriors aren't even asking for that much of an improvement.<br />
<br />
Boinshar- using defensive in the exp argument is just plain stupid- warriors don't use it there, except in the &quot;oh **** I am dead!&quot; category. Warrior defensive disc in xp groups is like pally loh or sk HT- it's nice, but it's something you hold in reserve for emergencies. The flip side of that is that warriors can't use any offensive disciplines if they want it up in case of those emergencies.<br />
<br />
Do you think it's a good thing that the only real benefit you can think of for warriors is a discipline 3 expansions(and what, 2 1/2 years?) old? The worst thing verant ever did to the class was to give that discipline to warriors- they've been holding it against us ever since.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that it applies to PoP more than lower levels though<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually Blarg it applies to levels 50 and up, about 1/4 of the levels and closer to 75% of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the part you don't understand, and the entire basis for your claim.<br />
<br />
The original post is not talking about uber mobs.  I am not talking about uber mobs.  The original post is talking about XP groups, and I am talking about XP groups.<br />
<br />
The number of seconds you stay alive on an uber mob is meaningless...with enough healing, you can have a CH chain on a goddamned mage and make it work.<br />
<br />
Next, Enraging blow is garbage.  Most warriors I know want it removed.  You have an entire class's aggro ability defined on 5 weapons, attainable by no more than 10% of the population of EQ.  Ya, that solves the entire issue right there.  Remove enraging blow, because it was a bandaid fix to a broken situation anyway, and FIX TAUNT.<br />
<br />
After that, you base a class upon it's &quot;3 minutes of glory&quot; aka Defensive.  It wasn't that long ago that people like you were saying that no one could stand up to the punishment the avatar of war put out, and now, he's routinely tanked by 1 man.  That means that for the remainder of that fight, after the 3 minute mark, it's without a disc.   Do you kill AOW in 3 minutes?  Didn't think so.  We're 3 months into this expansion.  Of course **** looks fearsome.  Once tanks start cracking 10khp fully buffed and knights not far behind, and breaking the 1800-2k ac barrier, we'll see how imposing the damage from mobs is.  Furor's ac is already over 1800, and he says he's doing MUCH better in PoP.   <br />
<br />
It's sad stuff, because the only arguments that people who disagree with improving warriors can come up with revolve around broken weapons and a disc that's only used for as long as it takes to stabalize an encounter.  Warriors tank stuff without defensive/evasive every day...and it won't be long before they start doing the same in PoP.  When they don't use defensive discs, they have the same defensive footing that a knight has.<br />
<br />
You're allowed to have your opinion, but I don't have to agree with you.  I don't have an EB weapon, I probably never will.  What about my aggro generation?  Am i balanced as a class because of a weapon it will take me and 40 of my friends to get?  I don't think so, and it's quite obvious that there's a lot of other people who agree with me.</div></div><hr />

Reading comprehension. Learn it, love it, don't post without it.<br />
<br />
Vaaxx,<br />
<br />
The original post is not talking about uber mobs. I am not talking about uber mobs. The original post is talking about XP groups, and I am talking about XP groups. <br />
<br />
Here's the part you seem unable, or unwilling to comprehend.<br />
<br />
Agro management is a balance issue, you can't just ignore the most important aspect of the game (killing uber mobs) and ONLY talk about exp groups. By doing so, you show that you are not interested in balance, only in bettering your class to the point of making two others obsolete.<br />
<br />
The number of seconds you stay alive on an uber mob is meaningless...with enough healing, you can have a CH chain on a goddamned mage and make it work. <br />
<br />
If you belong to high end guild, you'd realize that you made do with whatever classes you have online to kill mobs. Some raids, actually, ALL raids during off times you kill mobs with whoever you have online. What does this mean? You don't always have 20 clerics online to make a paladin tank viable against current game content.<br />
<br />
Why don't you think people just use mages to tank everything since they obviously generate a lot of agro? Maybe, just maybe that it'd take 24 clerics healing in shifts just to keep up with damage? Why not bitch that you need better taunt than mages, since they obviously tank so well?<br />
<br />
Agro != tanking.<br />
<br />
Next, Enraging blow is garbage. Most warriors I know want it removed. You have an entire class's aggro ability defined on 5 weapons, attainable by no more than 10% of the population of EQ. Ya, that solves the entire issue right there. Remove enraging blow, because it was a bandaid fix to a broken situation anyway, and FIX TAUNT. <br />
<br />
Kighnt out agro warriors with spells = Warriors out tank knights with discs. What's so hard to understand about this simple compromise?<br />
<br />
Only 1 knight across 30+ servers managed to tank a PoP uber mob with an army of clerics healing.<br />
<br />
Only 5% of all EQ warriors get to see EB weapons.<br />
<br />
Which is more likely?<br />
<br />
After that, you base a class upon it's &quot;3 minutes of glory&quot; aka Defensive. It wasn't that long ago that people like you were saying that no one could stand up to the punishment the avatar of war put out, and now, he's routinely tanked by 1 man.

Furor's ac is already over 1800, and he says he's doing MUCH better in PoP. <br />
<br />
Way to be confused about more issues than one genious.<br />
<br />
AoW is THREE, count, 1, 2, 3 expasions old. Are you trying to tell me that during Velius, knights can't tank uber mobs in the old world?<br />
<br />
Have you ANY any idea how pathetic the AoW's DPS is compared to even tier2 boss mobs in PoP?<br />
<br />
LOL, you whine about EB weapons, and now you want to claim getting 10k hp and 1800-2000 AC is easy simply because it fit your arguement? Are you actually trying to defeat your own arguement? Next time you decide to hang on Furor's words (but apparently missing his magelo, since he doesn't even have 10k hps) ask him how any mobs he tanks without disc, k?<br />
<br />
It's sad stuff, because the only arguments that people who disagree with improving warriors can come up with revolve around broken weapons and a disc that's only used for as long as it takes to stabalize an encounter. Warriors tank stuff without defensive/evasive every day...and it won't be long before they start doing the same in PoP. When they don't use defensive discs, they have the same defensive footing that a knight has. <br />
<br />
This is sad because warriors have the monopoly on raid tanking, and still want to be able to be the best tanks in exp groups. Some people, like you, managed to completely ignore balance, and continue this misguided crusade simply because they want upgrades, and damn everybody else.<br />
<br />
Does warriors have issues with snap agro? Yes. Should a warrior be able to out tank knights on raids AND in exp groups via equal agro control? Hell no.<br />
<br />
You're allowed to have your opinion, but I don't have to agree with you. I don't have an EB weapon, I probably never will. What about my aggro generation? Am i balanced as a class because of a weapon it will take me and 40 of my friends to get? I don't think so, and it's quite obvious that there's a lot of other people who agree with me.<br />
<br />
You are comparing yourself with people far out of your league. You will not be able to out tank people who's equipment is expasions ahead of you. If you ignore discs, even shamans and rangers with luclin/pop gear can and will out tank you--not because of your class, but because of your equipment.<br />
<br />
Agro generation is not the ONLY thing that matters for a tank. When you want to spew forth words like &quot;balance&quot; you have to consider the big picture. If all you do is exp and don't raid, then your experience on this issue is incomplete. On raids, warriors are the only viable tank, therefore they must give up something in exp groups, where they are still viable, just not optimal.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the number of people who agree with you does not make you any more right or wrong. Many people once believed that resists don't matter, dex helped channeling, and the earth was flat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Bigcat Daddy-o</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Definetly agree that the Warrior class needs an upgrade in taunting ability. When I am in a group that is looking for MT or replacement, I always suggest a SK/Palladin over warrior. <br />
So, Warriors get a beating in grouping opportunities, then how are they going to earn those 150 aa's that they need to fulfill their role? <br />
I would also further support that as shaman (or any group member for that matter) we need to be cognizant of the group make-up and what role we can play in each scenario. With a SK or Palladin tanking, I pretty much just do whatever I feel like, and don't worry about it. When warrior is MT, I know he/she needs me to lay back a few seconds, and time my slow to not mess them up. Sometimes, that means standing beside the warrior to slow, if they are having trouble holding agro, that way they don't have to chase the mob to get it back. But, I have also noticed that the warrior tends to not get into seroius hp loss trouble as fast as SK or Palladin if I lay back a few seconds on slow.<br />
It's all about teamwork and making do with what Sony has given us, and offering them good reasons to change when something needs improvement. <br />
I also remember the days when SK or Paladins were charity cases, and had difficulty getting groups too, so change needs to be carefully managed. <br />

You want the best tank in the game, the HP and mitigation champ, to also be the best at aggro... So that everyone can pour damage into the mob while its glued to the warrior... Well, that doesn't sound like a game to me, it sounds like shooting fish in a barrel. Lets put NOCLIP and God Mode in too, thats always fun.<br />
<br />
The way it is now, you need to make a choice: Do we want the super tank with weak aggro, or the super aggro, weak tank. Thats balance.<br />
<br />
And don't get me started about warrior's lack of knowledge of when to taunt. Mashing the taunt button is a sure sign of a frustrated warrior.</div></div><hr />

Vaxx: &quot;After that, you base a class upon it's &quot;3 minutes of glory&quot; aka Defensive. It wasn't that long ago that people like you were saying that no one could stand up to the punishment the avatar of war put out, and now, he's routinely tanked by 1 man. That means that for the remainder of that fight, after the 3 minute mark, it's without a disc. Do you kill AOW in 3 minutes? Didn't think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hoho. Def is used on EVERY mob we fight, whether it's ntov or ssra. Yes, we don't switch tanks, but contemplate for a moment the TONS of mana saved during those 3 minutes on a mob like AoW? Plus, dumbass, on many long fights the disc REFRESHES. The disc alone is what makes warrior THE raid tanks, especially now that god rods are gone and mana is more an issue. PLEASE, tell me why the heck you wouldn't use def on an end-boss type mob?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but the balance is good. For exp groups, pallies rock. For raids, get the warrior. Like it or not, both have clearly defined roles. <br />
<br />
And YET AGAIN we come back to the same old argument. I don't have access to item XYZ so you can't balance a class around it. Yes, but at the same time you can't ignore item XYZ. Those EB weapons do exist and make a big difference, just like 100+ AA do. SoDs and JK's also have nice taunt tho. And usually, when you REALLY need those items, you have the stregnth to have access to them. You're right, for the 24 member guild farming HoT, 2 EB weapons would be a nice perk, but it's not needed. The game does have a progression, and frankly thru mudflation and levels it's getting EASIER not harder to tackle older encounters. And the PoI dragon isn't really that hard anyway.<br />
<br />
Somehow I still see warriors get exp groups. Somehow I still see pallies welcome on raids. Stop trying to seriously alter what's not broken. Minor upgrade? Fine I guess. Equal to a pally/sk? Then just 2box a knight for brells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Merauk_EOD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">While I agree taunt needs some work I think it is important to point out how it exactly works (which in reading through all these posts I did not see listed).<br />
<br />
When anyone presses the taunt button (warrior, pallie, sk, etc.) they have a chance based on their skill to succesfully taunt.  When this happens the taunter gains the top aggro of anyone currently aggro on the mob +1.  This is the key point he is only 1 better then next closest person on the aggro list.  Lets look at this from made up numbers:<br />
<br />
Monk pulls has 4pts of aggro.<br />
Warrior taunts and succeeds has 5pts of aggro.<br />
Shaman casts slow and generates 6pts of aggro.<br />
Mob proceeds to attack shaman.<br />
Warrior taunts and succeeds and now has 7pts of agro.<br />
<br />
The main difference over everyone else and warriors is that they can generate aggro through means other then melee attacks.  Warriors for the most part cannot (aside from weapon proc's).  So if we look at the same scenario with a paladin:<br />
<br />
Monk pulls has 4pts of aggro.<br />
Pallie taunts and succeeds has 5pts of aggro.<br />
Pallie stuns and gains 5pts of aggro for 10 total.<br />
Shaman slows and generates pts of aggro.<br />
Mob stays on pallie.<br />
<br />
It is important that everyone grouping with the warrior know how to manage their aggro.  The warrior can beat the living crap out of the taunt button, but the only way he has to generate aggro is either proc or melee damage.  So it takes him longer to establish aggro then hybrids.  It is also easier for somebody to steal aggro from him because he does not generate as much.<br />
<br />
If you are using a pallie/sk as a tank in a exp group, then the cleric is going to have to heal a bit more, but everyone can nuke/dot like mad men.  It is close to impossible for anyone to take aggro from an SK or Pallie if they don't want to loose it.<br />
<br />
If you are using a warrior to tank in a exp group, the cleric will need to heal a lot less.  This frees him up to toss some nukes or do some melee which makes up the shortfall in DPS that comes from the other people in the group having to back off a bit (and it isn't that much backing off more then it is nuking later in the fight).  Generally if you wait till 80% to begin nuking like a mad man aggro is pretty well on the warrior and it will stay there.  <br />
<br />
In a raid situation versus anything tougher then Emperor Crush, you are going to need a warrior with defensive/evasive.  For this situation there are Enchanter/SK buffs to help the warrior establish and maintain aggro (and to reduce others aggro).<br />
<br />
So while a warrior may not be as good at generating aggro or gaining it at times, the rest of the party can do things to help him out.  The next time a mob jumps on one of you, might want to consider if maybe your own actions brought it on as opposed to somebody elses (i.e. that god damn warrior won't hit the taunt button).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I followed a link from the warrior message board (The Steel Warrior) to here - some industrious warrior was going around various boards finding non-warrior threads about warrior aggro.<br />
<br />
Few thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) A lot of warriors are opting to not use defensive right away so they can build aggro. Yes, its nice but comes at as price - lost aggro building potential. So while defensive is a class defining skill, it can potentially be a class negating skill too (Like if your enchanter is tanking because you dont have aggro).<br />
<br />
2) Warriors can tank well. SK/Pal can tank almost as well.<br />
<br />
3) SK/Pal can generate aggro as quickly under any circumstance. Warriors have a chance to gain (but not hold) aggro every 10 seconds (with a low success rate). <br />
<br />
4) Warriors have availble at lvl 59+ a unresistable AE taunt - it requires 24 AA points minimum. SK/Pal have high aggro mechanisms starting before level 20.<br />
<br />
5) In my experience, Shaman/enchanter slows are really hard for a warrior to overcome while SK/Pal can retake aggro fast. Oher classes its not an issue because CH/nukes/BS's come &quot;later&quot; in the fight when I've built aggro.<br />
<br />
SO sorry to the Shaman and enchanters. I'm sorry you got to cast your highest aggro spells as soon as I pull. My cleric like me much better than a Knight but my shaman's hate me. <br />
<br />
I know Verant is looking into this and traditionally before they &quot;fix&quot; a class they let its flaws linger (like the SK/Pal poor DPS for instance). I've heard that there is an ability that allows a warrior to give up a small amout of health for some aggro. <br />
<br />
That is a good idea but will probably have a refresh rate of 15 mintues or some other - but measures like that will continue to be seen until there is some &quot;balance&quot; in the warriors ability to gain aggro compared with a Knight's ability to tank.<br />
<br />
Of course, everyone has to post complains ad nausema on boards like these until SOE notices. (remember rogues, rangers, wizards, mages, druids, pal/SK, etc)<br />

You don't understand it correctly at al.<br />
<br />
The same can be said of you, boinshar. You don't want to hear what I was saying( and realize it's correct)- and consequently labeling it as me needing to learn &quot;reading comprehension&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then you turn around with this gem:<br />
<br />
<br />
Should a warrior be able to out tank knights on raids AND in exp groups via equal agro control? Hell no<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think either of you did anything but see &quot;warrior fix&quot; and jump in with a heated reply based on class hate.<br />
<br />
I'm going to steal something from another post on the matter to finish off my posting here:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are BROKEN . Anyone who says otherwise is either in serious denial, has never really experienced the alternatives, or is out to protect their own interests because they're afraid they'll be less attractive if Warriors are fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Last point Boinshar, because as unwilling as you say I am to see &quot;the other side,&quot; you're equally biased.<br />
<br />
This is sad because warriors have the monopoly on raid tanking, and still want to be able to be the best tanks in exp groups. Some people, like you, managed to completely ignore balance, and continue this misguided crusade simply because they want upgrades, and damn everybody else.  <br />
<br />
Shamans have the monopoly on raid slowing...and still are the best slowers in XP groups.  <br />
<br />
Rogues have the monopoly on melee damage on raids...and in xp groups.<br />
<br />
Wizards have the monopoly on burst damage on raids...and in xp groups.<br />
<br />
You see where i'm going with this?<br />
<br />
You wanna argue that enchanters &quot;can do&quot; for slowing with Forlorn deeds over turgurs?  Then accept that fact that a knight &quot;can do&quot; on a raid.<br />
<br />
But whatever, i'm done arguing with you.  There's always gonna be some jackass around who insists that everything is fine because he's &quot;smart enough&quot; to find a way around the problem, rather than fixing the problem.  This thread is 3 pages long, and there are countless threads on every other class board about the same issue.  It's obvious there's a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Jharassik,<br />

First you don't read, then you assume it's &quot;class hate&quot; instead of your own &quot;class envy&quot;. <br />
<br />

You are actling like a rabid chihuahua going around yelping &quot;I'M RIGHT BECAUSE I SAID SO, AAAHAHAAHA&quot; while somehow believing you are making a point.<br />
<br />
You are on a roll. Keep it up, you are about to reach a whole new level of idiocy previously unexplored by humanity.<br />
<br />
Vaaxx,<br />
<br />
There are always jackasses around who assumed everything's wrong because they are unable to comprehend the definition of &quot;balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's just like you to bring up something entirely unrelated to try to force a point.<br />
<br />
Shamans slow 5% more than enchanters and beastlords. In a group, all 3 classes have different roles. You don't need a shaman to slow on a raid.<br />
<br />
Rogues hardly do more damage than monks these days, on raids as well as exp groups. Damage dealing stacks in an exp group. You don't need rogues on raids to do damage, they are only required for disarm traps and open doors.<br />
<br />
Wizards have do more burst damage than any other class on raids and in exp groups. Do you absolutely need wizards to do burst damage? No, they merely make things go smoother.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the ONLY viable tank for current high end content. You need warriors, else you aren't killing anything past tier2. That's all there is to it.<br />
<br />
If you cannot see the difference between &quot;the best at doing something&quot; and &quot;only viable class at doing something&quot;, then you need to seek help.<br />
<br />
Let's see if you can add two and two together, it really isn't hard if you try.<br />
<br />
Why do you want a knight in an EXP group over a warrior? <br />
<br />
Why do you want a knight in an EXP over a warrior if all 3 classes generate agro equally?<br />
<br />
What then, is a knight's role in an exp group?<br />
<br />
So, what kind of an upgrade are you going to ask for that can satisfy your needs yet at the same time not completely screw over two other classes?<br />
<br />
When you  have the answer to that instead of jumping and raving about how warriors are broken, you'd have a case to plead with Verant. Until then, you are just whining whenver something doesn't go their way. The same idiots seem to think as long as they whine, they have an excellent point. Furthermore, as long as they get other idiots to whine with them, they somehow have found an universal truth. That's the story of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Taunt works by giving the taunter the SAME aggro as the current aggro holder, PLUS one, on a succesful taunt.  On a failed taunt, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
What doesn't work:  Monster is pulled (say puller has 20 aggro from hitting it with a shuriken), warrior taunts (getting 21 aggro), bashes (getting 10 more) and attacks for 50,50 (getting 100 more, total 131.  Shaman/Chanter slows (lets say 500 aggro).  Shammy gets pounded on until warrior can get his taunt key reset.<br />
<br />
What does work:<br />
a) Let the warrior attack longer to build aggro before slowing<br />
<br />
b) The warrior should SAVE his taunt, so he can pull aggro off the slower (but they mostly know this).  Puller can FD and mob can be tagged if needed, or puller can keep attack off so warrior's melee gets him aggro (assuming puller can take a few hits)<br />
<br />
c) someone who can afford to take hits casts spells to build aggro, then the warrior taunts aggro off him.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Option C is one of the best ways for a warrior-pally or warrior-SK team to work together.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for War vs knight taunting, warriors taunt skill is higher, but their aggro building at the start of fights is slower or at least less dependable.  knights with their spells have ALWAYS been better than warriors at building aggro quickly.  But, until PoP, noone cared much about that.<br />
<br />
***edit -- I'm not sure: I think warrior's Taunt skill has a higher skill cap than my SK; but if Im wrong, someone can correct me.  That was what I meant about &quot;warriors taunt skill is higher&quot; ***<br />
<br />
I doubt slowers, rogues, or rangers want SK/Pally aggro nerfed...  it's more a question of how to upgrade warriors.<br />
<br />
I personally play a SK;  I don't want warrior taunting to be SO upgraded that they make my aggro abilities (from my spells) into a joke.  But I don't want to see warriors left out in the cold either.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that a balanced fix would mean that taunt might need to be given a little better chance to succeed, and that successful taunt would give some amount of aggro boost, instead of just &quot;max plus one&quot;.<br />
<br />
One advantage knights have is that they can start casting spells when the mob is still incoming, starting with some aggro; whereas a warrior can't do the same at range (sure he can use ranged attacks but they don't add up to the same aggro).<br />
<br />
Basically, if you want to cast slow on the pull, you are going to need some major aggro builders to keep the mob from pounding you.  Root, when possible and it works, helps.  Waiting a bit helps but with PoP-hitting mobs, it's easy to see the incentive to slow as early as you can.<br />
<br />
my advice for now:  invite the warrior AND a SK or pally.  Let the sk/pally pull and let them have starting aggro, and have the warrior taunt the mob off them.  Pally/SK spell aggro can build up fast enough to let you slow quite early (especially if the knight is pulling to have an extra head start on aggro), and the warrior can tank for the majority of the fight.  As long as the plan is know up front, the cleric can be ready to CH the knight at first, and switch to the war as soon as he starts taking dmg.  If it helps you slow earlier, you'll save healing mana and be able to pull faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Here's your aggro fix answer right here...<br />
<br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=2691.topic<br />
<br />
75% of warriors haven't got a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">There is a fine line here that we are all dancing around.  Warriors have the best tools to absorb damage in the game.  If you combine that with making them the best at keeping aggro you will reduce the challenge of the game considerably.  This is why other classes seem to be able to pull aggro from a mob unless they are careful.  Knights need to generate more aggro than Warriors for the same reason every other class needs to generate more aggro than warriors. <br />
<br />
In a situation where the Warrior is the main tank, Knights need to control their aggro like everyone else.  But you gain the advantage of letting the character best suited to absorbing the damage take the punishment.  If a Knight is the main tank, then aggro is less of a concern for the group, but the group has to overcome the Knight's relative weakness in tanking power.<br />
<br />
As a 59 Paladin, I hold aggro fairly easily.  Much more easily than a couple previous Paladins who posted.  It is not uncommon for me to group for three or four hours and have noone else in the group take aggro more than once or twice except on an unexpected add.  However, the cleric has to be a lot sharper on keeping me healed than in the case if a warrior was the MT.  Shaman, Enchanters, and Wizards I group with want a pet Paladin by the end of our session.  Clerics aren't as happy because they have to heal more and the timing of heals is more important.  <br />
<br />
There needs to be a gap in the aggro generating ability between Warriors and Knights.  That gap seems to widen and lessen over time.  Is the gap at an appropriate level now?  I think so.  If I am in a group with a Warrior of the same level and quality of equipment I would expect the Warrior to tank over me.  If I am in a group with a Warrior two levels lower than me, or who's equipment isn't close to mine I would expect to tank over the Warrior.  Almost every group that I have been in would expect the same, except some might want the Warrior to tank anyway even at two levels lower than me.  I regularly group with a Warrior who is two levels higher than me, and who's equipment is nowhere near as good as mine.  No group we have been in has ever suggested I tank over him, and he holds aggro just fine if folks are reasonably careful.<br />
<br />
The fact that the group has to adjust to the lower aggro generating ability of the Warrior does not mean that Warriors can't do their job.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I feel I need to clear something up here.  I know perfectly well that making War the best taunters in the game will render a lot of encounters a lot more trivial.   I was hoping that when I said &quot;Warriors should be the tauntmasters&quot; people would realise I was being a bit tongue in cheek, considering the tone of my post.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's my fault for not making that clearer, I didn't think this would turn into the debate it has.  To set the record straight, Warriors taunt is FAR from good enough.  It doesn't have to be the best, but it does have to be BETTER!<br />
<br />
Everyday my list of examples grows larger.  I was in a group in PoV kill golems, we had a warrior pulling.  I did the standard malo and slow after waiting the appropiate time, but it matterd not, the mobs would agro to me without fail every time.<br />
<br />
Assuming I didn't epic or JBB (heaven forbid should I use bane), I would lose agro after about 5 seconds (unless I got resists, then I'd be looking at more like 10 seconds).  Which isn't too bad, but that meant all I could do was malo/slow, which is dull to say the least.  I mean come on, getting agro using a JBB, that's rediculous.<br />
<br />
Yes using AE is one solution, but why should we forfeit our most powerful and efficient dmg spells because we don't want to have to tank for the entire fight?  Because I did this a few times just to prove it to myself.  The war could only taunt off me for very brief periods.  But as soon as a DoT ticked, mob was back on me.  Other classes don't have to hold back, they just have to cast at the right time, casting a dot when the mob is at half-life just isn't an option for dot casters.<br />
<br />
In short I say again, Warriors don't have to be the best taunters.  But thier taunt DOES need improving.  Personally, I don't see how it would be overpowering to have their taunting on par with Pallys and SKs.   I don't see how it would make Pallys and SKs any less desireable.  I think it would make them (gasp) EQUALLY desireable.<br />
<br />
PS: Yes Drasek, I think it probably was you who was a the Pally bud.  If you saw me doing the same thing with a war and he wasn't losing agro, that was because I was holding back to just malo/slow, like a good gimpor. :)</div></div><hr />

- On our last Emperor run, I was the only shaman on. Until the situation calmed down meaning CC got locked down and whatnot, Blood and CC mobs were all slowed by a Beastlord. On our last MM run, enchanters slowed most of the mobs, they seem to have much more luck with insane MR mobs. Monopoly on raid slowing? My ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either you didn't wait the appropriate amount of time or the above is a rather large exaggeration.  I have spent countless hours in a variety of groups where warriors tank just fine, including POV.  Tashing at 85% followed by slow at 80% and casual nukes at the end has never caused a mob to shift off on me.  No dispute warriors can use some upgrades in the aggro/taunt department, you dont do the argument any good though by making wildly untrue statements though.</div></div><hr />

If every single mob jumped off the tank and onto you when you slowed you were quite obviously slowing to early or to quickly between attempts.  <br />

No I said I tashed, I play an enchanter.  If I can sit in a group with a warrior holding aggro dropping nukes with double stun components/slowing/tashing, I find it very difficult to accept the statement the mobs would agro to me without fail every time.  An enchanter casting tash has no impact on your aggro gain.  If you cast malosini and slow with our without slow the same amount of aggro will be generated by you.<br />

I am a ranger. Here is how I &quot;Fix&quot; warrior taunt.<br />
<br />
When I pull I use a spell called tangling weeds which generates about the same aggro as snare, and slows movement of mobs about 30%. I pull mob to the group and stop near my slower and Ensnare the mob. The slower then tashes/malos and then slows before the mob even gets to camp, and all the aggro is still locked firmly on me.  Next I run around kiting this snared mob while the warrior attempts to taunt. In my experience a 65 warrior will almost always land a taunt on either the first or second try. That is 6 seconds of kiting, and not even very much running if the warrior uses stun kick.  Some times when I pull I keep casting tangling weeds, or through in an Immolate.  This builds a TON of aggy, but I have 6k HP and 1400 AC.  I can take the 6-12 seconds the mob will be beating on me if Slow is resisted and snare is resisted, and the warrior fails 2 taunts in a row.  More importantly I am expendable, the slower, cleric, and tank are not.<br />
<br />
On some occasions my snare is resisted, or slow is resisted. In this situation kite and resnare.  Now this may seem like alot of time wasted that the group could be killing the mob, but I am usually doing it while the group is finishing up the last mob. On a good run I can chain pull for an hour, and drop a snared/slowed/debuffed mob on the warriors head to taunt off right as we get EXP for the last kill.<br />
<br />
Using this strategy in PoV our only healer is often a Shaman or Druid, and they stay FM almost all the time while I chain pull. So we have a AM3 ranger, Warrior, Shaman, and 3 other DPS classes in group. EXP flies...<br />
<br />
Now that I am flagged for BoT, HoH, and CoD I find this strategy works equally well, but we usually bring a cleric along because the mobs hit hella hard and resist alot more.<br />
<br />
The point of all this. Warrior taunt WORKS. You just need to have your hybrid build aggy at the start of the fight for the warrior to TAUNT over. Then your DPS people can go crazy. You can use this same rationale for boss encounters. Chain snare for 15 seconds while weaponshield, followed by AE taunt is a great way to lock aggy on your warriors. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>bluntgone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">if warriors had paladin / sk like taunt there would never be use for knights in exp groups unless no warriors were around. on top of that, any boss mob would be trivialised as you could cast anything and everything and never taunt off the warrior. there must be a downside. my guild always has and always will use warriors as mt, because they are the superior tank. don't even act like you would put paladins / sk in a mt role. unless you are seriously bottomfeeding, doing a trivial mob, you will have a warrior. there must be tradeoffs. knights = less hp, less ac, less dmg, better aggro. warriors, defensive, better ac, better hp, more dmg (unless defensive then slightly less), and you must manage your aggro. honestly i've never had a problem with a warrior tanking, unless that warrior was using crappy gear. when i play my shaman in groups i malo as mob is inc, wait till war hits it once or twice, and this is important, cast slow while standing next to the warrior. don't run around if getting hit. this makes it much easier for the warrior to taunt and hit the mob in order to regain aggro.</div></div><hr />

It's nice to know that the specialist tank needs another class to hold their hand for them to do their one job effectively, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Rhick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Last time I checked you could have 6 characters in group.  I remember a time in Kunark when I was the armpit of EQ, now as a ranger I have some skills I can bring to a group that make me valued.  I am not a tank, but I can help a tank build aggy.<br />
<br />
How is this a bad thing?<br />
<br />
I think there is also a confusion of terms. There is an amount of hate, and there is the skill taunt. Taunt adds NO hate. The only hate a warrior can build comes from their melee damage, and from taunting over others (and Enraging Blow procs). If tanks don't have someone take their aggro so they can Taunt over them they are very slow to build hate. The earlier example of taunt matching hate+1 was kind of misleading.  Have a warrior try to turn a mob off you without attacking.  At higher levels taunt is not sufficient to turn the mob, it is the attack after taunt that actually turn them (unless you back away in which case proximity aggro puts the warrior high enough on the hate list to turn it).<br />
<br />
Warriors that constantly mash their Taunt keys in EXP situations are wasting their taunt unless they are training the skill.  In raid situations the MT should probably mash their Taunt key because anyone that grabs aggro is going to die before the warrior can react anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">What a bunch of BS.<br />
<br />
Warriors are BARELY &quot;better defensive tanks&quot; than Knights.   By barely, I mean... identical AC, slightly better hitpoints, and barely better avoidance skills.    I'm going to take these one at a time because a whole bunch of garbage is showing up on this thread.<br />
<br />
Identical AC:   Yes, it's true, between NToV and Elemental armor, every piece of armor that a warrior can wear, a Paladin can also wear.   There is -0- AC difference until Elemental armors and even then, it's barely noticeable.   <br />
<br />
Slightly better hitpoints.   This one I love because people like to compare raid buffed warriors and raid buffed Paladins and go &quot;Gee whiz, there's a 1000 point difference between them&quot;.   Again it's nonsense in the world of experience grouping.  When a warrior isn't grouped with a Paladin, the Paladin has 750ish hitpoins in exclusive buffs (Brell's+Aura of the Crusader).  The *real* hitpoint difference is approximately ONE hit from a PoP mob.   This also doesn't account for the fact that a Paladin has about 6000 hitpoints hidden in his manabar, and another 6000ish hidden in his lay hands button.<br />
<br />
Barely noticeable avoidance skills:   The difference in avoidance skills accounts for approximately 1.5% difference in damage taken over the course of a night.   (12.5% difference in each avoidance skill, avoidance skills going off approximately 3.5%-6% of the time)  <br />
<br />
This does NOT compensate one iota not a single bit for the drasttic aggro disparity between knights and warriors.   Why?  Simple, each time a warrior loses aggro on a PoP mob, it forces the cleric to cast either Supernal Remedy or Supernal Elixir.   These spells have the EXACT SAME mana cost as complete heal.   So, if a warrior loses aggro ONCE, it costs a Ch worth of mana to compensate for.   A warrior has to be CH'd approximately 11 times to be separated from a Knight in terms of a full complete heal.  <br />
<br />
Knights currently costs SIGNIFICANTLY less mana tanking than warriors simply because of aggro-lock.   I'm not talking an extra Ch worth per 10 CH's to the warrior, I'm talking SERIOUS extra mana.   It's to the point that there is NO WAY, even using defensive that a warrior's extra mitigation can compensate for the mana savings of Knight's aggro-lock.<br />
<br />
Fights also last longer with warriors tanking due to other classes being forced to &quot;hold back&quot; to allow the warrior to maintain aggro.   <br />
<br />
EVEN WITH a warrior &quot;establishing aggro on a pre-slowed mob&quot;, he's STILL a less efficient tank than a knight since the damage output of a non-slowed mob is so much higher.<br />
<br />
But, the thing that amuses me is that knights KNOW all of this, they KNOW that even if warriors were to have an aggro generation upgrade that they'd STILL have no problem finding experience groups EVEN AS TANKS (although they also have a multitude of other skills which would make them valuable to a group in a non-tanking role), because they can tank JUST FINE.   They still choose to raise the flag of panic and doom because they don't want to give up such an enormous advantage that they shouldn't have.</div></div><hr />

Just for your information, the formula for calculating what amount of HP's are restored with LoH is 1hp + 32 x Level. So even a 65 Paladin will only LoH for MAX of 2081 HP's.

This is aside from the fact that you talk about running oom casting aggro spells...  Cease costs FIFTEEN MANA, Desist costs TWENTY FIVE mana.  Stun is 35, Holy Might is 60.   All are extreme aggro spells, and can be chain cast for like an hour without going OOM.   The ONLY thing these don't do is actually *stun* mobs in PoP, they're simply high aggro spells for almost no mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I've never minded knights having superior aggro. They can get it when they want, loose it when they don't. I see that as a class ability that both pal/sk's have. So I don't see a problem with how well they agro now. But as for being a warrior...<br />
<br />
Lets start off by this, I weild a SoD+Ribcracker, not easy to obtain weps. I am geared more twords dps considering I do not MT for my guild. Even tho I'm geared for DPS, this combo has some inane agro attatched to it. Far from EB, mind you, but with the crazy DPS I can do with this along with agro procs, it *should* work well enough in any exp group. <br />
<br />
Guess what, that combo doesn't work. I feel sorry for any warrior with anything less, considering what I have, its hard enough for me to get/keep agro. With this rather pimp combo, a knight/pal can out agro me with spells they got 30 lvl's ago. Again, this I'm all for them being able to do that, but not with such a large gap. With the 51aa I've gotten, all the years I've spent raiding, I should have just a little bit better chance against a knight that than. I am the master of war, I lead you f00s into battle, I shouldn't need the group to hold hand just because of game mechanics. <br />
<br />
I'm more disapointed about the feeling I get when a caster dies due to my agro problems, than I am about knight agro, F them this thread is about warriors. <br />
<br />
Does taunt need to be fixed? Yes, though it seems when many people hear that, they hear something more like: &quot;lets make warriors taunt absolute, better than knights, better than any other taunt in the game&quot;, and you are hearing things. A better chance is all I'm asking for. In an exp group, if a mob leaves me, theres is about a 35-40 percent chance I can get the mob back quick (in less than one round) through taunt and DPS.  I see that as quite low, honestly. At times it can make me look weak, even thought I cannot controll it, thats my real problem.<br />
<br />
On another note, what most haven't thought about... People always bring up knights abilities when they bring up balance issues. Look through this forum here, and find the posts that ask which is the best class to twobox with. Most often its a shaman+knight that is thought to be the best combo. This if often because of utility of the knights. What I want more than anything is more utility as a warrior. I'm not saying as much diversity as a spell book, but more group type abilities that make my class funner to play. On my shaman, I can be seen casting like mad in a flurry of activity, as is with most casters. But my warrior, I hit hotkeys 1-2 when they come up, and 3 (taunt) when applicable. With one hand, I can perform all my functions as a warrior - which is not right. <br />

Over the past few months i've come to a realization.  For a typical xp group, I'd MUCH rather have a pally/sk as MT than a warrior.  For raids obviously a warrior is going to have to tank the big mobs because of /defensive and more hps, but I feel that the warrior class is getting seriously jipped by this lack of taunting ability.  My best friend is a warrior, and I almost hate to group with him as MT because I KNOW that i'm gonna get aggro when I slow.<br />

Something has to be done about this soon, and it blows my mind that the warrior community isn't going ape shi* over this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With warriors you have to let them take a beating before slowing, it's just the way it is. They have the HP to deal with it so change your slow tactics the next time you think the warrior is the problem. If warriors could taunt as well as SKs and pallies then those classes would be much less desirable for grouping.</div></div><hr />

However, taunt has stayed pretty much the same. I notice as a warrior that Im just as likely to lose aggro with a PoP mob as with a froggy in OS. Sure, I can get it back in a couple of secs, but now the caster is getting whaled for a whole lot more in those few seconds. Sad to say that whereas before I could probably group with casters a few levels lower than me, nowadays when it happens more often than not they have a much higher chance of dieing, which I hate.<br />

I shudder to think how hard things are going to be for me when I advance through the PoP tiers.<br />

If every single mob jumped off the tank and onto you when you slowed you were quite obviously slowing to early or to quickly between attempts.  <br />
<br />
Which is just your misinformed speculation.  LIke I said, go and ask the warrior. Put up, or shut up.<br />
<br />
<br />
No I said I tashed, I play an enchanter.  If I can sit in a group with a warrior holding aggro dropping nukes with double stun components/slowing/tashing, I find it very difficult to accept the statement the mobs would agro to me without fail every time.  An enchanter casting tash has no impact on your aggro gain.  If you cast malosini and slow with our without slow the same amount of aggro will be generated by you.<br />
<br />
In other words you're commenting on a situation when you weren't there, and commenting about a class you don't play.  If I'd waited until the mob was at 80%, the tank would either be dead.  Or if we had a cleric that was quick enough to keep him alive, we'd have a lot of downtime.<br />
<br />
<br />
This the mobs would agro to me without fail every time is the dumb comment.  Because either you don't know what you are doing and thus saying warriors are messed up because you cannot manage your aggro, or you are making a gross over statement. <br />
<br />
Considering the overwhelming responce from Wars saying quite plainly that taunt it messed up and that they agree with me, I find it laughable that you are saying they are all wrong and making a gross overstatement.</div></div><hr />

- We're reviewing the tanking ability of the various melee and hybrid classes to be sure each class is competitively balanced with the others. The main factors we're considering are the ability to take damage, deal damage, and the additional abilities of each class. The goal with this review is to find any issues where melee classes are not &quot;bringing enough to the party&quot; when comparing their package of abilities. We're paying particular attention to the avoidance-focused classes such as the monk, to be sure things end up where they should. <br />

That paly tanked the entire fight save for one or two times it faced off on a good proc for the warrior. Now obviously a paladin TRYING to gain agro is different than him just gaining agro but still, a warriors livelyhood is based on his ability to gain and hold agro and in its current form its not very good. Warriors sacrifice DPS and other secondary skills for the ability to tank and maintain agro so its the primary skill of the class and they aren't very good at it currently. Why do you think the raid leader tells the guild to hold off and let the MT gain agro? Cause he wont be able to hold it unless they allow him to build it up in the first place. The fact that they added hate procing weapons should also indicate the broken form of taunt and warriors ability to gain and hold agro.
