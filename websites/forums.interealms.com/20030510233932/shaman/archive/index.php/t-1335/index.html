<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am raiding CoM to kill Neh Ashiir tomorrow, and need some advice, please.  I have searched, but the forum search engine won't accept Neh as a valid search term because it's less than 4 letters long!<br />
<br />
As background, I am the highest shaman in my guild, which is relatively small, and has not done this raid before.  With friends and our allied guilds, I am expecting about 3 groups, which is more than it took us to whack Ghiosk, so I am not concerned about our ability to get the manpower needed.<br />
<br />
I have led raids to CoM before, but usually we end up quitting just after the first hut at the top of the ramp into the sky, because the hut always aggros and we end up with a big big fight and lots of deaths.  Then it respawns whil we are rezzing and rebuffing.<br />
<br />
So, I have a few questions, and would be very glad of any advice:<br />
<br />
1)  Where exactly is Neh, and how do I know which is her reaver?<br />
2)  Where should we fight it - at its spawn point, or do we pull it somewhere else?<br />
3)  How do we get past that hut - do we just steam in and kil everything, or do we try to get someone to pull the mobs somewhere else (like the corner room before the ramp)?<br />
4)  Should I even bother trying to cast on Neh?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />
