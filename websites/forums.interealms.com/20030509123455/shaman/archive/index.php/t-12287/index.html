<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.  Me and my friends have a thing we do kind of like the T.V. show &quot;Jackass&quot;.  We have a camera that we use to film our stuff, but we don't have THAT much money to spend on props and other various items to use.  <br />
<br />
We are running short of ideas, and would like to have some more of em.  If anybody has any idea that other people would think would be funny to watch (Something like jackass, Involves getting hurt etc..) please post them here, or E-mail them to Ooker_Berkowitz@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
GL on EQ everyone, be safe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That kind of crap is just plain dumb and stupid. No humour in it what so ever for me.<br />
<br />
Then again, if you're stupid enough to try that kind of crap and end up dying...well...all the better for thinning out the gene pool. Knock yourself out, literally. :)</div></div><hr />
