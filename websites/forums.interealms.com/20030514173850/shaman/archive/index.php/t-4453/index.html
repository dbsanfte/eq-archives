I curious what you mean about multiple installs?    If you mean running a few differant charactors - either will handle that for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kraum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">was referring to multiple systems.. ie. can i load os on 2nd comp.. biggest factor for me is stable running with EQ so looks like win Xp pro is in the lead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bolth can have multi systems  ie  win98 and XP or win2k<br />
<br />
win2k is far better IMHO  XP is not supposrted well by MS and i find it just nto a well rounded OS . its like .. PC for mac users heh . just a lil pretty and attempts to be more friendly but ends up tripping over its own feet.  they will BOTH run EQ just fine .  and to be honest win2k has a deeper driver base then XP . years of tweaking to get it right.  <br />
<br />
you know what i htink of XP ? XP is great once you tweak it out to run like win2k . thats getting all the tweaks from www.teakxp.org ;)<br />
<br />
my 2cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I realize win2k wasn't on your orginal list of choices, but it is a far superior choice when it comes to EQ.<br />
<br />
XP is a lot more sensitive to lag spikes than win2k is.  You put a win2k box next to a xp box and the win2k box will perform better, and go linkdead a LOT less often.</div></div><hr />

this is also true actualy. i know this for fact cause i have this setup at ym house with my GF adn mine . she has XP i have win2k .XP is just more reasource intensive cause of all the backround programs and services . like i said , once you learn how to tweak it down its not bad . but when you tweak it down your basicly running win2k  *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

All versions of windows are licensed for only one computer. why do you think they added the activation for it. you are able to make up to 5 changes in the configuration. or 3 if you add a network card.<br />

Yes, it is true you will get a couple hundred more points from 3dmark on 2k over xp, but both are very stable.  I think XP has much better support for directx-based software so I would take that over 2k.  2k really wasn't desinged to run games at all.<br />
<br />
I have yet to play with tweaking xp much, simply because of time.  Once you disable all the backgroud crap like ms messenger and cd burning it should run faster.<br />
<br />
My main system though sticks to 98SE.  I still like that over any other o/s simply because when it does break, it is the easist to fix.   That, and my capture card does not have drivers for any other o/s :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The people bashing XP are just looking for something to complain about.<br />
<br />
XP Pro works just fine and in my opinion is even more stable than Win2K is. More LD prone than 2k? Sorry, thats just blatant misinformation. I would bet that it is your ISP causing that, or your hardware... it is not the OS.<br />
<br />
WindowsXP not supported? Uh... yeah... sure... Windows XP is supported just fine.<br />
<br />
Windows XP is my preference. It is much more configurable, much more user friendly, and much easier to get help from others on when help is needed.<br />
<br />
For those who like to get their systems tweaked, you can have a friend or someone your trust do it for you using the built in Remote Desktop.<br />
<br />
I have tweaked roughly 15 peoples systems without even needing to be in their home.</div></div><hr />

Windows XP works just fine assuming you are using decent hardware components for the system. Don't let others convince you otherwise.<br />
<br />
XP is worth using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo, and put a win2k system next to you and watch the difference.  The XP system is much more sensitive.  Don't take my word for it, try it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A Win XP box for main playing, and my older Win 2000 server for when I'm 2 boxing.<br />
<br />
I notice NO difference in LDs or any other glitches while playing both.  In fact, the XP box is significantly more responsive (it is twice as fast though, so thats probably why).<br />
<br />
XP does not cause warts, it does not cause permenant hair loss (once the install is complete that is), nor does it cause global warming.  Works fine for me and EQ.</div></div><hr />

Heh... hate to burst your bubble, but when a router goes down or your ISP has problems, or your Everquest server has a problem, Windows 2000 and Windows XP will both have the same issues.<br />
<br />
Of course, I have tweaked my system for broadband use, and I did the same thing under Windows 2000.<br />
<br />
If you haven't adjusted your system for broadband use you will go LD more, I will agree with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
XP&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;W2K<br />
<br />
For me, it is *far* more stable. W2K always crashed, and I used it on several different systems. XP never crashes, and the only time I go LD is if my ISP drops.<br />
<br />
Now, my point here is not to bash W2K (even though I hate it) but to make the point that people will get varying results with different OS's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on the problem.  It may be that you have never seen your system recover from a lag spike (since you don't run win2k :P).  I agree that if the connection is permanently gone you will have the same results.  And I would agree that there are probably things that can be tweaked to make xp run better (Tweaking that win2k doesn't need BTW).  If a user is looking for an OS that is going to run better EQ out of the box with fewer connectivity issues and better performance, win2k is their best bet.</div></div><hr />

It is a little more resource intensive than w2k is all. I run with 512meg ram and athlong xp1800 for reference. I  run w2k often on my laptop at the same time and both systems pretty much exhibit the same issues with lag. Performance is a none issue for both though I turn off models on the laptop.<br />
<br />
Either should work just fine for you.</div></div><hr />

Wrong here... the tweaks for Windows XP are essentially the same as for Windows 2000. Windows XP is basically an updated version of Windows 2000, which is based on NT technology.<br />
<br />
I used Windows 2000 before I changed to Windows XP. I used the same tweaks on both. There are a few additional tweaks you can do with Windows XP that Windows 2000 didn't have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You running xp side by side with win2k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Gee ... this is getting way over thought.    If someone was truly looking for a whacked out EQ machine ... they would built it themselves tweaked out to the max with the latest and greatest.  Heck - I've been debating with myself on trying out a tricked out Linux machine with MS emulator as a pure gamer for preformance.   Anybody out there that's tried it  ... post away on results.    <br />
<br />
IMHO ... spend your money on Ram and Video card first.   That's the biggest bang for your buck.    If you have the cash to upgrade Ram, Video Card, AND OS ... then you have the free cash to stop worrying about what OS to upgrade ... and go get a better PC with everything above AND with whatever OS you want as a aside.   <br />
<br />
Btw ... there are TON'S of sites that offer free programs on tweaking out OS's along with fiddling with Video card settings.    Something like Cacheman from outertech.com is a simple freeware tool that offers simple step by step wizards for solving some of Microsoft's gapping resource issues.   Video cards are in the same boat ... just figure out what you have and do a google search ... you will get all the hit's you can handle.<br />
<br />
And as to why use XP?    Because for many XP offers the following advantages ... auto sensing features for networking, MS focus on OS upgrades (95 is gone with 98SE coming in the near future as a supported platform), and current OEM software/driver upgrades.   It's what's being sold to the Masses as the OS option on new PC's.   Sorry to say ... but Microsoft drives the bus on what OS to use other than Opensource.    In time, DirectX 10 (or latter) will push everyone off 98SE just like it did for 95.<br />

<br />
No offense, but there isn't one reason there worth anything.  :)<br />
<br />
Network autosensing and &quot;Microsoft wants you to&quot; don't exactly make a compelling case.  I haven't found a piece of non-supported hardware yet (not saying there aren't any- just none that I've wanted), and frankly the licensing scheme around XP bothers me with it's intrusiveness.  Yup, at some point Microsoft will kick me off (likely through DirectX- it bugs me that MS came out on top of the DirectX/OpenGL/Glide battle for precisely this reason) but until then I'll go with light and fast over pretty and &quot;user friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
One more tidbit (from my CS days before I turned into a management wonk,) emulators- software emulators I mean - generally are not something you equate with high performance.  I believe you'd attain comparable performance only if your OS provided a staggeringly faster foundation- and while compiled-for-your-hardware OS's certainly can provide an advantage, commercial OS's (with the help of oligopolies in the hardware world- thx minimal configurations) in the past five years have been getting progressively better about minimizing those differences.  :)<br />
<br />

Sure, you go ahead with your nothing tweaks on Windows 2000. Give me a system with your exact specs and I can guarantee you that I will have a much more reliable machine by tweaking it...<br />
<br />
Just as if someone had a WindowsXP with no tweaks and I had a Windows XP with tweaks, my system would be more reliable.<br />
<br />
Go ahead, be happy with mediocrity.<br />
<br />
Someone sell this guy the proverbial clue-by-four.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Bigguss ... no offense take ...  I certainly don't want to debate the merits of MS ... UGH.    I'm onboard with your thoughts but that doesn't help the common user.   My comments were based on the fact that most users don't have a clue other than to turn something on and install a piece of code.    <br />
<br />
Taking responsiblity away from a techie person could be a bad thing ... taking the keyboard away from a novice user normally is a blessing for all involved.  That's why Mac's appeal to some people and they have been autosensing networking for years.  We may honestly have issues with MS on their practices ... but the reality factor means JoeUser out there rides on the MS bus.   95 is gone ... 98 will be soon ... 2000 is next on MS radar screen.  <br />
<br />
Yes I know that emulating MS via some Linux kernal most likely would not gain anything ... but I'm still hoping that someday there's a way to get around the MS lock on gaming.   I was dreaming on that one.   But maybe Verant will expose something when they port EQ to Mac ... wishing here.<br />
<br />
And the whole issue about &quot;compiled for your hardware&quot; ... go check out the wildly growing rage for network appliances.    FW's, Mail servers, Disk farms, Web servers, etc ... there are companies that are pecking at the edges of the MS world.   Time will tell if &quot;compiled for your hardware&quot; wins marketshare or goes the way of the hype like the &quot;Thin/fat client&quot; thing from a few years ago.</div></div><hr />

If you want the absolute best EQ performance, then you need to be running 98SE, but if you have more than 512mb of ram then you need to be running XP.  2k is fine, there is nothing wrong with it, but XP and 98SE run EQ faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">&lt;B&gt;Windows XP Minimum Requirements: &lt;/B&gt;<br />
<br />
PC with 300 megahertz (MHz) or higher processor clock speed recommended; 233-MHz minimum required;* Intel Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible processor recommended <br />
128 megabytes (MB) of RAM or higher recommended (64 MB minimum supported; may limit performance and some features) <br />
1.5 gigabyte (GB) of available hard disk space.*<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Windows 2000 Minimum Requirements&lt;/B&gt;<br />
<br />
Computer/Processor 133 MHz or higher Pentium-compatible CPU <br />
Memory 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum; more memory generally improves responsiveness <br />
Hard Disk 2GB hard disk with a minimum of 650MB of free space <br />
<br />
<br />
This is from microsoft.com.  Notice the processor requirements.  In addition to that comparision I've run windows xp on a 300 MHZ machine and it CRAWLED doing basic functions.  Windows 2000 performed considerably better.  A while back I was in fact doing benchmarks between windows 2000 and windows xp at the time because I was evaluating the performance difference for some custom 300 mhz embedded machines.<br />
<br />
Considering the trend for ALL software to become more and more of a resource hog over time it is a pretty logical extension that XP would take up more resources (leaving less for EQ) than win2k does.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not gonna waste time benchmarking an OS that I no longer have installed :P</div></div><hr />

You know Nazgruul, I ran win98 (something or another, not SE I don't think) for a good long time, until I started having problems with task switching between two sessions of EQ.  There may have been a way to fix that, but I noticed that my win2k box task switched without a problem so I upgraded.<br />
<br />
But yeah, if I ran single sessions EQ all the time I'd probably still be running win98. <br />
<br />
all gandalfh is knowledgeable about is how to twist other peoples words to suit his weak arguments. Finding a reading comprehension tutor might do you some good too :)<br />
<br />
For starters... Windows2k and WindowsXP both benefit from tweaking the registry for broadband use. But gandalfh doesn't appear to realize this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Oh Aruman, just screwing with you.  It is quite obvious that you are convinced that xp is superior to win2k.  It is equally obvious that you haven't a shred of proof beyond &quot;Ir said so and ir leet.&quot;<br />
<br />
So take Colal's advice plzkkthx :D</div></div><hr />

I never said XP was superior, I said that XP can be tweaked to perform better.<br />
<br />
I also said that Win2k can be tweaked to perform better.<br />
<br />
You however seem to think that tweaking the system isn't worth the effort.<br />
<br />
I upgraded to XP for the additional features, the main one being Remote Desktop... I can help others with their problems without leaving home.<br />
<br />
I suppose we can agree to disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">You said &quot;XP Pro works just fine and in my opinion is even more stable than Win2K is&quot;<br />
<br />
And now you say &quot;I never said XP was superior, I said that XP can be tweaked to perform better. &quot;<br />
<br />
Whatever :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because XP is more stable makes it superior? Wake up.<br />
<br />
XP *IS* more stable, but that alone does not mean much since Win2K is pretty damn stable in itself.<br />
<br />
Linux is more stable than Win2k or WinXP, but that doesn't mean it is superior to XP or 2000.<br />
<br />
Get a clue you damn twit.<br />
<br />
I won;t be replying to your moron ass anymore.</div></div><hr />
