<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vomite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit the point where my current xp solo spots was light bluing, greening out, do you think it would be possible for me to solo the cougars in IC without too much trouble?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What level are you? I started doing cougars at around 33 and took them to around 35 when I just couldn't stand the sight of another one, even though they were still giving ok experience. If you pick the lower level ones I'd say they should be quite doable from 31 or mabe even a bit lower. They are prety nice to work mele skills on ( I was tanking them with Totemic and weapons like a Drakel Sledge/ Beetle Stinger and had no problem keeping mele skills and defense maxed each level.) They didn't seem to have very high resists and everything stuck nicely ( root, slow, poison, disease, cold nukes....) The earrings make nice gifts to lower level casters since they have mana conservation 1 and nice AC on them.  Oh, bring plenty of water and food with ya' the gnomes are pirates even to their friends. :) That's all I can think of for now, good huntin'.</div></div><hr />
