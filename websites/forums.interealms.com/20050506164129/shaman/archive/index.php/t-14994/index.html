<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone helped with a rogue epic and know how tough this gal is? We'd like to take it down duo 61 sham / 56 warrior. We can add a friend or 2 but like the challenge :)<br />
<br />
I hear the pull is half the trouble as she's a chanter hanging in a shack with her buddies and they don't harmo very well. <br />
<br />
Any experience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sadly yes. (61 Monk)<br />
<br />
I've pulled this mess some 3 different times.  Tell your FD puller to be ready to die - a lot. You will need to use geography to split these mofo's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try and get them during the day as nightime adds are a pain in the butt.  The sequence I was never able to perfect. It is random and luck of the draw which one you get. (solo).<br />
<br />
61 Shaman and 56 Warrior? You might as well hotkey /consent. Cuz your a55 is gonna be deader than fried chicken.<br />
<br />
I pulled straight out of the hut. ONCE I got a solo, I ran to where the groupS were and let them beat the crap out of them.  They will reset aggro once they return to the house. <br />
<br />
Again, to reiterate, pull straight out and let geography split them.  Take whichever one you can solo. This may include a zombie or one of the lesser minions. (It's been 6 months).<br />
<br />
With only 2 or 4 people you are going to have problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best way i've seen it done is with a chanter pulling...   The chanter pulls with mez or root and kites while someone else gets the one sticking around.  Chanter keeps mez'ing or rooting a mob when needed and before ya know it, you're down to the last one.  <br />
<br />
Guess it could work with any root class, but have to have high magic resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If that guy is the one in the shack in Kithicor, man I hate that bastage lol, I WILL go back one day and kick his arse. On my way to highkeep for the first time, in the 40s I guess, (it was night time, like a moron I didn't know you couldn't take 2 steps without tripping over about 3 highly aggressive zombies), so I'm running all over the place and got a little lost, and accidently got a bit too close to the shack. I really wasn't that close, I could barely make out that it even was a building, then all of a sudden like 6 people start running after me. I guess they were sowed I couldn't outrun them, and I died in like 3 seconds haha. Just thought I'd share a stupid noob moment since that name brings back such wonderful memories :)</div></div><hr />

Man it's been awhile, but did you mean Rivervale, West Commons or Highpass?<br />
<br />
I also thought they were at SoW speed? (Or SoW + enough to catch you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nevvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Biggest change to these guys is aggro range..  Harmony made this encounter trivial, but now the aggro range makes it......... not so trivial.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd suggest getting a rock solid group together including a good puller, evac'er, and balanced rest of the party.  Your combo may be able to fight just her if you got just her.. but getting there is half the fun.<br />
<br />
Our guild was doing this a ton back before the aggro range change, and got extremely overconfident..  Next thing we knew, tried pulling and wiped.  Not because we weren't tough enough, but because we were completely expecting something different.<br />
<br />
And this was an entire GUILD!<br />
<br />
Note-  Small guild, yes.  Small unsuspecting guild, yes.  Guild that next time was prepared and didn't suffer a single death, yes.  ;)</div></div><hr />
