<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When Luclin came out, those who tested the new potions reported that Mystical Aptitude increases mana regen by 4 points per tick.  But now, according to Taxero's post most of the way down the page in this thread (http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm68.showMessage?topicID=26.topic), the spdat shows that the Mystical Aptitude potion actually &quot;Increase Effective Casting Level by 3&quot;.<br />
<br />
First, I need people who are wise in the ways of the spdat to tell me if it's possible that this is a red herring in the spdat and might not be reflective of the actual effect.  I know VI has started getting sneaky to try and keep us from using the spdat to figure stuff out.<br />
<br />
Second, I need people to confirm for me FIRST HAND that they have tested Mystical Aptitude and are absolutely and completely certain that it is 4 points of mana regen per tick.  I don't want to hear from you on this point unless you drank the potion yourself and very carefully timed your regular mana regen versus mana regen with the potion to conclude without a doubt that it has a mana regen effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Disclaimer:  I'm not an expert at the spdat, but this is what I've been able to discover...but I haven't tested ANY of this in the game. <br />
<br />
Bottom Line up front:<br />
<br />
The *effect* Concentration increases Mana by 2 per tick.<br />
<br />
The *effect* Greater Concentration increases Mana by 3 per tick.<br />
<br />
The *effect* Mystical Infusion adds 50 mana to your mana pool.<br />
<br />
The *effect* Greater Mystical Infusion adds 100 mana to your mana pool.<br />
<br />
The *effect* Mystical Aptitude apparently does the same thing as the 12th level  Enchanter spell &quot;Intellectual Advancement&quot;, increasing your casting skill by 3.  It does NOT increase mana by 4 per tick.<br />
<br />
I've highlighted *effect* since we can't be sure that when we drink a potion it is actually causing the effect of the same name...it would be possible that Verant is trying to mislead us, by using dummy entries in the Spdat.  But I doubt it. <br />
<br />
Discussion:<br />
<br />
First, the entry for Mystical Aptitude is COMPLETELY different than the entries for Concentration and Greater Concentration.  So chances of it givin back 4 mana per tick are slim-to-none.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about &quot;Mystical Aptitude&quot; and the Enchanter spell &quot;Intellectual Advancement&quot;.<br />
<br />
Both have some of the same statistics:<br />
<br />
Category: clarity<br />
Attrib : 70<br />
Base : 3<br />
<br />
The only spells that have '70' as the first attribute are:<br />
Intellectual Advancement (Base1 is 3) <br />
Intellectual Superiority (Base1 is 6)<br />
<br />
The *effects* Mystical Aptitude and Focused Mind both have 70 as an attrib, Focused Mind has a Base of 2, Mystical Aptitude has a base of 3.<br />
<br />
My guess is that 70 is the code for fizzle rate (or possible effective level of caster) and thus it's modified by 3.<br />
<br />
Side note:  The Dragon effect Feeblemind gives you a negative 200 to Attribute 70...so I doubt that '70' is effective level.<br />
<br />
I suspect enchanters will be able to tell us more.<br />
Edit:  In the newest version of the spdat viewer, 70 is mapped to Casting Skill.  But we still aren't sure what 'casting skill' actually is.<br />
<br />
Concentration and Greater Concentration:<br />
<br />
in the Spdat is a field for &quot;Description&quot;, and then several fields for Attributes, Equations, Max Level, etc...basically all the real values that get the job done.<br />
<br />
Mystical Infusion, Greater Mystical Infusion, Mystical Aptitude are all missing descriptions.  Thats part of the reason it's so hard to figure out what they do.  However, there are values in many of the columns, and some are pretty obvious. Ex:<br />
<br />
Attribute4 = Total Mana<br />
Base4 = 100<br />
<br />
Its a pretty good guess that the effect is to increase your total mana by 100 (that was Greater Mystical Infusion, btw).<br />
<br />
Edit:  Descriptions are now available, no changes from what we already knew, however. <br />
<br />
<br />
Concentration and Greater Concentration both have Descriptions:<br />
&quot;Increase Mana by 3 (L1)&quot; , but the 'real' values are missing...If you compare Concentration with Flowing Thought 2 you can see what I mean.  Both have the same description:<br />
&quot;Increase Mana by 2&quot; but Flowing Thought 2 has the following values:<br />
Attribute2 = Mana<br />
Base2 = 2<br />
<br />
Clarity  has the same entries:<br />
Attribute2 = Mana<br />
Base2 = 1<br />
Max2 = 7<br />
Calc2 = Min + level / 8<br />
<br />
Concentration has no values for Mana at all...It doesn't appear to do anything!  The more I ponder, the more I think that it is a dummy entry in the spdat, and the when you drink the potion you are getting some other entry in the spdat.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I guess I should have used the newer version of eqcaster (the spdat viewer)...Concentration does have values for Mana, they are just buried way at the end.<br />
<br />
Attribute7 = Mana<br />
Base7 = 2<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I should have downloaded the newer version of the spdat viewer first, and saved a lot of time.  Aplogies to everyone who was forced to read through my ramblings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mystipul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the rambling.. Ididn't understand all of it since i don't have the spdat.. but it made a world of sence and now i can go back and say..SEE. it doesn't do 6per tick.. :P hehehe.. but the info is a great help and thankyou for posting it... <br />
<br />
also. note. 100+ mana is a great help for those mana burn wizards:)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bit more of information, regarding Mystical Aptitude:<br />
<br />
It does the same thing as Intellectual advancement, and this is what Verant had to say at a recent panel:<br />
<br />
What does Intellectual Advancement and Superiority do?<br />
<br />
They decrease the fizzle rate on spells cast. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you very much Snapdragn!!!  I'm sorry it took me so long to get to it, I got sidetracked by preparations for yesterday's patch.  I've got this change noted to apply to the EQ Traders Alchemy Recipes (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm) tonight.  That makes a lot more sense, given the names of the potions.<br />
<br />
Just one question...above you list effects for Mystical Aptitude, Elixir of Concentration, Greater Elixir of Concentration, Mystical Infusion, and Greater Mystical Infusion...but I know of no potion called &quot;Mystical Infusion&quot;, only the Greater version and the others named.  Is it an effect listed in the spdat that is maybe in use on some other item or for future use, or is there a potion by that name that I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is an entry in the spdat.  I don't know of any potions (or any other items) that can generate the effect.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the effect is so minor (barely more than 2 Canni's) that they wisely decided to just implement the 'Greater' version.<br />
<br />
Now if we can just determine how beneficial the effects of Mystical Aptitude/Intellectual Advancement are.<br />
<br />
Possible Hypotheses:<br />
1) the '3' is applied to the base fizzle rate...so a 25 base fizzle becomes a 28 (I believe a higher base is better).  <br />
<br />
2) the '3' is applied to the caster's level for calculating fizzle rates...a 60 shaman casts at lvl 63 (with possible side effects of lower resists, increased damage, etc!)  this should be easy to test with a DD spell.<br />
<br />
I suspect #1 is pretty close to the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">or<br />
<br />
3) the'3' is added to whatever skill the spell uses, for example your abjuration of 200 becomes 203.</div></div><hr />
