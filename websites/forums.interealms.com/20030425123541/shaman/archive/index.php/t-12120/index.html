<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I picked up a flask the other day and was wondering if anyone has tried to MQ the Stoicism quest yet.  It seems like a pretty straight forward MQ if the flotsam and jetsam bits are looted by another player, but I have not had time to give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't done it but I'm about 99% sure you can MQ it that way.  Just turn in the bottle, let the shaman who needs the spell loot the pieces of flotsam and jetsam then have them turn the pieces in to the spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As long as you're a shaman (duh) you can MQ it all the way to half of the float / jet stam parts if you so wish. Found out the hard way a non-shaman can't mq :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lots of LoY quests use silent character flags, maybe all of them. If you don't get that silent flag for turning in the bottle, it might not accept your turn-ins of flotsam and jetsam pieces. I would not bet on MQability unless someone has actually done it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>scoobz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I attempted this quest last night straight up no MQ.  Took me 4 hrs to get the bottle and when i turned it in to the spirit he gave me back the rock, when i turned in the rock he ate it and did not spawn the 2 mobs.  Anyone know if this quest is bugged?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why would you MQ it? Its not like its particularly hard to do it?</div></div><hr />

I MQ'd this for my guild leader, who is a 59 shammy.  He hasn't been to LOY all that much, and as he organises a lot of stuff for our guild and tends to be pretty busy it was easier for me to go and get a second flask.<br />
<br />
I handed the flask in to the spirit, and got the rock back.  He summoned a pet, then I handed the rock in.  Flotsam and Jetsam spawned, we killed one each and he looted both pieces.  His hand in to the spirit went fine, and he now has his copy of Stoicism :)<br />
<br />
Edit: One thing to make sure of.. don't hand in any of the items to your pet by accident!  I did this when I was doing my own copy of Stoicism.  Real frustrating after spending hours waiting for the flask to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, granted it is a pretty easy quest, but I was hoping to help a friend or some other person who needs the spell.  There have been a few peeps I talked with that had camped the flask for a couple days before getting it and sparing someone a camp is good no? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seems several people have done the same, handed the rock to dogdog. I for one did it also.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I too have the same sob story... the dog ate my quest item.<br />
<br />
Before that, I turned in the bottle while the quest was broken.<br />
<br />
Yet, Stoicism was worth camping 3 bottles for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I MQ'd the flask for a 42 Shaman, so he could have the spell when he got to the level... Turned in the flask, got the rock, turned in the rock, killed the guys, he looted and got the spell.<br />

 MQ Works.</div></div><hr />
