  I know a lot of people troll here and have come up with some nice ideas, but don't have the patience nor time to drege them all up and repost the good ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its good they are being receptive to ideas, the only criticism is any idea we come up perhaps won't really be good as what a developer could come up with, ie they know the potential of their programming and what the new expansion will entail.<br />

Priest Archtype AA:<br />
<br />
Double Attack - 12 AA's (1)<br />
<br />
All Class <br />
<br />
Track - 50 AA's (2)<br />
Feign Death - 50 AA's (2)<br />
<br />
Tinker - 25 AA's (3)<br />
Alchemy - 25 AA's (3)<br />
Make Poison - 25 AA's (3)<br />
<br />
Improve Tradeskill Mastery - 2 AA's (4) (For every 2 AA's you can raise your maximum in a particular tradeskill 5 points beyond 250. Must be 250 (or 200 for Fishing, Alchemy etc) in that skill to use this AA)<br />
<br />
Druid / Wizard Class <br />
<br />
Use OTHER Portal - 6 AA's (5)<br />
<br />
Preface: I don't think you can balance the game with AA's. DAOC tried that and it FUBARED PvP. AA's are a nice bennie and an inducement to keep playing. (And paying)<br />
<br />
(1) I think this helps the Clerics as much as us, and who cares about Dr00ds anyway :). But it is a nice bone and for the Shaman reinforces our &quot;Battle Priest&quot; iimage.  Certainly Clerics won't be replacing Paladins in groups<br />
<br />
(2) My point here is - if you REALLY want to learn how to do something, you pay the AA's. Sony has already shown they will put in some costly AA's (Mez mastery) so why not go the whole route?<br />
<br />
(3) Maybe we would have had more support long ago for our Alchemy travails if it had been more accessible. /e shrugs. However, if somebody wants to spend time in the frozen tundra or swamp learning how to be a fantasy chemist - more power to ya.<br />
<br />
(4) I've seen trivials of over 300. C'mon. Heck, you could link this and NEW tradeskill trophies.<br />
<br />
(5) This would allow Druids and Wizards to port to zones that the other class currently can, but the second one cannot. So for example, Wizards could now port to Iceclad and Lava Storm and Druids could port to Nektulos forest. <br />
<br />
I know some people may say you can't take a &quot;Class defining skill&quot; and give it to another class. Having seen spells pimped like a two dollar whore I would ask &quot;Based on what precedent?&quot; <br />
<br />
Would a handful of people become &quot;Uber&quot; toons able to track, feign, with ALL tradeskills at 350?<br />
<br />
Sure. <br />
<br />
Would that SERIOUSLY unbalance the game? Not in the least. <br />
<br />
And frankly, I'd rather see AA's spread across the board, rather than spells. Besides - if you've been playing this game for 5 years - you SHOULD be a walking, talking fire-breathing (hey.....) kicker of ass.</div></div><hr />

SO terribly off-base here !  If you have been playing the game for 3, 4 or even 5 years YES you should be able to aquire special abilities IMHOP. Unluckily there is no real way to judge who those people are, many accounts have been sold or traded and alot of the currently more &quot;powerful&quot; toons are simply those who have boat loads of time or community accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think I better explain what I mean, like for example, aas like radiant cure, rabid bear, cann5. I reckon at the time, people wouldn't have been able to come up with ideas like this. I guess I am thinking that they more likely have a &quot;vision&quot;. When people suggest ideas, they are more likely to be of the nature of not radically altering a gameplay but only as far as enhancing. In a way, I think radically altering a gameplay and providing something not expected is what people go ooh about and want to earn. I dunno just my perspective, I am aware SoE developers are clueless a lot of the time, but in a way they hold arguably the best stance for both innovating and developing for a class. So, sure it will be nice that some ideas are taken on board as enhancements but it would be nice for some &quot;outside the box&quot; thinking which a developer is idealistically meant to hold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somebody should look up the best ideas posted on these boards and slap them on the EQlive boards while giving credit to the original poster.<br />
<br />
I remember the &quot;Spirit Shifting&quot; AA proposed by VeeshanMurtak that I liked a lot. It would transfer up to 40% of the Shaman's health to the target. The cast time was 0.5 seconds and the reuse 1 minute if I remember correctly.<br />

I LOVE it - but you forgot foraging.  And track, foraging, tinker, alchemy and make poison should all cost the same (well, maybe less for track and forage since multiple classes and races have 'em).<br />

Don't see a problem here but it does not look useful at all to me. <br />
<br />
Track - 50 AA's (2)<br />
Feign Death - 50 AA's (2)<br />
Apart from having to lift the maximum number of AAs you can save up to 50 - Track I might be able to see. Barely. And rangers should get something in the way of track upgrades noone else can get.<br />
Feign Death I do not think anyone but the few classes who currently have it should get. I can already see entire raids feign, raid encounters being built around it, guilds requiring it for their cleric applicants and so on.<br />
<br />
Tinker - 25 AA's (3)<br />

Looks good to me. Add forage too.<br />

I am pretty sure the 250 cap is legacy code deeply buried into the system. If they could feasibly raise skill caps they would have done so long ago. One could possibly code around this though, add a new &quot;advanced smithing&quot; skill or something like that.<br />
<br />
Use OTHER Portal - 6 AA's (5)<br />
Looks good. No clue if that is codeable though. It would be nice as a quest though, where you receive, as a wizard, a nodrop wizard scroll of lavastorm portal.<br />
<br />
Preface: I don't think you can balance the game with AA's. DAOC tried that and it FUBARED PvP. AA's are a nice bennie and an inducement to keep playing. (And paying)<br />
I disagree. A lot of the AAs out there are very powerful and easily the equivalent of more levels.<br />
<br />
I know some people may say you can't take a &quot;Class defining skill&quot; and give it to another class. Having seen spells pimped like a two dollar whore I would ask &quot;Based on what precedent?&quot; <br />
I would not say &quot;cannot&quot;. I would say &quot;should not&quot;. I have no issue with giving away alchemy or invis or ports or the likes. But game altering abilities like feign death should not be available unless the classes that get these abilities get similar abilities in return and maybe not even then. It sets a dangerous precedent - two expansions from now we might have slow, feign, rez, complete heal and mez as purchaseable abilities.<br />
<br />
Would a handful of people become &quot;Uber&quot; toons able to track, feign, with ALL tradeskills at 350?<br />
<br />
Sure. <br />
<br />
Would that SERIOUSLY unbalance the game? Not in the least. <br />
Feign death alone is capable of completely changing the way 90% of all encounters work. Do you wish for every new zone to be a series of rooms with doors that do not open until all MOBs in the current room are dead? Because that is the only way to keep you from skipping the entire zone when everyone has FD (or even a couple clerics).<br />
<br />
And frankly, I'd rather see AA's spread across the board, rather than spells. Besides - if you've been playing this game for 5 years - you SHOULD be a walking, talking fire-breathing (hey.....) kicker of ass.<br />
Have you been back to previous content lately? When I go back to tier 1 or the likes to help a friend it is amazing what I can do. 4 MOBs incoming - park one on incoming, sneeze one, click slow, nihil other. End result, 2 parked MOBs, 2 slowed MOBs, none of them took a swing yet. That is the result of spells and AAs.<br />
<br />
Dodger (Homage to  Fallout  ) - 1 AA. Each level of Dodger allows you to raise your Dodge skill (Capped at 75) by 5. Dev's could pick max.<br />

Will never happen.  With the increase in leashed mobs in several GoD expeditions FD has become less useful in terms of splitting things.  Have one chase you to a certain point and then get the others to go past their leash and warp.  In terms of evading death, SoW or a fast mount will help you do that better.<br />

Master of Everquest - 30 AA<br />
<br />
It's a hotkeyable AA that, when clicked, will kill everything in the zone instantly and put all their loot into your inventory and remove no drop tags.  Reuse time of 30 minutes.  Mobs in all zones will have a 30-second respawn time to compensate.<br />
<br />
This way we don't have to hear about guilds whining about attrition, players whining about balance, people whining about not being able to obtain good gear in the low-end game.  This AA will solve it all.  Everyone will have everything they want without needing to work for it.  Guilds won't have to think and improvise on raid encounters.  Solo players won't have to spend hours grinding xp for levels and AA.  It will remove all the reliance on grouping with other classes to achieve goals.<br />
<br />
In a subsequent expansion there will be a level 2 of this AA that, when activated, will return all money you've spent on subscription fees and expansions to your bank account.  It will also delete all your characters and close your account.</div></div><hr />

If they ask for input, they get roasted because &quot;they should be paying developers to do that&quot;.<br />

If they don't ask for input, &quot;they don't care what we think&quot;.<br />
<br />
.../boggle<br />
<br />
As for my AA, I would like to see a form of rez for shaman (hear me out, hear me out).  This is based on a battle rez implemented in City of Heroes.  Here's how it would work.<br />
<br />
Shaman casts &quot;Spirit Resurrection&quot; on a corpse.  The player gets a yes/no confirmation box as usual.  Player clicks yes and is summoned to the corpse as usual.<br />
<br />
No XP is returned by the spirit rez, but the corpse's rezzability remains intact,  i.e. the player can still receive a cleric rez at some point and get XP back.  This is a key difference.  Spirit rez is not a true rez, the player must still get a real rez.<br />

Player is rezzed at some percentage of full health and mana (have to do some thinking on the mana issue).  The percentage could be the differentiator between the various spells in the line, if they choose to add lower-level versions of this.<br />
<br />
The player has a different rez effect than normal, called &quot;Spirit Rot&quot;.  Effect is a splurt-type DOT doing n points the first tick, 2n the second tick, etc.  (actual numbers to be determined by tuning and designed to allow most characters to live about 5-8 minutes).  ALTERNATIVE: Spirit Rot does no damage until a set amount of time, and then it starts taking 10% of your health per tick like drowning does.<br />
<br />
This would serve a couple of great purposes:<br />
<br />
1. Battle rezzing - shaman could rez fallen comrades into battle when clerics/pallies are too busy.  Gives us something to do on raids besides malo/turgur's and watch TV.  Could even be useful in groups if the rezzee comes back with enough mana to be useful.<br />
<br />
2. Rez the rezzer - if the cleric is the one who dies, let the shaman spirit rez them, then let them rez themselves.  Saves an annoying CR on the part of the cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the spirit rot portion, I'm not sure what I would suggest for a penalty.  I would suggest maybe a permanent stat hit until a &quot;real&quot; rez is performed.  Half of a caster is better than no caster.  Just as half a melee is better than no melee.<br />
<br />
I don't want an EXP res, I just wanna be able to bring back a key class after an &quot;oopsy&quot; happens.</div></div><hr />

Bad idea. If you're going to do something with FD. It needs to be something that's sufficiently different from conventional FD that it will have no effect on the balance of the classes that are designed with the skill in mind. <br />
<br />
(Don't bother answering unless you've read the whole description).A FD potion would be be in keeping with lore about Vodoo or poisons that put you in a state of artificial death. Give it a fixed duration, something you can't click off untill the timer runs out. /drink potion, you're FD for the next 5 minutes. Can't break, can't remove it (if youre dotted FD may very well become RD). Hope it lasts long enough for the mobs to go home and forget you, hope you survive.<br />
<br />
Possible description.<br />
Juju Bazonga Potion (or insert corny name here)<br />
Trivial : 250 +<br />
Cost : 150 pp + (or add rare component)<br />
Effect : User is FD+Mez+18 poison counters. (has a buff icon, cannot be clicked off)<br />
Cast time : 1.5 - 3 sec <br />
Duration : 5 minutes, <br />
(cannot be broken by AE or whatever. Cannot be clicked off. Can only be removed using cure poison (IE someone cures you) or letting the duration run out.)<br />
<br />
<br />
This makes it a tool to survive emergencies.... It's effect would be specific and particular enough to make people want to keep at least one handy in many cases. And it's not anywhere near the same as regular FD in implementation or application.<br />
<br />
Potion effects like this would make alchemy interesting and flesh out the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Shaman casts &quot;Spirit Resurrection&quot; on a corpse.  The player gets a yes/no confirmation box as usual.  Player clicks yes and is summoned to the corpse as usual.<br />
<br />
No XP is returned by the spirit rez, but the corpse's rezzability remains intact,  i.e. the player can still receive a cleric rez at some point and get XP back.  This is a key difference.  Spirit rez is not a true rez, the player must still get a real rez.<br />

If the mana is to mean something it needs to be at least full mana and possibly a mana regeneration effect on top of it. Full mana is not much when naked. :(</div></div><hr />
