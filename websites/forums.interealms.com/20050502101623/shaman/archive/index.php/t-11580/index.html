<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anybody been able to find out just how the mitigation seems to work?  Or the approximate levels of the mitigation?<br />
<br />
Not parsed, but using our standard lev-60 = 75% slow as a comparison<br />
<br />
&quot;Partially&quot; seems to equate to about 35% max slow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly&quot;  seems to equate to about 50% max slow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Immune&quot; seems to equate to &quot;ouch.&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Does this follow with what everybody else is seeing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While I have not parsed it eitehr I take the mitigation msgs to mean the following:<br />
<br />
Immune to Changes in attack speed: 0 % effective slow =&gt; 0% slow<br />
<br />
Slightly: 25 % effective of normal slow =&gt; 0.25 x 0.75 = 18.75 % slow<br />
<br />
Partially: 50% effictive of normal slow =&gt; 0.5 x 0.75 = 37.5 % slow<br />
<br />
Mostly: 75% effective of normal slow =&gt; 0.75 x 0.75 = 56.25% slow<br />
<br />
Full: 100% effective slow =&gt; 75% slow<br />
<br />
This is using Turgurs at lv 65 (75%) in this example.<br />
<br />
While I cannot be sure of this but it seems to follow the logic that was posted by VI about slow mitigation that the best slows would still be the best (Ie Turgurs) since it is a percentage of the normal effect.  Id love to see some parses to see if it is in fact what I have described, but Mob dmg varies very greatly in excess of 25% so it isnt really possible to make conclusions this precise with that kinda of variation in the parses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If it's like that... That gives us<br />
<br />
Slightly : Shaman 18.75% Enchanter 17.5%  Beastlord 16.25%<br />
Partially: Shaman 37.5% Enchanter 35% Beastlord 32.5%<br />
Mostly:   Shaman 56.25% Enchanter 52.25% Beastlord 48.75%<br />
Full :       Shaman 75% Enchanter 70% Beastlord 65%<br />
<br />
Scary isn't it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Again not that I can confirm this, but examine the following:<br />
<br />
A Mostly slowable Mob will deal 43.75% of its normal Dmg.<br />
<br />
A Fully slowable Mob will deal 25% of its normal Dmg.<br />
<br />
This is Means that just changing a Fully slowable mob to a Mostly Slowable one Increases its Dmg output by (43.75%/25%) of its normal slowed amount.  This is an increase of 75%  in Dmg output of the Mob.  Again using Turgurs in all cases.  Ive exped enuff off of Mostly slowable Mobs to confirm that this is at least near accurate.  The pounding you will take from a Mostly slowable Mob compared to a Fully slowable is VERY noticable.  Like for example, it will make a Fully slowable mob that is a rough but doable solo fight, completetly untankable as a Mostly slowable one.<br />
<br />
So while I cannot give any hard data to backup my theory I do have emperical evidence to claim that it is at least near the numbers that Ive posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Slow mitigation is a hard capped percentage. No matter what &quot;Scoot&quot; said it was supposed to be(Shaman slow still best slow on mitigating mobs my ass), it isn't true. <br />
<br />
This means:<br />
<br />
Slightly: A ****ing melee with a willsaper slows as good as me<br />
<br />
Partially: Bard, Ranger, Enchanter, Beastlord and a melee with the Kunark 2 hander(procs 50% chanter slow, name escapes me atm) slow as good as me<br />
<br />
Mostly: Beastlord, Enchanter slow as good as me(Bards are very very close, but i seem to remember they can't overwrite my slow...)<br />
<br />
Full: My 4 expansion old slow is the best<br />
<br />
Evidence ?<br />
<br />
Ask an Enchanter to cast his slow on anything that somewhat mitigates slow and you had slowed before. &quot;Your Turgur's Insects has worn off&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it's like that... That gives us<br />

Mostly:   Shaman 56.25% Enchanter 52.25% Beastlord 48.75%<br />
Full :       Shaman 75% Enchanter 70% Beastlord 65%<br />
<br />
Scary isn't it ?<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's why I think it should have been subtractive rather than multiplicative.  Let's say it was 15%, 35%, 60% but subtractive (i.e. you take the normal slow % and subtract the mitigation amount from it):<br />
<br />
Slightly:  Shaman 15% Enchanter 10% Beastlord 5%<br />
Partially: Shaman 40% Enchanter 35% Beastlord 25%<br />
Mostly:   Shaman 60% Enchanter 55%  Beastlord 50%<br />
Full :       Shaman 75% Enchanter 70% Beastlord 65%<br />
<br />
Any slows lower than the mitigation amount would yield a slow of 0 and &quot;did not take effect&quot; or some such.  Our slows would be the same base % better than the other classes' slows, as it should be, but the mitigation of the mob would still have a dramatic impact on the fight.<br />
<br />
But it's water under the bridge now, unlikely to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, I missed a tier when posting -- I haven't seen a &quot;slightly&quot; message yet.  I appreciate the responses, but I'm wondering if anybody else is seeing the mitigation categories fall roughly into the %s I saw earlier.<br />
<br />
From Mmshah's info, it looks like &quot;Mostly&quot; comes out to a 56% slow when he's slowed.  Close enough to what I found for me to believe =D<br />
<br />
So, from observation we have (rounded to nearest 5%)<br />
Slightly:   ... ? %<br />
Partially:  about 35%<br />
Mostly:    55%<br />
<br />
Anybody have any anectodal -- or better, hard -- info to add?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slow mitigation is a hard capped percentage. <br />
....<br />
Ask an Enchanter to cast his slow on anything that somewhat mitigates slow and you had slowed before. &quot;Your Turgur's Insects has worn off&quot;<br />
<br />
 That does seem to indicate that it's a hard cap, and that Sony has mis-represented the way slow mitigation works in order to appease the top slower.<br />
<br />
 So has anyone ever had their slow overwritten by the proc from a weapon like willsapper? Or, would anyone care to dispute Giac's claim?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So has anyone ever had their slow overwritten by the proc from a weapon like willsapper?<br />
<br />
Yep, i have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Slightly&quot; is around 15% slowed with turgurs from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If mitigation was subtracted, you could end up with a hasted mob. Which used to happen, didn't it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So, <br />
Slightly: 15%<br />
Partially: 35%<br />
Mostly: 55%<br />
<br />
Anybody else feel this is right or way off base?  Or are we just so tired of them forgetting to lube the shaft that we're no longer interested?</div></div><hr />
