<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been gone from EQ for several months now (before LoY was out) and hit 200 alchemy shortly before leaving.  I am thinking about possibly coming back to the game after my long break and was curious if anything good has come along for alchemy to make my investment back then any more useful or even fun.  I would settle for fun.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

P.S. any major gameplay changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we have new illusions for each playable race and armor dyes....   other than that, no Alchemy is the same PP sink it's always been.  Usefull in certain circumstances, but useless overall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont forget gate to bind potions -- those are actually pretty useful if you raid and need a quick exit but dont feel like farming for thurg potions.  At 252p each, they are not astoundingly cheap, but they are bearable in a pinch.<br />
<br />
There is also the alchemy grandmasters trophy, which is not bad (and does summon one permanent 100 percent weight reducing bag and any number of temporary ones).</div></div><hr />
