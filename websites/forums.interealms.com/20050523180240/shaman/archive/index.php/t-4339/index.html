<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Unfortunately there may be a problem with the new keyrings.<br />
So do not delete your keys.<br />
<br />
We may need to reset the keyrings for some characters. This would result there being no keys recorded in your keyring, and you might need to use the physical keys again.<br />
<br />
We’re sorry for the problem, and we’ll keep you up to date.<br />

PS.  Sorry for spamming this to all these boards, but it just didn't seem to me that the information was getting out fast enough.</div></div><hr />

I'm NEVER going to get to do that quest!!!</div></div><hr />

Hail Absor,<br />
Thanks for dropping by and letting us know about this little challenge the keyrings are having at the moment. :)  The shaman community appreciates your attention and concern over this matter.<br />
<br />
Stop by any time. :D<br />
<br />
Tkae care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">oh bugger..<br />

Nooooo...I know hindsight is always 20/20 but always assume there is gonna be a **** up and just leave em in your bank account for a week or 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Edara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ouch.  Why on earth would you destroy keys so soon after a patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was about to delete my Seb key then though better of it. <br />
<br />
They are obviously doing this to stop people who haven't quested the keys getting into places that still require them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ftarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gloriana I think there is a new NPC outside ST who will take the Prismatic Scales and give the same items as Melafin without takeing your ST key - I think this has been put in as with Keyring most may not have held onto there keys. He will also exchange Melafen items back for an ST Key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On a related note, I can't get the /key command to work at all.  Do I have to be in the NewUI to use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You have to use a key once before it appears on your keyring.<br />
<br />
Go to OS with your key, use key to enter OS.  You should get a message, &quot;this key has been added to your key ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then type /key and it should be there.<br />
<br />
Repeat with all keys, but don't delete any.<br />
<br />
Ftarr, that's interesting!  I know there's a guy outside who exchanges some monk thing so they can get primal fistwraps.  Anyone else confirm the essence quest guy outside of ST that doesn't take your key?</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:10:43 2002] You say, 'Hail, Nelef the Trader'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:10:43 2002] Nelef the Trader says 'Good day to you, friend! Tell me, have you [traversed the cold] and the muck to forge through the forsaken tomb of the sleeping dragon? Perhaps you've come across mighty beasts with [prismatic power] beyond imagination?!'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:10:52 2002] You say, 'I have traversed the cold'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:10:53 2002] Nelef the Trader says 'Aha! I knew you looked like a daring and intrepid adventurer! I've been looking for a @#1476 like yourself who has made it through that wretched place alive. I haven't had the privelege of coming across any that have had any [proof] they've been there though, so I'm a little skeptical when someone says they have been there, as you can rightly imagine.'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:11:30 2002] You say, 'what proof'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:11:30 2002] Nelef the Trader says 'What proof? Well, let's see. . . Perhaps you can provide me with some kind of trinket that came from the prismatic dragon himself? I'd be most interested in a scale if you were able to get ahold of one.'<br />
<br />
And<br />
<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:52:31 2002] You say, 'Hail, Nelef the Trader'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:52:31 2002] Nelef the Trader says 'Good day to you, friend! Tell me, have you [traversed the cold] and the muck to forge through the forsaken tomb of the sleeping dragon? Perhaps you've come across mighty beasts with [prismatic power] beyond imagination?!'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:52:38 2002] You say, 'what prismatic power'<br />
[Wed Aug 14 17:52:38 2002] Nelef the Trader says 'Well, I have heard stories of a dragon who was after a prismatic scale and the key to enter the tomb as proof that the sleeping beast had been released. When he took them from the daring adventurers, he destroyed the key because he didn't want those people to return to the tomb. I have no idea why he did this, but if you were one of those unlucky few, please return to me the trinket he gave you and I'll return to you the key to regain entrance to that place.'<br />
<br />
Also a Guildie of mine has confirmed it works by trading the Scale only - for the Essence Lense - same stats but may be tagged differently from the Melafen one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Prismatic would be the NEW sleeper's tomb, which is only on stormhammer.<br />
<br />
The only trade in on most servers is the dragon in WW.<br />
<br />
But Glori, what you do is take some duel deaths in an arena...this often results in soulbound items being duplicated. ST key isn't lore, so you can have a key to turn in for an essence lens, and still have a key to enter the zone. Easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually no. Prismatic dragon scales drop on all servers where the sleeper has been woken up. I've got one sitting in my bank to prove it.<br />
<br />
There are prismatic weapons in the new ST on stormhammer but thats a different situation.</div></div><hr />

P.S.  Thanks for the heads up, BTW :)<br />
P.S.S.  I'm serious about the target window though!</div></div><hr />
