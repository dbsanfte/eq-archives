<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been playing EQ1 on and off since launch, 5 years later and I'm still enjoying it. EQ2 is now only 2 weeks away and I'm worried that the game I'm enjoying so much will become empty due to EQ2. I also played SWG for 3 months and came back to EQ.<br />
<br />
To the beta testers:<br />
Is EQ2 as good as the hype?<br />
will a large part of the EQ1 player base leave for EQ2?<br />
do you think EQ2 is as good as EQ1, i know its early days but can you see it becoming better than EQ1?<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if I should buy EQ2 or not, I don't want to miss out on something that will give me even more enjoyment than EQ1.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't played EQ2 beta at all, nor do I intend to. But I can repeat several things posted from my guild's message board about it: YMMV:<br />
<br />
We took a &quot;poll&quot; asking how many were planning to at least try out EQ2 once it came out. Only about 10% of guild claimed they intended to. I suspect the number will actually be higher, but I also suspect that most will trickle back, just as they have other times, when DaoC and SWG and WoW beta and other games came out.<br />
<br />
But some of the comments from several on there who have played the Beta extensively...<br />
<br />
--The game appears to be clearly designed for casual playing. It is NOT a raiding game, and doesn't purport to be, so if raiding is your thing, you won't be attracted to it after the newness wears off (raid max size is 24, btw).<br />
--The game is very pretty.<br />
--Leveling seems very slow, even at low levels.<br />
--Even though Sony claims you can solo at any point in your progression, people are finding that past lvl 15 or so, you can't. You have to group to feel like you are gaining much.<br />
--Classes seem even more interchangable than in EQ1.<br />
--Gear is apparently all &quot;level-limited&quot;, meaning that it has a &quot;recommended&quot; level, and if a character below that level wears it, they don't get full effect. Thus trying to fix the twinking problem EQ1 has.<br />
--Gear also wears out, though I gather it can be repaired to full or nearly full usefulness again by a tradesmith. Nonetheless, there is some fear that this will lead to even more farming than in EQ1.<br />
<br />
As I said, these are not my comments, I'm just repeating what I've been told. YMMV--take it all with a grain of salt. <br />
<br />
One timesink in a lifetime is enough for me, thanks :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to add, from all of the beta reports I've read (not in the beta myself), the game is not ready to ship.  And will not be ready for another 3-4 months.  However, SOE is going to push it out the door anyway, on Nov 8th.  If you played SWG, then you probably will have a similar experience with EQ2.  Lots of unfinished content, quests and balancing issues.  Hell, the gaming industry was obviously very surprised by the Nov 8th release announcement, many of them were planning on giving out Beta subscriptions in Nov.  That is not a good sign.  Just like a movie, whenever it is released quickly with little industry insight, it usually means it's being rushed (and really not ready for prime time).  I plan on playing it in about 3-4 months, about when they should have released it and it will start looking like a finished product.  Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think they are two very different games.<br />
<br />
http://eqii.com has a wealth of info.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think it boils down to this:<br />
If you have played eq1, and like it, you won't like eq2 as much.  EQ2 seems to be designed with new players in mind.  Its the user friendly pretty eq1, minus the expansions, plus horizons like tradeskill systems and player housing, plus FFX1 group combat moves.  <br />
<br />
Spells seem very limited.  All 6 priest classes have basically the same spell set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From what a beta tester in my guild has said the problem off each of the four architypes being the same is due to be fixed with a whole load of new spells. However as these have not made it into the beta yet, is seems as if they will be tested on live servers.<br />
<br />
Also to fix the lag issue they have start instancing the main zones 300 people max, so the 301 person to enter will get a zone to themselves though if you were joining friends there is a way to switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I made it into beta, and I've been playing it alot over the past few weeks...<br />
<br />
the only thing you have to remember is that this is not EQ1. <br />
<br />
while it holds many similarities, it is a different game altogether, its far more beautiful than EQ and the zones are absolutely huge (takes ~30 mins to run around the edge of antonica with SoW)...and on my average system it runs great (2.0 ghz celeron, 1.5GB Ram, 128 MB video card, on a DSL line)...there are a number of bugs that need to be worked out, but nothing completely outrageous that I have seen..<br />
<br />
I agree that it is geared for the casual gamer, I've seen some light raid content, mostly against small dragon-type creatures in the commonlands, battles are faster paced than EQ and I haven't had any problem soloing past 15...<br />
<br />
the game play is fun, and more involved than EQ1 is currently...<br />
<br />
I think some of the playerbase will come back to EQ, some will play between both games (as I intend to), and some will stay with EQ2, it really comes down to what you personally like to play...I feel they have made a strong effort to eliminate some of the things that many of the people hated in EQ, namely class dependancy, overcrowding of zones and KSing (honestly put, I'd like to see some of the things in EQ2 patched into EQ1)<br />
<br />
I enjoy my shaman on EQ immensely. I'm enjoying playing my Mystic on EQ2 as well, its alot different, (don't go expecting to be a &quot;slower&quot;, it really doesn't make too much of a difference in EQ2) the shaman defining ability is now a &quot;Ward&quot;, like the enchanter rune of EQ1, that absorbs 100% melee damage and heals the character what damage isn't taken by the ward when time expires on it..<br />
<br />
priest archetypes do all have the same spellset...until they stop being a priest and choose a class (shaman in my case), and then a subclass (mystic)...<br />
<br />
there is alot that I like, and some things I haven't quite figured out if I like or don't like yet, I can't say that I've found any hard negative yet, but at this point, everyone is a newb, and everyone has things to figure out...<br />
<br />
my suggestion (as it usually is) is buy the cheapest version and &quot;get your own opinion&quot;...I read that it should come with a free 30-day subscription...which is just about enough time to play past the first 20 levels as a casual gamer and at level 20 you are the same level as the lowest raid targets I've seen....if you like it, great, you have a new time-sink, if not, you're out about the price of a dinner at a nice restaurant...<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents on the topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its a game made by SOE...<br />
it has no planned pvp<br />
therefore it sucks<br />
(not that the pvp part really matters since soe has already proven they are clueless about pvp but hey)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's geared towards casual players but they will be forced to group. Hmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm in Beta. I have two EQ1 accounts. I have played EQ1 since April 1999. I have preordered 1 EQ2 account. I will continue to play both until I can get a laptop that runs EQ2. My current laptop won't run EQ2 and I am on the road three weeks a month.<br />
<br />
EQ2 is very pretty if you have the hardware to run it. Your video card must support DX9c completely in hardware. Geforce MX cards will not run it at all. Geforce 2 Go 5200 or Radeon ?9600? or higher are required for laptops. <br />
<br />
There are loads of quests that do work. The gear rewards are pretty good. Tradeskills and housing are interesting.I am not a hardcore raider and if I wanted to PVP I'd still be playing DAoC.<br />
<br />
I think EQ2 is as good as the hype.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In their defense (after I bashed em for server stability recently) they did put in instancing for the Commonlands and Antonica which has drastically helped the lag/slideshow problems there. I am assuming they will instance later outdoor zones this way if needed be, but it has helped a lot. <br />
<br />
Most quests that I have seen work fine, but some need the rewards balanced (one biggie is the Qeynos vs Freeport comparison....FP quests result in considerably worse quality gear IMHO)<br />
<br />
Classes arent very well defined right now (or rather they arent that different from each other inside of each archetype) but there is a huge content patch going in today with the intention of providing the definition that is lacking...spells/combat arts, traits, etc. <br />
<br />
I would say that today can really change some peoples minds if they do the changes right. It can also make a lot of people finally give up if they do it badly.<br />
<br />
I still think you need to take a &quot;Wait-and-see&quot; attitude on this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
These descriptions of EQ II are some of the same descriptions peeps were saying about ACII shortly before it launched.<br />
<br />
I pray that EQII doesnt follow in the footsteps of ACII, which was a very sad, sad game due to its potential and what could have been.<br />
<br />
Im looking forward to EQII but am also weary for the reasons I just posted.<br />
<br />
Looking more forwrd to WoW and will be playing WoW for at least the first month....prolly going to wait on EQII as I dont have time or money to play more than 1.5 of theses games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have been playing EQ2 Beta for a month now and have had no desire to go back to EQ1.  For a casual player, EQ1 now seems like such a chore to log on and try to find something productive to do.  With EQ2 there is just tons of stuff immediately accessible to go do, and I am enjoying it.  YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is EQ2 as good as the hype? <br />
If the hype has convinced you EQ2 will be to MMOPG what slices were to bread, then you are in for a big let down. If you think EQ2 will be a gorgeous looking game with a lot of the EQ pain taken out and more scope to adventure in a fantastic environment, then i'm hoping you turn out to be correct. It's too early to say. The beta holds promise, but promise is something SoE have repeatedly shown they are willing to ditch for dollars.<br />
<br />
will a large part of the EQ1 player base leave for EQ2?<br />
No, i think they are emigrating to wow.<br />
<br />
do you think EQ2 is as good as EQ1, i know its early days but can you see it becoming better than EQ1?<br />
I prefered EQ2 to EQ1 straight away. I cannot imagine ever going back to EQ1. Whether it's as good is not really relevant to me. It's new, and after 5 years in EQ1, new = fun for me.<br />
<br />
As for ready for release... well i'm willing to pay the 50 to play EQ in its current state, with the full realization that a lot of the features are not in, are not tested, or don't work properly. However, there is enough in the game as it is now that i am willing to take the chance that it will evolve along lines that will suit my preferences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Geforce 2 Go 5200 or Radeon ?9600? or higher are required for laptops. <br />
 It works on my mobile Radeon 9000. But I would not really call it playable nor pretty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall I think that E2 is just too limited to keep people playing for a long time. <br />
The first 15 - 20 levels there are ALOT of quests to do and some of them actually give nice rewards. But starting around level 10-12, many of those quests can not be done solo anymore (before they are trivial). So to get them done while the reward is still usable, you have to group. <br />
<br />
Also there are many access quest, think one-groupable PoP flags. Some of these zones you may also enter if you are some higher in level, you are not locked out of the standard zones forever. Many of the instanced adventure zones require 3 people in group, similar to LDoNs.<br />
I better stop now, I am feeling the urge to write a novel :p<br />
<br />
I think that many people who are currently playing EQ1 will return to EQ2 after say 2-3 month, either from EQ2 or WoW or after trying both.<br />
<br />
And the first month will see the swinging of the nerf bat that makes the SWG release look like a kindergarden party. There are just too many balance issues that have not even been recognized by us beta-testers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been playing EQ2 Beta for a month now and have had no desire to go back to EQ1.

With EQ2 there is just tons of stuff immediately accessible to go do, and I am enjoying it.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
I have to take statements like this with a grain of salt, however: when EQ first came out, and the world was fresh and new and interesting, there was tons to do there as well. Hell, just running from Qeynos to Freeport took me an entire day, with fear and celebration and wow, was that a wild ride. Quests really were quests, where you had no idea where you were going or what you would find there. A zone like Lavastorm could be terrifying, let alone somewhere like Guk. Remember how scary it was the first time you tried to exp in Najena? Or Befallen? <br />
<br />
Part of the problem with EQ is that everything is now documented, everything has spoilers, everything has been made so &quot;immediate-gratification&quot; oriented that there is nothing new any more. Do we really need maps of all of the OoW zones with every named spawn point marked on them before the expansion is even out of testing? Do we really need a port-ho stationed outside KodTaz just because we are too damned stupid and/or lazy to run safely across the zone to Qvic?<br />
<br />
And a year down the road, that will in all likelihood be true of EQ2 as well. It will be interesting to see whether it can maintain any freshness or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just to clear up a few misconceptions...<br />
<br />
--The game appears to be clearly designed for casual playing. It is NOT a raiding game, and doesn't purport to be, so if raiding is your thing, you won't be attracted to it after the newness wears off (raid max size is 24, btw).<br />
Check the FoH boards for the pics of the VoX raid. Main thing different from EQ1 is raid size is limited to 24. Personally, that is one of the things that really attracts me about EQ2.<br />
<br />
--The game is very pretty.<br />
Pretty is too weak. The game looks stunning.<br />
<br />
Leveling seems very slow, even at low levels.<br />
Found it to be pretty quick compared to how EQ1 was back in the beginning. I also prefer it taking a long time. Give you time to experience the content.<br />
<br />
Even though Sony claims you can solo at any point in your progression, people are finding that past lvl 15 or so, you can't. You have to group to feel like you are gaining much.<br />
You can solo all day long. I'm sure you will be able to solo to 50. It's slower than grouping, which is what people complain about. I like this feature and it's another thing that attracts me to EQ2.<br />
<br />
--Classes seem even more interchangable than in EQ1.<br />
Shamans, droods and clerics can all rez and heal about equally well atm. That may change with new spell lists on the way. This is one of the biggest plusses for me. If they cave in to all the hysterical clerics sputtering about how they are &quot;supposed&quot; to be the best healers, i will probably stop playing.<br />
<br />
--Gear is apparently all &quot;level-limited&quot;, meaning that it has a &quot;recommended&quot; level, and if a character below that level wears it, they don't get full effect. Thus trying to fix the twinking problem EQ1 has.<br />
Like the DAoC system, even same colour cons. Doesn't bother me either way.<br />
<br />
--Gear also wears out, though I gather it can be repaired to full or nearly full usefulness again by a tradesmith. Nonetheless, there is some fear that this will lead to even more farming than in EQ1.<br />
Incorrect. Atm, if you die your gear takes a 10% hit, which you can repair. It will never break (so they say).</div></div><hr />
