<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elenrak-FS-Rathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having trouble getting into the tower in BW to talk to Atheling Plague.  Can anyone give me suggestions on how they got into the tower?  Where to run from?  Combo of spells to use?  I've tried Spirit of Cheetah but I always end up just below the white bone things that stick up.  i also tried running with the camera angle straight up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're getting to the white bone things, then you're starting in the right place.  I only found one spot on the zone wall to climb high enough to even try.  I tried using SoCheeta several times and almost got inside every time too.  If you're not 52 yet (I was 50 at the time) you can use Scale of Wolf.  It worked for me twice.<br />
<br />
The walkthroughs say you've got enough time to summon and buff Doggy after you give Atheling the skull, but be warned:  Doval WILL despawn if you don't engage fast enough.  If you feel the need to kill Atheling after Doval,  Just sic Doggy on him and keep Doggy healed unless you want to be teleported, which leads me to my last tip:<br />
<br />
The 4 Sarnak around the table in the area you get teleported into are dark blue but single pullable at lvl 50 with Nullify Magic (most are shaman type mobs and all are heavily buffed before you get there) unless there's a named one (Somethingorother Klyseer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To the right of the castle wall, back about 100 meters or so, is a good hill to launch from.  It does take quite a bit of practice to get in there so keep trying.  You can do it with SoS on or SoC pretty easy once you figure it out.<br />
<br />
The best way to fight Doval is to fight on the edge farthest from Atheling.  That way you avoid getting TP'd into Chardok.  Nuke big too because Doval is a wuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can tone the graphics down a bit, for example drop your clip plan down to nothing. Graphics lag can hinder your movement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, make sure you are looking straight up the majority of the time!!!  If you are looking straight on you'll always drop.  With looking up I managed to get into the tower with standard SoW.  Hit the home key after a little bit just to make sure you aren't walking through the tower (like 10 or so seconds) but then immediately look back all the way up.  Only took me two tries to get it.. also you need to go back a little further until you can go up the mountain quite a bit.. that's your 'fly off' point.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I could only do this using one of my computers, the other one is just way too laggy to be able to do it.  You should be able to make it in by using Scale of Wolf, it pretty much puts you right in there perfectly.  So if you find that Scale doesn't do the trick then its your system that is slowing you down.  So drop the clipping plane like Shjekai said, and if that doesnt work turn off all models and that should do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I could NOT do this part.  Apparantly my old system was too slow and generated many ' mini-lags' that were too fast to see, but the engine could detect them. <br />
<br />
So I sank like a stone..even with spirit of the cheetah and lev. I turned off everything, I clipped to zero and couldn't even see the tower from the launching point, I used every combination I could think of..<br />
<br />
Finally I dualed a friend, and had a cleric rez me in the tower.<br />
<br />
FYI subsequently I got a 200mhz processor and 1.5 gigs of memory with a 64mg video card and now I can fly all the way from the tunnel in Dreadlands to the other side of the zone if I desire.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the fight when you get there.  Once you've finished the thug off, attack aelthing and he'll banish you to the chardok exit..just a fun way to get down..&gt;:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Video lag causes gravity while levitated, so you can reduce your rate of descent by futzing with your video settings (or buying a faster PC). Lower the clipping plane, lower the screen resolution, use old models, turn off 3D sky and other video effects, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zarlaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if your comp sux like mine and lag keepin you from making the lev run you can do what i did and get on top of the wall next to tower and have a wizard Gflux you up into tower,  you take a little dmg but is much less stressfull</div></div><hr />
