<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They do. And even if they didn't, Advanced Call is way more damage than the first AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So since they are more damage than SC, it would be fine if they stopped proc'ing suddenly?  ;)</div></div><hr />

You could just have had a bad run or two.  I've a feeling that could be heavily influenced if you were to do something like Champion them when summoned with Pet Affinity aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SC3 (normal version) hit them with panther/leopard. Better DPS than Advanced SC</div></div><hr />

Oh that's interesting...not something I considered before since I don't have affinity or champion yet.  But if you have all possible spirit pets up at once and cast champion (or any group buff) it hits them all?<br />
<br />
That is kinda cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grouping with bards is some good times on the ole' parser, I hear.  Pet Affinity affects songs, too.</div></div><hr />

Swarm pets dont act like summoned pets..so therefore your pet affinity or group buffs wont affect them...also pets arent grouped so you cant cast a group buff on them ;p<br />
However i do cast leopard on them (1 by 1),sit back and enjoy dps</div></div><hr />

But I thought...<br />

Pet Affinity<br />
&quot;This ability allows your group spells to also affect the pets of group members.&quot;</div></div><hr />
