<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hunnybumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My husband has a 49 shammy and I play a 50 monk (both Iksar), where is a good place for us to level?  If you say KC I will have to shoot you!  We have tried Rockhoppers in DS but there are too many people there; same with Velks.  We have also read many of the suggestions here but they all state &quot;solo exp&quot; so how is some of this stuff for duo exp?  We are looking to level up fast and have about 6 hours a day during the week and all day on weekends.  We are on Rodcet, any suggestions would be much appreciated.  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulfgyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stables in CoM.  He needs shackle quest items from there, you need epic note drops.  Keep an eye out on /ooc, in case someone drops Lord Ghiosk and doesn't need the note.<br />
<br />
Exp is ok....  not PoP good, but at 50'ish, it's not bad.<br />
<br />
At around 51-52, Wyverns in Cobalt Scar.  You can even solo them, when he's not on.  (Make sure you have yer Claws of Veeshan faction close to max though, cuts down on adds ALOT.  Kill giants in Kael to raise it)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Frenzy and Lord rooms in lower guk are good xp for 2 at 50.  I duel box there with 50 monk and shaman, for quite awhile.  Decent coin if you loot all the Fine Steel, and a chance for and extra 2k from the sash never hurt.  Now a days guk is pretty empty most times, especially weekdays.</div></div><hr />
