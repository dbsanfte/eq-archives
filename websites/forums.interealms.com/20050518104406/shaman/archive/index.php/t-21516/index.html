<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there,<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild is, like alot of the other Elemental + guilds, losing a fair number of our players to retirement. As we have yet to kill any of the mobs that key you for PoTime, this puts us in an interesting position.<br />
<br />
We recently had to up the entry requirements to the guild to 80aa's, and some Flags preferred. This was because of the lack of the earlier applicants to do what was required of them on raids. Things like extremely low manapools for clerics (no SCM) and too many people needing to use the 85% raiding rule for entry into the Planes.<br />
The problem with this is that the flags are not an easy thing to come by (even with the guild co-operation that exists on the Nameless), and the aa's required are getting up there.<br />
<br />
We are a casual guild with non-compulsary raiding and no DKP system. What have other guilds done in this situation to keep the numbers up? <br />
What are the options available to my guild?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your suggestions,<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know the pain your guild is going through.  Mine was also in the same position at one point.  There's a few things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
1.  It's a cycle - every guild goes through it.<br />
<br />
2.  Perhaps your aa are set too high.  Instead of requiring an app to have aa that you'd like them to have, think of where you are in pop currently and only require what is absolutely necessary for that class.  You may find, that even if the aa requirement is dropped by 10aa, you'll have a few more ppl interested.<br />
<br />
3.  Flags - are there any open raiding group around on your server?  Fennin Ro is lucky enough to have Khasel open raids, and a few other people that normally lead open raids.  These raids are a great source of backflags.  If that isn't available to you, then you may have to lower your flag requirements and set up a once a week or every two week type of backflagging event within your guild.  This is for current members, applicants, and potential future applicants.<br />
<br />
4.  Potential future apps - Is there a channel you have for the guild/apps/potential apps to get together and talk?  We have one and it works GREAT for spreading the word about your guild for recruitment purposes, as well as giving your guild a chance to chat outside of tells with apps and potential apps.<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me either here on the boards, or send me a cross-server tell.</div></div><hr />

This is going to be your biggest problem.  Anyone can get AA anywhere; getting flags is next to impossible unless you are already in a guild that will help you get them.  And once you are in a guild that helps you get the flags you need to progress, why leave for another guild? <br />
<br />
I've found this to be painfully so on my server (Rodcet Nife) and its one of the reasons that I have not logged into my shaman in over a week.  We have no open raid culture.  Even getting the Junkbeast up or a Terris Thule flag is a guild event.  Those guilds that are already elemental flagged require elemental flags as a condition of joining; backflagging is something that no ele guild seems to want to do anymore and I cant say that I blame them a much.  The elemental guilds will trade flags back and forth for members that need, say, a bertox or Sol ro mini flag, but outsiders are persona non grata..  So, unless your guild is moving to flagging stages, your play time is the BoT/HoH/Tactics grind or LDoN.  Im not even going to touch how hard it is to even get anywhere in GoD.<br />
<br />
Kumoe, it looks as if you might have to take 2 steps back before you can take a step forward again.  If you are not getting any apps with the flags that you need you might have to use the guild to get them for your apps.  With a non-compulsary raid atmosphere it might be hard to get enough to show up  for the backflagging, but it sounds as if you have enough to make it worthwhile if you are stretching the 85% rule for more than 25% of your flag required raids.  Bite the bullet.</div></div><hr />

Slowly. My guild is knocking on Solusek Ro's door, and we're a non-mandatory guild with no DKP system (we use a loot council). Sure, we raid 3-4 times a week most weeks, some more, some less, but our turnout varies at each raid. Lately we've begun a loose friendship with another pre-Elemental guild, and that has helped some. I joined my guild last August, and we started POP flagging in earnest back in late December/early January. I think my guild's best quality is that the membership is stubborn.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoP progression was a horrible idea and it's killing the game.  <br />
<br />
Reduce the number of flags to about 5 (if not eliminating them) and tune encounters so people will actually want to do them because of 1) loot or 2) it's cool or fun.  <br />
<br />
For some reason, that will strike some as unreasonable.  I think it's evident what the problem is from a game design prespective.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I forgot to add... guild mergers are really the fastest and potentially best way to proceed.  They can also blow up of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On Bertox, we have two things happening that might be good ideas for you. <br />
<br />
You mention &quot;loose friendship&quot; with another guild. We have two or three guilds that routinely raid together as a group--they retain their individual memberships, but they just seem to do most of their raids together. I have no idea how the separate out the loot, but if your main objective is to get more people flagged, this is a good way to do it. Takes some work by the officers to work out who is Raid Leader, etc, but it would get you the bodies you need for a RZWL hit or Sol Ro hit.<br />
<br />
Another idea is to organize &quot;pick-up&quot; raids, and advertise them. The &quot;base&quot; of the raid becomes your guild, but you allow essentially any warm body who isn't a known asshat and who meets minimum qualifications (generally just a min level, such as 60) to join the raid. You get a LOT of dying this way, but you can also get 72+ for the raid. Your guild gets the flags, and you also meet new people you might want to recruit later on. On Bertox, we have a couple of guilds who tend to raid this way, as well as one or two fellows who work hard to organize complete pickup raids (insanity, imo). <br />
<br />
Beyond that, the only suggestion I would have would be to approach one of the current elemental guilds/Time guilds, and see if you can work out a &quot;tag-along&quot; system whereby you essentially apprentice your guild under them--you provide warm bodies for their raids (since they may also be suffering from low numbers atm) and you get flags in return.<br />
<br />
Fudapuda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You sound a lot like us, we broke into the Elementals 3-4 months ago and things are starting to suddenly get really rough for us, we've lost a lot of members due to RL constraints (or boredom with EQ, other games, etc.) and a few of our harder core people have left for guilds that are raiding guilds.  Looks like a lot of guilds are having troubles now.<br />
<br />
We have NO requirements to join our guild except that you bring a good attitude and have fun.  ZERO.  Level doesnt matter, AA's dont matter, Class doesnt matter, there are no raiding requirements and yet we made it Elemental, Im very proud of what we have done.  Its always been almost impossible for us to field enough of a crew if there wasnt a raid sign up at least a week in advance, very rarely can we get enough for a spur of the moment raid.  Loot is handeled by a council of the raid leaders usually but any raid leader can handle it the way they want, we even have raids led where the loot is randomed.<br />
<br />
We basically setup a raid once/week that was geared toward progression (every Monday night).  With A few other raids on the side we were able to catch up the odds and end flags we needed and a majority of the guild was flagged (70ish), a few months ago our raids were upwards of 80+ people that wanted to join.  We got to the Elementals and with all thats been going on, retirements and people leaving, that same progression raid is 50ish now and its almost impossible to get enough to get non flagged any other night we someone might setup a raid.<br />
<br />
We will have to adapt as everyone else is, wait out the troubled period, try and actively search out quality people with the same mentality, etc.  I think the new expansion will bring back more folks with level 70 and new epics, at least Im hoping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thorzion, <br />
<br />
Guilds on Rodcet Nife that are elemental and beyond don't as a general rule flag people in other guilds unless the guild they belong to has already killed the mob in question.<br />
<br />
That aside, there has been an enormous recruitment push over the last month. 2 time flagged guilds folded, and almost every elemental and time guild opened the recruitment doors and entered into backflagging mode. I know that one time guild, and 3 elemental guilds did not require any flags for this recruitment run. The only thing that was required was that the person be un-guilded and an applicant of the guild. Flag sharing has been rife with all the guilds trying to get the flagging done as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
True, there is not an open raiding culture on rodcet. I am not disagreeing with that. I am just saying that backflagging is something that happens and there are opportunities when it does. If your point is that you want to remain in a non-progression guild, but get elementally flagged by elemental guilds then I am afraid that Rodcet Nife, int it's current form isn't the place to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We raid twice a week, only 51 guildmembers and we are currently farming mini's in Sol Ro and prepping for RZTW.  So we're 2 kills (Sol Ro himself and RTZW) away from the EPs.  Hopefully drop them this month.<br />

Kumoe:<br />
<br />
I would suggest some sort of active recruiting instead of passive.  Close your apps and then make a *short* list of high speed players you might want...then try to get them interested in the guild.  That way joe-ordinary won't be wasting your time, but you don't need to have artificially high AAs or flagging requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fudapuda:<br />
<br />
Yep, that &quot;loose friendship&quot; basically equates to the following ... their guild leader is arguably one of the best raid leaders I have yet met, and his knowledge about these targets and strats for them is perfectly amazing. On the other hand, we have 180+ mains in our guild, the majority of which are 63+ ... he needs our numbers. It works out great for everyone, even when we /random the loot and a paladin wins the Miserable Bauble (wooh, I was hot that day. You should have seen the necros, lol). We're working on a loot system. They use DKP, we use a loot council, so we're trying to find a middle ground. Loot ... well, meh. My guild is in it to earn some flags. Loot is simply icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
One of Karana's good/bad points is the pickup raid culture we have. They go almost constantly on my server. Trouble is, they are usually lead by morons who do nothing more than depop the mob and force everyone to wonder when the mob was actually despawned and when it will respawn. Not many open raids on my server are actually successful. But the good thing is that a lot of folks who don't have POP-capable guilds get to take a stab at some of these mobs, and maybe even get to take one out and earn a flag.<br />
<br />
My guild tries to rarely include pickup folks (so to speak) in a guild raid, simply because 1.) we are rather set in our ways and have our own method of raiding, and 2.) we generally have more guildies show up than we really know what to do with, lol.<br />
<br />
Time/Elemental guilds on my server very, very, very, very rarely even speak to the rest of us, much less allow us to tag along on their raids. We don't even exist to most of them. It's sad.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stuff you can consider doing:<br />
<br />
1.  Do a massive backflag push for an entire month.  Announce that anyone that's been interested in joining your guild should app now since you'll be doing a complete backflagging of elemental planes.  For every 10 apps, you'll probably get about 2 - 3 good recruits out of it is my guess.  But, those are most likely recruits you'd never have had if you didn't do the backflagging.<br />
2.  Open up recruitment to every class, regardless of AAs.  There are actually some good newer players out there, believe it or not.  Just because some don't have the required AAs doesn't mean they aren't a great asset to a guild.  They can get the AAs they need later on.<br />
3.  Our guild used to use loot council, but we've since gone to DKP.  I love it, and many many of those that were hard against changing the 3+ year loot system have since come to like DKP moreso than loot council.  DKP auctions for loot are fast.  People spend what they want for items based on how valuable it is to them, not by how much other people think the item should be valued by someone.  Also keeping track of DKP adds incentive for people to actually log on.  Doing backflags for us gives additional bonus DKP multiplier (depends what the target is.  First time succeeding on Ele Plane gods was 1.5 multiplier.  doing backflags is usually 1.1 or 1.2).  We've had problems with ninjacampers when ****ty backflag raids were announced.  DKP helps stop that, especially when those people that stick around for the raids get bonus dkp for the back flag.<br />
<br />
Whether you like it or not, to stay up on your numbers, you'll need to backflag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the replies :)<br />
<br />
I included a link to my guild at the bottom of my sig for those that want to know how we did it progression wise.  We keep a good main page that is updated regularly to show progress. That helps with prospective apps. We did not skip content, but moved from NToV to SSra/VT to the Elemental Planes. <br />
<br />
Shenen: <br />
We have two channels we use for apps at the moment. We have a very long entry phase, of at least 4 weeks. In a nutshell, pre-apps join &quot;vghopeful&quot;, and applicants get the password to &quot;vgapp&quot;. This sounds like a lot of work, and it is, but our roster is currently over 120 members, so we have pretty consistant raids.<br />
With regards to flags, the Nameless, and Valorguard (VG) is particular is lucky enough to have a server-wide flagging system. There are a good number of asian-time slot guilds, and VG is maybe the only guild on server that works in three time zones (EST/PST/Aussie). Because of this VG members and apps can get flagged very quickly indeed.<br />
<br />
Karshak:<br />
VG uses the same system. If a guild has killed a mob by itself before, we will assist them in any further killings, or invite them to our slaying of that mob if numbers are low. It works very well. As far as I know, open raids are very limited, and somewhat rare. <br />
<br />
Juujuu:<br />
Some excellent ideas. Thank you very much. Moving to DKP is not an option for my guild, as whenever it is raised, it gets beaten down. The multi-timezone nature of my guild leads to a lot of unhappy people. Implementing it would be troublesome, at the least.<br />
<br />
The idea of opening up the apps is interesting, and I can see how it would work.  One of the best things about my guild is the strict method we have of raiding (look at the guild page, and raiding guideline to see what I mean). As one of the lead shaman in my guild, i am usually in 3 chat channels (debuff, heals and raid) and the /rs channel. It is highly structured, and I think it has a lot to do with our success. <br />
While this method leads to clarity on raids, apps find it a lot to deal with at times.  Especially as a lot of the apps we get are coming from much smaller guilds, with little raiding experience. I'm not sure what we can d about this :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your input guys. Much appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After having been allocated gear with loot council for multiple years, and having used DKP for about 7 months, DKP is a far far far superior system IMO.<br />
here's a link to our dkp system<br />
http://www.eqwatchers.com/points.htm<br />
in short:<br />
-for us we earn 1 point for every hour you raid.<br />
-items are &quot;sold&quot; to the highest bidder via a silent auction.<br />
-we have an online database we can log into to see our current point total and how we've spent our points etc.<br />
I wish we'd gone to DKP much much longer ago.<br />
<br />
Reasons our silent auction works so well:<br />
-it's fast.  usually loot is done in about 5 mins tops<br />
-items are worth different amounts to different people.  An all/all haste shoulder item from earth probably isn't worth much to a melee who has a haste item already.  But to a caster where haste items with good stats are far and between, it's fantastic, so they'll bid more on it.  Plate items with FT aren't worth much to a warrior, but a lot to the other classes.<br />
-items' values go down as you equip yourselves better and can do harder raids.  ele plane armor for us used to go for 20-60 points per item on average.  now pieces go for 1-20 when we even bother to do ele plane raids.  no one would dream of paying 50 points anymore for ele plane armor when we raid time every week, and do GoD raids on the off nights.  having a library of items constantly needs to be reevaluated as to what an item is worth as you get access to new and better items.<br />
-guildmembers have ZERO right to bitch to officers saying &quot;why the hell didn't I win the item over soandso?!  I'm clearly a better choice blah blah blah&quot;.  With points, if you deserve to win the item, then spend the points.  If you don't have the points, you don't deserve the item.  Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

From memory, the main reason for the DKP getting voted down was that being a casual guild, there would be an increasing gap between those that can play a lot, and those that can only login for a few hours a week.<br />
<br />
Is there a work-around for this? I'm personally for DKP, but the ways we had of implenting it were flawed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My guild is a failry good model of a &quot;Casual&quot; guild progressing well. We have no raid requirements. We are on a wonderful DKP system. Yeah, we probably progress a bit slower than a &quot;merit council&quot; guild would (MA gets HPS slower, clerics get FT and other focus they need slower) but that works for us, because most of the members WANT to go a bit slower. We are only racing ourselves. <br />
<br />
We are now 1 kill from Time. Coir went down earlier this week for us. We found a wonderful niche in the overall scheme of things once Gates shipped and the &quot;Top 4&quot; went there instead of farming elemental_mini_487. This has allowed us to get 100s of molds fairly quickly. Such active raiding has also brought us a lot of recruits. But overall, we are mostly casual. Oh, we have 15-20 fairly &quot;hardcore&quot; people who drive the bus and keep us flowing, but the rest of us are just along for the ride, and its been a blast. Sure, I could be in the &quot;Top 4&quot; and be fully Time geared and in Uqua etc etc, but there is something special about being with 70-100 other people on that &quot;First Kill&quot;. All the gear in the world wont make me give that up.<br />

<br />
The guild that I am in uses DKP and yes, the more casual raider will get less points per day than the hardcore raider. But, that's the good thing about DKP. It allows the casual raider to build points up slowly, and as long as they spend carefully there is no reason they can't get gear. Of course, the more prolific raider will get the new drops faster, but they should.... if they are on raiding and keeping the guild progressing.<br />
<br />
It's the fairest method of ensuring that people get out what they put in.<br />
<br />
The casual raider reaps the rewards of being able to raid casually and still progress. The hardcore raider reaps the rewards of being able to accrue points faster and get gear more often. It should be a win win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ive enjoyed PoP progression immensely as well, just being able to check off a new mob done and see how you are doing and what your next stage is has been really fun.  Additionally, being so casual a guild, we raided NToV a couple times (never finished even the circle once), did a very small amount of Sleepers Tomb, completely skipped Luclin (except for the few things here and there - no ssra at all), no VT and headed straight for PoP.<br />
<br />
Our merit doesnt outfit certain items to certain classes either, it all up to what you have done in the past (including web administration work, tradeskilling for the guild, etc. - which is hard to measure in a dkp system) and I imagine it has slowed us as well a little but not all that much.  We have also tried mutlitple times over the last few years to change to some kind of point system, but since the loot policy is not a guildwide thing (the raid leaders can choose their own loot rules), its hard to get everyone to buy into something, but I wish we would.  But the current system is working for the most part.<br />
<br />
We had another 3 members either retire or move on yesterday so we've got to find some ways to get back into our goal of progression to Time.  Luckily a bunch of our recent appies have been joining our servers 'open' raid on flag mobs and have done a bunch of work themselves, but still looks like we are going to have to start backflagging again when the targets are up.  We definitely will not be doing any kind of open recruiting, that sounds way too scary, but currently under consideration is finding another guild that shares our goals and setting up an alliance while we plug at getting more recruits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think it's hurt the game by slowly strangling it, and allowing encounters to be attractive strictly because of flags, and not because they are fun to do or have cool loot that makes them fun.  <br />

Just saying &quot;backflag&quot; causes people to groan and start camping.  It's a game; that's a curious phenomenon for a game.  <br />
<br />
I just don't think it's robust game design.  Absolutely it will have it's share of advocates.  That's fine, I totally understand that.  I felt a thrill hailing RZ's projection.  <br />
<br />
But stepping back, and looking back, I really think PoP progression is badly designed.  Really badly designed.<br />

<br />
As an example of what I'm badly trying to articulate:  Earth Rings.  <br />
<br />
God, could these be more boring?  Why is this sort of thing necessary?  Can they do better than that?  <br />
<br />
Plane of Torment is another.  Boy, the loot kinda really sucks here.  I see so much promise in this zone and with these encounters.  But the payoff just isn't there.  I actually like the Saryrn fight a lot though, but the whole encounter just needs something - the part leading to the fight I mean.   <br />
<br />
Fundamentally, I think there's too many flags required, and it causes unhealthy gameplay to keep up with the Joneses, and it's letting the obsessive drive progression.  That leads to division and burnout.  I don't think that's good for a game, and it's really showing up now in a lot of guilds.  This thread is symptomatic of it.  Things don't have to be this way.</div></div><hr />
