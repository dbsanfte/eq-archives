<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive come to the conclusion that most of the arms available to the shaman suck so im off to go get a spirit wracked cord. My (newb) question is, when you kill something for faction does it &quot;split&quot; among your party? ie if i solo i would have to kill less mobs than if i duo to raise the faction the same amount. <br />
Also anyone know when the droga/nuga change is going to happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">one faction hit is one faction hit.  If you are in a group of 6 and get faction, it is the same as if you were soloing and got faction.<br />
<br />
I would anticipate the nurga and droga changes will go in on the next patch, which looks like from EQlive site, to be early AM July 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At your level I would recommend against doing this quest. You'd be alot better served by getting more levels, getting access to better spells and generally upgrading all your gear along the way than you would be by doing this one quest. Just so you know your looking at something along the lines of 4000 gobblins killed to get your sarnak faction to where you need it if you've bottomed out your sarnak faction. And then you have to start the quest. Give that drusila isn't an easy mob to get to i highly doubt you would be able to get he needed urn from her for the quest. Not to mention the guts from sebilis.<br />
<br />
Get your levels first and if your still interested you'll have an easier time killing stuff for faction, easier time doing the quest and probably an easier time getting help with the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If for some crazy reason you try to solo faction at 52 (unless your sig is wrong &gt;&lt;~)...watch out for pet adds, the level 37 i believe pet will draw all the mobs in the area on you..which could mean a few 300 HTs.  And high level buffs wont necessarily help you avoid death as many things dispell (in case you thought virtue would come to the rescue :) ).<br />
<br />
After the faction work (took me 3 days of 3-5 hours at 62 NON STOP killing), you then get the joy of camping the angry goblin and drusella (suppose you could camp drusella at any time).  Both are 3 day spawns and highly contested..on my server anyway and i'm sure same elsewhere.  I'd also like to point out that i dont think you'll have much luck killing warlord skarguz at 52 solo; which means you'll need at least one friend ready to help you when the angry goblin is up.  With the revamp think the angry goblin ends up outside in FM, which greatly increases your chance of soloing, but greatly lessens the chances of him ever being up.  Details on warlord are as follows, slowed right away so not sure if level helped me...hit for ~150 max i think...hit me with 731 i believe HT..has quite a bit of hp i'd guess around 10-15k but its been a month since i killed him so take it for what its worth, and yes i solo'd him at 62.<br />
<br />
Quest i'd divide up like this  1/10th factioning up chardok, 3/10ths finding angry goblin, 1/10th getting undead dragon sinew (might be harder for others i got 2 in 30 minutes off juggs), 4/10ths getting drusella (and urn doesnt always drop), 1/10th finding someone to open door to queen.<br />
<br />
So after all that...get hurricane chain arms , and if you get the spirit wracked cords, put them on your wrist~</div></div><hr />

But he only has until July 11th before the revamped zone goes in.  Then it will be much, much harder to kill goblins since they will be level 50ish instead of whatever low level they are now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even better, he can just get faction while in an exp group =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the quick replies guys. kinda dissapointed on the outlook though. I wasnt really planning on doing the whole quest in a row, just more of getting the faction work out of the way before they get revamped. couldnt i just kill the gobos in frontier mtns? i believe they are a few levels lower than inside the temple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure that the FM mobs give the faction hits. If they do than obviously yes you could do that. I do believe that they drop salts/skins but not totally sure about that either, haven't hunted in that neck of the woods in a year or 2 rl time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ya i had to go tow eqatlas myself. i havnt been to kunark since my roomate told me about a place called lake of ill omen :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">goblins in FM DO give faction hits but none elsewhere do (at least not brood of dizok hits) the problem is there are like 10 outside droga and maybe 20 that wander the whole zone....you need to kill 2500-3k goblins and turn in all the salts and skins so you can see how this wont be the best plan :)<br />
<br />
oh and...ANY green goblin can drop a skin but o nly goblins in FM or nurga/droga drop salts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hopefully they will increase the faction hit of killing the blue goblins once the zone changes, can anyone on test confirm?</div></div><hr />
