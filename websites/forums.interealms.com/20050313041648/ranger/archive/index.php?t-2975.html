Subject: Things Delicia may not do in /gu anymore  <br />
 posted 5/13/2002 11:49:52 AM      <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I was recintly placed on guild probation for being me. The following is a list of things I have been told, at one time or another, that I may not do in /GU<br />
<br />
<br />
Things Delicia may not do in /gu anymore.<br />
<br />
I must stop telling n00bies that I'm really a GM on my day off.<br />
<br />
I may not /ignore my chain of command. <br />
<br />
I must not collect &quot;Union dues&quot; from n00bies.<br />
<br />
If the thought of something makes me giggle for longer than 15 seconds, I am<br />
to assume that I am not allowed to do it. <br />
<br />
Crucifixes do not ward off officers, and I should not test that.<br />
<br />
I am not in need of a &quot;+9 dmg against Guild officers sword&quot;. <br />
<br />
There is no such thing as a &quot;lag reduction necklace&quot; and I shouldn't try to<br />
sell them to new members.<br />
<br />
My Leader is not old enough to have fought in the orc war, and I should stop<br />
implying that he did. <br />
<br />
Must not mock command decisions in front of n00bies. <br />
<br />
Never, ever, attempt to correct Miane about anything, even if he wants to<br />
Lay the dragons. <br />
<br />
I cannot trade my officers to the Orcs. <br />
<br />
'I'm drunk' is a bad answer to any question posed by my guild leader. <br />
<br />
The following words and phrases may not be used by me in /gu: Bed snail,<br />
mound mower, batteries, happy toy, necrophilia, 'wiggling my finger as fast<br />
as I can', tingling nippys, Cyber slut, Lesbian mating ritual, Tuna,<br />
Lubrication, Queen of the Bed.<br />
<br />
/gu is not a forum to voice my ideas. <br />
<br />
/gu is not to be used to replace the radio. <br />
<br />
I am not authorized to sell loot rights. <br />
<br />
I am not deliciously saucy. <br />
<br />
I will no longer perform 'lap-dances' while in /gu. <br />
<br />
The revolution is not now. <br />
<br />
Being on Guild Probation does not entitle me to be spanked.<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as a were-virgin. <br />
<br />
We do not 'charge into battle, naked, like the Celts'. <br />
<br />
Must answer an officer with &quot;Yes Sir&quot; or &quot;No Sir&quot;, not with &quot;Hang on, I'm<br />
playing Gems&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The voices in my head told me too&quot; is not an excuse.<br />
<br />
My body may be a temple, but I may not tell people to come inside for a<br />
religious experience.<br />
<br />
I am not allowed to sing &quot;99 bottles of beer&quot; all the way through in /gu<br />
ever again. <br />
<br />
I must not flaunt my deviances in front of my officers.<br />
<br />
Not allowed to lead a 'Coup' during raids. <br />
<br />
Not allowed to get killed.<br />
<br />
May not call any officers immoral, untrustworthy, lying, slime, even if they<br />
are a rogue. <br />
<br />
Must never ask an officer if they've been smoking guk weed. <br />
<br />
Must not tell any officer that I am smarter than they are, especially if<br />
it's true. <br />
<br />
Not allowed to sell &quot;Rare spawn locating rods&quot; to n00bies.<br />
<br />
Not allowed to attempt to appeal to one's baser instincts in recruiting<br />
players. <br />
<br />
I am not authorized to fire officers.<br />
<br />
I may not use public masturbation as a tool to demonstrate a flaw in a<br />
command decision. <br />
<br />
Not allowed to trade guild bank equipment for 'magic beans'. <br />
<br />
I may not feed my Guild leader to Megadon.<br />
<br />

Bah! I've quit guilds that tried to force me to call people sir and m`am because they are &quot;Higher rank than me&quot;<br />
<br />
May not call any officers immoral, untrustworthy, lying, slime, even if they <br />
are a rogue. <br />
<br />
Bah! Bah I say to that!<br />
<br />
<br />
I barely got a chuckle out of the thread... not really that funny imo.</div></div><hr />
