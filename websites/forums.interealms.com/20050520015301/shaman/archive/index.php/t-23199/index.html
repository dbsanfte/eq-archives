&quot;Relax.  Breathe deeply.  You're looking at information culled by a 3rd party program...and in most cases of the things you're complaining about, the information is just dead wrong.  Wait til you see what is actually in store before you burst into flames. <br />
 <br />
The actual AAs should be on beta in the next day or two.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah but third party programs are not covered in the NDA. so that is all we are allowed to talk about.<br />
<br />
Only problem with the lack of communication is even a little snippet even if wrong is treated as word of god. <br />
<br />
Sad but true. Even if we know what the Aa are going to be because of beta... guess what we cant talk about it..<br />
<br />
Going into an expansion blind again is wrong. I am not doing it.<br />

<br />
What AA?<br />
<br />
As for Lucy info being incorrect and so on...strangely, i trust the parsed data more than i trust the words they post on their message boards.<br />
<br />
And finally, why do they need an NDA on a beta for an expansion that's coming out in a few weeks? Are they afraid WoW is going to copy their amazing new technology that can automatically churn out 3,000 bazillion variations of their skeleton and reaver models?</div></div><hr />

I suspect that SOE are saying don't believe lucy for two reasons. First,  lucy does not parse or recognise all the info in the database. After all, in spiritual channeling, what does &quot;Unknown #324 (100/180/0)&quot; mean? We can infer that it might be some form of mana transfer but, in reality, we have no idea what it is solely from the lucy entry. We don't even know for sure which classes have which abilities yet. The second reason is that this is all subject to change.<br />
<br />
And finally, why do they need an NDA on a beta for an expansion that's coming out in a few weeks?<br />
This is standard business practice for any beta program. It is the same with WoW, EQ2, SWG and every other MMORPG. THey don't want people revealing details that are yet to be finalised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I suspect that SOE are saying don't believe lucy for two reasons.... <br />
<br />
I know what they say. My experience is that parsed spell data (remember the spdat???), now seen on Lucy has consistently been more accurate and free of BS than the guff SoE throws around.<br />
<br />
Also, it is obvious the AAs and spells will change, but the earlier we get a look at the ideas -- seeing as the SoE developers do not share them -- the earlier we can see where they are heading.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's speculation, but that's half the fun leading up to an x-pack.<br />
<br />
THey don't want people revealing details that are yet to be finalised.<br />
You missed the point. There is nothing to reveal, particularly at this late stage. Why bother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It more freaks me out they're still building the damn stuff. Constructing the AA's during beta shows signs of a project running way behind time.</div></div><hr />

Warlord's Tenacity III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4927&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Resolute defiance is the exact same thing, only it is a larger magnitude effect. Also, the listing of new skills as they appear in Lucy is in alphabetical order of the classes. Resolute defiance is directly below Ancestral aid, which is obviously a shaman skill. Warriors are the next class after shaman alphabetically, so their aas should be listed directly after the shaman ones. Resolute defiance has to be a warrior aa.</div></div><hr />

How much does the GoD ward heal for and how long? The only info i could find was that the recast is 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Digressing again, but... is the ward a straight steal of the totem thing from WoW? Just as well SoE has an NDA -- they wouldn't want other companies to see what other things they were ripping off ahead of release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's just the name of the upgrade to canni5<br />
<br />
Overall so far of all the classes I've checked out we actually get the most upgrades and the most unique spells.  Clerics have good stuff too.  Druids get nothing of significant note on top of what all healers get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There seems to be an all-class port to safe zone AA called Origin.<br />

<br />
Improved Critical Affliction<br />
This ability grants damage-over-time spells an increased chance to have a critical effect each time they are active.<br />
<br />
The 3 that look specific to shamans seem pretty craptacular to me <br />
<br />
Improved regen ward - Doh, every priest has this and with the amount of clerics in our guild it is our clerics that use this spell 95% of the time.<br />
Spirit Channeling - Cast spells from hitpoints (not mana) - potentially useful, will probably have a 2 hour re-use making it like rabid bear i.e. pretty useless.<br />
Ancestral Aid - Unsure, it had better be mgbable or its same old, same old.<br />
<br />
Beastlords get a stun...........???????? &lt;boggle&gt;. Give them plate armour and a rez and they now replace paladins AND shamans.<br />
<br />
Roar of Thunder<br />
When this ability is activated, the beastlord will unleash a terrible roar that damages and stuns its opponent.<br />
<br />
Nothing much there to make me go Wow, i want to buy this expansion. Enough stuff there to make me seriously think WoW, wonder when its going to be available (pun intended) :)<br />
<br />

With several other general ones, such as the ability to crit HoTs and Improved chance to crit DoTs being applicable to us.<br />
<br />
Overall, not bad, about what I expected.  The key, as was said, will be the cost, and the actual implementation.  Still a wait and see situation, but sure, I'd like some of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">i see the 5 min perma canni thing as the only good thing we get... everything else is crap, and druids STILL get their rez.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully the list i saw from beta is gonna make it thru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">OK just looged into the server and now finaly see whats here.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off the stat increase things.  Big deal, we know how great those are right ? But that was expected so lets move on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Origin -  Quite obvious to me, though i might be wrong, that this will send you back to your home city. So basicly you made my spirit stone which i was so proud of and that is cheap enough for anyone under 50 to buy pretty easily, useless. Thnx a bunch. <br />
<br />
But actualy i think spirit stones are priest only so in the big picture i guess its good, unless this is a priest only AA, then all i can do is sigh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs slots and spell slots for AA - You know they are out of ideas and know it, when they are charging you for things that should be in the game for free.  Come on man, i dont care if this is 1 AA, its prett stupid in my personal opinion. <br />
<br />
Expansive mind -  Extra flowing thought. Not exciting, but a good thing. This is a worth while AA in my book.<br />
<br />
Slight of Hand - Dont know what this really is, the desription is vague. I would assume it would do things like lessen heal aggro or nuke aggro. Not too bad i guess, but not to good either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing AA - Nothing really special on the % upgrades, but the crit HoT healing is nice, i been wantin that for a long time, so depending on the AA cost, this is potentialy something cool.<br />
<br />
Call of the Wild -  We get this?  Is this a AA all priests are getting ? If so i have to applaud SoE for this, cause even though it SHOULD be a % rez, atleast itll help take the pressure off having a cleric and help the druids in their main healing roles.  Could have been a much better AA, but not to bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Suspended Minion - Dont they stay when you zone now?  Either way this is a craptastic AA cause they should since pets now zone with you. Thisis another expample of how they are running low on creative talent and have to rely on making you pay in AA form, for things they should have in already. This doesnt nothing to add to the enviroment and roleplay, it does everything to remind you your not in a fantasy world, your sitting at your PC wasting hour of lifetime WORKING at a game.   Crappy AA.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid -  Not enough info, but depending on how much it actualy helps us, it MIGHT be useful, also depending on how much the AA cost is.<br />
<br />
The new canni type thing looks interesting, but im worried with its 36 minute recast. If its a 5 min AA with a 36 min refresh, i dunno, will have to see that one more.<br />
<br />
Finaly, the unconsious thing. While i do have to give props for inovation, i think its kinda lame. I would MUCH rather have a new level of ND so i ca buy more HP with AA. But you cant really get too upset, cause like i said, i dont like it, but its useful and its inovative, so props to that.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest is pretty crappy and im not going to bother with them, but hey, i didnt expect them all to be amazing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Over all im not happy. Maybe this is cause its become my default behavior to anything SoE does. Lttle blame on me and a little blame on SoE for that habit. But objectivly as possible i see 2 maybe 3 AA's that i deem truly worthy of getting, which is more then GoD offered me, i havent bought 1 single AA from GoD. Only crit affliction and the new pets look midly desirable in that entire expasion, the rest can be deleted as far as im concerned. I mean come on. 20 freaking AA so i can cast group buffs on my pet? Another exmple of roeplay /off and no fun work/on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So to sum up, i think we are seeing the start of a new trend in the EQ world. Roleplay and vision have long since been dead, this game is no longer about the druids in leather not killing animals cause it doesnt play well with what a druid is, its changed to the druid quading wolves and bunnies cause they need more AA for a extra buff slot. The world of gods and dragons and lore is dead and the corprate machine that just pumps out content, that makes no sense to what EQ is, so they can make more money, just making up names with random letters that make no sense and have crappy un-unified and linear lore attached to it, is whats in its place.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ is truly dead and this expansion puts the final nail and a valiantly fought battle by its community. Everyone of us, me you he clerics the druids, the BST, all of us, begged and pleaded for SoE to change things, every one of us misses the old days of kunark lore and dragons and trolls and ogres that actualy &quot; spek like dis wen da tlk tu yu &quot;.  <br />
<br />
No more marriages, no more fresh inovative ideas and directions, those people are all gone from the team and moving on to new games and new things and taking with it the heart and soul of the game. Like a person just before they die, the spirit is gone and the shell remains to slow dwindle untill is ceases to be. Im just thankful with this expansion it would seem that its not going to be hard to move on from EQ at all, cause they failed in fixing the things and changing the mentality that atleast i personaly have requests and desired.<br />
<br />
<br />
So from this day foward ill still play my shaman, cause ill always love him and remember the good times we had, but the days are counting down will WoW comes out or EQ2 comes out. The days are counting down till my billing runs out and till my shaman will finaly camp out in halas, but with resolution and no regrets in his eyes. I miss him already to be honest. I really find it hard to believe that i can pick this up in EQ2 cause the mentality going on here will just carry over to EQ2 and it just will be a slow painful death all over again. Hopefuly WoW will be playable and enjoyable, cause if not looks like MMORPG's are going to die with EQ for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well thats my thoughts, not as happy and promising as i hoped, but then again, not eveything in life is how we want it.</div></div><hr />

Planar Power = 25 stam (more hp), noticed ya didnt have it already according to your magelo.  If you are maxed already this will add a noticable gain in hp.  If you arent maxed at the old cap then you still have a lot of room to add more stam before putting points here.  Also they added :<br />
<br />
<br />
Chaotic Potential<br />
This ability raises the maximum that your statistics can be increased to with items and spells by 5 points per rank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is the exact same thing, plus 5 more levels.  So there is plenty of non gear hp upgrades out there for you yet.</div></div><hr />

Well said Litgruv. I feel much the same way.<br />
<br />
I actually give the new AA's a solid B+ rating though. They seem to have put some thought into it. But there is a deal breaker for me. The rez. If druids get it and we don't, I will probably re-roll anothe class. It would just make it even more clear that SOE isnt interested in fixing &quot;Uber Shaman With Best Slow&quot; and instead LOVE their druids, cause all the developers probably play one.</div></div><hr />
