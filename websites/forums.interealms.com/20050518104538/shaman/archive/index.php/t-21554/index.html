<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lonig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have read a guide that said I can do this at almost any level since you can buy the items. (dont remember if you could buy EVERYthing or not, but anyway).<br />
<br />
I noticed this is one of those items that is RECOMMENDED level.  So... if I bother to get my 25 shaman this in a few levels, will it have reduced stats like most recommended level items do?<br />
<br />
I'd hate to waste a few k pp and it end up being +1wis or something like that.  I dont know if I can ask this in general instead of quest, but its not really a quest question :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you can buy all 9 items for the earring. On my server people auction the package of items for about 5-6k. Thats usually about what you can buy them for individually if you shop around. If you're patient sometimes tradeskillers will dump a bunch of sickles or robes on the market just to get rid of them.<br />
<br />
The flowing thought effect works at any level, but the stats will be reduced until you reach the recommended level. Every bit of flowing thought helps, though, and the stats are a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28771) and if you look below the item picture you'll see a spot where it says display as level. Just type in your level and it'll display what the stats will be at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lonig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks to you both :)<br />
<br />
Dont think I can justify that much spent right now, but it'll be in my list. heh.<br />
<br />
ps: cool feature on lucy, never even noticed it</div></div><hr />
