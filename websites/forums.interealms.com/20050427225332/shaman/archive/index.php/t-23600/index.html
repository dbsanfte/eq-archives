i farmed cash to buy baz stuff for my twink...ldon tradeable hard mode drops rock...click my pally link, there are some good ideas for buyable stuff that would work for your warror too :)<br />
btw, i have found the ldon stuff way better than ornate for HP/AC.<br />
I'd avoid the LDON hard stuff for right now.  It is extremely overpriced and the level recommendation (or is it 55 req'd?  I forget) won't help you in twinking a new warrior until he's in his upper 40's, and by that point you will probably want to push him to 55 in whatever he's wearing so you can get the 55+ stuff (ornate, hard drops, etc).<br />
<br />
I recommend farming Siren's Grotto named, Tawro &amp; Radir in UP, WW dragons, and the Temple of Droga for all/all or Warrior wearable items.<br />
<br />
With some skill you can take out Fellspine solo for the 34% haste belt.  Some of the other named mermaids and such have some pretty nice all/all drops with no level req's on them as well.  Search the beastiary for Siren's Grotto, examine the loot tables (many of them are large, so this is a bit of a loot lottery) and pick your targets accordingly.  1-2 friends makes this zone alot easier, but with your hp/mana #'s you should be okay solo.  Remember to bind outside just in case things get hairy - which can happen fast if you are alone.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Radir and Spirit of Tawro in Umbral Plains have some nice twink weapons that are no drop but have no level recommendation on them. With skill (&amp; judicious potion usage) you can pull them to the zoneline and kill them there, then just have your invisible warrior (use invis potions or an escort to camp him at the zoneline) loot the weapons.  None of these drops are amazing, but they are usually better than most other stuff commonly available in the bazaar and you can get them free.  In addition to weapons, a bracer of might &amp; bracer of fortitude are pretty good warrior twink wrist items that commonly drop from these mos.  Best part is you can clear both caves solo (if you haven't done it before, might want to bring a friend or two, makes it tons easier) in a single session, netting your warrior a possible 4 items (2 bracers &amp; 2 weapons) in one day.<br />
<br />
Farming WW dragons is another good free source of twink armor for your warrior.  Most of the dragonhide stuff is all/all and has no level recommendation.  If you luck out with a peerless or similar BP drop, you are pretty much set in that department for a long time.<br />
<br />
I'm not familiar with the Velious Plate stuff for warriors in terms of stats, but you could easily farm Kael for the Thurg stuff solo, or even HoT for the SS stuff if you were a little careful.<br />
<br />
Temple of Droga stuff has level recommendations on it, but even so many of the pieces are decent mid-level stuff even with reduced stats.  A Sword of the Bloodsworn &amp; Copper Hammer of Striking is a pretty good set of weapons for a non-uber warrior up to even the 60's, and you can get both pieces free soloing.<br />
<br />
Hope these ideas can be of use to you.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
