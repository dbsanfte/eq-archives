<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our pet has never been hitting for 53, 51 has been the max. Nice to see a 53 hitter though :)<br />
<br />
Heard they upped their attackrating somewhat. Will be interesting to parse this and see what difference it makes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good. I summoned my dog last night and he was hitting for 49. Very dissapointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This could be pretty nice combined with summoning the best pets, if they fix that. (Which I think they did in last night's patch?) Now if only they slightly raised his double hit, bash and dodge caps to go along with it. It'd be nice to be able to depend on Dogdog's help when fighting low blue casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed the pet also can TRIPLE HIT now... TRIPLE! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">!!! First our pets get same resists as us, now always highest lvl, more atk, higher chance to double attack and other attack skills, hits for 53, and can TRIPLE attack...guys, our pets just got alot more useful (not to say they didnt help before).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Our pet can solo dark blues ;)  <br />
<br />
I solo in HHK now and I can pull dark blue with slow and let my pet  tank and do all the damage and not losing more than 2 bubbles of HP, I buff dog dog with regen and haste and he is a bad one now ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
This will help allot when soloing....<br />
