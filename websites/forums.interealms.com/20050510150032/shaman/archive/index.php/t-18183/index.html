<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A quote by Jinheim from the Medicine Cabinet.  <br />
<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 3 (9aa + 12aa prereq) - Gives you a 16% chance to exceptional heal for double healage (2600pt tnargs, doesnt work with kraggs). I feel that our primary role on raids after a mob is debuffed, is to heal. For minor splash damage, I can heal with Q. If someone is getting beat, they need a blast heal. 1300 is a decent heal, but with mobs hitting as hard as they do nowadays, it isn't always enough. A 2600pt heal, though, is almost always enough to save someone's life for long enough for them to lose aggro or gain the attention of a cleric. I perform lots of exceptionals on raids, as most of you have probably seen, and I have saved many people's lives. I feel that healing adept is a good AA, but healing gift is much much better for our purposes. I plan on getting HA soon, though. <br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5 (15aa + 12aa prereq) - This AA makes you get missed a lot more often. I feel that this serves us better than CS + ID. If you get quadded for 2500, and you have ID5, you'll only get quadded for 2000 instead. 10000vs8000 damage doesnt matter, you're still gonna die. If you had had LR5, though, half of the quad might have missed you, and you would only take 5000 damage, which would not kill you. LR5 really works. I often see long strings of misses, and I honestly believe that it has greatly increased my survivability. With this AA, I rampage tanked DXXT, and exp mobs have become laughable. I can now function as the main tank anywhere in a tier2/3 exp group.<br />
<br />
I sit at 101 aa's with the following: Run3 - Regen3 - MC3 - Canni5 - MGB - ND3 - SC1 - SCM3 - SCR3 - SCRM - SC1 - RC1 - VP1 - QB2 and a Haste of Mithaniel item.   <br />
<br />
I don't solo anymore.  I'm either on a LDON Adventure or raiding.  I also like Jinheim said, find myself healing on raids after debuffing.  This is where the healing aa's would come in handy.  But I also find myself getting beat on from Tnarg's agro, usually when I'm the main healer in a LDON Adventure.  ( Kragg's is at the back of the spell book.  Too little for too long a cast.  With my IH4 item, it's gone for good. )  LR sounds like it would help me survive here.  Been going back and forth here and would appreciate any insight.  <br />

I still dont have healing aa's other than one rank of crits, but its on my list eventually.  Defensive aa first imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same inner debate, now that I have CA3 and am about to buy LR1 I am thankfull I chose this route. I get hit alot, mostly cash farming (buying Ornate Bracers and Legs, sick of camping them and losing to non-chain)<br />
<br />
Now I have CA3 I get hit less, I cant wait for LR5<br />
<br />
BTW A lot of people seem to overlook/forget .. Defensuive AA's = less interupts, IMO this is far more beneficial than not losing HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Both LR5 and healing aa are great aa's.<br />
<br />
LR5 makes you survive more, which indirectly benefits your raid/group when you catch aggro etc as folks above have mentioned.<br />
<br />
Healing. Heals are unresistable, and there is no such thing as 'too much' healing on some pop encounters. <br />
<br />
If you raid a lot and are consistently short of healers then healing AA can really be beneficial. Sure your not going to keep up the MA on yer own, but when a few clerics have bought the farm and the chain is shakey a lucky 3k+ tnarg or two can smooth out the curve. Also, very nice for spam healing on engage or vs proc/tap mobs, again stops clerics getting munched as quick, plus with LR you can take a bit of heal aggro ;)<br />
<br />
For Ldon, well I do mostly hard mode; i'm usually on support heals/keeping CoD ench up; I have lost count of the number of times a 3k heal has saved a partial/full wipe, esp. when the cleric catches heal aggro on a bad pull and has to DA (ie: Div arb used etc)<br />
<br />
For xp camps (pre-elemental) it often means I can go along as only healer/debuffer with 5 melees and be compeletly effective, just bring a pally to rez (same applies to normal Ldon).<br />
<br />
Overall, i really enjoy the 'chaos' factor of healing aa, a few lucky/chain crits can really make me smile ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LR5 first, and maybe a level of healing crits for eye candy and the off chance it would save someone some day :)</div></div><hr />

I still have no intention to work on healing aa.<br />
Next I will go for quick buff.<br />
<br />
I am usually the main slower and healer for my group. I found that I rarely heal with Mending, just Q all the way. Maybe 2-3 casts of Mending during an entire LDoN adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if you're dead you can't heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm so honored to be quoted :D<br />
<br />
I wrote that guide long before LDoN came out, so let me give my thoughts on what these AA mean nowadays.<br />
<br />
In LDoN, we can play a variety of roles.  In a pickup group, I am usually functioning as the puller.  I pull several mobs at once, and use VP + ornate legs to CC them while the rest of my group picks one and kills it.  If there is no ench (and thus no mezz) I dot and nuke the adds while my group works on the rest.  Stacking Bane + BoS + a few nukes is actually surprisingly good damage.  However, we all know what happens when you start stacking dots.  You get hit, a lot.  What I do is just dot a lot of mobs, try to keep them rooted, and if I can't keep them rooted I just back in to a corner and quiescence myself, then continue on with the dotting.  Between full defensive AA's and respectable AC, I can pretty much ignore the melee damage of a 2-3 slowed LDoN mobs.  In my mind, this greatly outweighs the benefits of healing AA's.  Don't get me wrong, healing AA's are still great for ldon, but they aren't nearly as good as defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
In hard adventures, defensive AA are even better.  In a normal adventure, defensive AA allow me to play like a jackass and not die.  In hard adventures, they are a major boost to my survivability.  The mobs hit very hard, and you really want to have defensive AA.  Healing AA's, again, will help you a lot, but not nearly as much as defensive AA.<br />
<br />
On raids, it really depends on what you are raiding.  There are some places, like vex thal, where you don't really need to heal that much.  There are, however, a ton of adds and you are bound to get aggro repeatedly if you are trying to slow them.  The mobs don't hit overly hard to begin with, so with defensive AA, you're have a much better chance of debuffing and surviving.  I rarely have to heal in VT (assuming I am doing it with a whole guild and not a small 2-group crew), so healing AA doesn't help that much there.  On most pop raids, there are fewer adds, and they are easier to control.  Thus, you are less likely to get aggro while debuffing.  Also, the mobs hit much much harder, so backup heals are more and more necessary as you get further in to pop.  There are exceptions to this, though, such as the bertoxx ring, where (if you are doing your job, at least) you can expect to be getting hit nonstop for 500ish.  You definately need defensive AA there.<br />
<br />
For most PoP bosses, you are pretty safe from ever getting aggro unless you are trying to.  You already mentioned it yourself, and I have said it a million times:  I feel our role on raids is to debuff first, and then heal.  I do not dot on raids, I chain-cast tnargs on whoever needs it.  It is very satisfying to watch yourself crit for 3200+ repeatedly, and even more satisfying when one of your crits saves someone's life.<br />
<br />
So, to sum it up, when I am fighting a pop boss, I get a lot more use out of my healing AA's than I do my defensive AA's.  When I am clearing for pop raids, it is pretty evenly split, they are both valuable.  In LDoN, I use my healing AA's a lot, but my defensive AA's are getting constant use.  You should decide which of these is most important to you, and spend accordingly.  However, I would suggest doing defensive AA's first.  As someone else said, you can't heal if you are dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was thinking along the same lines, and then asked myself what caused me or someone in my group/raid to die more often, and come up with me getting hit on until I ran out of hps was the most common occurence, so I decided to get LR5 first, and I am glad I did, LR5 is fantastic - get it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did LR5 and ID5 before i started any healing stuff, and i must say LR5 is so nice, i got the healing stuff now and well yeah its ok to heal for 1700 but not super AAs, thats maybe because i dont like doing healing stuff, im more like debuff and DoT</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know how effective or not LR5 is, but I have yet to see any parses that use any kind of constants, given the fact that it takes most people at least a week or 2 to grind from nothing to LR5 and no one has ever actually held all the AAs and used the same mob and identical gear and buffs each time. From what Ive seen noone has even come close to that on parses. Scientific method is the key, without it you may as well post a chili recipe instead of parses.<br />
<br />
I can personally tell you I take substantially less damage from mobs in the same areas as I did before I had LR5, however I took like a month to get to it and in that time I also began getting Time lvl gear, so I have no way of knowing what actually made the difference. (I have several pieces with dodge modifiers??? you tell me wth that means)</div></div><hr />

Same gear, same buffs, same mob!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">LR5.  You'll never regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If I wasn't lazy and had a bit of foresight, I'd have parsed LR5 myself.<br />
<br />
However, I am lazy, so instead of using parses, I will argue for LR5 from another perspective.<br />
<br />
I have all healing AAs as well as LR5 and ID5, and from my personal perspective, I use LR5 far more often than I need healing AAs. To clarify that statement, the life of a shaman who stretches his abilities to their limits is a life full of &quot;so and so hit you for such and such damage&quot;, and getting hit for less, or not getting hit at all, is always better than having to spend mana to heal.<br />
<br />
From a raid perspective, there are too many mobs that can beat a shaman into the ground in 5 secs or less, therefore even a tiny chance of avoiding a hit is more valuable than any potential healing I can do in these situations.<br />
<br />
With that being said, healing AAs make a *huge* difference in our healing ability. In fact, with full healing AAs, I can match a lesser equipped cleric in raw healing power from doing LDoN to camping regruas in PoWater.<br />
<br />
LR5 and healing AAs are both important, but remember, the dead heals no one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for all who replied.  I know CA/LR is an often debated topic.  Where I am at currently in my aa journey, I was facing a choice of heading down the Healing or CA/LR path.  After reading over the posts here a few times, I have spent my 7 stored aa's on CA 1 and 2 and will continue towards the goal of LR5.  Yes, 27 aa points is a long ways off for me, but from the advice from my fellow Shaman here, that path will be of the most benefit to me atm.  <br />
<br />
Reb<br />
<br />
P.S.  Look for another post from me in 3 months whether to head down the Healing or CS path.  Of course AFTER LR5 is in the books!   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Havent made up my mind yet, just finished LR4 and have no healing AA's.  I like LR4 a lot, but wish I could help out a lot more on the healing during boss mob encounters, so healing AAs will definitely be next.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I mgb f07 and my mana bar barely moves! And I can tnargs for a looong as time and I credit it mostly to scm saving me mana.. <br />
