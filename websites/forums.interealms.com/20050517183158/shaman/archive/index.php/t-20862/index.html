<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if this is in the wrong forum, even after viewing these forums for close to a year and a half I still have little sense in what belongs where  :confused:  <br />
  Anyway, my account was banned (I owe them a payment that was contested,  but I almost have the cash to pay it off) so the question is, would it be worth it to re-activate my account and keep on going (65 Shaman with 15 AA) or just keep to CS, BF 1942/Vietnam.  Thanks for all of your input, for from what I have read it seems to be going downhill and have lost most sense of playing, so all input is definately appreciated, thanks friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's your money, do you still wanna play EQ or not? Do you have friends to come back to?  How long have you been gone.  The high end Shaman are really screaming about the &quot;uselessness&quot; of the Shaman in the end game.  I still love it, but then again, I'm no where near the &quot;endgame&quot;.  Good Luck in whatever you decide.</div></div><hr />

Man, if paying for this game is strapping you for cash then you have a whole lot more to worry about than where to get that next AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You didn't include the most critical piece of info for us to help you with this.<br />
<br />
Were you still having fun with your shaman or were you just putting in the time hoping for something better?<br />
<br />
Don't worry about what anyone else says about their experience here.  It's all about how you feel.  Remember, it's your money not anyone else's that's paying for you to have fun.  If you aren't then it's time to stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are having fun, by all means keep playing.  Personally, the game was not fun for me anymore, so I quit.</div></div><hr />

stay away for a couple weeks and get some perspective, play some other games- connect with real life, then come back.</div></div><hr />

Yup, already did that.  Also to answer some questions I meant just got the cash as in I have the money to repay the money I owe them.  I was having fun, yes I have MANY friends to see again too, the very day I was banned was suppose to be my first open-raid that I hoped to crown a new tradition (Manaetic Behemoth was the target, if I come back if your on BB shoot me a tell about him)<br />
I wasnt really sure because I never experienced any high-end PoP so I wanted to know if it really is great. (Highest thing ive fought was Grummus but had a blast)<br />
  Thanks for anymore input to this!</div></div><hr />
