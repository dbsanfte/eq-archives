<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried of pop grouping? Hate pick up groups? Miss the dungeon crawl? (ok im done now) I finally found my place to grind out 58 and im going to share it so that us soloers have a spot in the high 50s.<br />
<br />
The place: Chardok.<br />
<br />
I my self bind out side in the big field before the gates of chardok. I didn’t see any roamers at the time so im guessing its safe. Invis up and zone in. Now I was doing the entrance for awhile but got tired of people killing my mobs on the way in. im guessing it would be the same thing with the exit too. So I did some digging and found a topic on here =) anyway with invis up run to the fort. (if you’ve never been here it’s a building with a bunch of mobs on it) now take a deep breath and run right through the door. Yes you’ll aggro everything on the way but don’t worry. When you get to the bridge fall off. They will take a minute or two to path down giving you time to camp out to clear the hate list. (please make sure no one is on the other side or camping the fort before doing this) the first time I did this there was this damn froglok that wouldn’t let me camp. if you see something that will aggro you down there take it out asap before you try and camp. all the slaves (3) were apprehensive to me, I have no idea what faction they are on so I hope no one is KoS when trying this. The froglok scowled, but after I took out the first frog a ratman popped so I didn’t have to worry about it again.<br />
<br />
this is your pull spot. Its safe for you to go afk and do whatever you want. Summon a dog and buff it however you want. Mobs here are mid to high 40s with the occasional SK or caster. (usually necro from what ive seen) you will never run out of mobs here, and they are spaced perfectly so that you can single pull each time. Spawn time is pretty quick too so watch out when that first mobs pops again not to be pulling. (anyone know the spawn time down here?) because it’s a kunark dungeon mobs don’t have insane HP. You can do 1 of 3 things. You can alpha dog, epic, bane, and VoS will take it down to about 15% when vos/bane wear off. Or you can alpha dog, epic, bane, and ebolt which will take them out fully without the dots doing full duration (I don’t do this because I feel it’s a waste of mana but if you want faster xp go right ahead =)) or if you don’t have epic: dog, bane, ebolt, and VoS should take them out. With JBB I imagine this camp would be sad. This camp is very easy to keep. Even if you pull sloppy and get an add just root park it and throw on a DoT or two while your pet deals with one. Ive never gotten close to dying in here at 58. Loot is 0-5 plat, exp was pretty good for soloing. (being a dungeon with a ZEM) AA exp is 1% a kill. I *think* you could stay here until 60 if you wanted, which is what im probably going to do. Fyi, Im an iksar so I have a 20% penalty, people who are not the supreme race my get different exp rates. I also have an extended affliction 3 item so DoT damages may very a bit.<br />
<br />
What I love about this camp is that I can log on for half an hour kill some mobs and just camp out down there. Since I don’t get much time to play anymore this works best for me. Also, if have a spiritstone you can gate to your home town and restock on food/drink, pet weapons C3 whatever. And just gate back to burning woods and do your insane run again. DO NOT BIND DOWN THERE! It may sound like a good idea but if you die outside of chardok you’re going to have a fun time getting your self out =D<br />
<br />
I also heard that if you have levi you can do this tunnel next to the exit. Just run up the tunnel out of chardok to get some height and run up there. It has the same mobs from what ive heard so XP should be the same. It could be an alternative if this camp is taken (anyone know the name?)<br />
<br />
If you’re on brell no touchies! Jk hehe I don’t get much time to play now-a-days so you probably wont have to worry about me there.<br />
<br />
Hope you guys enjoy this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mobs that you pull from below the bridge are the same mobs that you'd be pulling from the tunnel (solo a 58 shaman can probably only clear 1/2-3/4 of the tunnel.)  This is assuming that you aren't pulling from toward the Bridgekeeper and Captain (a left after you leave your little alcove).  Chardok is a good place for a soloing pre60 shaman to get to 60, then proceed to FG (since you can't single pull there until 60) to breeze through 60 (or get aa)... that is if you like mindless exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What about going to Droga killing for faction? Then going deep into Chardok for ez pull spots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Droga factioning is mindnumbingly tedious, and it's not worth doing just to get to a good exp spot in Chardok. You will lose that hard won faction very quickly, and will end up doing more faction work than exp work. You'd be much better off simply spending the time in a not-quite-so-good solo spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are there any okay solo spots near entrance?  Where singles can be reasonably pulled?  I've been thinking about Chardok, and if it weren't for the long trot from the FV book I'd probably be there right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">entrance is pretty good solo xp. the mobs are easy and you can single pull 57+ (I think thats the magic number). at 58 the whelps are light blue though and the underlings will be next level from what I heard. what ticked me off most about it was when people ran through killed all your mobs. then you have nothing to do for about 15 minutes... exit can be bad for the opposite reason, some one will get a train from camping the fort and you'll have a bunch of mobs on their way to the exit. but mabye I just have bad luck with things =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You got it there Psycotika.  That's the best way to solo chardok pre-60.  When you get to 60 you can single pull most of the soloable part of the zone until you get a bit into the mines or head to the palace.  That's when chardok gets really fun.  My xp sessions there would be: grab c3 (and aego if possible) in nexus, grab ride to sf, once in chardok I would just start at the fort and kill everything I could until c3 wore off (or start at the lev tunnel, either way).<br />

You can solo past the bridge if you really feel up to it :)</div></div><hr />
