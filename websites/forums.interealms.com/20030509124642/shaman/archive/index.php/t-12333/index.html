<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't think there is one, turned mine in as Barb with no faction work at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pretty sure JD is on beta neutral</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks. I thought as much, but a 'friend' kept insisting I had to work my faction up to Ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ally on WHAT?   Jaled's a traitor, that's why he rewards you for killing his old dragon buddies...  And he give you a key to further damage his enemies...  He's completely neutral</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the faction work is for Zlandicar. If you want to get the key to open the door to get to Jaled Dar, you either have to kill Zlandicar (and take it) or kill the rats (or ratmen? -- I forget, as I haven't hunted much in DN) to build up Zlandicar faction (and Zland gives it to you). Supposedly, a rogue of sufficient lockpicking skill can open up the door for you, but I'm not sure on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A high skill rogue can definitely open the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">rogue needs over 210 skill (which can only be obtained via +lockpick skill items).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">rogue needs over 210 skill (which can only be obtained via +lockpick skill items).<br />
<br />
My guildleader is max skill with +2% item and he picked it for me, I think pick caps at 200, and 2% would be 204.  really, I think any +lockpick item will work if they're at max skill.  It's much easier that way than making a key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lock pick caps at 200 at lvl50, at lvl60 it caps at 210.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that Jaled Dar's door CAN'T be picked at 210 alone (first hand experience here), you need a skill over 210 via +% Lock Pick items (most common being Mechanicized/Tinkered Lock Picks).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You don't need a rogue to access Jaled's room. <br />
<br />
Go behind Jaled's room along the cliff wall, work your way up the  rocks, and lev over on top of the room. Hella gfx breakup around here so don't fall into another area. There's a small hole in the ceiling. Drop down, lev'd, but be sure to angle yourself onto his platform as he's tough to reach if you're on the ground floor. <br />

Gratzi ST key.</div></div><hr />
