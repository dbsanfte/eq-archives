<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So for kicks a group of me and guildies have been doing the PoJ trials over the last few days.  Was me, monk, wiz, cleric, enc, and druid, all 65, in vt/ssra gear, most over 100 aas, etc.  Long since been to PoV/S, but wanted to see if we could beat em all to check out the 7th Hammer.  Was a lot of fun figuring these trials out.  They are all a good challenge that require you to really think about the best way to overcome the difficulty presented by each trial.  So even tho we all took a few deaths to beat each trial, was a lot of fun.  <br />
<br />
Until the dreaded Flame, lol.  That trial has got to be the lamest thing ever designed.  Mobs poof if you don't engage them, don't chase you if you try to move them, sit there invulnerable pretty much while you try to kill em... you name it, lol.  So after a whole night of working on this one we still couldn't figure it out.  Thought I'd come here to see if anyone knew if the whole poofing and 0 chase range was just a bug?  Or if its really supposed to be like that.  Btw, they poof and go invulnerable all over the room, not just at the central post thing.  Any tips or pointers would be cool.  Not fishin for a full spoiler, but there's gotta be something fundamental to this that I'm not seeing, cuz no way can the same group that dominates all 5 other trials come to this one and not even make it to wave 3, heh.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any hints, and definitely recommend you all try the other trials.  They're definitely the funnest thing in the game atm imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh...  maybe you did it before some patch?  Imps = non-mezzable, up to and including Bliss.  There's a rare spawn type of them called a fiery aggressor that can be raptured, but the rest you can't mez.  As for ignoring the spirits, heh, tried that and it flunked us.  /shrug.  Ah well, back to beating my head against the wall for a while.  /kudos VI  ;)</div></div><hr />
