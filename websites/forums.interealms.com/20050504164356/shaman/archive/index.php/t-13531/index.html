<br />
Please post any advice, links etc that a 65 shaman on a blue server could use to educate himself about PVP (Duels)<br />
<br />
I'm very very bored and have received a challenge from a rival guild, know I am capable of killing them all, I just want to get the basics down-pat so I can make the most of the training time I have.<br />
<br />
I need to learn, spell line ups, strafing (what is strafing) tricks ... heck I need to learn it all.<br />
<br />
So far I have found this http://www.notacult.com/guide_trollshaman.html via Google, you chap on red servers, got any links to some helpfull info?<br />
<br />
This is me.....<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66077<br />
<br />
I have spirit call, C5<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Barb<br />
<br />
EDIT my AC in the magelo is screwed and I do have a full complement of BD gear, Wurm shield etc which I have not got around to putting in profile yet......assume reasonable NToV level resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Duelling is not really something you should ask Red Server Shaman about - we don't in general, duel a lot. Duels are so formal, and stifle creativity. Many duels require no buffs before duel starts, but no shaman on a PvP server ever goes into combat without buffs on - just like no melee class would go around without armor / weapons. Many duels are fought in a predetermined small area - this does not suit a shaman who generally has a movement speed advantage over most classes. Without resorting to lame tactics (training mobs, for example), a freeform PvP has a lot more leeway for creativity<br />
<br />
Here are a few things to think about.<br />
<br />
1. Instant Click items:<br />
Things like SoW booties, Grim Aura Earring etc. If you are allowed to pre-buff for the duel, a caster will probably try to strip your buffs with cancel/annul/pillage etc...Using insta click buffs allows you to protect your important buffs. More insta clickers = better. Make hotkeys for each one.<br />
<br />
2. Buff management:<br />
You want to try to have your first couple of buff slots free so that any nasty spells that stick to you can be cancelled (or pumiced) without having to cancel your useful buffs.<br />
<br />
3. Potions:<br />
Potions like damage shields, resist potions, stinging wort potions can give you a significant edge in PvP. I would have the high level DS potion as a bare minimum against any melee class (and agains a monk, they own)<br />
<br />
4. Spell slots<br />
Free up as many slots as possible by having useful clickable items. For example, earring of cleansing, earring of purity for cure disease / poison. The more spell slots you can have for other spells the better. Even consider getting the neck that summons a pet<br />
<br />
5. Nasty items:<br />
Snare is a winner in PvP if you can land it - the easiest clicky snare item is the webs from crystal cavern - head there and get a few. Farm the Divine Aura item that drops from the boss orc in Highpass Hold<br />
<br />
6. Mana conservation.<br />
Against most casters, he whos mana lasts longest wins (not true against necros, but not a bad rule of thumb). Remember that it takes much less mana to heal/cure/remove a spell than it costs to cast that spell. Shaman are not particularly good at handing out massive damage, but we can win by outlasting. Concentrate on keeping yourself healed and cure all DoTs etc, and you can be sure that you are burning up less mana than your opponent. Once a caster's mana is gone, they are easy meat.<br />
<br />
7. Know your enemy. <br />
Tactics that will work against a monk might be useless against a SK, etc. Against any caster aspecially snaring caster, get your resists up the wazoo (use potions to raise resists more). Dont try to toe-to-toe melee a melee class. also, as a general rule, if you arent actually casting a spell, do not EVER stop moving. Try to get competent using 3rd person view if at all possible because it will help you against nimble opponents. Know that a rogue is pretty useless if you can get your back protected by a corner or wall. A monk is much less dangerous if he cannot knock you back to interrupt your spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Strafing<br />
In its simplest form, strafing is simply using the Ctrl control button and left or right arrow keys with autorun on, which makes you run diagonally and sideways at the same time. &quot;Circle strafing&quot; is more difficult, but useful. using the mouse to pan one way while using the arrow and control kets to move sideways in the other direction will make you move in a circle facing inwards. So you can circle strafe from an opponent's frant to their back without turning your back on them. Its tricky, so practice it.<br />
<br />
9. Use the terrain<br />
If it is a steep terrrain, levitation and runing around can hurt a non-levitated player badly<br />
<br />
running at full tilt up a hill and making a sharp turn can cause a &quot;ghost&quot; imagewarp that makes it look as though you are still running up the hill whereas you are actually not - this can buy you time to get a spell off, or can just be useful in shaking an opponent off allowing you to change spells, cast slow heals etc.<br />
<br />
10. Practice makes perfect.<br />
PvP is so different from PvE. Try to practice as much as possible. Go to an arena with friends and PvP against each other again and again and again...just because you get your ass handed to you the first time doesnt mean you arent gonna be able to kick their ass after the 20th time.<br />
<br />
I could write heaps more, but there are a few things for you to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you are gonna die a mean nasty horrible death and wonder why pvp servers have any shaman at all.<br />
<br />
(we get sow first for easier CR)<br />
<br />
get all your resists up with gear as good as you can.  hotkey your sow boots again.  MR better be over 170 without being buffed.<br />
<br />
against multiple opponents, properly prepared, even a higher lvl shaman stands little chance.<br />
<br />
your dog will get rooted/feared.  there is even a possibility that a bard can poof it.<br />
<br />
all your buffs/resists don't mean squat against enough people, because if they spend a few plat each for pumice they all get a cancel magic clickie item that strips your buffs.  if, and i mean if you are decent, you can constantly reapply sow instantly from boots and constantly have them just cancel the same spell over and over.<br />
<br />
snare.  if you get snared it is about all over but the crying.  you can't catch their runners and if you stop to kill someone rooted, they will swarm you.  worse, rangers will lead off your pet, kill it, come back for you.  root is easier to break than snare.<br />
<br />
blind, if you get hit with Tash; there is a practical possibility you will get blinded.<br />
<br />
Winged D, you have to have all your buff slots filled with the best buffs last and then click off two.  do sow as number 1, #2 vacant, the progress up the buffs thru 14.<br />
<br />
buy your own pumice so you can cancel necro's and druid spells.  when you get hit with one, click off sow, right click pumice, again if necessary, reapply sow, and off you go.<br />
<br />
alchemey shines in pvp.  in gen inventory have cure poison, disease, regen and DShield.  TASH is Cure POISON.<br />
<br />
your dots will be cured to fast if they know what they are doing.  even if they don't they will only die from disease dots long after they have celebrated around your corpse.<br />
<br />
stuns will interupt you.  cleric cast and from pet proc weapons like gnoll hide lariets.  and the wiz line like careless lightining.<br />
<br />
you have to heal yourself or at half some SK is going to death touch you.<br />
<br />
i seriously doubt that at 65 and more AA than a FoH member, you could take an epic mage pet with your dog out of the picture.  same with the nasty necro spell or a manaburn Wizard.<br />
<br />
jousting is what you need to learn.  thing is, your only hope is epic, for the manaless damage and they way it is based and resisted.<br />
<br />
jousting is hitting the attack button only when you need to, then turning it off when you don't need it.<br />
<br />
hehe.  example.  you are fighting a rooted monk, with a REIF (you are hosed, wrong weapon) bust out the huge delay, huge damage 2 blunt.  if you are a barb use the barb spir hammer for the proc or Blight<br />
<br />
here is what you do.  monk is rooted.  you run at him, at the instant you pass him hit attack, swing (hopefully connect), turn off attack (all this still running) wait for attack to refresh, turn around, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
if you stand toe to toe with someone with higher DPS than you, you will end up dying.  the way to beat that is to eliminate being in range of them when you are not doing damage because of weapon delay.<br />
<br />
because each computer is different in packet travel, practice this in a newbie zone while running.  run over the mob and hit attack for optimal effectiveness.  you will have to practice so that you do not get the message that your target is out of range.<br />
<br />
spells.  all depends on who you have to face.  a different line up for almost each class you face.  but fastest root, fastest debuff, fastest heal, and poison DD spells.  CR is to easy to get up, ,PR is harder.  cripple if you are against a melee<br />
<br />
weapon.  remember how i just confused you with jousting?  throw that out the window if you are on a pure caster. their DPS is in bursts same as yours is.  get in close with the fastest weapon you have and realize you need to kill them quick if they are a pet class because your dog only lasts so long.<br />
<br />
get a see invis item.  what are you going to do when the rogue just hits sneak?  sit down and start to mem the spell while he gets a free shot at maximum damage bstab from you sitting? i hope not.  (on pvp servers, players go off target when they invis , unless you can see invis.  how it works on duels on blue servers i have no clue.)<br />
<br />
setting up.  if it is against a melee start as far away as possible so you get a few casts in.  if caster start as close as possible so they don't.<br />
<br />
equip the dog.  if you have the time and mana buff the dog with everything.  i am not sure they are stuck with the 15 buff rule.<br />
<br />
open up with epic dot.  then think about switch weapons depending on who you face.<br />
<br />
you won't see me on the thread about removing the flags from pop; i don't know squat about that so no need for me to be there.  i took a shaman to 40 on Vallon, then a shaman to 52 on Sullon.  Sullon is mean, nasty, obscene, vicious and i would bet RL money that the mighty voices we see here on this board could not run a barb shaman to 30 on Sullon without twinkage.  i honestly wonder how many tried when Sullon came out, and then used the expansions as an excuse to come back blue.<br />
<br />
seriously pvp is about the gears and the lvls; but a lot of it is also about preparation.  on a pvp server you have to be prepared all the time, or sure nuff when you aren't you are dead.<br />
<br />
on Sullon Verant kept stats as to who had the most kills.  the best shaman i can remember had a druid partner that tracked for him, then they unprepared people that had mobs on them (sounds like great fun, doesn't it)<br />
<br />
while i am not going to bet on you, i wish you luck.  shaman are not the best pvp class.  but you might get lucky and the other people be worse at duels than you due to them knowing less about it than you.  but i am still not putting money on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">55 shaman on Sullon Zek k thnx =)... alot of good pvp'ers gave me some advice not too long ago.. if you search for the thread its there but as you can see from this (sullon zek boards)<br />
<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/sz_summary.jsp<br />
<br />
don't bet too much pp on a shaman beating any other class &quot;hands down&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do not listen to the above poster, bonestomper (not ninth), stopped reading after he said you'd have no chance against a mage epic pet.   Turgur's or blind &gt; mage pets.  (level 58 or so is when you can land spells on them more consistently)<br />
<br />
If you're fighting a pet class you can turgur the pet and then not worry about it, or keep it blinded/rooted.<br />
<br />
I would suggest annuling/pumicing 3 or 4 times before you did anything else.   Then go with a malo (don't wanna dispell it) then try to root/blind.   Then go offensive.<br />
<br />
It's kind of a thin line to tread with how you decide to fight.    Go all out offensive after debuffing or stay defensive and wear them down.    I tend to think most people get suprised and panicked if you go offensive right away.   Put one dot on them, use poison, and not disease.   They'll panick trying to get rid of it and then you wanna use your poison nukes.   Not a whole lot of dmg, but resisted less than our cold (after debuffing them) and are our fasted casting dmg spells.<br />
<br />
Use your pet if you can.   The guy above said a ranger will take it far away and snare it.   Why would you let him take it away?   Don't let him, pet back off is your friend.   If your pet does get rooted or snared, stay right next to him or make a melee &quot;run through&quot; him to get to you.  You can also dispell the snare/root if need be.<br />
<br />
Against a level 65 bard, necro, SK, or wizard your chances are slim, very slim.   If bard's disease resistance is low VP will get him rooted so you have a decent chance in that case.  Same against an Sk if he doesn't have the 8k HT ;)   Wizard nukes and necro lifetaps are just too fast/hard to resist, not to mention manaburn and lifeburn.  I'd imagine spiritcall on a VP'ed necro/wizzy would give ya somewhat of a chance if you lived long enough to get VP on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a wee bit of experience in pvp.  <br />
<br />
Alot of what Weyalan had to say is bang on the money.  I'll expand on a couple though if I can and I'll try and do it so it makes sense :x<br />
<br />
get all your resists up with gear as good as you can. hotkey your sow boots again. MR better be over 170 without being buffed.<br />
<br />
For sure you need MR cranked as high as possible.  No other resist really matters - FR/CR while nice are not critical, and we can cure anything PR/DR based for free or very little mana depending on equipment.<br />
<br />
Take tash out of the equation.  Ideally you want to be able to resist MR based spells *with malos on you* if there's a shaman around.<br />
<br />
against multiple opponents, properly prepared, even a higher lvl shaman stands little chance.<br />
<br />
Completely untrue.  Only enchanters have the ability to crowd control better than we do.  A combination of malos, slow, root and blind will carve up multiple opponents.<br />
<br />
your dog will get rooted/feared. there is even a possibility that a bard can poof it.<br />
<br />
Maybe rooted/snared/feared.  You can annul root or snare.  You can MR buff your pet.  Bard cannot poof pets anymore.<br />
<br />
snare. if you get snared it is about all over but the crying. you can't catch their runners and if you stop to kill someone rooted, they will swarm you. worse, rangers will lead off your pet, kill it, come back for you. root is easier to break than snare.<br />
<br />
Yes.  Snare is the reason that you need a high MR.  *If* snare lands then you can *maybe* annul or radiant cure it off (RC being better).  Against multiple people snare can = death.  Again, make sure that MR is high enough so you can resist MR-based spells after you've been malosed.<br />
<br />
Winged D, you have to have all your buff slots filled with the best buffs last and then click off two. do sow as number 1, #2 vacant, the progress up the buffs thru 14.<br />
<br />
Ok on this point I'm going to disagree.  The common theory is that everyone should have 2 open buff slots at the beginning of your buff order, followed by clickies, then buffs.  For our class the rules simply <br />
don't apply.<br />
<br />
We can outheal any dot that lands on us, and I mean any, easily.  Winged death is 143 hps/tick for 350 mana.  Torpor/Q is 300/tick for 300 mana.  If a druid is using winged death against you then you're winning the mana war already, and you're not losing any health.<br />
<br />
Time that you take to cure dots is time that you can be on the offensive. Why cure what you just outheal anyways?  You should virtually *always* have torpor running in a multiple-opponent PVP situation, and against a single druid you should be too busy laughing at the level 53 dot that's just been thrown your way.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple dots on then the same applies - although if it gets *extreme* then in addition to torpor you might just have to tnarg's yourself once or twice.<br />
<br />
As an added bonus, again, we can radiant cure.  If you're that worried about those dots or debuffs then try and disc them off, failing that don't worry too much.<br />
<br />
buy your own pumice so you can cancel necro's and druid spells. when you get hit with one, click off sow, right click pumice, again if necessary, reapply sow, and off you go.<br />
<br />
Not necessary.  Outheal them.<br />
<br />
alchemey shines in pvp. in gen inventory have cure poison, disease, regen and DShield. TASH is Cure POISON.<br />
<br />
Potions I'd recommend stocking are - damage shield, and MR/divine endurance if you have an MR problem.  Cure poison yes if you have no item with the effect.  Cure disease - get velious legs, you will save yourself alot of grief.<br />
<br />
stuns will interupt you. cleric cast and from pet proc weapons like gnoll hide lariets. and the wiz line like careless lightining.<br />
<br />
High MR you should resist all stuns.<br />
<br />
you have to heal yourself or at half some SK is going to death touch you.<br />
<br />
It's at 75 percent that you become DTable.  There is no winning solution against a DTer/manaburner.  There is no defense that works against a wizard that wants to manaburn you, save going for the lucky DA using a shiny brass idol/frozen skull earring/10th ring scroll.  You will die and you will like it.  If it's a duel then I would recommend not even bothering if DTs are allowed.<br />
<br />
Against an SK you have a chance.  Stay above 75 percent and get the SK rooted/blind asap.  If he can't get in range he can't use harm touch, or drop your health down fast enough to get below 75 percent.<br />
<br />
i seriously doubt that at 65 and more AA than a FoH member, you could take an epic mage pet with your dog out of the picture. <br />
<br />
Mages are one of the easiest classes for us to kill.  No healing ability, limited nuking power (although this has increased a bit~), no innate cures.  Focus on the pet first and slow it.  A mage can annul root off his pet, but can't cure slow.  If you have high hps/high ac you can just slow and not even bother with root, just channel through it's ridiculously nerfed dps.<br />
<br />
if you stand toe to toe with someone with higher DPS than you, you will end up dying. the way to beat that is to eliminate being in range of them when you are not doing damage because of weapon delay.<br />
<br />
Except that we can mitigate damage because we can... wait for it... heal.  Assuming your opponent can't also heal (and equal hps i guess), with torpor running their dps would have to be 50 higher than yours (300/tick/6 seconds). <br />
<br />
open up with epic dot. then think about switch weapons depending on who you face.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend using something with a 10 second casting time.<br />
<br />
Here's a couple tips I guess just throwing stuff together in no particular order:<br />
<br />
 Always malos first.<br />
 Never use disease dots in PVP.  DR debuffing takes an extra spell slot, and the dots themselves are slow (129/tick for BOU vs 320/tick for BOS).  See above, they're already malosed so PR is down... (note: I do not have VP, I really have no experience using it.  You may need a DR debuff to use it effectively, I have no idea - I'd still recommend against using DR dots though)<br />
 Stack multiple PR dots on melees.  If you can land the big 3 - Blood of Saryrn(320/tick), Scourge of Nife(254/tick), Bane of Nife(214/tick) - well you're doing 788 damage/tick which is immense.<br />
 If you do land PR dots on someone, and see them going to cure them (a melee stops to cast) get in their face and do your best to not let them channel.<br />
 Don't waste time with cripple.  The effect is negligable on melees (most good ones have max strength without avatar, let alone with it - not so high for dex/agi but you get the picture).<br />
 Don't waste time using your epic.  10 second cast time is immense - against a melee you will likely get interrupted regardless of your AC/channeling AAs.<br />
 Spiritcall is the caster killer.  If you manage to root a caster, and get all 5 pets engaged on him, he/she is very likely going to die.  It is almost impossible to channel vs max spiritcall - this includes heals so use it to kill healers.<br />
 Kind of an extension of above, but against healing classes you kind of need to wear them down to the point where you can root/spiritcall them, and then do enough damage in 1 minute to finish the kill.  It can be tricky.  The only time I bust out a cold nuke or rain spell in PVP is when trying to finish a healer under these circumstances.<br />
 Keep Tnarg's memmed, not just torpor/Q.  If you don't, then any opponent that can maintain more damage than 300 per tick will kill you eventually.<br />
<br />
My standard spell line-up (general purpose) is:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Blindling Luminance<br />
 Malos<br />
 Turgur's Insects<br />
 Quiessence<br />
 Tnarg's Mending<br />
 Scourge of Nife<br />
 Blood of Saryn<br />
 Paralyzing Earth<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone with extremely high resists will be a problem - if you find someone that resists DR dots, PR dots, and roots even when debuffed then it's time to get creative.   Use your dog, use melee, use whatever you can to dish damage.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One more thing I forgot, and one correction I should make.<br />
<br />
Important AAs for PVP are:  Spiritcall, C5, Quick Buff (3.0 second torpor &gt; *), Radiant Cure, maybe VP.  Others are nice but these are pretty critical.<br />
<br />
I mentioned above that manaburn wizards are virtually no-hope but things may have changed a bit since the nerf - I haven't fought one since the 75% change since most wizards cashed in the skill long ago ;)<br />
<br />
With the nerf to DTs a manaburn wizard should be easily killable provided you keep hit points above 75 percent - use range (duck oor), use alot of heals, keep torpor on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another thought - don't bother resist buffing pet, it takes your resists anyway. Do give your pet 2 proccing weapons - give puppy 2 x gnollhide lariats, dex buff him, and you will find your life just got a whole lot easier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some good info so far. Here is my basic pvp summary.<br />
<br />
For 1 on 1 pvp I keep the following spells memmed. I know most of my enemies so strategies vary depending on a persons skill, class or gear. (Skilled enemies that I know have high resists will often have me using pumice before I start casting on them.) In mass PVP I don't dot so my enchanters can mezz people.<br />
<br />
Tnargs<br />
Quiessence<br />
Cani<br />
Paralyzing Earth<br />
Malicious Decay<br />
Malos<br />
Scourge<br />
Bane (will substitute Blood when I get it)<br />
<br />
I lead with malos and malicious decay. Then I VP them or root them if they still resist VP. Once rooted I send the dogs. If it's a melee type I un-mem malicios decay real fast and mem cloud of grummus (lands a lot more often than turgurs in pvp) and slow them. After I slow a melee I get both dots on them and go in and usually melee. If it's a caster type I like to use Rabid Bear at this point. I can proc my mace a lot in a fight and usually kill them off before they kill me. <br />
<br />
I used to keep my top spots open to dispell dots, but I don't go that route anymore. RC works much better. I keep 2 insta clicks in my top 2 spots and I make sure to keep them up when I get dispelled. Sow boots and AoN are perfect here. Skeletons are harder to target so this piece of gear was made for pvp.<br />
<br />
Bards = Unless they are AFK don't even bother. I hate them with a passion.<br />
<br />
SK = A well geared SK will usually tear a shaman up 1 on 1. They only need to get you to 75% before they click that magic button. SK in my guild whacks me fast and furious for 500+ a hit. Life taps are unresistable I think.<br />
<br />
Wiz = If you can keep yourself healed while they try to get you below 75% you have a chance. Keep Q on and try to get them rooted. Send dogs and dot them. Go Rabid Bear and beat them fast. <br />
<br />
Necro = You can dispell lifeburn.<br />
<br />
Paladins = I've tried to kill some of the paladins in my guild so many times I've lost count. (before we were guildmates) I think they are unkillable. A couple of them always run around with up to 10k on them at all times as a prize if someone actually does kill them. They just don't die. Lesser geared paladins I can actually kill. Takes a long time though and their stuns make it difficult.<br />
<br />
Shaman = I once fought another shaman for over an hour. Another time I died right fast because I accidentally un-memmed malos instead of another spell.<br />
<br />
Clerics = Annoying to fight. They can't usually kill me, but they are hard to kill themselves.<br />
<br />
Rangers = Since the ranger nerf, they are now 10 times easier to kill. VP and disease slow them and it's all downhill from there. Unless there is water in the zone, in which case the few annoying rangers I fight will swap out their scuba gear and play the water game with you for hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Melee = Malos, malicious decay, cloud of grumus, dot, melee, keep rooted while you canni and heal and loot their corpse when they are dead.<br />
<br />
Have fun. PvP is what keeps the game exciting for me.<br />

DISCLAIMER:<br />
This was all best case scenario by the way. Every class can and has killed me on more than one occasion. I have also killed every class more than once myself. So many variables when it comes to pvp. I don't believe shaman are pvp gods by any streach of the imagination. I especially don't believe that I am any type of pvp machine. We shine in group pvp more than solo pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know this is true in theory, but is it true in practice?  Everytime I dont resist buff my pet he just gets chain rooted, and if he's borrowing my resists then he should have 280 base MR..  Now I MR him and he gets rooted anyways, just wondering if the &quot;pets borrow resists&quot; actually applies to PVP?</div></div><hr />

Would like to add on a little something about our dots. Right now dots simply are not keeping up in relative power versus total hitpoints and hitpoint regeneration. Add in the insane resists that people run around with and the all-or-nothing nature of dots makes them just plain suck. The ease with which anyone can cure them is the final nail in the coffin.<br />
<br />
This is why getting spell casting fury and using our nukes/rains is sometimes a good option. For example, versus a bard who has Aria of Asceticism memmed there is no point at all in using dots. Just melee/nuke away and hope for some crits. Also, in mass pvp (I'm talking 20 vs 20 or more) dots are a bad choice because here it's all about quick damage, not our usual wear down the opponent strategy. Also, dotting people will make them immune to mez, like Shinerbokk already mentioned.</div></div><hr />
