<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Capucinette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am horrified to see that dog at my side. Not even a proud savage wolf as I discovered soon.<br />
<br />
I have to refrain from doing my manicure on it whenever I summon it.<br />
<br />
/petition for Feline Pets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I want a Crow and the True Spirit Dog is a Proud Savage Wolf, he eats Seblis Bugs 2 at a Time. (when his master screws up the pull, heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chiyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">spirit tigers would be seriously cool :) just take the level 39 / 49 beastlord pet and make it translucent, job done :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did a /feedback a while ago asking if it was possible to have race specific pets like Beastmasters do.  Also the possibilty to customize pets a bit.  ie armor dyes to change tint of pet permanently, and a /petname command so u could permanently name your pet ;).  I thought it would add a bit of flavour to an otherwise boring shaman pet.  If u like the idea send those feedbacks.  If enough do it you never know.  It worked on our useless str and dex spells (well more or less )....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used to make jokes about being a cat in a bear suit on a horse followed by a dog.  Sounds like a travelling circus to me :eek: <br />
<br />
Almost as bad as some of the freakshows I've seen since armor dyes came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah shucks, I like puppy as he is, although I thought he was much cuter years ago when he was solid instead of translucent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a vah shir shaman, I would love a cat pet! However I can understand the reason why shaman's have spirit dogs as pets, if you have ever started the epic, you will understand why. Many of the spirits we speak to for the epic are spirit wolfs exactly like our pet.<br />
<br />
I also would really love the ability to give names to our pets, like the Beast Lord Pets (everyone should /feedback this)</div></div><hr />

LOL... I've seen some really bad combinations. It's amazing to me that after people complaining about looking like a box of melted crayons for so long, they're given an oppurtunity to fix it. Then they end up looking like something from an acid induced Woodstock nightmare.<br />
<br />
(Just a note... there is no race in Norath that looks good in hot pink and/or fuchsia... Especially Ogres, Trolls and Iksar.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The dogs where desinged for the Barbarians and where not that bad for ogres and trolls.<br />
<br />
Now with all kinds of exotic and strange creatchers invading our class, the dogs are not as reasonble.<br />
<br />
What makes me mad is that SOE continual spouts off about no room in the global table to fit more pets for us, but we constantly see more new global models like the lizard horses and all the new frog models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I would like a big Komodo dragon pet.<br />
A giant snake might be interesting too....well take my word for it fellas, a giant snake is a good thing, just ask the ladies ! *wink<br />
