<br />
Sorry I am a tard in a totemic helm</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's entrance is in Eastern Wastes inside the Rygorr Fort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I'm lvl 31 and I heard that you can solo the top of cc is this true? I'm lookin for a good spot to solo for decent xp and plat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can solo here at 31, but I would suggest a partner if you trek past the orcs in the first part of the zone...<br />
<br />
I have been here for a few levels now, and I ain't leaving anytime soon! This zone rules....currently 36 and will be 37 if I can stop travelling for business long enough to play for a few hours!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Definitely one of my favorite zones in the game from 30-40.  I highly recommend trekking out there. <br />
<br />
 The only annoying thing is sometimes all the orcs are dead from high level farmers...but this is rare.<br />
<br />
There are several types of camps...orcs, tentacles, spiders, and geos.  Geos are ALWAYS camped my server, and I wouldn't recommend trying them solo anyways until 40's.  Spiders are lots of fun, crowd control is helpful here though as they can easily gang up on you.  Terrors and orcs are the most soloable mobs for xp, and they all drop cash, velium weapons, and velium pieces/bricks for tradeskills.  <br />
<br />
And on top of it all, there is a bank and merchants to sell to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was thinking about going there myself with a small group. Do you think myself a 29 shammy along with a 28 beastlord, 31 warrior and a 28 shadow knight would have any trouble in there? Also what's the best and safest way to get there? All of us have PoP and I can invis if need be to get there. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">basically go to GD from PoK invis an levitate whole group aswell as SoW then run for EW, once in EW run to the ry`gorr fort and to the blue ball tihnk on a pedestool, bind here then zone in, when your in your group can work there way dwon or levitate and float sown and run to the dwarven city fast as possible(coldain town)</div></div><hr />
