<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Trash your FV faction and do the cudgel quest.  Finish up your SoF.  A Chitinous belt would be nice.  Hunt in ME and pick up a Shrouded Medallion and a Stone Idol.  Hunt in HS while working on skulls for your 7th cudgel and pick up an Enshrouded Veil.  Sell those ridiculous purple pants for cash and put the buy some Brown Chitin legs. <br />
<br />
That should keep you busy and get you some exp, resists, hp, AC, and cash all at the same time. :)</div></div><hr />
