<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So question is where is a good place for me to solo xp from 51 to 55 at the fastest speed possible?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I like my goodly faction, I don't care about the Seru or Katta factions because they both hate me anyhow. I'm on giant faction because once I hit 55 I'm going to start raiding with my guild in ToV, so in otherword CS, SG, and WW are fine if there's safe xp to be found. I've got a horse, I'm pretty well equipt, and best of all I've got an EB item (Lodi shield).<br />
<br />
I've heard that the airless zones have a big xp mod. What about zones with a lot of water, do underwater mobs provide and average of more xp than others? Even though no horse underwater, I'd like to take advantage of the potential xp mods for underwater.<br />
<br />
So with the givens above, please advise on where to hunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Katta is good solo from what I hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have done some solo'ing in Kedge in the past for fun, but it may already be too late by level 55...things start to green out pretty early there.<br />
<br />
Underwater fighting is an interesting change of pace, I hope they don't neglect it in the new expansion (probably have..but it could happen).</div></div><hr />
