<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, just wanted to let you all know that over the next week or two, I will be relocating to a different service provider. I got a good deal in which I was able to substantially upgrade my server and still remain around the same price.<br />
<br />
I want to thank HTML.com who has hosted me for over two years now and giving me a great deal on the pricing.<br />
<br />
There will be a small downtime when I make the switch, but other than that, there shouldn't be a major outage. I'll let everyone know more as soon as I find out a more definite date. <br />
<br />
Also, I'll be pruning the boards of old posts. Any posts older than 6 months will be removed. So, if you find any old posts you want to save, go in and bump them so they make the cut.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey Sunmoon,<br />
<br />
Since we're talking about the site, is there any chance we can get some updates on the Crucible? Alchemy/Spells, etc.? I'm willing to help if need be to get that part of the site more functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does cutting posts include the hunting forums? That would be a great shame as heres loads of useful stuff to help us level. Please don't cut any of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to agree about the hunting guides.  They are a tremendous resource.  I was just looking them over today to get an idea where to hunt in my 30s when my current hunting grounds turn LB.  I’m sure many of those posts are over 6 months old, as they are mostly just read and not commented on.  It would be a great loss if they were deleted along with the general forums.  Finding good hunting grounds is THE most frustrating “feature” of EQ for me and good guides are hard to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What would you suggest to mark a post we would like saved, bump it with a message 'Please save this post?'<br />
<br />
I was about to suggest to you a read-only forum The Library like many other boards do to put some of the better threads there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll try to only prune the busy sections like general and leave the less travelled sections as they are. As far as updating alchemy, etc. I'm STILL waiting for the new version of vBulletin to come out. Once it does, I'm going to be tying a lot of the site into the boards which will make for easier updating.<br />
<br />
As of now, Thantu is really the only person that handles that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tymson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OOOO OOOO!  GIANT TOE + WORMWOOD!??!/!  ANYONE :) <br />
<br />
Maybe the CoV faction guys can do the Kael Armor quest now!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Moving the boards tonight, so be prepared for some outages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ghaurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This explains why going to the ranger board takes me here :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">everything taken care of now?</div></div><hr />
