I got it, Nitefox.  I don't have any of my own or plans for them, but I understand.  I doubt it will stay that easy, but this moment is probably what keeps you from killing them when they wreck your car at 18.  (or destroy a lower unit on your boat, or drop that fine piece of crystal that was your grandmother's)   :)  Best to remember it.  Glad my parents did.<br />

Especially now that Christopher Reeve is in a wheel chair, it adds to his legacy.<br />
<br />
Of course, if that's what impresses you about superheroes, you'd probably be a big fan of Wheel-Chair Boy.  Now there's some tough disabilities to start from!<br />
<br />
Besides, Spiderman sold out when they got Kursten Dunst to play in the movie.  Ugh, she's so annoying.</div></div><hr />

Got a bunch of comics from the '91-'96 era.  Few Spiderman, X-Men, Nova, Avengers (Avengers ruled), Hawkeye, Deadpool (also ruled).<br />

Captain America was the man, too.<br />
<br />
(Man, we hijacked this thread so bad).<br />
<br />
I never really got into the DC comics much (I assume Freedom Force is DC).  Though I'll be sure to look out for it if I ever start buyin' 'em again;)</div></div><hr />

Actually, kidding aside, Gilgamesh is a conceptual model for Superman, read the legend and you will be amazed at some of the similarities.  Nothing new under the sun.</div></div><hr />

For me, it's that last flicker of sunlight on a Sunday night, when you set down, look at the moon rising and realize just how small we really are.  The cosmos is a beautiful thing.<br />
<br />
Oh, and when you find out someone you've been attracted to for months feels the same way about you.<br />
<br />
Spider-Man was so much better than Superman! Who wants to watch some dude set there and stare down a gun? YOU KNOW IT CAN'T HURT HIM!  Who cares if Superman catches a bank robber?  He was never even in any danger!  <br />
<br />
&lt;--- In a great mood!</div></div><hr />

He has real problems. Parents died, uncle died, his aunt died then was brought back to life. He was cloned, he lost his powers, his wife (MJ) was kidnapped and thought dead and then MJ left him.<br />
 Superman= the ultimate hero nothing can hurt him except Doomsday and Batman.<br />
 Captain America= American icon. Capts the best good guy hero around.<br />
 Batman= the dark hero. He'll do anything to win.<br />
 Wolverine= the baddest hero on the planet. He's the best there is at what he does. and what he does ain't pretty!<br />
<br />
 Little children= the most humbling weapon known to man. they can make you weak in the knees just by their innocent questions... to quote Dana Carvey when his son Dex asked him... &quot; does God have feet?&quot; &quot; I just went weak in the knees it was so damn cute!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Thor would stomp the blue out of Supermans shorts with one smack of Mjölnir.  Did you know in the first Superman comics (Action Comics) he did not fly.  He just jumped.  Flying came later.  I used to have reprints of AC #1 to 12.  Kinda weird reading comics from before my father was born.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) The rules.  Superman has the limitations of the Paladin's ruleset.  Batman has the freedom of the ranger's, perhaps even the rogue's ruleset.  Dark Knight moniker aside, Batman is not a shadowknight.<br />
<br />
2) Code against killing, Superman = Yes, Batman = No.<br />
<br />
Still, Superman will survive every fight with Batman, but only because Batman knows Superman won't kill him.  Batman knows how to beat him, and can with enough prep time.</div></div><hr />

No one else agrees with me that Batman is just plain smarter than Superman. Hell, if he so desired he could buy or build a kryptonite hand grenade or the almighty nuke. Or kyrpto bullets.

Still think batman is an sk though.</div></div><hr />

The look on my 7-year-old's face when the marigolds we planted in his bedroom window all sprouted while he was away at school.<br />

Superman has that whole &quot;truth, justice and the American way&quot; thing going for him.<br />
<br />
Batman is far cooler in my book. He's absolutely brilliant, and just a shade on this side of good. He's fun because it seems like it wouldn't take much to push him over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was trying to calm her down one night and was at the Spider man website and we watched a few of the trailers.<br />
<br />
Her eye lit up as he did sumersolts and flips and of course the blue and red costume helps too.<br />
<br />
So I told her that was Spider Man (in a nice whispering tone with a hint of excitment.)  <br />
<br />
Well now that the TV commercials are going full bore she will stop and run to the TV whenever a commercial is on and in a whispering tone with a hint of Excitment she will say &quot;Spiserwans&quot;<br />
<br />
When I was picking out another game for my computer there was a new release of some Spider Man game and she saw it before I did and RAN over picked it up and showed it to me and said &quot;Spiserwans!&quot;<br />
<br />
I would love to take her to the theatres to see it since she is so hyped up about it but I'm afraid that at PG13 with loud explosions and the Scary Green Goblin she might not make it through the film :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Happiness is the feeling I get after riding 100+ miles on my road bike and making myself walk that 1/4 of a mile up to Chuys to get my after-ride beef nachos and Rolling Rock.<br />
<br />
Happiness is laying out on a body/surfboard in the waves for a couple hours and listening the surf break on the shore and hearing the seagulls call during June-gloom (not many people there) on Coronado beach.<br />
<br />
Happiness is doing the mountain bike ride to Chiva Falls shortly after monsoons hit and actually having enough water coming over the falls to take a shower and cool down before I begin the trip back.<br />

Nitefox, it's not always that easy, but there will be moments along the way when you are reminded why you stay up all night with a sick child spewing from both ends :D Just wait till he lectures some other kid on Superman and the kid tells him he is wrong; he'll be saying &quot;well, my dad told me that and he knows EVERYTHING&quot;.

<br />
Aye, I know the &quot;proper&quot; title of the song - when Bogle sings &quot;No Man's Land&quot;, he pronounces it (and has it written in the lyrics the way I've put it in there)  like &quot;floors&quot; or &quot;flures&quot;.  Sort of an old scots pronunciation.  :)<br />
<br />
You are very clever, as Addy would say, I've been waiting for someone to ask about that ;)</div></div><hr />

Eric Bogle is an amazing songwriter and has written this, and another like it - also about WW1 called &quot;And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot;, which I posted in a thread about ANZAC Day here:<br />

I remember the first time I heard a local musician sing that song here at a local irish pub.  When he finished, everyone there had tears streaming down their cheeks - the singer's as well (Good job on that Rick :)).  Little did I know how important Australia would become to me back then :).<br />
<br />
War is an amazingly wasteful, stupid, futile thing.  As John Stuart Mill once said though &quot;War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things...&quot; For now sadly, there will still be wars that must be fought.  <br />
<br />
To tie in with the thread so I'm not totally off topic...<br />
<br />
Happiness will be the day there are no more wars.  :)<br />

Check out Eric Bogle though :)</div></div><hr />

The first time I heard &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; was in Campbell, California at a pub called Brittanica Arms.  The band was Golden Bough, and tears were streaming down everyone's faces, except for a couple rude drunks who had been arguing football all night to the detriment of the performance.<br />
<br />
Golden Bough is still around and performing, well worth catching if they come anywhere near you.  There stuff is also available on the web.</div></div><hr />

The Fam and I took a little trip to Baton Rouge/New Orleans over the weekend to go to the Audobon(sp?) Zoo and Aquarium.  As we are walking through the zoo, we come upon a small exibit featuring a lizard of some sort.  My son get's within 6ft of it and I just ask out loud, &quot;I wonder what that is&quot;.  My son replies, &quot;That's a Blue Tounged Skint(sp?)&quot;.  The handler looks at him with amazement and says &quot;Now how did you know that?&quot;.  That boy impresses me more and more.<br />
<br />
For those without kids, it's in a parent's contract to brag about them on a constant basis.  I would give equal time to my 9mo old daughter but she is still in the drool/poop/make a mess stage.  Of course all the while being as cute as a bug.</div></div><hr />
