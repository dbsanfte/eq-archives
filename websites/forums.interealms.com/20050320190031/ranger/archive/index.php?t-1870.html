<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My most vivid memory from my youth?  Neil Armstrong, stepping down off the ladder onto the surface of the moon.  I watched the broadcast with my parents.  My younger siblings didn't see it as any big deal, but for me I was watching hjistory, good history, happening.  I was wearing black and white Ked's sneakers, Levi's, a white t-shirt, and sitting on the couch at the right hand edge.<br />
<br />
Next, the Challenger disaster, bringing my little color tv downstairs because my roommates were anti-tv snobs (then, now, don't ask) as we all sat around the TV.  They all held out hope for a survivor, I was the only one who knew from the getgo no one got out.  I had watched any specials on the space program and paid attention to the basic desigh of the shuttle, no evacuation procedures.  No life pods.  I let them hope.  I can tell you what they all were wearing, what we ate that evening as we watched the same footage for the hundredth time.  <br />
<br />
Yes, there are moments of extreme presence that etch themselves into your mind.<br />
<br />
But the one that means the most to me, the birth of my one and only child.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The day I came home from a week and a half french trip to France to find my future husband waiting for me to get off the bus.  He had said he wouldnt be there due to family plans so I was joyusly shocked.  I ran for him as soon as I saw him, jumped into his waiting arms yelling the whole time, and with my mouth wide open in a shout of &quot; BAYBE ! ! !&quot; I got him with my front two teeth RIGHT in the forehead.  He bled like a stuck pig and had a scar for almost two years ;)<br />
<br />
The day he payed me back (he says accidentaly lol)  We were at work (Spencer Gifts, he was the Ast Mngr, I was a Supervisor)  Standing behind the counter on a sloooow day waiting for buisnes.  I went to sit on the stool we had set up back there when he decided HE wanted to and pulled it over to him.  Needless to say my tail was already on it's way and I hit the floor hard lol.  I managed to NAIL my elbow on the sharp corner of the cabinets behind the counter, got 5 stitches and a permanant scar. . . . .this was the day before my FIRST trip to Disney World by the way. . . . .<br />
<br />
The Day he asked me out. . .THAT was a big one. .  .I remember thinking he might. . but knowing I was just imagining things, nobody wants to go out with me after all. . .so then he asks if I would like to go to dinner with him sometime. . my jaw hit the floor!  Then reality hit and I asked him &quot;Are you joking?&quot;  I was SURE it had to be a cruel joke like the guys at school always played. . but he meant it!  We had our first date on June 29th 1997  I was 17, he was 22. . .. Come to find out. . he thought I was refusing him when I asked that lol ;)</div></div><hr />

The day my best friend died when I was 6, after he fell out of a tree onto a barbeque grill.  He came back minutes later, but for some reason we were all told he was dead the moment he died. I set there crying thinking he was dead for 10 minutes probably.  Then I found out he was alive. It was both the saddest and the happiest day of my life.

Most vividly I remember:<br />
<br />
The day my dog died when I was 4 - well the day I found out about it. She was kicked in the head by a horse while we were out of town. She was the best dog ever, smart, protective, gentle and beautiful.<br />

The day my youngest sister was brought home.  No, not from the hospital; from the adoption agency.  I was only 7 years old, but I remember it like it was yesterday.  It was a sunny morning, and the rest of us kids had gone to my grandmother's for the morning while my parents finalized the preparations.  She was brought in in one of those car seats with the handle that crosses over the top; she was but a red-headed, freckled little ball of pudge.<br />
<br />
The day I got off the plane to meet my fiancee for the first time.  Well, she wasn't my fiancee back then, but you know what I mean.  I was sweating profusely and worried that the dozen roses would wilt.  They didn't.  We found a table near the gate and just sat there... neither of us knowing what to say, not being able to say much, but with the two biggest grins you've ever seen on our faces.  She half-held her hand in front of her face... and every few seconds she'd sheepishly peek out to make sure this was really happening.<br />
<br />
The day I started second grade.  The school decided to move me up a notch midway through the year... but I didn't want to leave my friends.  My mom dropped me off and drove away, and I promptly got in line for the first grade class.  At the end of the day when we walked in the door, I sat down at the table and she asked how my first day of second grade went.  I'll never, ever forget the expression on her face when I told her &quot;I don't know, I didn't go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The morning of 9/11.  I was sitting outside, kicking my car because one of my brake lines had just rotted through... I was going to be late for work.  When I came back in the house to look up a nearby mechanic, my fiancee's daughter called and said to turn on the TV.  We did, and in seconds I had run to the living room to find the phone number of our friend who works at the Pentagon.  Of course, I couldn't get through, but he turned out to be alright.  The next phone call was to my family up north, and from then until 6 or 7 PM the two of us sat on the couch, just holding each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to work as a school crossing guard when my son was little. My crossing was just a few blocks from my house. I was standing on the corner, towards the end of my afternoon shift, when I heard a horn honking. I looked up and saw my dad turning the corner in his brand new GMC truck......and sitting there next to him was my mom, with the biggest smile on her face, waving excitedly at me. She was sitting there so tall and proud and happy, in her pink housecoat, the few gray hairs left on her head blowing in the breeze. That was the happiest I had seen my mom in a long time...she died of cancer a few weeks later.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few years ago, I went to pick my son up after track practice at his school. I was slowing down to turn right, when I saw a boy on a bicycle come flying down the street (this street was on a very steep hill) I was about to turn onto. A minivan, going straight, slammed into the boy on the bicycle. The boy flew through the air in one direction, the bike in another. The minivan slowed as if to stop, then sped off, leaving the scene. I parked my truck across the street to block other vehicles from hitting the boy, sent my son to the school for help, grabbed my jacket and ran to the boy, covering him, talking to him, holding his hand, until the paramedics arrived.</div></div><hr />

Biting my tongue off at the age of 8 and having it somehow stitched back on, I will never forget the red of the blood on the ground....<br />
<br />
And at my fathers funeral meeting the girl of my dreams and for a while girlfriend who is still one of my closest friends thank goodness :).<br />
<br />
Most of my vivd memories are mainly pretty depressing I guess those are the things that really make an impact on your young life or maybe its because I haven't reached the major milestones of my adult life, like graduating from University, meeting whom ever I am to marry and having children hopefully oneday these things will become my most vivd memories :)</div></div><hr />

I had true photographic memory until I was about 11 (I could recite the letters from a certain page number in a book I saw once in a language I dont speak... ) but it went away when I went through puberty and my brain changed priorities.<br />
<br />
<br />
I used to have photographic memory as well, then as I told others, I ran out of film around 16 or so.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I still remember everything that happens to me, I forget what I deem to be minor details or trivial topics.  The sad part is, my girlfriend tends to think those are the non-trivial topics...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kind of treat my mind like a computer hard drive. I file unimportant things away where I would have to work to retrieve them.<br />
<br />
Having a photographic memory isn't as great as it sounds sometimes. If you don't train it, and learn to &quot;file&quot; memories, your mind gets too cluttered and you miss what's important. You can remember the page of your high school chemistry textbook that talked about the molcular weight of benzene, but you can't be trusted to pick up the dry cleaning on your way home - not because you &quot;forget&quot; but because it's not filed in the right place.<br />
<br />
If I sit and think about it, and really work at it from the right angle, I can remember everything that I've done from about the age of 2 until I was 20 when I crashed on my bike, giving myself a closed head injury. For about 5 years after that, I didn't have the photographic memory anymore. Then at about the age of 25, I realized I had recovered the ability, so I can remember everything I have read, seen or done from that point until now. However, I learned at about the age of 17 to file unimportant details away where they are difficult to recall, just to keep my mind clear for important things. It's kind of like forgeting details, but they're really just remembered in a different way - like a computer archive. If I really want them, I have to restore the archive.<br />
<br />
Having actually studied about memory, a lot of experts believe that everyone has a photographic memory. The human mind never really forgets anything - it just files it in a way that most people can't get to. In reality a photographic memory should be called &quot;perfect recall&quot; instead.<br />
<br />
The one thing that a photographic memory/perfect recall is really best for is that I have never taken notes in a lecture class. Saves a lot of time studying, and a lot of notebook space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Locz</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember many things vividly.  Just a few that stand out:<br />
<br />
1. Burning my leg on a floor heater when I was about 1.<br />
2. When I was about 1 1/2 yrs old, trying to straddle a pipe spanning a canal and fearing I would fall.<br />
3. My second sister coming home from the Hospital after she was born (I was 3).  I was amazed.<br />
4. JFK being killed.  I was in kindergarden.  There was an announcement on the speaker as school ended.  The teacher told us to line up by the door, put our hands together, and pray (hehe, this was a public school).  I came home, and my Mom was crying.  School was cancelled the next few days, and they wouldn't show cartoons on TV.  I remember seeing Oswald being shot live - my father said, just a moment before Ruby pulled a gun &quot;they won't let him live&quot;.  Then Oswald was killed.<br />
5.  Hurricane Betsy.  I was 7.<br />
6. Watching the Chicago riots outside the Democratic convention on TV.  I was 10.<br />
7. First time I slow-danced with a girl.<br />
8. The Vietnam war on TV news and worrying about getting drafted like all other the older boys I knew.<br />
9. A semifinals match in a college tennis tournament, match point in a tiebreaker.  The match point went on for dozens of shots, with near kills and spectacular saves by both of us, finally culminating with my opponent hitting overheads and me running every one down and barely lobbing it back sevral times.  I never played so well before that day, or afterwards.   Heh, I lost  ;)<br />
10. Sailing with my wife-to-be.<br />
11. My wedding.<br />
12. Challenger disaster<br />
13. The birth of both of my sons.<br />
14.  Tienaman Square massacre.  This was a surreal experience for me.  My wife and I were shopping to buy a new color-TV that night.  We were at a big discount store surrounded by dozens of color TVs of all sizes and shapes, stacked up 8' high, and all the TVs were on.  And every TV was showing the massacre, live, with a new picture every 10 seconds or so.  Gunfire could be heard and people screaming.  It was riveting and appalling. With all those TVs surrounding me, I felt like I was there, on the Square, with all the victims surrounded by the Chinese military.  I stood there for a very long time, and cried, as did my wife.<br />
15. Oklahoma City bombing.  We were on vacation, in NM, with my kids, it was the morning.  Turned on the TV and damn.<br />
16.  9 / 11.   Every minute of that awful morning is burned into my mind.</div></div><hr />

I'm mostly saddened by the fact that I don't have as good a memory as I believe I should...  Maybe I just haven't had any really good experiences that had exceptional impact on me...</div></div><hr />

I also remember the moon landing and Joe Nameth waving his fingure running off the field. (Jets break my heart every year).<br />
<br />
I bearley remember Challenger except remembering it was something else to drink over.<br />

Oh and by the way I haven't drank in over 14 years ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The day when my (now ex-) fiancee told me that &quot;we had to talk&quot; and opened the conversation with a hearty &quot;I don't love you anymore&quot;. While I never forgot that moment itself, I have a hard time to actually remember the conversation that followed...<br />
<br />
While I served with the German army... as a part of an exercise, the base had to &quot;play dead&quot; - no lights, no one allowed to leave a building. A comrade of mine was sick and I tried to get to the field surgeon to get him some pain relievers... The sergeant major stood at the door, pointed a G3 battle rifle at me and told me that I wouldn't leave the building. I swear I could see in his eyes that he wouldn't hesitate to fire if I took one more step. <br />
<br />
But there were good moments too. After two weeks of exercise in the snowy mountains of Bavaria in late November where the ground was so frozen that you almost had to blow it up to dig a trench and hardly two hours of sleep per night (if at all), one Sunday every single man in the field was brought a fresh hot steak to their trench with the major's best wishes. I still think that was the best steak I ever had in my life ;).<br />
<br />
Oh, and from EQ, there is a moment I won't forget so soon either :D : we killed one last white wurm after a rather disappointing evening in HoT, my guild leader looted ... Pause... then he said in guildsay &quot;worship me.&quot;  He had found me a nice new chain bp  /grin .</div></div><hr />

Perhaps.  I've never met anyone that I thought deserved her, though.  I was warned by an ex of hers that she was the Anti-Christ.  I chose not to believe.  Then I came to believe.<br />
<br />
I saw the warning signs, I did not listen.  I learned.<br />
<br />
Heh, one night while whining into another too many beers about it, I had a friend tell me that I was the luckiest guy in the world.  Before I took a swing, I asked why.  He replied that there are musicians out there who would pay good money to be treated like I had been.  That there was a platinum record for somebody in this woman's ways.<br />
<br />
Gosh I wish.  :)<br />

Yep, I saw that.  I think we may have a love connection here.  I've made a point NOT to keep track of her, but if I find out where she is by any chance I'll be sure to send her contact info your way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two more very significant moments that I will never forget.<br />
<br />
Have you ever had a true epiphany? A moment where you could almost feel the light bulb turning on over your head like you were a cartoon character? I've had that happen twice.<br />
<br />
<br />
The first time, I was in Advanced Calc I my senior year of college. I had already taken a year and a half of calculus in high school, Calc I, II, III, Differential Equations, Proofs, and several other math and statistics classes. Advanced Calc was basically a theory class, in-depth exploration of the theories and proofs behind all the things we had done in the previous classes.<br />
<br />
One day, Dr. Kelley was going through the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus with us. We had just spent several weeks proving everything up to that point, and we were starting from nothing and proving that calculus works the way we'd all been using it for so long. Up to that point, the Fundamental Theorem had always been assumed. The books would show us the theorem, and say &quot;This will be left for proof later.&quot;<br />
<br />
About halfway through the proof, that magic light bulb turned on over my head. CALCULUS MADE SENSE. I had always been able to do the problems, but suddenly, like an electric shock, it wasn't just math, it was...beautiful. I almost lost my breath; I was so overcome with that sudden understanding. Dr. Kelley stopped class to ask what was wrong, and I was too embarrassed to explain. Even now, it's hard to make someone understand the difference between merely being able to perform calculations, and truly understanding where they come from, what they mean, and why they work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advanced Calc II was actually fractal geometry. We spent the semester making pretty pictures in Mathematica. I got an A, and Dr. Kelley really wanted me to go on studying fractals in graduate school. I ended up having a baby instead. Fractal geometry was hard, but fascinating. I spent hours calculating the fractal dimensions of common objects and geographical features, etc. I learned about fractal encryption, a little about very large number theory, chaos theory, etc. I was hoping to go on and get an MS in applied math and work for the NSA, or something exciting, but life got in the way.<br />
<br />
Then, one day last year, I was listening to a radio play on tape. It was John DeLancie and Leonard Nimoy, in a dialogue called &quot;Spock Vs. Q&quot;. Something they said in there put all the pieces together for me. It was a simple phrase &quot;Sensitive dependence on initial conditions&quot; but it was the catalyst I needed. I was driving, listening to the tape in my car, and I had to pull over. That light bulb was shining over my head again, and I couldn't watch the road. FRACTALS MADE SENSE. They weren't just pretty pictures, and numbers, and fractal dimensions. They have meaning, and I get that meaning. I can not only write the programs to generate fractals; I know WHY they happen, and what it means when they do. Fractals and chaos theory were just rote to me, but now they're beautiful, in the same way calculus is. They're more real than ever before.<br />
<br />
<br />
That true feeling of epiphany is indescribable, but unforgettable.</div></div><hr />
