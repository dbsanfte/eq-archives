<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">abashi (waste of DNA) was the first &quot;customer rep,&quot; and in his defense, he was about as qualifed to be the CR as I am to play in the NBA.<br />
<br />
abashi begat absor whose career started with the usual Kumbaya and support from the fan boiz.<br />
<br />
Then absor made this statement:<br />
<br />
&quot;Classes are not that out of balance,&quot; and he quickly found his way to another division in SOE.<br />
<br />
absor begat brenlo.</div></div><hr />

Thats not funny its dumb. In ShadowBane there was an everquest tombstone was funnier. But ShadowBane much like WoW eventually failed. WoW Bizzard forum looks like kindagarden, them and you represent your player base rather well would you agree?Such idiots they can be, 'eh?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing his motto is &quot;I r litrit&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Funny.  Thanks for the laugh.<br />
<br />
FYI, I think Mill was being funny based on Brenlo's &quot;what is a shaman?&quot; comment often quoted from some online devchat event.</div></div><hr />

Now I get it. Color me thick. :)</div></div><hr />
