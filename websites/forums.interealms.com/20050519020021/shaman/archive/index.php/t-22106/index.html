<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">IMO this was a horrid idea.  Shamans... Clerics...  either dont give a **** about the other or how they work.<br />
<br />
From what I've read, Clerics take EVERYTHING as a stealth nerf to them blah blah blah me me me, IM A CLERIC I DESERVE MORE....<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets not throw what some of us beleive to be our problems on someone else.   I dont agree with what all of you say, but dont tell them.  They WILL NOT UNDERSTAND.   The only civil people on the board are the druids.  We (shamans) get accused more than anything.  <br />
<br />
Get this.<br />
<br />
 So please stop trying to sort out the problems by just comparing healing, because that is not what all that classes do. All you seem to want is for shamans to become the most powerful priest again, that you were during Luclin. Also you seem to hate clerics because you want to see them nerfed as well as shamans improved. <br />
<br />
blah... whatever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunatly, its mainly a matter of perspective.  Getting someone to try and see something from your perspective is really hard.<br />
<br />
While I cant understand some of the clerics issues, I can understand why they are terrified of the healing power of other classes.  Clerics are incredibly one dimentional.  They have a hammer they can toss around a bit, and a few nice utility spells but they are healers, end of story.  Thats pretty much all they do.  They believe that if shaman get better heals that we will start to take their places is more content that is closer to the cutting edge than LDoN Normals and BoT.<br />
<br />
I think that many clerics are unwilling to accept the fact that they will always be the prefered healers in groups.  Becasue when it comes right down to it a cleric can mitigate more damage than a shaman ina shorter amount of time.  And as expasions have shown lately, its all about who is the fastest at anything. <br />
<br />
Im all for giving clerics a bit more utility.  (I refuse to call it &quot;group friendly spells&quot; because clerics are as group friendly as you can get.)  I dont want to see them nerfed.  There is at present only one class that I think needs to be scaled back a little and that is paladins, and only in reference to their proposed OOW spells.  They are coming dangerously close to outhealing us, and if the current test spells go live they will be the second best raw HP buffers by a far margin.  <br />
<br />
Light of Piety, level 66 OOW spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5282&amp;source=Live)<br />
Affirmation (Vitue clone sans duration) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5298&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
For a tank, this is questionable IMO.  Since stats beyond HP/mana/AC mean very little anymore a TANK that can buff better than a priest is just wrong.  <br />
<br />
Having pissed of any paladins that might read this, I'm going to stop there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shamans and Enchanters probably have more in common with each other than Shamans do with other Priests or Enchanters do with other Int Casters.  Both classes can slow.  Both classes can Haste.  Both classes have a large assortment of buffs.  Both classes have crappy DD spells.  Trying to balance Shamans to Druids and Clerics is as pointless as balancing an Enchanter against a Wizard.  They are totally different beasts.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I think that Mana Regen+Charm+Mez &gt; Crappy heals.  Excuse me while I go re-roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No one has ever presented an argument that explains exactly how would giving the shamans up to around a 2000 pt direct heal even remotely come close to affecting a cleric?<br />
<br />
Cleric's heal just fine, they don't need more - in terms of healing.  In fact, since GoD is designed at level 70, they are already able to heal in this environment.  They have stuns, pacify, nukes, and the best dps of a priest class with that ridiculous hammer they summon that procs like all get out.  They need to get over themselves.<br />

As far as I know sustained cleric DPS (nuking + hammer) is about 80 DPS, a little more with outside buffs. That is certainly decent but far fom &quot;the best DPS of a priest class&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone yet to fear the new OoW Beast slow?<br />
<br />
Its pretty much a great big question mark right now.   Thats the real threat right there, not the HP buffs.  If they get anything over a 65% Magic based slow, or a 50% Disease based slow,  Shamans are done.  PERIOD.  That scares me more than a Pally Virt new **** heal.  <br />
<br />
If we become obsolete to a hybrid... someone who is supposed to be half of what we can be, the games balance and role for one class is gone forever.  They dont need a new slow, its too much as it is now.  <br />

Never saw a response from SOE about our hybrid &quot;child&quot; class outperforming us either.<br />

<br />
Shamans do have more in common with enchanters.  I've always claimed we've become slowers, and are not really a priest class any more, and am still convinced of it.  The notion that slow is a subtle heal of sorts is a lot of what got us in this jam to begin with.  <br />
<br />
I wish I could remember who to attribute this to, I think I read it at the druid grove first,<br />
<br />
Clerics can heal and don't want anyone else to be able to,<br />
<br />
Druids can heal, but would rather nuke<br />
<br />
Shaman can't heal, but want to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The cleric response to increased healing by other priests is pretty much the same as shaman responses to increased slowing capabilities of other classes. Sometimes those fears are valid, sometimes they are not. You guys of all people should understand that.<br />

But those are the responses that people are going to have, rational or not. When it comes to balancing classes its something the devs have to keep in mind. It is likely that is the reason why they appear so reticent to effect changes that the community thinks are obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure that's true Tugela, in the sense that there are some shaman that are ready to give up on slow altogether.  <br />
<br />
But I suspect that cleric feed back on any direct shaman healing increase is part of what keeps SoE from upgrading shaman healing in general.  I also fear that SoE thinks part of the shaman problem is that GoD is designed for lvl 70 characters, and once they lift the level cap, then the &quot;underachiever&quot; classes will not notice it as badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The healing ratio of 100/75/47 doesn't even compare to the 75%, 70%, and 65% (or 100/93.3/86.7 ratios) for slows.  Not even close... not even in the same ballpark for discussion.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of room to improve the 47% our healing does now without even getting close to the healing ability of a cleric.  Their toes are about 10 feet away from us still, so no danger of stepping on them.  Their fears are completely irrational.<br />
<br />

Well said, and quite possibly true.<br />
<br />
But then, they did give away slows five, ten, and twenty percent less than ours to three other classes since Turgur's came out. The point being, if the third best slower is only ten percent behind the best, why should the third best healer be fifty-three percent behind the best?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Whoops, shoulda just said /agree Mach :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solution: There is never a happy solution. When one class's power gets augmented, another class will bitch. For every action there is an equal in oposite reaction. Do I think that shaman could use better healing? Hell yes. How bias am I to this? That is something I cannot decide.</div></div><hr />

Just want to point out a flaw in your perspection. SoE has made it very clear in a direct way that hybrids are basicly a thing of the past. Even though a ranger is a hybrid caster and melee they will now come into their own power, so them surpassing a druid or warrior in certain areas has nothing to do with them being a hybrid. The beastlord is the most obvious and easy to see representation of this idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hybrids are gone, so stop thinking about how a class is supposed to be less then the parent. Those days are gone and itll will only stunt your thought process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I thought they meant hybrid in terms of having an xp penalty...which is now gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is probably the reason why the new beast slow hasnt even been unveiled yet; its just a place holder and has been since all the spells were realeased.  They KNOW that if beasts get anything more than a 65% slow that there will be 50K shaman that throw in the towel.  If beasts get a disease slow there will be 20K shaman that throw in the towel.  <br />
<br />
There has been one shining factor that has kept me from rolling a beastlord; when the **** hits the fan I can try and keep people alive with my heals.  Yeah, gimped as they may be (though Ive spent a handfull of AA trying to fix that) I can still try and use them to keep people vertical.<br />
<br />
As for the Beast Avatar (Ferocity of Hawthik (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5542&amp;source=Live)) they can have it.  750 mana...2 min recast time...6.5 min duration...its all theirs.  Hell, give clerics an avatar too.  When my role as a shaman in an experience situation is to keep FA up on 5 melees and occasionally patch a heal when Im not slowing I want everyone to have some of that joy.</div></div><hr />

This would be true if the hybrid classes didn't inherit most of their spells from a parent caster. As long as they are based off of a dual class model instead of designed with unique class abilities of their own they will always be hybrids.<br />
<br />
The whole class system is set for the dual class/hybrid and the only way to change that is to completely redo the whole shabang, ie new game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
I tend to discount &quot;labeling&quot; since it means very little in actual practice.  <br />
<br />
I also believe as a previous poster says that every class has a unique &quot;feel&quot; in gameplay and that was what Sony/Verant has attempted to do - with some success.  Thus I am 100% fine with beastlords having slows and good dps - that's pretty much how they were designed and how they play.  I also feel that the term &quot;hybrid&quot; was a bad idea 5 years ago and led to poor balancing until Sony scrapped the theory.  Unbelieveably, the original theory of SK and Pally was to be superior to a warrior thus the 40% hybrid penalty was applied.  It was only in actual practice and customers complaining for a few years that Sony pulled their head out of their xxx and remedyed the situation.<br />
<br />
The shaman who lament the dps of the beastlords could have rolled beastlords if they wanted a better pet and some melee capability.  It really was only the very beginning Shaman (which includes me, btw) who got a bit of a harsh reality about the &quot;tribal battle cleric, lol&quot; without enough information to make a good choice.  But we got lucky and had a darn good class until the recent content changes of quicker fights (which I am 100% in favor of since I think long fights are boring)..just rebalance the classes that were effected by the content change, plz.<br />
<br />
But anyway, why the bashing of Paladins, SK or any other class?  I think we should worry about Shaman, and just try to bring pursuasive arguments to Sony to in the hopes that they will re-tune us so we can 1) compete effectively in getting groups 2) stack well on raids 3)  have a playstyle that is fun (hmmm canny canny canny FA FA FA FA, canny canny)..<br />
<br />
If Sony fixes 1,2 3, I could care less how they do it.  Healing, dd's, dots's, melee, pet, buffs whatever.  That's why I am so critical of specific arguments that ignore the big picture of #1,#2, #3 and also of a content balanced environment.  Just because Shaman are a &quot;Priest&quot; doesn't mean a darn thing in reality.  We are what Sony decides we are.  My biggest beef with Sony/Verant is how slow they make class balancing changes after they make content changes.  My second biggest beef up till recently was how they manage to piss off (excuse the language but that's what happened) their customers by just ignoring them.  That's just bad business.<br />

<br />
Yes, and all the more telling -- none of those heals are mitigated in the slightest.  <br />
<br />
Whereas the mitigation of the slows makes slows that are already about as identical as you can reasonably get become truly essentially the same.</div></div><hr />
