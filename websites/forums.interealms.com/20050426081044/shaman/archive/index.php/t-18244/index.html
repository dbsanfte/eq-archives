<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all<br />
<br />
I have heard that some of the bet loot in the pit (poTac) drops off the piglet in the stampede.<br />
Biggest problem seems to be splitting him off the heard to kill him.<br />
<br />
As a shaman that solo in the pit, how would one get him without dying?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of routing him (with VP3) and then running for the zone out and then quickly zone back in and see if i can get to him before root breaks.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />
or anyone that have tried that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Be at max casting range against the wall and just root him as he goes by. Make sure no damage is done to him where he's at in the middle of the room till after the entire stampede has passed. No need to run for zone.<br />
<br />
FYI if you dont pull him back into the corner when root breaks, he'll run for the pen and despawn. Not a hard solo but may take you once or twice to get the hang of it. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Numgrag is correct. Rooting is the way to go. The piglet has a small agro range so the best method I have found is the following:<br />
<br />
1) Root piglet and pray that you are at the right distance to miss agro from the herd.<br />
<br />
2) malos/slow/cripple the piglet when the herd has gone.<br />
<br />
3) Inch forward until the piglet turns to face you.<br />
<br />
4) Q yourself.<br />
<br />
4) JBB or direct damage him to break root. As long as he is facing you you have agro.<br />
<br />
5) Bring him to the corner and root him. Then slide along the wall a little until out of melee range.<br />
<br />
6) Chuck everything at him. BoS, Ultor, Epic, the kitchen sink.<br />
<br />
7) re-root regularly. If root breaks let him come to you and take a hit or three while you re-root. Then move to the corner and continue.<br />
<br />
8) Loot.</div></div><hr />

If you have the pit to yourself, the easy solution is to just wait until he makes his return trip.  He is USUALLY the last to return towards the pigpen because his little feeties run just a bit slower than the big boars. :D <br />
<br />
At that point he's easy to just root and then rot to death.  I use SC3 (w/o a regular pet) to kill him a little faster.  The 5 dogs will chew him up a bit, and the last dog or two will die right around the time they were going to poof anyway.  I personally use Malicious Decay followed by VP3.  MD's fast cast time allows me more latitude in targeting (if I missed getting him targetted on the way out) &amp; getting aggro.  VP helps in placement of course, setting up for a smooth root/rot situation out of the pathing of the occasional wanderers that can come through.<br />
<br />
If you DON'T have the pit to yourself so you can't rely on the return trip root method, you still have to park yourself in the room outside the stables.  Move to the corner farthest from the stables and closest to the tunnel where the boars will stampede out.  You will have a static spawn mob on your left and right if you are facing the corner opposite you (on the diagonal).  Keep these 2 spawns cleared for extra safety. Their respawn is around 20-22 min iirc.<br />
<br />
When the stampede occurs, target the piglet ASAP and cast root right as he goes by.  If you do it right (and this is tricky) you will have him rooted  just outside that room (in the tunnel) with no other aggro from big boars.  Petrifying Earth is long enough for you to zone-out, zone back in and get him, but someone else may snag your rooted mob if they see you train out.  Keeping levitation up on yourself (though floating annoys me personally) will save you critical seconds to get back to him.<br />
<br />
Greater Immobilize is usually not long enough to zone-out &amp; back in, but if you have a really fast zoning machine you could make it back to get the piglet on his return trip.  Once again, if you have company in the zone, you have likely lost your shot.  But Greater Immobilize does cast faster, so you might want to try rooting with that and then following up with a quick PE.<br />
<br />
If you bind outside the Tactics stone, you can even suicide root if you have to (if you are in a group).  I've done this on a few occasions where there was a group just outside the room/tunnel waiting to pick off the piglet if my group missed.  Usually it is easier to mez him than root, but w/ no ench I don't mind taking the hit for the team to ensure we get him.  I can make it back to the camp, loot the important pieces of my gear and help significantly even w/ rez effects still up.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can you guys normally get the piglet single by rooting him from max distance in the middle of the heard just before they enter the arena for their first trip around? Its trivial to get the pig on its return trip, but on its way out is a different thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Solo I still have problems getting him on the way out.  I can do it, but it is much harder.  If I have even one other person with me it makes it much easier and grabbing him going out isn't hard.  I use the method I listed above, but it is by no means foolproof.<br />
<br />
The other problem solo is that unless you get very lucky with the timing, you are already engaged with a mob when the stampede message comes across.  I am pulling almost non-stop when I solo, except for the occasional brief recovery period.  Every now and then I might wait a minute or two for a wanderer that I'm expecting to come by.  But when you hear the pounding of many hooves usually you are immediately trying to rapidly finish an engaged mob (via root/rot) and still keep enough of a mana buffer to get the piglet &amp; have a good chance of success.  Rather heartbreaking to have to watch him go by unmolested, but I've had to do it on more than one occasion because I already had 2 mobs (normal &amp; wanderer add) aggroed.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nitpicky detail: he runs at the same speed as the rest of the stampede, but he appears slower because he takes 1 of 4 randomly different and longer routes through the pit, while the rest of the stampede always takes a shorter route.<br />
<br />
This doesn't really matter, however, because if you root while your back is to the wall on his return trip you will rarely get the rest of the stampede, even if you root him out of the middle of the pack.  The only issue then is that any group exp'ing in the pit will probably nab him before he comes back around.<br />
<br />
Also, I have never seen a wanderer assist him, so you can root-rot him in the center of the room, but you have to stand within his aggro range (he will turn to face you instead of the stables), or he will regen at his standing rate, which exceeds the DPS our dots can generate.  So, you can root-rot him and your pull at the same time, although it can get a bit hectic on the second add.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly pally dps is such crap you might have better luck haveing him heal you while you root rott it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sit in the NE corner of the room, if the zone is free of pesky pig rustlers, wait for the pig to stampede back around, root from flush in the corner.  Follow up with a Malo and then VP3 to launch it a bit into safety.. invis and make sure the stampede has ended, prox yourself to agro and dot.. wait for root to break or VP to come back up to put it further into safety.</div></div><hr />
