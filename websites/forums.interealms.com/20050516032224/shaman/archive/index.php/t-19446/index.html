<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dubbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heylo,<br />
     I was wondering if anyone on here knows how to record MPEG movies while in EverQuest. This would be extremely useful for guide walkthroughs or a cool idea for guilds to display their raids. I've seen it done before but I don't know how to do it. Anyone know what program you need? How to do it? Any information is welcome!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you have to record via tape from the video card you can use dual monitor displays to do that or that yellow port on the video card  then all you need is a tv tuner to record it  or that the ghetto way of it <br />
<br />
<br />
you could probly do it with an all in wonder video card</div></div><hr />

Records straight to .MPG on your hard drive, no external devices required.<br />
<br />
Works like a charm.</div></div><hr />

He also has a DVD burner, and whenever he wants to capture, he can capture it straight to the DVD. We have a blast watching all the stuff that happens to him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like a waste of DVD media to me, but ok. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Valgoth have you used this program yourself?  I was just curious how difficult it would be to add your own audio track, and if you had any experience with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you use fraps and have windows movie maker, it is very easy to add your own audio tracks and/or credits ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not difficult at all as long as you have some sort of audio/video production software that performs that type of operation.<br />
<br />
I have several myself. Sony Vegas, Sony Sound Forge 7.0, Pinnacle Studio 8.1, Windows Movie Maker 2.0 (which is FREE!). A/V production is yet another hobby of mine. :)<br />
<br />
To simply load the MPG and add audio, Windows Movie Maker would be your best bet since it costs absolutely nothing, and it's really, REALLY easy to use. If you're looking for something with a few more features, Sony's new &quot;Screenblast&quot; software is pretty cost effective and has a decent collection of features and functionality.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dubbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all the info everyone.</div></div><hr />

If you saw what he records, you might change your mind ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then again maybe not - in this day and age, given the example of FRAPS, it's a waste of money to expend media on raw footage. Welcome to the new Millennium, that's so 1990's..... Editted and mastered content on DVD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; raw footage on DVD.<br />
<br />
Colal - this is a very easy app to use, try the demo and see for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another screencap util worth trying (mainly since it's free) is [u]CamStudio[/URL]<br />
<br />
I've used this one to put together projects at work. Nice lil app. Just be sure to configure it for &quot;full screen&quot; recording if you're going to record game play footage and such.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />
