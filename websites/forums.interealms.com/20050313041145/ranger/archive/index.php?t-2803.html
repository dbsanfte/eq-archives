<br />
I was in EW hunting some big game. (Mammoths and Rhinos) and it felt like I had to get right up next to them to hit them with my pulling arrow. I was using 150 range arrows with a 200 range bow.<br />
<br />
I hadn't used archery in that zone much, so don't know if it's just me.<br />
<br />
On the brighter side I sent a LVL 47 ranger a tell in the zone and had this conversation.<br />
<br />
<br />
You told LVL 47 Ranger, 'Have you tired any archery lately in this zone?'<br />
LVL 47 Ranger tells you, 'No never use it'<br />
You told LVL 47 Ranger, 'You never use archery? Ok thank you.'<br />
LVL 47 Ranger tells you, 'Its one of them most usless attacks in the world'<br />
<br />

Sad, that one should grow up without a clue or a mentor to help guide them....<br />

i agree with you fandros they probably should consider another class if they dont use there bow. <br />
in my opinion this is a rangers paradise on improving archery and track. (just waiting for that post 51 skill to start raising again, ;-)). but i got my skill to cap out very quickly hunting here. <br />
as for range i havent really noticed it too much. i use the bow of the huntsman which i believe has a 180 range and 150 range arrows. <br />
next time i am on ill check it out and see what happens. been busy getting my keys for seb and hs.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it's just something with the bigger mobs and there graphical scaling.</div></div><hr />
