<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
If you had just lost your guild so had no chance at runes anymore, and where trying like crazy to get 65 and want to be prepaired for it with the right spells already on hand, what order would you buy the level 65 spells?<br />
<br />
As they spells all have high costs to them, I can only do one or two a month (unless I get luck on rolling for nice items to sell), so want to make sure I get the most bang for my Plat on the first 2 purchases if at all possible.<br />
<br />
As a site note, lossing your guild at 64 has got to be one of the most painfull things to a shaman. No other raid guilds want a level 64, so the chance to get into other raids for the right gear and spells is just painfull if not impossible.<br />
<br />
So what order would you buy your spells in?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Q, Malos, BoS, 7, FA.<br />
<br />
If you expect to join a raiding guild right when you hit 65, move 7 up a slot or two...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Q, 7th, FA, BoS, Malos.  If you already have malo that is.  If you don't, I'd put malos #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">agree with cakaris fully, if you have malo dont need malos.  Q and Fo7 are very nice.  FA and BOS are fun but far from needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have Malo<br />
<br />
Q-7-BoS-Malos-FA<br />
<br />
No Malo<br />
<br />
Malos-Q-7-BoS-FA<br />
<br />
<br />
Gotta have that debuff (malo/s) even tho Q is uber...Q not going to save ya with a couple resisted slows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went malos, bos,fo7, FA, Q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have Malo :)<br />
<br />
Is Q that much more usefull than BOS if you have torpor?<br />
<br />
I had thought BOS, then Q, and then Fo7. <br />
<br />
I play half solo, half group these days. I have Can 5, but a lot of guilds seem to want at least 50 aaxp also. Up to 35, but going to take some time to get them aaxp rolling after 65.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answers so far :),<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's my order<br />
<br />
Q - first last always!<br />
BoS - no guild, yer gonna be doing a lot of exp/solo, this is a good one for it<br />
FA - can help in EXP/small raid (short refresh, better Avatar and not worn atk buff)<br />
Malos - somewhat better malo<br />
Fo7 - this is simply the group version of FoS.  No extra HP's, no longer duration, and the same cost as casting FoS three times.  It also hits on all members of your group, instantly pissing off clerics and caster classes.  For a non-guild Shammy, it's not worth it.<br />
<br />
Edit to answer your question.....<br />
Torpor changed your life.  Can V/Torpor was EXCELLENT for your mana and morale.  Getting Q will make you think that Torpor was complete crap!  Imagine, you now can be a SE Cleric for melees, as well as doing your Can V/Q dance....  Quiescence is BY FAR the best Shammy spell EVER (closely followed by Turgur's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My order would/could be different dependant upon your/my situation.<br />
<br />
Q-no question, way better than Torpor, number 1 priority, best spell we get at 65, raider, grouper or soloer, you use it constantly and would use it more than any other spell you could get, paid 40k.  I had torpor already for a long time, so this was a huge question in my mind if it should be first also, it should.<br />
FA-I never had any form of avatar so I thought this one very important, especially for groups, but also raiding, already had 45% extended buffs so not as aggrivating to cast all the time, paid 25k.<br />
Fo7-was working on MGB and knew I would need for that one reason, if I wasnt a raider however I wouldnt have valued it so high on the list, paid 30k.<br />
BoS-I dont solo much/any so to me its nice, but not necessary and falls way below my first 3 choices, dont have yet, likely to wait for rune.<br />
Malos-already have malo and malosinia (and 2 other shaman in guild have Malos), so in no hurry to get this one and because of that, its my last choice, dont have yet, likely to wait for rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Q godly. Paid 50k for it and am completely happy. Am a bit pissed that my cleric gets a group version at 60 for 5pp off a vendor though.<br />
<br />
FA if you use a parser and group with mellees a lot the dps increase this gives you is amazing without making you #1 choice on the lunch menu. Happily paid 20k.<br />
<br />
BoS gotta love the DPS. Paid 15k. <br />
<br />
Fo7 wasn't in a big hurry to get it but bought a rune MQ off a guildie for 7.5k and got it. Its nice but no biggie. <br />
<br />
Malos I'll get it when I get it. 10 more debuff is no big deal to me to spend 30k+ on. If I see it up for 10k or less I'd probably buy it, otherwise whenever I happen to get it is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">since you have malo<br />
<br />
Q first for sure<br />
<br />
Now next question would be...are you going to grp or solo  or a mix?<br />
<br />
solo-BoS-dd'less dot is just bad ass<br />
grp-7 is good..but so would BoS this could be a toss up to whatever u want<br />
mix-then i would say BoS<br />
<br />
after Q, (BoS,7), then go malos and FA<br />
<br />
malos is just a nice upgrade and will help you more than FA will.<br />
<br />
FA is nice...but not OMG I MUST HAVE IT NOW nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get flagged for BoT and xp there as much as possible in the upper wings.  Named wing bosses drop runes.  OR if you are Tactics flagged there are a few places like the kitchen that have named spawns that drop runes as well.  No reason to farm gimpy mobs for cash to buy spells at all IMO.  I know quite a few shaman that have all their runes and got them in xp groups.<br />
<br />
As far as order to buy them in if you have to...  If you are soloing a lot and want to increase your efficiency there, get BoS first since I think you said you have Torpor and Malo already.  After that I'd go for Q and Malos.  lastly Fo7 and FA.  <br />
<br />
Now if you group fairly often, Q is damn handy as it allows you to be sole healer in many spots without gimping your melees, and IMO FA is a noticeable boost for all those melees in groups.<br />
<br />
It all kinda depends on your playstyle, but I'd be camping those wing bosses in BoT and/or Tactics to get the runes on your own while you're making xp to get to 65.  Save ya a ton of cash at least. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Q is definitely number one priority.  It will seriously change your life and make you a MUCH better healer.  There's a night and day difference between Q-equipped shamans and Torpor-equipped shamans.  <br />
<br />
Second would be Fo7.  It's a must have for raiding, and raiding is the name of the high-end game.  Nothing says luvin like MGB Fo7!<br />
<br />
Third is FA.  No avatar is nearly as good as this spell, and it will make a lot of MAs and group melees very very happy.  Which increases your reputation as a shaman.  Which helps you get groups and raises people's idea of your power.  So I rate this number 3.<br />
<br />
4th is Malos.  Having this for raids to more fully debuff difficult resistant mobs is kewl.  However Malo will also work if the enchanter remembers to tash.  I dunno.  <br />
<br />
BoSaryn:  this spell is really nice and will greatly increase your soloing ability.  However, the game is very little based on solo ability, and much more focus placed on grouping and raiding.  Thus, this is the last spell you should shoot for.  <br />
<br />
Currently, I have Q, Fo7, and FA.  Still need the last two.</div></div><hr />
