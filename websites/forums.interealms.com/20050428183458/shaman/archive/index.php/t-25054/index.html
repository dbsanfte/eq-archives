<br />
DAOC retains the title of having the smoothest launch ever.</div></div><hr />

Worst launch to date, save AO.<br />
<br />
It's pretty sad that they also take down their forums when there are server problems. Pretty pathetic overall.<br />
<br />
I'll give 'em till the end of my free month to get it fixed. Otherwise I'll go back to CoH and check in on WoW every now and then until they get their sh!t together, but I'm sure as hell not gonna pay a monthly fee for this kind of performance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW was the big one, everyone has been waiting for WoW, its the EQ killer. Just try to remember that fact when the lag comes and have patience. <br />

They did give everyone that signed up the first week of release a free month tho.  This was also about 4+ years ago.<br />

<br />
Actually having a que so that n00b zones are not a complete &quot;stand in line till a mob spawn&quot; fest is not that bad an idea.<br />
<br />
The major flaw Blizzard made is splitting up the server parks and outsourcing the server parks (and maybe when you do outsource you should not go for the lowest bid in cases like this)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's not the worst launch ever like so many people are screaming over on their forums.  However I DO have a SERIOUS problem with the launch (not the game itself).<br />
<br />
My guild pinned down a CST PVE server before launch.  On launch we chose 1 of the 4 available, Stormreaver,  deliberately choosing to avoid Archimonde because we knew that server was going to be swarmed by organized &quot;hardcore&quot; PVP guilds.<br />
<br />
Everything was fine til early evening yesterday when the queues showed up and people could not get in to join us.  After some deliberation and despite over half of us being over level 10 we pulled the plug and moved to one of the new servers.<br />
<br />
We are primarily EST heavy but have people from all over the country and also some foreign (that's why we chose CST to begin with - because it was a middle ground).  Well where did we end up?   PST.  Why?  Because Blizzard was now essentially forcing people to give up on EST/CST servers with the queues they were experiencing.  Basically last night the only accessible servers were PST.  So now I'm almost afraid to play and level up... but can't see going anywhere but where friends are - maybe they'll offer server moves at some point?  unlikely.  Server splits are even less likely given how many new servers they have continued to put up.  So now as an ESTer I get to play Pacific where I get crappy latency...  I'm scared to see what will happen to our Euro friends running all the way around the globe to Pacific.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly well disgusted by the whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The major flaw Blizzard made is splitting up the server parks and outsourcing the server parks (and maybe when you do outsource you should not go for the lowest bid in cases like this)<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with you here aside from the lowest bid part.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw I've never heard the term &quot;server park&quot; before, only server farm or data center.  But ennywho - outsourcing?  Blizzard is not in business as a web hoster, and I certainly would not have expected them to build their own server farms from scratch to do so.<br />
<br />
Also, splitting them up is logical and sensible for many reasons.  The principle behind it goes back to their whole localization concept.  The idea that people connect regionally makes sense.  It allows them to control and provide more diverse and better connectivity opportunities to the end users.  If they only have one server farm in say California you  have everyone on the East coast potentially suffering far worse latency than the rest.  You invite a potential lack of redundancy.  Something freakish happens and facilities providing bandwidth to the site or the site itself is destroyed, you lose everything.  Unlikely yes.  But smart from a networking perspective.<br />
Single point of failure = bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So let's see 2 weeks ago they host open beta. 500 000. Let me spell that for you<br />
<br />
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE.<br />
<br />
So..half a million people apply it's a safe bet that a number close to 500 000 are going to try the game in retail even though many screamed &quot;omg 15 dollars a month no way never boycott now&quot;.<br />
<br />
So let's say 450 000 people will be hammering the servers on the first day if not second day of the launch and beyond. Why in god's name did they have the &quot;stress test&quot; and open beta? There were problems then and i didn't bitch at them then because i was not paying to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
They did the same with diablo2 on launch day. Bnet died cause about 1 million people were trying to connect to it.<br />
<br />
This time they knew the numbers and server capabilities why didn't they do anything. Sigh. I got two more tests this week so my play time is cut in half. So it won't hurt as MUCH but if this is not fixed by the weekend i will be megapissed. Simply get more servers up. A LOT more on the central and EST because that's where most NA players are apparently.<br />

Too many short-term memory folks here - seem to have forgotten EQ (and the 2 weeks for free payback after the abyssmal start), AO (and its associated &quot;do-over&quot;), DAoC (and their lack of content/incomplete game engine - another Vivendi distribution, BTW), and the worst one of all time: SWG (with its non-functioning database engine).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't keep up on all the details, but from my understanding, Vivendi owns Blizzard.  They bought them from someone or other I can't remember a couple years back, and they're under the umbrella of &quot;VU Games&quot;.  Don't think Blizzard had much, or any, say in the deal.  Since VU owns them, they also will do their own publishing, and I doubt Blizzard had a word in on this either.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the main WoW page they say 200k accounts in the first day.  Very likely we'll be rolling over that 500,000 beta signup mark pretty quickly.  Explains some of the lag issues, but not all, since the open beta was functioning with a claimed 500,000, and I'd assume a lot of it is the same hardware.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MrKnowItAll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When EQ1 came out they didnt have anywhere near 500,000 people trying to log in at once, and they faired worse than what Blizzard are now. So I dont really see the point the first post is trying to make.<br />
<br />
Give them a chance, it took them a couple of weeks to get EQ1 under control.  If Blizzard are still having these same problems in 2 weeks then yes you can say Sony&gt;Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Im just wondering how much freetime Blizzard are going to give away to make up for it ;) If they dont give away anything at all, then that is pretty sad considering what Verant did when EQ1 had a dismal launch. Atleast Blizzards servers are up most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Atleast Blizzards servers are up most of the time.<br />

If a server is up, but I lag whenever I try and loot - am I really playing?<br />
<br />
Lag, die, run to body, rez. Repeat  ad infinitum .<br />
<br />
It is not a population issue. The problem(s) exist on low population servers as well.<br />
<br />
Simple fixes:<br />
<br />
1) Cap servers<br />
2) Offer one-time free moves<br />
3) 2-1. For every day this is going on, offer two free days of play.</div></div><hr />

Its not that i dont want it to suck, its just that i expected this the day i heard a MMORPG that will rival EQ that is made by blizzard is coming out. People are freaking out and going nuts like blizzard has earned this huge bad rep and they must now suffer cause there is a lil lag on day 1 of release. People are shouting about taking the game back cause it didnt work for 1 day. They lost 77 cents, not to mention the first month is technicaly free, no matter what people want to word the text on the box to mean.<br />
<br />
Im sorry, but people just need to relax. This is huge complex system that will need to be tuned to work perfect and they also underestimated the number of people that were going to flock to it.<br />
<br />
Chill out, pick up another hobby and come back the next day. I have had no problems today, the lag is gone and there is no other problems that i personaly know about. The game is now running perfectly in my interactions with it. <br />
<br />
Except reality. Nothing is perfect in this world, things rarely go off without a hitch and dont crucify a comapny cause they arent jesus incarnate of the gaming world.  They are doing a good job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">All these issues seem to be pretty much resolved.  I'm a little bitter about leveling to 16 on Mal'Ganis and then having the server come down indefinately, thus forcing me to do the tauren shaman newb stuff for a THIRD time on a new server, but I'm over it now.<br />
<br />
I occasionally get a spot of lag, but my cable is kind of shoddy so I'm not sure that it is Blizzard's fault.  I see people whining about lag in general chat sometimes, but it is usually the same people every time so I think it is on their end.<br />
<br />
The servers are more evenly populated now and queues are a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
I can really only think of two things that could have been done better:<br />
<br />
1)  More servers from the beginning.  On opening night there were about 4 central PvP servers, and they all go overloaded, resulting in 500+ queue's and lag.  My server, Mal'Ganis, eventually melted and went offline for several days.  After the first day they added LOTS of new servers.  Those servers should have been there from the beginning.<br />
<br />
2)  Offer free character moves to people who were on Mal'Ganis or any other server with long-term issues.  I'd be 26+ by now probably if I didn't have to start over.<br />
<br />
Right now the game is running great and I have no issues with it, and it's been like that for the last few days.  It was really only the first 2-3 days that were bad, and I mean really, what did you expect?  Anyone who cried and whined can come back now.  Or not, you won't really be missed.</div></div><hr />

From what I've read, their current single point of failure is that all servers are hitting the same item database, unlike other games where each server has it's own. A lot of the in game lag that players are experiencing is supposedly due to this.<br />

Can you verify this? I was speculating that they were using one item db per time zone which would be bad enough.  If they're using one freakin' server game wide... yikes.  That would explain a lot.  Considering the complete independence of the data between servers, I don't see any reason it couldn't easily be divided between more physical db servers.  <br />
<br />
The only flaw in this assumption though is that a lot of the issues are time zone or realm specific.  Of course it's very possible that they have a memory leak on the realm servers and load issues on the db server.  That would be a lot of fun to track down.  But if they only have one db server- please, divide the data and conquer already.</div></div><hr />

I thought all the servers were physically located at that phat hub in Virginia and the time zones were just for gameplay purposes, not latency.  Does anyone have have concrete information on this?  I'm going off memory from quite a few weeks back.  The game is noticeably less stable when I play at night than when I play in the morning.  In the early morning it's like playing a FPS, very very smooth- well, when they aren't crashing the server or taking it down for maintenance 2 hours late that is.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where do you think AOL has it's servers?  Just a few miles from Blizzards.  Northern VA is the Internet hub for the east coast (if not world).  More Internet companies have their server farms here than anywhere else.  Why? Because of the infrastructure and available bandwidth and technical manpower.  It's also infinitely easier and cheaper to support one location and keep them all configured properly than to do it for locations all over the globe.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no advantage to having a server locally, even across the street from your house, as long as you have good connectivity to either machine the performance will be the same.  Just like driving 5 miles or 30 miles, the time it takes is based on the conditions of the road and traffic, not just the distance.  In this case, the distance is much less a factor, because at the speed of light, the difference in distance it irrelevant.<br />

Now, yes, I realize that the longer distances might mean that your connectivity suffers due to poor servers along the way, however, that would happen if you lived across the street from that same server.  So again, distance has very little to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I thought all the servers were physically located at that phat hub in Virginia and the time zones were just for gameplay purposes, not latency.  <br />
Yeah, I thought the same thing too Iz - I've visited the location of the server farm here in VA (Reston) after the tornado hit their building.  At that time all 3 beta servers and the first stress test were housed in there.  I assumed the whole game was going to be there as well, but read some things on the WoW boards that led me to believe they'd contracted out server farms in each time zone (was a Blue Post, not the usual blathering kind).  Now I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I can say this - I routinely get latencies under 50 ms playing WoW (tracked outside the game using ping plotter), not that it makes much diference with some of the server lag we've seen!<br />
There is absolutely no advantage to having a server locally, even across the street from your house, as long as you have good connectivity to either machine the performance will be the same.<br />
I would submit that the average 50ms ping, 5 hop connection  I get off the local WoW and DAoC servers makes a big difference compared to the average 140ms, 11 hop ping I used to get to the EQ servers in San Diego.  It's noticeable in gameplay.  It's pretty hard for the average residential broadband connection to get much bette than that (and usually it's much worse).  Still, 0.05 seconds versus 0.14 seconds shouldn't be too big of an issue!  :p</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft Shatters Day-One Sales Records<br />
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 1, 2004--<br />
<br />
Blizzard's Newest Title Becomes North America's Fastest-Selling PC Game Ever, with Record Number of Accounts Created and Concurrent Players in First 24 Hours<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment(R) today confirmed that World of Warcraft(R) has broken day-one sales records in North America, making it the most successful PC game launch ever. World of Warcraft, the company's subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), sold through to over 240,000 customers at retailers in North America on Tuesday, November 23, selling more in its first 24 hours than any other PC game in history.(a) <br />
<br />
In addition to shattering sales records, World of Warcraft also broke peak concurrency and account creation records for a MMORPG. Within the first day, over 200,000 players created World of Warcraft accounts. By 5:00 p.m. PST, over 100,000 were playing the game concurrently. These two record-breaking numbers made World of Warcraft the fastest-growing MMORPG in history. Within a single day, all original 40+ World of Warcraft servers were filled to capacity, and by the end of the Thanksgiving weekend, more than 40 additional servers were deployed to meet the rapidly growing player base, as the number of new accounts and concurrent users continued to grow. <br />
<br />
&quot;We were all extremely pleased with the success of World of Warcraft on its first day of launch,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;Once we saw the numbers for the first day, we knew that we had to immediately increase capacity to accommodate the huge numbers of players joining our game. We're glad so many people are enjoying World of Warcraft, and we are dedicated to supporting a fun and smooth game experience for everyone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Retailers across North America reported that the World of Warcraft launch was unequivocally their biggest day-one sales in PC gaming history. Leading industry retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, EB, and GameStop, all reported that hundreds of their stores sold out of World of Warcraft within the first day. <br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft has once again shown that Blizzard consistently delivers the best games in the industry,&quot; said Robert McKenzie, vice president of merchandising at GameStop. &quot;It sold better than any other PC game this year -- in fact, World of Warcraft enjoyed the best day-one sell-through GameStop has ever seen on a PC title!&quot; <br />
<br />
Over the Thanksgiving weekend, players continued to buy World of Warcraft in record numbers, with a total of over 350,000(a) copies of the game selling through. Blizzard Entertainment and its retail partners expect the remaining supplies of World of Warcraft to sell out soon. Blizzard is currently evaluating its ability to ship additional games to retailers, given the unexpectedly high demand on the servers. The company continues to increase server capacity to accommodate the growing number of players connecting to the game. As the additional servers are brought online and proven stable, additional copies of World of Warcraft will be made available at retail. Blizzard will announce the availability of those additional games as soon as they are on shelves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tombfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I've still not seen any lag, nor have I had to wait in a queue on the Hyjal server where I started on the day of launch. The only game-stopping experience I've had was when the servers were taken down a few days after launch for extended maintenance.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there have been server crashes and such, but I've managed to miss them all somehow. <br />
<br />
WoW has really shocked me in how good, fun, and addicting it is. It reminds me of EQ when I first started playing...without the BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">The part that amazes me is in one week (actually about 5 days), Blizzard wrapped up their open beta, shipped out the Gold version, mated up CDs, Instructions, and Boxing, shipped it to distributors, and had it on my front doorstep by 10:00 in the morning of the 5th day.  I realize a lot of the effort can be done in advance, but that's still pretty darned impressive.  They (and by &quot;they&quot; I mean Vivendi) must have had a lot of production lines ready to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Yep...I'm very impressed with what I've seen so far.  I expected some lag/concurrency issues (and I've gotten some), but they have far exceeded my expectations in terms of the actual game play - which is where it counts because that's what is important in the long run.  (and I'm assuming they will sort out lag/concurrency in a couple weeks)</div></div><hr />

Let me give you a BIG hint.<br />
<br />
People who did not do beta had to patch upon install. IE the Gold version was out of date (i.e. went to press before the completion of Beta). Its also likely the source of the lack of fixes in the first week.<br />
<br />
That being said I got 4 free days (even though I could play for most of it and I am on a high pop - i.e. original - server) and am struglling to remember why I play EQ. That being said wondering what 50+ is gonna look like from a content perspective. If they dont have an expansion online for Spring then they are STUPID.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I just think the final beta should have been extended so they could actually fix things, as it was, the gold copies must have been in production already. Getting better though, not queues to log in often at least, and generally only one crash a day!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Would be nice if they could do that Mill, but it's a real balancing act.  &quot;Perfection is the enemy of good enough&quot; in program development, but judging &quot;good enough&quot; can be dangerous.   Anarchy Online really missed the target by a long shot and never really recovered from it.  EQ1 was good enough (since its only competition was UO) and had great success.<br />
<br />
Staying with development before release for too long can kill you too.  A team like WoW's can be big.  A run-through of the credits got a me a count of over 500 folks involved with the WoW development/release.  The development of a program like this reaches its peak as you approach release - with no real revenue stream to support it.  If the average salary if these employees is around $50,000 per year (ranging from ~$20,000 to ~$200,000), WoW was burning something over $1 million per week in the final weeks of development!  You can't keep that up too long before you go out of business, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />
