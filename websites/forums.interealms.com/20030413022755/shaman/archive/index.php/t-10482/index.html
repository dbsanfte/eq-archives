<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, just 3 days after the anniversary of the Space Shuttle Challenger, we lost another. <br />
<br />
I hope each and every one of you will say a prayer for the 7 astronauts on board and for their families.<br />
<br />
My sister called me this morning from Plano, TX to tell me she watched the shuttle go to pieces after she heard the explosion.<br />
<br />
A sad day for the United States and Israel. <br />
<br />
God Bless them :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Err why?<br />
<br />
I just can't feel the slightest twinge of pity for people I never met. They were astronouts so there heros now? I bet more postmen get killed on average then astronauts, where are there prayers.<br />
<br />
Hypocrite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mrens, you are one sick and twisted F&amp;&amp;K. You are the epitomy of what is wrong with the world today.<br />
<br />
I say a prayer anytime I hear about anyone dying whether it is a postman or an astronaut. Did I say the word Hero anywhere?<br />
<br />
You are truly a piece of Shi7</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh BTW Mrens, I just looked at your Magelo. Is being a gimp Shaman what causes you to be such an uncaring jerk-off?<br />
<br />
Just curious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Brax I understand how you can be angry, but I don't think personally attacking Mrens (or Mrens's profile) will help much.<br />
<br />
It truly is a tragic event though :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your right Garf, attacking his profile is pointless and silly, but was the next best thing I could do to actually kicking his arse.<br />
<br />
And BTW the kid personally attacked me by calling me a hypocrite because I feel sad for what has just happened?<br />
<br />
I didn't know caring was hypocritical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">horrible tragedy...  :(<br />
<br />
/moment of silence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My equipment sucks :(<br />
<br />
Now that is a truely tradgic event, my thoughts and prayers go out to all shamans who can't afford to be as Uber as Braxton :(<br />
<br />
God bless those Charred guardian shield users.<br />
<br />
All kidding aside I didn't mean to sound insensitive just why is this such a tragedy? Because there famous? Just seems silly. I mean I love my granma, if she died I wouldent feel the slighest bit of pity though, because shes not famous enogh to be in the news (Thats how I should feel right? According to you)<br />
<br />
I have a challenge for you Braxton, withought looking it up could you give me the names of half of the astronauts who died? Didn't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can't we just feel sorry for the families? If you had a relative die, I'm sure you wouldn't expect the people here to tell you they don't care at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What are postmen doing to try and advance the human race? When they arent going berzerk and killing all their co-workers. <br />
<br />
Yep, feel alot sadder that explorers and scientists blew up then a buncha obsolete snail mail deliverers. The earth is a fragile basket, and right now all of humankinds eggs are in it. If we still want to be around in a couple hundred thousand years we need to get off it and plant our seeds elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Not only is it sad for the crew of the shuttle and their families, but for our chances of ever fulfilling a destiny amongst the stars, when the politicians decide to use this as an excuse to spend money bombing rustic backwards desert nations then trying to advance the human race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ive had realitives who have died, did you feel sorry for them or me? No?<br />
<br />
Ohh wait the news didn't do a report about them and tell you how to feel, why should you feel bad.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't need half of america who has never even heard of my loved ones feeling sorry for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mrens, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You are right Karlen this is a devistating blow to our space program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mrens,<br />
<br />
How old are you? 13?<br />
<br />
Like I said, you are the epitomy of what is wrong with this world today. People today are so desensitized that they see no sadness in the death of people or tragic events like this.<br />
<br />
No, I do not know all the names of the astronauts that perished today, nor do I need to know them for my heart to go out to them and their families. You see Mren, when people die it is final. I did not say these astronauts were heros who saved that world. They were humans though, with lives and families.<br />
<br />
Can you please point out to me where I said this is only sad because they were in the news?<br />
<br />
I was in the army for 4 years and stationed in Germany when the marine barracks were bombed. I assisted in the triage of helping innocent people with shrapnel all over there body and witnessed first hand the suffering they experienced. I didn't know any of them, but I did cry for them. <br />
<br />
I am sorry you have a heart as cold as ice and will pray for you even more Mrens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mrens I hate getting into flameing wars but you truly are an ass. Oh and by the way if I knew that someone in your family had died I would feel the same for you as I feel these people. I dont know how old you are but grow up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I see once again you dislike of anyone who dosent jump on your religious bandwagon has caused you to screw up my point.<br />
<br />
People die EVERY day! Funny how I don't see 5000 posts every day in these forums John Smith the III died today, lets have a moment of silence.<br />
<br />
Do you say a prayer every time you hear of someone die on the news?<br />
<br />
Do you feel incredibly depressed when you visit sights like &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot;?<br />
<br />
No you don't, the only reason you felt the need to post this drivel today is because you saw this as a event on the news you belived you could start a pity party on a message forum about.<br />
<br />
Do I feel sympathy for thos who died? Not really, but thats my choice.<br />
<br />
Do I care if you show symathy for them? Belive me I could care less.<br />
<br />
Do I find it ironic that people only seemed intersted in showing pity when they feel others share there views?<br />
<br />
So far you have insulted my equipment, called me a 13 year old, whats next? You going to threaten to find me an beat me up? Ohh wait you already did that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ignore List is a wonderful thing.  Bye Bye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You are truly a sad individual Mrens, I truly pity you. If you didn't care at all about what happened, why do you bother posting your drivel?<br />
<br />
My post was meant to be nothing but a solemn and sincere tribute to 7 people who lost their lives this morning. Tis just sad that the ones taken were those of the caliber to aspire to advance our civilization and not someone like you that can only ridicule someone that actually has some feelings left in them.<br />
<br />
The fact that you are someone that doesnt care about anyone but yourself and those you personally know is not why I insulted you, it's because you called me a hypocrite because I dare to care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for Mrens he is the type of prick who probably felt nothing when all those lives were lost on 9/11.. I felt sad for them and thier families. Even tho I did not know any of them and even tho over 90% were'nt &quot;hero's&quot;. They were every day people. and it was a tragic event like this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Coralie,<br />
<br />
Your location shows you to be from France?<br />
<br />
Why am I not surprised to see yet another example of the attitude displayed towards an American tragedy from someone of a particular nationality whose ass the US has saved more than once?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We care especially about the austronauts because they are some of the brightest people in America.  It could be argued that they are doing some of the most important work on the planet.<br />

P.S.  When Mren dies everyone will celebrate :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just can't belive that all of you are getting upset over this when none of you even knew these peoples names 9 hours ago. Some of you still don't know these peoples names and yet you still think anyone who dosent feel the same as you is &quot;pathetic&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">To paraphrase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some people I never knew about died, im going to pray for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me &quot;Where is your pitty for the millions that die every day but don't make the news?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG u r such a troll banplz&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">just can't feel the slightest twinge of pity for people I never met.<br />
<br />
Interesting. How about this person?<br />
<br />
http://www.snopes2.com/inboxer/graphics/drunk.pps <br />
<br />
PS the images are disturbing.  If you aren't Mrens (who won't care a thing about this person) you might not want to follow the link.<br />
<br />
I also think it's worth pointing out that most sociopaths also have difficulty experiencing empathy for other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">mrens, instead of commenting on the original posters sentiments you could have simply not posted. Could have chuckled to yourself over the 'hypocrisy' of someone expressing a viewpoint that you disagreed with.  <br />
<br />
You could have moved along, ignored the whole thing, gone back to reading, playing or something else.<br />
<br />
Instead you posted inflammatory statements, without thought, care or regard to the person who started this thread and the emotions he or she was trying to convey.<br />
<br />
You're right - I don't need to be told when to grieve. You're right, you shouldn't be banned for posting your thoughts.<br />
<br />
But for all the other reasons I posted you are a troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">God, I missed the &quot;disturbing&quot; part of your post.<br />
<br />
What a brave, brave young woman. I hope the drunk who hit her, got life in prison with daily rapings and getting dipped in fire.<br />
<br />
Wow. Kudos to the young lady. What a incredible family she must have. <br />
<br />
And what a TOUGH Girl to live through that.<br />

You obviously have no prespective on who astronauts are or what they do for a living.  A postal worker goes to work every day and the major problem they deal with is traffic.  It's nowhere near as dangerous a job as reentering the atmosphere at over 12000 miles an hour.  A postal worker doesn't train, exercise, eat, sleep, day after day just to do their job.  Delivering mail just isn't that hard.  The people that go into space are dedicated, focused people chasing the dream of space exploration.  They are the very essence of what it means to be a hero.  No - we don't know their names, because the media is busy chasing political scandal, murder, who is sleeping with who, etc.  The positive side of the world never makes it to the news except in tragedy.<br />
<br />
People from broken homes, drug addicts, the French :) , etc. that have never dealt with these issues have so much focus on themselves that they just can't understand anything outside their own universe of complete and total selfishness.  We can only pity you Mrens.<br />
<br />
And meanwhile, pray for the families of these heroes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Mrens you knew you would get flamed when you posted your comments and someone said something you had to come back with a commet. All i can say is **** can keep your opinions to yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Posting my opinions on a public message  board, how dare I</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Posting your opinions is fine. I can respect opinions.<br />
<br />
Publicly slamming national and international heros who died tragically serving their countries....pathetically bad taste.<br />
<br />
I value your opinion exactly what I paid for it....squat.<br />
<br />
Thank you, have a nice day. Please drive through, only please don't come again.<br />
<br />
/ignore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well, if Mrens feels that these astronauts, that had dedicated their lives to something as valuable as space exploration and the betterment of mankind, were not of enough value to mourn for them and their values; then Mren's life must be less in value to that of a cockroach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Keene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">It doesn't matter a whit that these people were astronauts.  It doesn't matter if you considered them hero's.  It doesn't matter whether or not they were famous.<br />
<br />
What matters is that some souls that were loved by some or many on this earth are gone.  Their families now have to go on without a father or son, Mother or daughter.<br />
<br />
Feeling sympathy in any shape is the HUMAN thing to do.  Compassion does not have a nationality, nor does it care about fame.  It just is.  Love of your fellow human being is something that is both noble and proper.  Your blatant disregard for these feelings is beyond callous.  It is cruel.  You mock others for caring while you do not.  In truth, I almost pity you as much as the families who have experianced loss, be they astronauts, postmen or just a family member.<br />
<br />
Your life must be empty and alone.  For that I pity you.<br />
