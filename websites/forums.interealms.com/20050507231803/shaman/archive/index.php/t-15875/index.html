<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some time now I have been wondering why it is that in EQ every caster always ends up with the same spell line up.<br />
In my opinion it would be much more fun if caster had a basic set that they all shared (per class that is) and then had the option to customize some spells.<br />
<br />
Now I know that you can not make the difference in spells that are available to big or you will end up with everybody still picking the same spells. (min-max effect)<br />
However there are a few options that from my point of few would work.<br />
<br />
Examples could be:<br />
<br />
1 – A DD spell where you can pick the resist type it checks against<br />
2 – A heal spell where you can pick from various amounts of HP healed per second cast time (as example: 3 sec cast time = 600 HP healed, 4 sec cast time = 800 hp healed, etc)<br />
3 – A proc buff with various effects<br />
Etc <br />
<br />
You can create some diversion this way without making some spells extreme rare (ancients when first created) or the result of long quests.<br />
<br />
And as SoE has started with displaying what spells do they can simply put this type of spells on merchants who shows you what each spell does and checks that you can only have 1 spell per set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dark Age of Camelot had something like this with their caster class implementations.<br />
<br />
Basically, in DAoC you received nnn character points each time you leveled, and you could choose to spend them along a skill-progression tree that branched out into the various types of magic specializations.<br />
<br />
Everyone of a base class got the same base spells, but depending on their specialization path - characters receive different higher power spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was a little funkier than that... in DAoC, each caster class got 3 &quot;schools&quot; (I forget the exact terminology&quot; of magic, and there were 2 spell lists in the school, the base, and the specialization.  Each would have a spell every 2 or 3 levels.<br />
<br />
As you leveled up, you automatically got the base line spells, you also got specialization points equal to your level, and that's what it cost to raise the specialization level, which gave you both that line of spells, plus it helped the base line spells, usually with smaller variance.  For example, if you're a shaman, raising your mending (I think that was the name) specialization gives you better heals in the specialized mending line, but instead of your base mending heal doing from, say, 50 to 200, it might do 150 to 200.<br />
<br />
The way the cost system was set up, it encouraged splitting your points between two spec lines, or one heavily and a smattering with two<br />
lesser ones.  For the classes where it was balanced, it led to 2 or 3 seperate common paths.  For some others though, the power path was pretty clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Almost sounds like how most next generation MMOGs are going to be.  SWG has a system where you get to choose where to put your skill points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But it was still class based.  You took a generic class to level...  5, I think, then took a specific class -- a &quot;seer&quot; became a shaman (mostly a buff/DoT class with a little healing) or healer (a cleric type with good crowd control skills but 0 offense), for instance.  Apart from that minor detail, it's still very class-structured, you just had a little wiggle room in what direction you wanted to weight your spell set.<br />
<br />
A couple hybrid classes had a little more play, letting them toss almost everything into melee-type skills, or go a little heavier on the magic stuff, but again, for a lot of classes there is/was a clear choice (I haven't played for quite a while).<br />
<br />
BTW, from what I hear, EQ2 is taking the proto-class approach that DAoC toyed with but is extending it further so that you're not actually set in a class until about level 20 or so.  That could add a little interest to early game development, or it could make it more dull.  I played all the healer-base types in DAoC up to at least 20, and I tell you, going through being a newbie Hibernian with the exact same skill set for the 3rd time got kind of old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The advantage to the EQ system is that everyone is on even ground across the board once they get a spell.  The problem with skill based systems like DAoC is that they kept changing the template (hence the stupid two respecs they handed out after I left the game.)  <br />
<br />
If they let you reconfigure your character semi on the fly then a skill based system would be alright.  But I don't see it as a huge improvement over what EverQuest does now.  It just means your character would be able to do X,Y,Z or A,B,C depending on how you configured it, whereas in EQ they just said ok this character can do X,Y,Z,A,B,C without having to hassle with allocating points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Welllllll... kind of.  I mean, it's not like there's usually black/white can I/can't I do this.  It's more like, do I want really good nukes and squeak by with a 20 second mez, or mediocre nukes and lock down 3 mobs at a time?  And how much of those would I give up for a good (or bad?) snare.  That was Sorceror I think?  Like I said, it's been a while.  Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Like I said, not all the classes had balanced paths.  The class I ended up playing most, Warden, was a tank/priest hybrid had a pretty well defined path due to one of its lines being the best damage mitigation in the game (gee, sound familiar?)  and the rest was a quibble on the exact degree of offensive melee vs healing power, but it wasn't much of a difference.<br />
<br />
There were at least 3 or 4 flavors of Mentalist though (a very flexible robed caster that also had limited heals -- kind of the jack-of-all-trades caster).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd much rather see them add deity-specific spells for the six priest classes (Shaman, Druid, Cleric, and their hybrids). It's not so much a concern for int casters, because they supposedly get their spells through researching other people's stuff, and thus aren't channeling the will of gods.<br />
<br />
Why do clerics of Bertoxxulous and Rodcet Nife heal as well as one another? Why do Karana druids get Tunare's Behest and Tunare druids get Wake of Karana (Sorry, i'm bad at Druid spells). <br />
<br />
I remember back in the early days of PoP rumor, someone at Sony said the Gods would have more in-game effect... We later learned this means they're going to lead you along to Druzzil Ro's rewind button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I sent in an idea to SOE to just add in some AA related &quot;fields&quot; of magic.  Where you could progress along spells in a field by spending AA towards it.  That wouldn't remove anything already there, but it could enable different people to get new spells - or maybe new spell lines as they wanted, and have spell scrolls (maybe researchable), specifically for those fields of study rather than any specific class...<br />
<br />
Something like &quot;metamagic&quot; was an idea I offered, where metamagic spells would handle magic relating to other magic - say enabling you to cast a spell-reflection buff on yourself or your partymembers that could absorb up to a set amount of damage/mana from incoming spells ... or have a mana-absorption metabuff where incoming magic would be partially converted back into your manapool as it hit you, depending on the strength of the metabuff spell.<br />
<br />
Say a mob casts a spell at you that might do nnn damage.  The meta-buff would convert y% of nnn back into your useable mana, and you get tagged by the remainder - or rebound it back to the caster, and after the buff hits it's limit, it poofs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">or maybe something like what these guys are doing:<br />

that makes alot of since i dont know why dieties don't more influence then just making a few more items wearable<br />
<br />
as for the original suggestion i don't think SOE would go for it and wouldnt take the time plus theres more important things to work on</div></div><hr />
