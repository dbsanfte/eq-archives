Perhaps you should be more specific about which mobs you are interested in.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure Fippy Darkpaw pops within a few minutes of Fippy Darkpaw popping, actually.<br />

Comments on a few spawns (mostly from memory, so cut me some slack):<br />
<br />
As nearly as I can tell, all elemental minis spawn on a 3-day cycle now, but at least in Fire, that cycle is VERY variable. My opinion is that it is 3 days +- 48 hours--its not unusual for Pyronis in particular to spawn within a day or so of his last downing. GoD/FRo is definitely 3 day, +- roughly 12 hours. Earth rings seem 3 day, Croc slightly more variable. Air rings I think are 3-day, but don't quote me on that. Water-don't do them enough to be sure, but they seem to be 3 day also. <br />
<br />
Don't think any of the elemental minis spawn on server set, but often do shortly afterwards. Elemental gods definitely don't, since resets don't affect them, supposedly.<br />
<br />
Seru is either 12 or 14 days, don't remember which. I think Emp is 7 day. I don't think either of them auto-spawn on server up, either.<br />
<br />
VT, if I recall correctly, spawns on server up, but the warders don't, so you have to wait for the warders anyway, or else things get buggy.<br />
<br />
Kael bosses aren't up on server up, but usually within a day of reset. <br />
<br />
Don't remember spawn cycle in ToV, nor whether it is up on reset.<br />
<br />
Don't know if any of that was much help, tbh :)<br />
