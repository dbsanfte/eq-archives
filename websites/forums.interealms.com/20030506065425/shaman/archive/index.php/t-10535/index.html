<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At what level is this dude killable by a group?  The group will consist of shaman, cleric, mage, mage, enchanter and possibly another shaman or another pet class.  At the moment we are each near 20.  I am curious when the 5(6) of us could take this guy, I hear he is rather badass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He is rather badass for his level. He's got an unresistable knockback+DD (for 200ish?) proc and summons. He's slowable, but I'm not sure how his MR is before Malo. I died the first time I tried him at 60 due to the summon/knockback.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I kill this guy everytime I pass by him to get my guild Remove Curse. You can do it lower than 50, but I wouldnt be less than 46 without epic or JBB.<br />
<br />
I clear his little guys and they usually carry weapons. I give these to pet. Then I sic hasted and regen'd pet on him. I keep my MR up because he likes to Thunder Strike. I go into his room and put my back into one of the corners there. I just keep myself and Jabober healthy. Let the pet do all the work. Having regen on helps much because of the unresistable knockback. If your back is in the corner though you wont get interrupted. YInterruptions happen when you move from your initial casting point. Since you are not moving (only up and down) then you can still cast. You can time your casts between his knockback. You can cast your Ice DD if you like to hurry up the fight. <br />
<br />
He is a lot of fun to fight because it is a different sort of battle than I am used to. It takes me about 4 kills to get a spell. I give all eyes I get to my vendor and sell them cheap because he seems to drop it every time. The gloves are nice. I still use them on AE raids. +5 to mr/fr/cr. Not bad for easy junk.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you stand on the hill next saprophyte and just sick pet on Saprophyte you will avoid his AE.  I think its a z-axis 'sploit though so watch for GM's.  Easy to kill past level 50 so doesn't really matter after that.  Just buff up MR/PR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you for the input, very helpful.  Anyone know his spawn time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It was kinda long.. just under 3 hours or just under 4 hours? something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where does this guy spawn?  My cleric still needs this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He spawns in Echo Caverns. Heading towards Fungus Grove take a right in the hall just before you get to FG. Keep the little guys around him killed I think they heal. <br />
<br />
He's a toughie. I've seen him kill a 52 rogue who just wasn't ready for all the slinging around he did. But he was a piece of cake with a Shaman with him =).<br />
<br />
Also, his spawn time is just under 3 hours. He dropped the Remove Curse spell on my 3rd try =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Hen :)  Haven't seen you online lately; good to see you on here!</div></div><hr />
