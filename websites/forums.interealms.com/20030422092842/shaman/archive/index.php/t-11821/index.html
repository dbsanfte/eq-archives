<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My magelo is located at.. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62955 I'm going to try and rep my Enshrouded Veil for a Death Mask of the Elysians, shoulders with an ODS, and perhaps my band of the arisen cultist for another ring of gallantry.  I do have a band of the visionary.. though didn't want to rep it for the band of the arisen cultist since I think it had less ac and hp.  My neck slot is a bit lacking so there are a few options here.. Tracking Wolf Collar, Ribbon Choker, Clattering Bone Necklace, or an Iron Amulet of Unseen Horrors.. The Ribbon Choker I guess may be best since it's not too expensive.  My head slot is still lacking.. but nothing much out there that can be gotten for a low price and is much better that I've noticed.  Oh yah.. just got the black sleeves last night.. not sure if I want to completely use those instead of the cc I had on before yet =/</div></div><hr />
