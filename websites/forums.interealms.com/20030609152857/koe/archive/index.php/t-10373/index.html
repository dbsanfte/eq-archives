<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did anyone else get their equipment wiped in the recent Magelo upgrade? The additions look great, but I am having to set up all my equipment again since it is blank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EEK! My data  is poofed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems the magelo site is lagging. I betcha mine poofed too.<br />
<br />
*edit* dang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Noooooooo! Crap.... have to reset up so many characters.  ARG!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gonna give their updater a try now.  Don't feel like going back through by hand and rebuilding all that crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So, you gonna pay the $12/year for the auto updater?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If they get it working right, yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
One dollar a month is cheap for me to be able to check which character I left which item on last time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was updating Bemidian when it went down. I can't connect to it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Unfortunately the server's REALLY REALLY slow due to EVERYONE loggin on all at once to update their characters since there was the wipe.<br />
<br />
I would be entertained to see what FoH looks like now. A lot of them haven't been updating their profiles, but now with the whipe, they should have completely new ub3r gear on their profiles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got wiped as well, and only got a few items in before I said screw it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Magelo servers are temporarly down, we are investigating the scalability issue<br />
(20pm GMT) Update: We got an hardware issue, no data were lost but we will not be able to restart servers this night, should be up tomorrow morning. <br />
<br />
We apologize for any inconvenience, we understand that you are eager to use the new magelo features, be assured we are doing our best to bring servers back as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">magelo is back up and working. I was on it late but was able to reinput my equipment in no time flat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you goto &quot;Manage Alternate Profiles&quot;, there is a link on the alternate profile page that will bring up a list of your magelo 1.x profiles and the id's for the items so re-input is faster. Personally, I broke down and signed up for the yearly 12.00 membership to get the syncro. Figured it would save time and I could use it for both of my accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aneron your stuff is pulling up ok but mine is not. I have edited everything and can see it on magelo, but when I pull up my profile display it is blank. Is there anything you did special to save it?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Hmm I'm not sure how but it ss working now. I went back and hit the save and reload buttons. I didn't see anything special but nonetheless is working. Strange that you have to click save even though all the equipment is there every time I log in and out without clicking save.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Make sure on the manage equpitment screen to hit SAVE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Aye what Sori said. there is a save option at the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can see your equipment now Bem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">NOTE to those who have payed for a premium account<br />
<br />
Apprently your account doesn't go premium until Magelo gets final confirmation from paypal that it's cleared. I bought my premium account yesterday and paypal is estimating December 24th before it's verified cleared. So don't hound technical support until you've seen it clear on your bank account and/or online banking. Also make sure to keep your reciept from paypal of course :-D.</div></div><hr />
