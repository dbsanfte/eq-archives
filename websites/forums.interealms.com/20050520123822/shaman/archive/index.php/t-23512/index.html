<br />
What's going on here? Why do Druids get such a spell, when we have been asking for more durability through a stonstance AA. <br />
<br />
Aren't Shamans the ones with aggro problems, since we depend upon landing fast slows to perform our roles?<br />
<br />
-Shamans are THE class most in need of a short term defensive ability that enhances our durability to survive the unavoidable beating. <br />
-We have been CCing with our moderate tanking ability(via slows and HoTs) for a long time and actually lost most of this capability due to how the game has evolved and we have been neglected. <br />
-We should have been given something that allowed us to fulfill this pseudo-job as well as we once used to<br />
<br />
...instead they go and give a defensive emergency ability to Druids, who have never had anything close to this in any way, shape or form?<br />
<br />
What the hell am I missing? Why do Druids get this?<br />
<br />
Even if the Vindictive Spirit spell goes live with the recourse, there's no ****ing comparison as you'd have to cast an AE slow in order to benefit from the recourse.<br />
<br />
****ing gay.</div></div><hr />

Hello?  Knights?<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you think shamans need an offtanking ability more than knights, you're going to lose what is currently pretty decent support from at least the SK community for shaman fixes.  <br />
<br />
To claim that shamans are more entitled to a short-duration mitigation discipline to be used for offtanking than knights, the traditional offtanks, is simply proposterous.  <br />
<br />
None of that really matters too much, though.  With a 5000hp limit and 15min reuse, this ability isn't going to have any real significant impact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I think is, that Knights should get a defensive &quot;invulnerable&quot; disc(from front, be it parry, dodge, riposte or whatever doesn't matter) like every other melee, which allowed them to jump in and live long enough for healers to switch to him, in order to be able to pick up tanking and subsequently be the new MainTank.<br />
<br />
That obviously has nothing to do with the role of the Shaman, hence I wasn't in any way insinuating that Shamans needed something like that more than Knights. <br />
What I was talking about, is an ability that serves the Shaman to live through a number of hits in case of aggro, so that the tank can regain control or the shaman can pull the mob to the side to root it(exp mobs). <br />
<br />
An emergency ability to save his life, not to facilitate transitions or to offtank raid encounters. Just what this Druid spell will allow them to do and what they have no business doing.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Just to be clear:<br />

<br />
These are your quotes. <br />
First you are almost shocked, that we ask for a defensive ability over knights(which I already dismissed), yet you say &quot;this ability isn't going to have any real impact&quot;. <br />
If this is exactly the ability we want, and it has no significant impact(i.e. nothing knights would want), then how come you were offended, when, in your mind, I was asking for it over knights?<br />
<br />
I am curious.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully we'll get something else, they seem to be adding stuff to OoW even how close we are to the release date of it, so some of it will change and hopefully they'll look at shaman and see us as the underpowered class that we are, and fix us (what's that I see? is it a pig flying across the sky... hmm do they even have pigs in Norrath, or is it like cows, where their functions are fulfilled...

It looks more like they're fine tuning things now and less like they're going to be making big changes to spells.  But maybe that's just me.  Still, would have preferred that an SK get this over a lousy druid.  They really need something like weaponshield or this spell.</div></div><hr />

By the way, the most recent addition to this spell is &quot;Defensive Proc(6156)&quot;. This is probably something along the lines of the following proc &quot;spells&quot; recently added:<br />
Stun Effect (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6202&amp;source=Test) <br />
Rune Effect (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6203&amp;source=Test) (this one is the effect from a new warrior disc)<br />
Slow Effect (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6204&amp;source=Test) <br />
Poison DD Effect  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6205&amp;source=Test) <br />
Lower Hate Effect  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6206&amp;source=Test) <br />
Increase Damage Effect  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6207&amp;source=Test) <br />

I'm not sure what all these are attached to, except for the warrior one of course. I seem to remember seeing some spells described as &quot;proc #xxxx&quot; sometime back, but cant find them any more.</div></div><hr />

I don't consider the ability to be overly impactful, worth having, but far from game-changing.  That is irrelivant to what I quoted from you, however.<br />
<br />
You're asking for an offtanking improvement and claiming you're more entitled to it than the classes which have traditionally filled that role, but are currently suffering balance problems on par with those faced by the shaman class.  That's the part that &quot;offends&quot; me.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your suggestion for a knight &quot;fix&quot;... a melee immunity discipline would be benficial, and is something knights should have had all along, but it won't fix knights - far from it.  If we recieve a melee immunity disc, it will almost certainly be very long reuse; long reuse and offtanking don't mix well.  It would help with single-group named in GoD trials, but beyond that it's impact wouldn't be particularly significant.  <br />
<br />
We don't need something to make us last a little longer against boss mobs, we need something to help us with our established offtanking role.  That implys something that can be used frequently.</div></div><hr />

Nice backpedal, really.<br />
<br />
It might help your &quot;plight&quot; a bit more to make less sweeping generalizations and more specific insights that include the shaman's role in perspective of all other classes. I have no problem with a shaman &quot;getting hit&quot; in any group where I'm a tank with a few provisions - my spells work and go off.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if knights had something that allowed them to channel/cast aggro a little bit better, you wouldn't need worry about taking a beating, as getting hit = tanks job, the ability to absorb hits is not, last I checked, a bonus or separator of any casting class, shaman included.<br />

This is a spell with a 15 minute recast, and it lasts 3 tics.  This isn't an emergency spell--it's a raid encounter buff for the main tank and/or rampage tank.  I can appreciate the application of it for our raids, for sure.  Given the recast, I know I wouldn't want to tie up a spell slot on it, though!<br />

It's self only, so it's only use would be an oh **** self rune buff type.<br />
<br />
3 tics = 18 seconds, as an oh **** spell this wouldn't last 5 seconds. However, it would buy you some time for others to pick up targets.<br />
<br />
For me, as a shaman, I would love this. I get random aggro on raids often due to the need of fast slows, especially in Uqua or similar events where you are dealing with multiples on inc. Drop this on myself, this would allow me to actually survive more than 2 rounds for others to react.<br />

Instead of procing when you attack with a weapon, it &quot;procs&quot; when you are attacked.  If mobs are hitting the druid and this goes off on them, it will be easier for someone else to pick up the aggro the druid has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Runing gives you aggro, so enchanters don't really use it for an &quot;oh crap&quot; event, they use them as a damage buffer.  Chain a rune spell on yourself will retain aggro just like chain healing yourself does, except that healing will give you hp back, runing won't.<br />
<br />
A druid casting this spell on themselves will only decease their aggro, as damage mitigation spells don't have any associated aggro with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be infinitely happy if they just give us this: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4690&amp;source=Test as an AA mitigation ability, they can change the amount mitigated, but this is exactly what I want from this expansion.

<br />
I don't think anyone is suggesting that shaman need more offtanknig ability than knights.  I think what the shaman community finds absolutely insane (correct me if I'm wrong) is that of all the priest classes, shaman would benefit the most from a defensive shield/life saver of some kind.  <br />
<br />
Unbelievable that they'd give this to druids over shaman.  <br />
<br />
None of that really matters too much, though. With a 5000hp limit and 15min reuse, this ability isn't going to have any real significant impact<br />
I die usually at least once per hour in GoD raids (if not more).  Tonight was especially bad, new monk was learning to pull ikkinz.  If any tank drops, guess who they go for next?  Clerics, nope.  The reason the tank dropped is he didn't get many heals.  Every single time a tank drops in GoD fast encounters, you can be sure a shaman is next.  We are hands down the first to land major aggro on a mob, usually even before the tanks do.  <br />
<br />
I rely on our excellent pally's and sk's to get instant aggro, and I rely on the druids and clerics to heal those tanks.  When the druids and clerics lack, the shaman die.  When the tanks lack, the shaman die. When the chanters are not fast, the shaman die.  Pretty much any any front line class that doesn't do their job results in a shaman death in our guild.  <br />
<br />
It only lasts 3 ticks and is meant to help with heal agro for the junior-league cleric role that sony has put druids into.<br />
<br />
Sure give it to shamans but also give shamans big cheal spells so they can be put in cheal rotations, fun fun.<br />
<br />
You're kidding right?   Slow aggro &gt; heal aggro any day.  Sure, heals draw aggro from untanked mobs, but so does slow.  Sure, a mob left untagged will draw to healers, but we are healers also.  We just have the additional burden of also being front line debuffers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe there's a way you can edit / delete this thread to save a little face?<br />
<br />
Maybe, though, I can just call you a retard?<br />
<br />
I'll go with that. <br />
If you have been playing EQ for some time you must have noticed how Shamans used to have limited CC power in exp groups. So in case a mezzer wasn't available, the Shaman would slow the adds to grab aggro off the Cleric for instance and root park them to the side, then heal up himself proving as self sufficient CC'er.<br />
<br />
With PoP and Slow mitigation things suddenly started to change. Mobs not only had much higher DPS, but they started to require a debuff to land Slow reliably. <br />
Before PoP, this wasn't an issue, since the Shaman was able to move, the mob and root it aside in a matter of seconds, even if the mob resisted the initial Slow, he'd then proceed slowing the rooted mob. <br />
<br />
Come GoD, mobs hit like trucks and with much higher accuracy. Even a slowed mob totally ****s the Shaman up really fast, so that the Shaman can't perform the CC role he once invented.<br />
<br />
I hope that was specific enough for you.<br />
<br />
I could go on on how the marginalization of Slow upped the necessity to Slow a mob even faster than before, since our heals don't account for the game design changes. <br />
On top of that, being by design a slow acting class, everything we do(healing, DPS mainly) needs to be done early and in fast succession to be at least somehow impactive.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to go on expressing, how I hurt the feelings of the (Shadow)knight community for saying that Shamans needed an emergency ability to survive and to reinvent the role as &quot;ghetto CC'er&quot;, then be my guest, but realize, that quoting something out of context and insisting on how only tanks are supposed to take damage and therefore we have no legitimation to ask for more survivability(which we once had I must add), makes you look rather stupid.<br />
<br />
Fact is, Knights wouldn't want this ability. It wouldn't either fix, nor adress their very specific issue with pre-tanking boss mobs. Furthermore, I have yet to see Knights having issues with offtanking exp mobs('cause that's what Shamans are talking about) and you'd tank any of those better than a Shaman under the effect of this spell.<br />
<br />
So, why the hell are you quoting what I said out of context and not in relation to the spell/ability I am discussing?<br />

I guess I know why. Because, if you did, you'd have no ****ing reason to to post here at all laying out your(totally different) case(as valid as it is), as this ability doesn't do **** for you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't think anyone is suggesting that shaman need more offtanknig ability than knights.  I think what the shaman community finds absolutely insane (correct me if I'm wrong) is that of all the priest classes, shaman would benefit the most from a defensive shield/life saver of some kind.  <br />
<br />
Unbelievable that they'd give this to druids over shaman.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. The comparison has to be made with the Priests and the Slowers as we compete with those classes. <br />
From all Priests and Slowers, Shamans used to be the most durable. Now we are the mage among them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Branman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree with most of our shammy bitches on these boards....except this one.<br />
<br />
My RL wife plays a druid, and she can out aggro some of the best tanks I know(if she really wanted to), I have boxed her a few times, and have seen it myself also. Their snares, their debuffers, and their quick heals create more aggro than our slow.<br />
Most of you that slow upon incoming think that you just got screwed because you hold alot of aggro and are on the Target's target, and most likely die. The spell isn't as aggro'able as it is the caster's timing of casting it.<br />
The druid line of spells have high aggro and yes, some do snare at 99% (why, I still have no clue- at least wait til 90%). But they can't help but to cast some Sylvan's Infusion on some group members while their group cleric is healing the MA, etc, etc.<br />
So, why should they get this more than us? Cause their leather wearers, their AC sucks, and they don't mitigate as much as we do. I don't see them using it as often as most of you think, nor do I see it being as valued as what your bitching about.<br />
MY OPINION is just that, my opinion. I group in the hardest zones, and raid most of the time. I can no longer speak on behalf of the casual shaman, but as my personal experiences in game only.</div></div><hr />

Sure we have all grouped with &gt;insert class here&lt; that over aggros, or can over aggro easily. Thats not really the point here. My beastlord (I know, herasy) can overaggro with just a simple dot or three, and my rogue can overaggro with a crit double backstab, again thats not really the point here.<br />
A druids &quot;role&quot; in most groups is one of 2 things...healer or nuker, and in general serving as backup role in either of those two. By early snares, blasting a few heals and laying on the atk debuff early, you get what your going to get, asking for it or no, aggro. If that is to be a Druids role, then they should have tools for that role (this AA may be it). For the most part, they do, but as you state, tend to be light in the Hp department and Ac dept, and this leads to easy waxing. But we have all grouped with a Caster that goes BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! and sits then wonders why they got waxed when they sat. When a shaman slows on inc or fairly early, its why were there, slowing a mob as early as possible is really the only thing that most groups drag our sorry asses around for...it sure as hell aint for our l33t DPS skillz or S0XX0R R0XXING heal skills....most of the time were slow bitches and Ferine Avatar whores. This early slow &quot;role&quot; is a ground were rapidly losing to beastlords, as their utility is nearly as good, their DPS is far greater, the only thing they dont do as well is heals, and if they have their way in the new spell line up, they willl be getting a HoT too. Most classes that have a problem with over agro have a solution for that problem, rogues get Evasion, necros Feign, Chanters have a multitude of solutions, Clerics have Divine Aura, monks Feign. I admit that druids dont have any solution other than careful control of their casting, thus making their lives difficult too. Most classes though do have some ability to shed or deal with aggro. I have a high level beastlord, if I get aggro on him with a slow, I hit Protective Spirit...boom 3 ticks of near immunity to melee....and I get to use it 3 mins later. This alone makes them better at &gt;OUR&lt; role in the game.<br />
The shaman class, by its very ROLE in the game, either by our play style over the years, or by design (all be it accidental) by the developers, is to be the Slower. Its a role that were very protective of (read any 10 threads here on our current state for more on that) but find slipping from our fingers daily. Its the only thing that we do well thats not been overly marginalized (outside mitigation or immunity, thats another rant), but its been handed out to other classes (I dont know many chanters that really want the role to be honest). Chanters have mem blurs, the arcane rune, Doppleganger AA, etc...shaman have to stand still and hope they dont soak up too much mana before the tank gets the aggro back, and god forbid that you have a resist.<br />
Do I think that its a personal attack on the shaman as a class, or as a result of incompetance at some level or sort on a developers part? Lord knows, but I really have my doubts.<br />
Edit: no, there is no class hate here, I am not into that nor do I want anyone to think that, I just think that as a Shaman, my job is rapidly falling away, and I want something done.</div></div><hr />

Think a moment. Doesn't this question really answer itself? S'not exactly a head-scratcher.<br />
<br />
They're druids, we're shaman. boom, answer to your question solved.<br />
<br />
Note that this also works if you play a Shadow Knight, Berserker, or Wizard. Just apply the &quot;They're Druids, we're (class X)&quot; argument, and boom, you see why it is like it is!</div></div><hr />

Chain a rune spell on yourself will retain aggro just like chain healing yourself does, except that healing will give you hp back, runing won't.<br />
<br />
There is a difference in chaining yourself and chaining others. (Why I don't know).  I can chain Arcane on myself and live. However, chaining a fellow PC (Bertoxx event comes to recent memory) is &quot;asking for it.&quot;<br />

I couldnt disagree with this statement more. Our role as Off-Tank is gone, period, and good riddance AFAIC. We have MUCH bigger issues, whining about this is EXACTLY why the Dev's dont give us SQUAT, because we all suffer from &quot;New Rope, Not Enough, Need More, You Forgot This Ability&quot; etc. No matter where I turn, I see someone whining about something we USED to be able to do that we cant anymore. I am SHOCKED I dont see demands for an upgrade for our Fire Nukes, because &quot;at level 1 we had a Fire nuke!&quot;. It needs to stop, we do NOT need any sort of off-tank role whatsoever. We need momentary suvrvivability in emergency situaitons, which is exactly what an AA like this would give us. <br />
I am 100% serious when i make this statment.<br />
<br />
I feel we are being punished for something at this point and i dont know what it is.<br />
<br />
Im dead serious.<br />
Litgruv, I have to agree. For a while, I have thought it was just a question of having other classes &quot;catch up&quot; to us, because we were so over-powered in Kunark and Velious, but now, I gotta think its something else. <br />
<br />
Here is my theory:<br />
<br />
SOE is trying to eliminate a class, and they chose Shaman. Not kidding. I bet they ran some database numbers, and came up with &quot;we can piss of the LEAST number of people if we just eliminate Shamans, which would eliminate that huge slow, and give their roles to other classes (BLs, Druids, Chanters). I am sure they are convinced that a large percentage of us will simply swap classes, and eventually, the Shaman class will &quot;cease to exist&quot;. Its being done somewhat subtlely, a lot of us do not even see any real &quot;problems&quot;. But we are being left behind in EVERYTHING. We are not being given any role whatsoever. <br />
<br />
And why are Druids getting all the best goodies? Simple. Look at your guild rosters. There are SO MANY druids in this game, and it is not NEARLY the &quot;burn-out&quot; class that Cleric is. I am willing to bet that Druid is the Number 1 &quot;main&quot; Class in EQ, population wise. <br />
<br />
So, they want us to quit our Shaman, and choose the path we prefer as players, Healers or DPS or CC/Debuff. Personally, I am gonna find me a Time equiped Bard and pull, I think thats where the &quot;fun&quot; is these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">What we really need instead of a class list is a breakdown of Hours logged in one day by each of the classes. <br />

That would tell the tale of why shaman will recieve little upgrades. There are alot of us. And we play alot. So everything is fine. <br />
<br />
If ever shaman that was upset Simply cancled thier accounts Logged on and feedbacked why they cancled then stop playing thier shaman till the accounts expired we would get some changes. They might be bones. They might be real changes. But there isnt a damn thing they will do while folks are still logging in.<br />
<br />
It is a horrible thought that the only way to make the developers listen would be to gut friendships and ignore the people you care about for weeks, but honestly all the talk in the world hasnt changed a damn thing. We are getting rote upgrades in  Omens just like the rote upgrades in every expansion since Kunark. While other classes get more benifit of thier upgrades along with a perk or two each expansion. And to really cap off the destruction of our role the game has been hyper sped into a mockery of what it once was. <br />
<br />
Yall do what you want. But I belive it is the only way to make the developers bosses see what we want. It's a damn shame but it is the truth as I see it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Druids are the number 1 played class and have been since i started playing thisw game. Since day one they are billed as the mosted rounded and easily played class and for years its been easy to see they get the most attention, which is why i think shaman always had a natural hatred for them, cause druids and shaman used to be like the twins in the family and they were the less loved twin cause of race pentalites and home starting points.<br />
<br />
So as far as why they get upgrades, im with you on that.<br />
<br />
But the shaman hatred i dont get. We have had all our spells and abilties whored out, there has not been any effort to make us special or improve us in anyway since kunark, which used to be fine cause we were powerful, but now we seriously need help. There is something going on here i think that has nothing to do with our abilties. So i dunno blazz.<br />
<br />
Its hard to believe in something like what you said, cause its a lil too conspiracy theory, but something is going on, that i do believe. Honestly when you look at how shaman are in EQ2, its really not so hard to not consider your theory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">This appears to be a raiding spell for druids, to give them a way to deal with healing aggro. Clerics have DA, it allows for someone to draw aggro off of them so they can continue to do their job.<br />
Druids have been moved into the role as main healers now in raids, we use them in CH cycles regularly and they do well. I dont have a problem with them getting an ability like this to deal with healing aggro because if they survive, the raid has a better chance to succeed.<br />
Now, having said this, I would also hope for shaman to get a similar ability. We slow AND blast heal. There is no question as to how much aggro we generate. All I can do is speak from a good amount of high end raiding experience. And from that, I can say that in GoD, I spend a lot more time naked in Nedaria's than the numerous druids on our raids.<br />
Would I like to see druids get this ability? Yes.<br />
<br />
Would I like to see shaman get something like it, and for some of the same reasons? Yes.<br />
<br />
Will we? Probably not. The powers that be seem to be having a good chuckle over driving so many of us out of the game. I don't see the logic there, but it's their income and when WoW comes out, they will reap what they sow.</div></div><hr />

You know what kills druids?  Spot heals on Multi Incoming.  <br />
Tier3, Pulling in Gates, Uqua.   What happens is pretty simple.<br />
<br />
Mobs come in.  People Spot Heal ((no one CHs in this environment))<br />
Spot Lands, right as an Add shows up.  That puts the Cleric or Druid on top of the Hate List with a good Hate Lead from a 2-4k spot.<br />
<br />
If someone doesnt pick up the add, it then goes right after the healer<br />

I hear you bro. Its probably my over-active imagination again, but honestly, I KNOW there is somehting going on. Maybe they just want us to be &quot;less&quot; popular. Remember when Pallys were the BOMB tanks? Everyone suddenly had a Pally. Remember when Monks were GODDLY pulles and DPS? Who dindt make a Monk toon. Maybe its like Snoww says, only with a different spin. Maybe SOE looks at the numbers of Shaman logging in and says &quot;We gotta lower the ratio on this class, how can we do it? I KNOW, make em LOTS LESS attractive&quot;. And maybe they are making Druids SO much better is, despite thier huge numbers, they want MORE druids, in an effort to relieve the Raid Dependcy on Clerics.<br />
<br />
Who know. I do know this though. I have been coming here for a bit over a year. In that time, I have grown to respect a lot of people who come here. And its KILLING me to hear the pain as they post. Litgruv, Snoww, Murtak (who doesnt even seem to come anymore, sigh) and more that I cant think of of the top of my head. Its breaking my heart, and my spirit, to see this. Our class is slowly being degenerated to 3rd Rate by nothing more than inattention and ommission. Its not that Druids dont need this AA, its that we need it, and maybe we need it more, but we wont get it, because SOE is choosing NOT to make us better.</div></div><hr />

I agree Cor. This is a big reason why I posted the things I did on this thread, and even started my own thread, about shaman being made obsolete intentionally. Druids most certainly DO need some emergency aggro reduction. I dont think anyone can deny that. But we need it too, and arguably even more. <br />
<br />
I was in a pick-up Tipt run the other day (no, still no flag, sigh) and the Chanter there thought I was a GOD. Know why? Because I had Cripple memmed full time (instead of a DOT) and I used it whenever we had ANY sort of aggro problem. The mob INSTANTLY charged me, no matter what, even over the spot-healing Druid and Cleric. The guy GUSHED about it. Said I was the best shaman he ever saw. And I never died because of it, but mostly because I am a good ass player, and had Mal Decay up and VP ready, and Root (my Gates Trial set of spells is . . . different, heh). <br />
<br />
My point is that Shaman can EASILY outaggro a Druid, even accidently. And dont forget, our MAIN role in healing is back-up, spot, the exact kind of quickies that you mentioned as demonstrating the MOST aggro. I think most of us can agree that this is a GREAT AA ability for Druids, I just think that most of us feel we need it more, and we also feel that we won't get it, which pisses us off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couple tidbit.  Part of it is most druids don't play agressively, and don't debuff.  Druids can go toe to toe on agro with a shaman.  Just most are pansys and choose mana gear, have less ac, and don't build for HPs<br />
Thier 2 Ro Debuffs, and Thier Ro Dot are just about same Agro As Slow + Cripple + Poison Dot.<br />
<br />
Problem is more that Shaman are excepted to generate agro because we are exected to debuff.  Where few notice if druid doesn't debuff.<br />
<br />
Another sidenote.  No tipt still.  When do you play.  I'll get ya through Tipt easily enough.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but *everyone* is going to die on a multipull like that unless every single mob is tagged as soon as they cast(especially since you are talking of raids). <br />
You are getting aggro on raids from multipulls, I am &quot;expected&quot; to get aggro in *every* situation I face. Do you see the difference?<br />
<br />
Now, Shaman could use a similiar ability without a doubt.  But to say another class doesnt need it too is silly.  Argue BOTH could use.<br />
<br />
You know, everyone could use everything. Everyone could use FD too and rezz. I don't see that being a valid argument.<br />
Arguing that Druids should get a defensive ability is ridiculous and if had read a Druid asking for something like it on their boards, I would have smiled thinking he was trolling.<br />
<br />
Druids aren't designed to have great defensive capabilities. Druids are a leather class and your defensive tools have been snare, root and evac for as long as the class has existed. The Shaman is a class that wins(used to) through his durability, outlasting their foes, often (forced to) fighting face to face. <br />
<br />

Yeah, cept, in that situation, the 3 shaman in my guild have tagged those adds with slow, rising us above your spot heal.<br />

Not saying that healing isn't a huge aggro generator.  Just saying that shaman have both heals and slows to deal with.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't be so pissed about this spell if shaman and druids got it, but to just see druids get it feels like another slap in the face.  We already have the weakest heals, weakest hp buffs, and our debuffs have been mitigated (tm) or in most cases, immune. <br />

Since we can't really do much, at least let us stay alive and toss our nuke around (oh, btw, yeah, its the weakest nuke of any pure caster).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I agree with Blazz and Giac.  There is no real justification for druids getting any defensive abilities over a shaman.  While heal aggro is an issue for all priest classes and admitedly, druids have only a couple tools for self preservation, SoE is spending time and effort fixxing this situational issue for a largely functional and largely balanced class (look at the timer and look how much easier it is to get single pulls in MOST GoD encounters) and leaving underbalanced classes untouched for day to day situations in GoD content.  There is no precedent, the need isn't really all that pressing (how many other classes can pull aggro from a single spot heal or root a mob on incoming) because of the number of work arounds.  When I was getting smeared my ranger worked with me to root mobs off of me as I backed off for the next slow on multi pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Look - here is why I liked my shaman.<br />
<br />
I realize in todays game things have changed drastically from the way they used to be, however, I fell in love with a shaman because they were like tough casters.  They could melee and take a pounding and act tough in general.  I could joke around about getting hit, and we were all the large tough races.  I still joke around like that and try to get my guild to let me tank stupid things.  The fact is though now druids clerics even int casters can beef up their HP and do the same things really.  It just takes some of the luster away.  First they upped cleric melee and no druid mitigation with this spell.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about huge balancing issues.  I'm not talking about being able to tank like or melee like a melee.  I'm talking about in relation to casters and for simple fun.  <br />
<br />
Everyone is always complaining about our usefulness, and saying there is no reason to take us in groups now over certain other classes.  Quite honestly I have 0 problems getting in groups, and I make myself very useful on raids and in xp groups.<br />
<br />
I just want the fun back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I just want the fun back.<br />
<br />
Agree.  But the fun for me was seeing my spells have an impact on a battle.  Now, I slow a mob, he mitigates much of it, and I don't seem to notice much of a decline in dps.<br />
<br />
Or, like last night, doing an ikkinz raid.  Priest badarse X inc.  I cast malos on inc, only, it didn't land, the mages had already malosinia'd him.  So then I go to cripple, spell didn't take hold, for the heck of it, tried slow, IMMUNE, cast bane, resisted....then infuriate, AE rampage, bam, every member in my group is at 22% life or so, quick heal then Q, quick heal then Q, etc.. got 2 of them healed before the rest dropped to riptose or whatnot.  <br />
<br />
Guess I'm excited about the group heal.  Other than that, with our raid role being much the same, I'm really discouraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I agree we could really use some work in a few areas and there are things I'd like to see.  I don't, however feel we are quite as broke functionality wise as *some* here claim.  The board has a very gloomy feel, and I kind of stopped coming here often it was all so depressing and never fun threads.<br />
<br />
But even if we are slightly broke right now, I'm a good shaman and I make myself useful.  That isn't going to make me stop playing a shaman.  What really kicks me in the gut is everytime we lose one of our fun defining abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">You're missing the point, Vulash.  You can make yourself 'useful' all you like, but bottom line, any group you join would be better of with a beastlord or an enchanter for a slower, or a druid if they need a 2nd healer.  Given even semi-competence in ench/BL/dru, they outclass you, no matter how 'useful' you think you may be.  It's not a question of skill, but a question of basic class limitations.<br />
<br />
You, as a shaman, are more limited than they are.  No amount of playstyle is going to change that in non-trivial content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I guess my biggest complaint is the resists to all of our spells. My wife and I were headed to WW to help a friend out with the 4 dragons. So she played her druid instead of her cleric for the Port to CS. <br />
<br />
We get into the SG and see that Fellspine is up and if I we get lucky that is a quick 30k minimum if he drops his belt, so I start pulling mobs with my warrior and start to slow with my Shaman. Resist, Malo', Slow, DoT - resisted, DoT - Resisted, DD - resisted... all on a low low blue mob.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile my wife has them snared, DoT'd x 2, and is nuking all without a single resist. Now mind you the first cast was pre malo but the rest were all after and resisted. So there is my shaman just sitting on his butt because it was pointless to cast anything other than slow and malo.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to cast a spell and not have it resisted, I am sick of paying the price for having debuff spells. i.e. sick of all my spells REQUIRING me to debuff in order for them to have a CHANCE to land.</div></div><hr />

You may be right but at the moment so much is skewed against us. We have to make some noise. If you dont say something how is it ever going to change? Unfortunately SoE has a bad habit of not listening unless you use brute force!</div></div><hr />

The deficiencies of the class don't really kick in until shaman reach level 65 and pack in some AA.  Young shaman who get discouraged and are not experiencing class issues are not thinking clearly.  Shaman are well equipped for most entry level content and also trivial content.  Young shaman have nothing to be concerned about, other than the fact that SoE might not address their class's issues before they reach these levels.<br />
<br />
While I agree that the negativity here is excessive, there are a lot of pissed off shaman that are tired of being ignored.  Vulash you are elemental geared and likely to have experienced some of the issues yourself, how do you feel about the communication with SoE and their progress with their poorly implimented content?</div></div><hr />

Actually the frustration and helplessness is a pervading feeling at all levels of the game, not just for shaman, but for knights as well. Due to problems and issues at the high end, the lower end players that are either alts/twinks or that read class boards (believe it or not there are some that have never heard of class boards, SOE supported or no) carry over the feelings to the lower end, and make their opnions known...best example I can think of, I was tooling around doing some LDONs with my level 55 (at the time) SK....hes twinked all to hell with roughly 3k6 unbuffed hit points and nearly 1300 Ac...the group choose a warrior level 51 wielding a Wurmslayer and a Defenders Lightblade as the main tank...now I am in no way knocking the guys gear. He was a up and coming player and we all came from crap/low level gear and did the best we could at the time, but when your in a group that is basically trivial content (mid 50s content) where classes supposedly have few or little issues, and said group chooses a average geared warrior 4 levels lower than a knight thats twinked to hell because &quot;Sks suck as tanks&quot; then there are problems at all levels of the game. Certainly its more a virtual problem at that point of the game, more of a trickle down theory...<br />
Lower level players copy our attitudes, if we say we suck, then it must be so, even when were talking about high level content that it will take them, at best, months to even begin seeing issues doing.<br />
Does this mean that the low level game needs altered? No way, its perfect like it is, actually tons more balanced than the high end even begins to be, but the high end game needs fixed before lower level knights (more SK than paladin) and shaman decide to run the other way and start a different toon.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I won't dispute the SK stuff as that that aspect did get out of control and I don't know too much about it (my SK was lvl 19 when I gave up on him out of boredom, not anything else).  The difference is that knights are hybrid tanks, while shaman are priests.  We've already surrendered the healing role to the clerics and RARELY get the call as primary healer on challenging content.  As slowers, we are the best and thats the role that's suppossed to get us groups.  Mitigation has badly beaten back that requirement.  So, while SKs were suppossed to be viable main tanks, we're already giving up on being viable main healers and depending on our status as the king of slow to get groups.  So while the word is likely getting out about the state of the high end shaman. If you need a slow, which you doubtlessly can make full use of in the pre-65 game, a shaman is still the best choice.<br />
<br />
BTW, good post, I'm not disagreeing with you so much as saying that the shaman state for lower end players should not be directly comparable to the SK situation as it was at that point in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I very first started EQ I was a wizard.  I remember going to Graffe's all the time (this was prekunark) and they were always talking about how much the wizard sucked compared to mages and druids.  I read all their &quot;on paper&quot; stuff and they were all level 50 so it had to be true.  So I was bummed about my class by level 12 (granted this was back when 12 took a little bit to get).  Anyway my point is they don't have to be effected by it to get bummed out by constant posts.<br />
<br />
I have seen a little bit of it.  When the cleric goes afk in KT I have to convince entire groups I can heal it.  I've had bsts running our preslowing everything on raids and swearing the shaman were all afk.  I'm not denying some problems in our basic design.  I also agree to Sony we need to make some noise or do something to get their attention cause quite honestly they are worthless when it comes to CS.<br />
<br />
You can make noise though without every possible thread around being about how imbalanced we are.  Even if someone starts a harmless thread someone else turns it into imbalance, or they get screamed at for not using Search feature (even if it isn't a common question).  I'd just like to see some people here breath deep, and not make this such a bummed out and intimidating place for young shaman to come and read on their class or ask questions.<br />
<br />
I'm not blaming anyone in this post specifically.  Just trying to get a point across.  I don't even know how I got on this subject :D</div></div><hr />

I dont really have a problem not being a primary healer role in all content. In 90% of the content I have access to, I can do just fine, even being able to heal a hard LDON with the right group. The real problem, as you said, is that we are slowers...SUPPOSED to be the best in the game at that particular role, but when it comes down to the nitty gritty, were more like the worst. Sure our debuffs let the slow land more, and our slow is for, in theory, more % (marginalized by immunity and mitigation), but as you look at how things are, were in the worst position. In older content, up to and including 75% of PoP content, we dealt with the unwanted aggro by stocking up on Hp/Ac gear and when they were introduced, defensive AA. Once you reach the Elementals that becomes a challanging way to survive unwanted aggro, and in GoD it simply doesnt cut the mustard. A named in Vxed (highest content I have seen is open GoD zones) tore into me for 1500ish a hit. Think about that for a second.<br />
A beastlord would hit Protective Spirit and for 3 ticks would be mitigating that 90%, so taking roughly 150 a pop (hope that math is right). A chanter has the rune line (Arcane is a 1500 rune, no peridot cost, not a great choice but certainly better than nothing), Doppleganger, an AA which makes an aggro clone for the chanter, and Color Cloud, a 2 second cast time stun up to level 65 mobs. Now certainly chanters still dont have it as nice as beastlords when it comes to unwanted aggro (push button melee immunity every 3 minutes is pretty phat) they certainly have it better than us.<br />
The problems that SK experience are indeed different than us at the high level, but the basic problem is the same. Their spell line up and AA line up is inadequate for the tasks that they are supposed to be able to do in the high end (certainly in the lower end game, as I have said before, all classes are more or less just fine, this really does include even up to tier 2 PoP, maybe tier 3). Lower level SK can chain lifetap to help provide a nice buffer of hit points, and give them a decent way to fake mitigation. This is mana intensive however, and will run even a nicely geared SK OOM pretty fast. <br />
Paladins, by their own spell make up (various stun lines), mitigate better than an SK, if for no other reason than taking 2+ seconds every so often from a mobs attack cycle helps them simply get hit less. Whats even more rude is that these stuns are cheap to cast, for example Force of Akilae, level 62 Paladin spell....65 mana for a 4 second stun with a -45 resist check..which do you think mitigates more damage, that or Touch of Volatis 62 SK 280 mana for a 350 point lifetap?  A shaman slowed mob with a paladin stunning it might simply as well have taken his ball and glove and gone home when he saw the two coming. VERY often if I main heal a paladin he requires just a Q or 2 every 2-3 mobs, an SK needs Q and blast heals, even given similar gear and AA.<br />
SK have Aura of Pain, an interesting Ac drain that grants a ton of Ac that depletes over time....this is certainly NOT equal in any way to the paladin stun line, and high mana cost scaling lifetaps dont either....what good is a 300 point life tap when your getting smacked for 1500? Your better off having a paladin outright delay that 1500 hit with a stun, which by the way will also give him a total lock on aggro.<br />
SKs and paladins in high end encounters are supposed to be crowd control tanks, using non-damage forms of aggro (stuns, terrors, Fear) to mez tank mobs while the main targets get waxed. Without some sort of increased mitigation ability, either by Disc, AA, or spell, Sk will not be able to adequately do that role without seriously being overgeared, and even over geared Knights have troubles. Paladins have LESS of a problem with this, due to having access to the stuns, but given stun immune mobs, the disparity is notable.<br />
SK and paladins should be viable tanks for ALL encounters other than high end bosses, just as we should be viable healers OR viable slowers with the same limitations. To ignore this need or to poo-poo it as SOE seems to be doing, is not going to impress the players, its simply going to cause people to quit in frustration, or switch to an alt and level up something that is actually useful in the high end..IE anything else other than a knight or shaman (heh and monks too, but thats another rant).</div></div><hr />
