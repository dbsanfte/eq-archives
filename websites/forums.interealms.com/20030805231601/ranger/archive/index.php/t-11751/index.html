<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gandilain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was pulling stuff in UP last night with jolt.  This was my first chance to try this ever and it seemed to work pretty well.   I was wondering if anyone else does this and if there are any bad sides to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shareel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use Jolt if I need an spell for pulling.<br />
<br />
Jolt has no LOS issues, is fast cast and 200 range.<br />
<br />
Perfect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ulvian Stormweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And don't forget, when pulling 51+ mobs with jolt you wont exceed the damage treshold on your targets which would get them to start summoning you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only pull with jolt as well - best way to pull besides casting cancel magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as I'm concerned this is &gt;THE&lt; best spell to pull with in a raid situation. (except situationally snare) In a raid you're not going to be main tank usually. Snare holds a lot of aggro with it and even a first bowshot tends to get you hit a few times. Jolt places you on the mobs Hate list, but at negative 500. Anything else anyone does to aggro the mob will automatically add them to the hate list above you. It allows your MT to immeidatly get aggro from you and lets you swing right around and be ready to engage.<br />
<br />
Any other spell you use-- from Cancel magic, to snare, or a DD spell or even a bowshot grants you positive hate values. It may take the MT a few moments to get that off of you.  Jolt on the other hand means that ANY agressive action taken against the mob means the mob will turn on the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I usually only pull with jolt when I can't hit the mob with my bow. <br />
<br />
When I used to hunt in Velk's it was the best way to pull spawns from the lower levels if you were in one of the upper spider camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use it as well for pulling.  In fact back when we were farming HoT I was often asked to do the initial pit break/pull because I could almost always get one wurm to come solo into the lobby with Jolt.</div></div><hr />
