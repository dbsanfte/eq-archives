Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here are some suggestions:<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Fingers&lt;/B&gt;: Those +2wisdom rings suck. Hell, I would rather wear jagged bands. If you insist on being a &quot;Wisdom Shaman&quot;, get +7wis rings, Otherwise get +AC +hp rings, ie 6AC 65hp Velium Fore-opal wedding rings<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Chest&lt;/B&gt;: Maybe look for Ry'gorr - more AC<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Back&lt;/B&gt;: Totemic Cloak?<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Waist&lt;/B&gt;: Head to Runnyeye and pick up a blackened alloy belt - it is 8AC +5sta, and you could get it with a couple of friends to help you. Alternatively buy a cheap Strawspun Belt - 10AC or a not so cheap Smiters Girdle - 10AC +3 all stats<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Legs&lt;/B&gt;: Totemic Legs?<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Secondary Melee&lt;/B&gt;Testament is cool, but rather low AC for my taste - I would suggest either a Charred Guardian Shield, or even getting 2 or 3 level 30+ friends and getting your Shield of Falsehood<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Range&lt;/B&gt;Howling Harpoon is good in Range slot. Alternatively, do shawl quest to get Seal of Thoridain, or even head to Hollowshade and camp for Ceremonial Smudging Stick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The wisdom on the rings is pretty low, so I'd recommend either the 6ac 65hp rings, or if you can't afford two of those, get the 5ac 55hp ones instead. Two of those will cost approximately the same as one 6ac 65hp ring. Rygorr legs would be nice and fairly inexpensive. Get a charred guardian shield if you're concerned with wisdom or a clay guardian shield (my preference) if you'd like to up you ac/hp. Both should be fairly cheap. The shield of falsehood would be a nice improvement also, if you'd prefer to put your money into some items other than a shield. It's also a lightsource, by the way, which is a nifty side-effect. A rygorr bp would be a nice upgrade in the chest slot and it's fairly economical. For the most part, your gear looks pretty decent for your level. You may want to check the profiles in other people's signatures on this board to get a feel for what other shamans wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You've got some very nice equip - Jaundiced Bone at your level is nothing to laugh about.  Upgrade your rings first, then your Book has to go, get a shield.<br />
<br />
(actually, I don't have anything to add above what Weyalan and Donar said...just wanted to let you know that JB items at your level are nice.)</div></div><hr />
