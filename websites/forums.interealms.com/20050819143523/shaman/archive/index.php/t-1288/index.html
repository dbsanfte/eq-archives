<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My 3 initial goals for my Troll Shammy were:<br />
<br />
1. Snare Necklace<br />
2. JBB<br />
3. OT Hammer<br />
<br />
Typically I have done them in reverse order, getting the OT hammer at about level 35, the JBB last night at 46 and now I guess I should start looking at the Snare Necklace :)<br />
<br />
The quest will be very easy for my level, but I'm not sure about how much faction work will be required to get it started.  Can any fellow Trolls advise me on the likely number of asslings I need to kill to get the required faction?<br />
<br />
I have searched for the answer, but whilst the quest is dealt with in detail the faction work isn't.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info,<br />
Scrote.</div></div><hr />

You have to deliver the note from Grobb to Neriak first to have the neccesary faction to get the Freeport note methink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Piece of cake... and you won't have to kill any asslings for faction.<br />
<br />
Just grab the note from the DE in Grobb and hand that to the guy. SUPER faction boost with the DE clerics. Takes you from apprehensive to amiable in one hit I think. Sometimes that's not totally enough though, so if the quest doesn't start up properly then just do the note quest again.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is going to be getting the metal bonings. I did it with a little troll buddy. Didn't take more than an hours or two. Most of that was travelling time too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the reply all :)<br />
<br />
I've already got the note from the DE in Grobb, so it's off to Neriak for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can a Troll Shaman with CT as his God use this necklace?  My DE Cleric has this Necklace but it says Deity: Innoruuk.  Class and Race match but the Deity doesn't.  Wondering if this would be a waste of time.  <br />
<br />
Thx for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everything I've read specifically mentions Innoruuk and the work you are doing is for Innoruuk aligned people, so I'd say you're almost certainly not going to be able to use the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Definately doesn't work. Has to be equipped to cast, can't equip if you're not an Inny worshipper.<br />
<br />
For what's it's worth you can get a fear undead/animal necklace from Erudin.</div></div><hr />
