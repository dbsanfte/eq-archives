<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skott340</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know i am not the only one that would like to add avatars to my threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>skott340</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well i hope on eof them takes the time to respond to this request . like i mentioned before i am not the only one that would like access to this. thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What and have quality posts like the above spammed with avatars? Haha no thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No kidding...nearly 21 topics in a row in &quot;The Grey&quot; from Skott here. With that kind of inability to operate the edit button, what makes you think you would have any chance getting your avatar to work?<br />
<br />
I know that forum is unmoderated, but for goodness sake, show some self-restraint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Taking a wild stab in the dark based on what I've seen from boards that do allow avatars I'm gonna guess that it's because the mods already have enough to do and don't want to add &quot;make sure the avatars people are using are not in extremely poor taste&quot; to their (unpaid) job description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can we please ban this retard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i know i am not the only one that would like to add avatars to my threads.<br />
<br />
1 question <br />
<br />
Why do you want an Avatar ?<br />
<br />
Wulfbane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can have avatars here...<br />
<br />
But spamming to get them is plain retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frankly, I'd rather have plaintext than Avatars.  I read here for information, not to see pretty pictures.</div></div><hr />

2. Avatars/Custom Titles<br />
Custom Titles are available to users with over 1000 posts. Until our board software is updated, you may PM Henora, Mojokyn or Gloriana to set your custom title for you. There is a 25 character limit.<br />
<br />
Avatars are not available at this time. If you have an avatar already and would like it removed, contact Henora, Mojokyn or Gloriana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh, great, now this guy is going to spam the board with 975 links so he can get to 1,000 posts.</div></div><hr />
