<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Minotaurs, oh, and Ogre Paladins.<br />
<br />
Ogres were once the most civilized and cultured race on the face of Norrath before the curse.  I'd certainly like to see a small contingent of stalwart Ogre Paladins who turned from Rallos Zek and his bloodthirsty warmongering ways to the more tranquil paths of Prexus or the Seventh Hammer or something and were spared the curse that hit the Rallosian legions and have quietly lived out their lives in serenity and isolation from the rest of Norrath.<br />
<br />
And Minotaurs - intelligent, thoughtful, nature-loving minotaurs.  Come on, I don't know WHY people have to keep portraying minotaurs as some bloodthirsty, cavern dwelling carniverous brutes?  Those Greeks were gnawing on some nasty herbs to come up with that one.<br />
<br />
Who among you has EVER seen a predatory COW???  It's a half-COW people.  Docile, quiet, content to gnaw on grass all day.  <br />
<br />
So, with that in mind, I'd like to see intelligent, nature-loving, field-tilling, minotaurs in EQ.  INT casters, sure, WIS casters - yep, even SHAMAN.  In fact, I think a minotaur ought to make a pretty darned good shaman.  Make them a large race with slam, and give 'em a mediocre baseline skill in tracking as a racial ability, make it lower than a bards, but still something neat to do.<br />
<br />
Failing that, I'm still holding out for my troll shaman some clothing models with a hawaiian shirt, bermuda shorts, and sandals, and maybe some wayfarer sunglasses.<br />
<br />
Let's try and get things back in perspective here folks.  Ask for what you want, but understand realistically your chances of getting what you ask for and don't go berserk if it doesn't happen, just keep playing your shaman instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">don't go berserk if it doesn't happen<br />
<br />
Indeed, go berserker instead.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All I want is illusion snow bunny.<br />
<br />
Better yet, make it an ancient lvl 65 spell that is no-drop and can only be looted off Quarm.<br />
<br />
Then, when someone asks why the !@#$ is that person hopping around in a snow bunny gettup, everone can bow their heads and reply simply &quot;because they can&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Instead of adding a new class, what I think would make the game more interesting is opening it up so that every race can be every class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">every race cant be any class because they would have to make new models for robes on ogres and trolls, and other what-nots. And it seems doing as little work as possible is SoE's new job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I'd like to see them really put in/finish/update many of the quests that are broken/unsolvable/etc...<br />
<br />
I've been carrying these stupid Erudin Defender's Blades FOREVER because for some reason the quest amulet doesn't drop.</div></div><hr />

Female cows, maybe.  I've ridden a bull before and I assure you they are neither docile, quiet, nor content :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I worked my fathers ranch for about a year...  *I* have seen a preditory cow.  Her name was lawnmower, and the damn thing was running off all the males from the pack.  Weirdest damn animal I have ever met in my life.</div></div><hr />

What I'd really love to see in EQ is a very strict naming policy such that any and all names that can't be somehow justified to fit the fantasy roleplaying theme of EQ would be eliminated.  This includes all character names that are spelling butcheries of their characters class name (Clerik the cleric, for ex), all names that rip off RL names (we have Dikembe Mutumbo, Neil Diamond, Arvydys Sabonis, and others on Xev), adjectives and adverbs (are rarely used as names) - so 'Deceptive' the rogue would be name-assassinated, names that are blatant drug references, offensive names, and any other names that don't fit the fantasy RPG theme.<br />
<br />
You can't expect roleplaying in a (MMO)RPG - that's really stretching your expectations.  That and defining and enforcing roleplaying is impossible.  You can't even expect people that are hiding behind avatars to exhibit decent human behavior most of the time.  But is it really asking too much that the names in a fantasy roleplaying game somewhat fit the theme of the game so that those of us idiots that want to feel some sense of immersion in a fantasy roleplaying game don't have to have it shattered every time we look around and see yet another dood/aim chat handle/stupid/'creative' name?<br />
<br />
Character naming IS something that can be defined - rules can be put in place, and it's something that can be enforced.  Of course, in the case of SoE where customer support is a concept they've lost touch with, this could never happen.  But one can dream, right?<br />
