<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Underbulks in echo caves...good grouping and soloing spot.<br />
<br />
Im lvl 44 currently, and getting almost 1/2 a blue per kill.  About 5 kills gets ya 2 blues.   <br />
<br />
Only real loot is claws, sells for about 3pp each to vendors.<br />
<br />
Bugs don't resist much, easy to slow.  Hit for about 80, sometimes after a good fight I'll be at 80hlth, but occasionally they will get me down to about 40%.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can get a group you can hunt just up the tunnel and get more spawns, and faster xp.  <br />
Named mobs in this zone are Fireclaw, Trillcor, Szzra Taskmaster, and Xilinov.  *Don't mess with Xilinov*<br />
<br />
Friends have soloed from 44 to 49 here with few problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This was a great spot for me between levels 39-45. The underbulks in the hallway were easy to single pull and not too resistant. I soloed here a lot to raise my defense and just because the exp was good. Also, if you wanna group, you can go to the rooms near where the Taskmaster spawns. If you're in a strong group, you can take on the taskmaster, or at least the skeletons in the room with him. Each skeleton drops a pick and they sell to vendors for roughly 6pp, depending on your charisma. If you can pull the skeletons, you can do quite well, loot-wise. On a side note: If you/your group can kill the taskmaster, save any organs that he drops. If you can get three, you can turn them in somewhere in Katta (not completely sure of the details -- check allakhazam -- quest is called 'shissar organs') and receive a no-drop necklace that has a permanent enduring breath effect. I think the necklace is called 'amulet of the grey wastes' or something like that. I mention this here, because the other places where the shissar organs drop are pretty high level. The organs are a rare drop, but if you level in echo for a while, you can get enough of them to get the necklace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Donar basically said everything I wanted to say but better.<br />
<br />
For a good time, partner up with a Paladin for the Skellie Room...Paladins love to take out undead, and the two of us *easily* cleared the room, including the Taskmaster.  <br />
<br />
Occasionally Xilinov will pop inplace of the task master...Hes a scary looking dude...We decided to give him a try with 39 Shaman (me at the time) 51 Paladin, 44 Warrior, 43 Druid, and a 60 Druid who was passing thru the caves.   Yeah, we all died, especially when the Paladin was charmed and started to beat on the druids.  But it was a blast, and so close to our bind points it didn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did 44-51 in Echo, mostly solo. The XP was godly.<br />
<br />
I would wait sometimes up to an hour for a camp to open. I'd practice my div while waiting. Div is now at 235, capped, horray.  So is everything else. But the xp is almost orgasmic.<br />
<br />
I did 50-&gt;51 in 6 1/2 hours soloing the deep room - clearing it out, including FC and Trill, pulling extras from TM and hallway, then reclearing.<br />
<br />
I did 49-&gt;50 in 6, same spot. I could single pull then.<br />
<br />
48 was a bit of a haul, as my spells and dog were being eaten by TM room and The deep room wouldn't single pull for me. I teamed with a 52 warrior and we killed TM 12 times in a row, and wiped out the TM room on the downtime. I got 2 of my organs, he MQ'd the last one, I Got my absolutely wonderful EB necklace. I waltz into kedge and the grey, I got my swimming up to 200, get this necklace. It turns life or death areas into &quot;no sweat!&quot;. All you need is 1 organ, a guildmate can MQ the other 2 for you, and if they are druids who quad the grey, they've probably got them coming out their ears.<br />
<br />
44-47, I did the hallway. I pulled from the left, by the time I finished the last to the right, the left usually had popped. Sometimes I pulled the two free stonegrabbers from the deep room on downtimes, or the spawn in the hallway near the TM room. I averaged a yellow every hour and a half. <br />
<br />
The only downside to this area is it is CAMPED CAMPED CAMPED. Best time to get a camp is around 1 am PST. Or get friendly with the guy who is holding the camp and practice spells. I'm now maxed in all my spell skills and I don't regret it - that's one less boring thing I have to get over with. Less fizzles too.<br />
<br />
At 51, I can do a blue an hour in the deep room. Everything is LB except for Trillcor and Fireclaw. It's not worth the camp time to me anymore, CoM I do a blue and a half in an hour. So I've moved on.<br />
<br />
This was with no JBB, horse, epic, or anything special. Just a cat with higher wis than she ought, lower ac than she ought, her dog, and her sharp toothpick.<br />
<br />
Loot stinks by the way. Claws sell for 3 plat a pop. The biles are no-rent. Fireclaw's pieces are lore and sell for no more than 3 plat. Trill drops nothing. The skeletons drop lore picks that sell for 5 plat. TM drops no-drop organs, a lore range item, a lore whip. A cracked skull that nobody can figure out what to do with, no-drop. Fungal fiends drop claws (3 silver) and spores (no-rent). stonegrabbers drop up to 8 plat, but there are only 3 up at any time usually. 2 in the deep room, at most, and 1 in the TM room, at most.</div></div><hr />
