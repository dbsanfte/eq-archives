<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kukis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a new player, so far I haven't made it past level 7  :)<br />
<br />
In the games I have previously played (DAoC and AO) I haven't had to deal with corpse recovery, since you respawn with your items intact in both games.  Realising the possible pain of corpse recovery in this game, I wonder if you could tell me what measures a Shaman can use to ensure it is as painless as possible?  I should point out, I will likely solo more than I group due to time restrictions so I need to know if I can expect to find and retrieve my own belongings or not :)<br />
<br />
I imagine the invisibilty spell gained at level 29 would help, but I see levels 11 - 28 in the way first :(  Would Vah Shir sneak ability help perhaps?<br />
<br />
I plan to start my Shaman on the new Kane Bayle server (I currently play a Gnome Necromancer) as I live in the UK, so any input on the effect of race would be welcome also.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, one thing I always found helpful is to have a /loc hotkey (let me know if you need some help setting one up) and if things started to go badly, I would hit the /loc key so I would know where I died.<br />
<br />
One sand dune looks like another in a place like No Ro, so learning to get in the habit of doing a /loc before you die (and learning to use the /loc command) is very very helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i remember my first death, it was in northern ro.<br />
I almost cried, the world was so wide (past commons and ro i didnt even KNOW what there was), finding a corpse in this immensity of sand was my first worst experience of CR.<br />
<br />
The second in order, but the first in my mind was this 23 hours CR in plane of fear after a failed break in...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also if you know you are about to die, try to move/run to a safer spot where it wont be so hard to get your corpse, say like a wall, corner, someplace where the mobs that killed you will not be wandering.<br />
<br />
As Glorana stated, make sure to get a Loc of where you are before death.<br />
<br />
Try to get familiar with the surrounding where you are fighting such as exploring the camp/zone.<br />
<br />
Have a /corpse Hot Key like you will have for your /loc key.  If you died in a bad spot drag your corpse to a safer spot before looting.<br />
<br />
If you died in a bad spot ask for some assistance so you do not die again.<br />
<br />
Hmm all I can think of at the moment, Bah back to work. :(<br />
<br />
Good Luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Perhaps I was mistaken, but it was my understanding that characters under level 10 no longer lose their corpses.  They die and keep everything.  No corpse, and they go back to their spawn point.  Did that patch not happen?  Am I on the hash pipe and not knowing it?  :)<br />
<br />
If anyone can educate me (a HUGE task!), I'd appreciate it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, that's true, but this guy is talking about levels 11 - 28 (the CR period before restarting with all your gear and the level you get invis).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya you keep your items and stuff to till L10. You also get 20 food and drink that are &quot;hearty meal&quot; so they last a hell of a long time now which isi very nice. I have a twink ranger I been messing with and he is like L12 now and still on the same food I started with. Before you got like 5 and they would go very fast, you spent more buying food and water than you could buying spells and stuff. <br />
<br />
But ya learn how to use loc.. there is a guide over on eqatlas.com etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ALWAYS get a loc when you die.  You do this by using the /loc command.  Its a good idea if you know what zone you are in when you die also.  This sounds obvious but when you are truly new, sometimes it is easy to get confused.  A trick you can use if you aren't sure is to type /corpse in the zone, and if it says you don't have a corpse in that zone, you know you are in the wrong <br />
spot.<br />
<br />
Another thing you should do is goto eqatlas.com and read the guide on using /loc to navigate.  Also don't neglect your sense heading skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is why Im against the new CR policy  below lvl10 in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is why Im against the new CR policy below lvl10 in the first place. <br />
<br />
Oh lighten up, you obviously havnt had a lower level character lately.  The new no corpse rules and food/exp are perfect.  I started a newbie enchanter the other day, no twinking, and after about my 15th death, I would have totally quit the game if i had to find my damn corpse in Nektulos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Levels 11-28 aren't that bad really. You get SoW at 9th and that will keep you out of a lot of trouble. <br />
<br />
... what everyone else said about using /loc for when things do go wrong. Having a chipped bone rod (about 5p I think) in the bank is also handy, if you do loose your corpse, though going linkdead for example, you'll have a way to find it without having to run down a class that can use it. <br />
<br />
As for race, I don't think I'd worry about that too much. If you're on a new server, you won't be able to buy toys like a fungi/jbb anyway. If I wanted to level ahead of the curve on a new server, I think I'd go iksar. They probably have the only newbie zones that can actually handle the rush on a new server. If you want to do a lot of quests, I'd go for barb or kitty shaman, the faction does make a difference imo.  But play what race you like, pretty much anyone on this board will agree that race doesn't make a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Buy a chipped bone rod as well if you see one on a vendor. Right click locate corpse. Just remember to bank it.<br />
<br />
-Zor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Seriously, it's not even funny.  I decked out a new hafling ranger.  Everytime Im oom or low on hp, I just attack one  of those zorro-wannabe and continue my exploiits.  Too easily abused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SK's and Paladins are partularly fun to level to 10 , fight , HT/LoH, hit a guard repeat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Apart from the /loc command<br />
<br />
Take a quick look around, head to something that you will recognise when looking for your corpse.<br />
<br />
Many a time id lost my corpse, then noticed some strange object that i had try to run to before I dropped and then scouted around it to find the corpse in question.<br />
<br />
If all else fails, ask a necro / SK / or bard to do a quick track for you.  Most people will help you out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Remember also that if you cant find your corpse for some reason or another (sometimes corpses get stuck in the wall and are only partially visible thus making them hard to spot in unknown area) you can ask help from Bards, Necromancers and Shadowknights. They have a spell that locates your corpse.  Chipped bone rods from merchats do the same thing, just can be a bit costy for an untwinked new player at lower levels.<br />
I guess you already knew this from playing a necromancer tho...<br />
<br />
EDIT: You know how to set up a /corpse hotkey right? Targetting your corpse and using /corpse -hotkey/command allows you to &quot;drag&quot; your corpse to you from 50ft away. This is handy if you dont know exactly where your  corpse is. Just spam the key and run around, or if you happen to die at a hostile place, ie. in the middle of an orc camp for example. Sometimes it's also good to drag your corpse to a safe spot to loot it safely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My biggest advice is don't go adventuring too far without getting a bind in your new hunting area.<br />
<br />
At level 13 I was bound in West Freeport and decided to get a port to Surefall so I could make my way over to Halas and get my new lvl 14 spells.  I made it all the way to Black Burrow, got trained on and died.  Showing up back in West Freeport, I didn't know what to do....I had no money and no one would port me for free, so I decided to run it.  I ran across NINE zones, taking about 2-3 hours, got to Black Burrow and died.  I thought I was going to cry.  When my boyfriend got home I begged him to help me find my corpse (lvl 55 druid).  I didn't know the loc of it, so he planted me in one spot, finally found it on track and got me safely to Halas.  It was definitely my most tramatic EQ day ever!<br />
<br />
So always get a bind and use your loc key in the event that you die....it will save you much pain and heartache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ouch Raoulna<br />
<br />
I think you can buy a chipped bone rod in Yee Magic in Halas.<br />
<br />
Those things saved me many a times.<br />
<br />
I think they only have like 5 chgs on them tho.. I am not certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kukis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks very much for all your replies :)<br />
<br />
I didn't realise the range on the /corpse thing was quite that long, that's good news to me!<br />
<br />
I started a Vah Shir in the end, because I really wanted to be able to buy, sell and bank wherever without worrying too much about travelling back to 'home'.  Also, they appeal to my sense of fantasy a little more than the Barbarians did (I must admit I didn't really consider the evil races due to faction worries).<br />
<br />
As for the under-10 policies, I have to admit I like them.  I have found EQ fairly difficult to take in, and I would be furious with the sheer amount of deaths I suffered with my Necro :)<br />
<br />
I mean, you have to do some real digging around to get much info since the EQ world is so vast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Here is how I addressed the need to get a loc at early levels when you die.<br />
<br />
1. Bind Sense Heading to ability 1<br />
2. make a button that says:<br />
     /doability 1<br />
     /loc<br />
3. Put this button right next to slam and mash it during battle.  This serves to raise your sense heading skill and get a loc every now and then.  Should you die, just scroll up and look at the last Loc you got<br />
4. If you die edit that button and put in a line that says /corpse at the bottom.  Now you have an all in one corpse recovery button.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">get that /loc hotkey - and with a little bit of exercise you can also learn to navigate very well with it.  Just remember, whoever set up the EQ coordinate system wanted to play with the mthematicians mind.  The first number indicates north, south, with high being north, the second number indicates east west, with high being west.  Over the years you will be able to run from NK to LR by just aiming your way with the second coordinate while running south and arrive just at the right spot (about -7500, -1300 if I'm not too off).<br />
Amazing what kind of nonsense the human mind records....</div></div><hr />
