&quot;there aren't any level 46 bards begging for groups in PoD yet they are flagged to enter, why would you think it would be any different for Valor?&quot;<br />

&quot;They'll get over the KEI thing fast - at least we wont have to hear the complaining.&quot;<br />

I'm at work and can't log in til 10:30 CST.  Um, just how many Indians are there?:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so many that everyone else has moved out. I did a who of Valor and there were only 25 people in it... the problem was the average level was something like 59. I failed to notice that and got a group with a 65 paladin friend of mine, assuming I was safe. Boy was that a mistake... found myself grouped with sub-60 cleric, enchanter, and druid. <br />
<br />
I dont get how these people can even think they will survive there. they are fxing level 62+ mobs, what the hell gives you the idea that you, at level 56, are ready for an exp group there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I figured this would happen, although I'm optimistically hoping that within a week or two, they'll all be tired of dying and will move back to more appropriate zones. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm hoping hedge might be open in PoN or left courtyard in PoD... With everyone dying in Valor should be nice Tier 1 camps open :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just out of curiosity, how can that possibly be fun after the first or second time?  After doing THO and burrower about a dozen times, and doing god knows how many shards in that zone, I would be more than happy to never ever go there again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Post patch experience:<br />
<br />
Zoned into Valor, 20ish people there, I did a &quot;/ooc 61 shaman lfg&quot;, and got a tell from an SK asking if I could come buff him. He was 62, but his group had a 56 cleric and he'd just died at OC.<br />
<br />
I went there, and their enchanter was just leaving, so I was invited into the group. The SK did warn me in a tell that if he died again, he would leave. It was the lowest group I've had in PoV, in fact, the only time where I haven't been the lowest person in the group. 62 SK, 62 necro, 62 rogue, 61 shaman, 57 ranger, 56 cleric.<br />
<br />
The ranger was a touch irritating, &quot;wow, this is sweet exp&quot;, &quot;I wonder if I can make 59 today&quot;, etc. He was also doing archery some of the time, which at 57 is pointless, except to skill up.<br />
<br />
I wasn't in that group very long - a friend needed help so I left. But while I was there, the exp seemed about the same as before per kill, though our pulls were slower.<br />
<br />
Second group I got was in PoN. After a couple of false starts crossing the river (*sigh*, it's not *that* hard), we killed hobgoblins. The experience there seemed to be a bit better than before, but I wasn't there long enough to tell for sure. <br />
<br />
A lot of guildies said they really noticed the improvement in experience in PoD, and I've heard a few people say that PoV exp rates are much the same as before.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that maybe the PoV exp modifier was nerfed more than the tier 1 planes, so that it's not that much better to exp in any more. Anyone else have any experiences to back this up or contradict it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoV does seem to be just the same as before exp wise. BoT and HoH however seem to be great experience now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I spent the evening in a FG shard camp in a full group of 6, and the XP was NOTICEABLY better than before.  Mobs were easy, easy kills for 65 mage/65 bard/60 ranger/63 shaman/62 warrior/65 wizard, of course, but we each made around 50% of an AA in 2 hours.  Considering these mobs were low dark blues or even light blues before the patch that's pretty good XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 59, I don't even plan on stepping into those planes I can access now.  I know better.  My main goal is to get 60, somehow find Malo, I have stoicism, so Torpor and it's ridiculous price will have to hold off just a bit, unless I get lucky on drops.  I was hoping that SOE would somehow know that under 60 in Teir 2 was a dumb idea...... guess I should have known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in PoV last night. I didn't go because I wanted to go, but because it was the only group I could find. I had no problem slowing at 59 for the stuff we were pulling (although it was all yellow and red). I did get 1 or 2 resists and died once because of it. But I think I could hold my own there as long as we didnt do any higher level mobs.</div></div><hr />
