<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I belong to a reasonably small family guild.  We raid occasionally but we aren't a &quot;raiding guild&quot; by any means.  We have been talking lately about moving into a bit tougher raids.  For the most part the only raids we've been doing lately are epic driven ones.  We have started talking about where we want to go next.  We will never be a raiding guild so most likely one raid a week is the extent of our raiding.  One of the common suggestions was to work towards raiding Vindi and other Velious content.  Does anyone have an tips, suggestions, strategies, required numbers/classes, etc for doing Vindi?  The guild is comprised of mostly 55-65 people.  Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The challenge on vindi is pulling him solo. That said a CH rotation of 4 or more is recommended, and 2 FD pullers to tag pull vindi.<br />
<br />
my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Corner tank his ass and burn him down. Vindi is the first real raid mob in the game, so don't be surprised if you blow it a few times. The good news is once you get your Vindi technique down, you just mastered 3/4 of the fights in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The pull is the only tricky part.  Two monks should be able to do it just fine, although they might die a few times learning it.  Once you have him single in the arena, the monk jumps over the side walls to where your raidforce waits.  Vindi will jump over the wall as well, at which point you have a ranger use weaponshield disc and go wild on the aggro.  Once his disc is about to wear off (12 or 15 seconds I think) your MT uses AE taunt and pulls vindi in to the corner.  Hopefully the ranger lives, but it isn't necessary.  <br />
<br />
When you corner him, your MT stands with his back in the corner, so that he faces ******d.  Since your tank's hitbox is smaller than vindi's, if you also push vindi in the corner, he will have to look in to the corner in order to attack your MT.  This means that only your MT will be in front, and everyone else will be able to attack from behind, meaning higher DPS, no ripostes, and melee can attack through enrage (though if your tank is a sadistic F'er like ours, he will turn the mob around for enrage and see how many rogues he can kill).<br />
<br />
It is important that your start your CH loop BEFORE your tank has aggro.  Have your clerics start the loop as soon as vindi is over the wall, and just duck out if the MT doesn't have aggro yet.  This loop preparation time is a second bonus to using the weaponshield tactic.<br />
<br />
If you have a tank successfully holding aggro on a mob, and clerics successfully looping CH on him, then you've more or less beaten everquest.  Good luck.<br />
<br />
edit:  the censored part should be the word that is the opposite of &quot;inward&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From a shaman point of view, Vindi himself is unslowable, his guards are not.  If you can spare 2 tanks and 2 shaman, you can off-tank the guards easily; this safes you the tag pulling.<br />
One thing to be careful with - fast debuffing of the guards can get you on Vindi's rampage list.  That is a very fast way of dying if you are a pre-vindi equipped shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hopefully the ranger lives, but it isn't necessary.  <br />

In my opinion it is essential that he dies.   The foundation of all good raids rests apon the corpse of atleast one dead ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shrink your MT. Having never been an MT myself, I'm not really sure WHY it's important, but it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shrinking your main tank is important so you can stick the MT as far in the corner as you can to &quot;aow&quot; the mob.

Aye, its like a sacrifice to RAllos Zek, god of war.<br />
<br />
My old guild usually tried to get 2 down, just for giggles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LMAO!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
But seriously, as everyone else has posted, pulling Vindi is the hard part, once you have that down it's cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Make sure everyone knows to holler if they start taking rampage hits, and that there is a healer or two dedicated to healing rampage damage, if possible. <br />
<br />
Vindi can be a hell of a fight, or quite easy, depending on how many L 65's you have. He was pretty scary  pre-Luclin AA's and PoP levels. If your tanks are still in that range, be ready for a tough fight. If your have a couple tanks who are L 65 with a bunch of AA's, it shouldn't be very tough (if you can get the pull right) even if their gear isn't all that hot. The keys have already been discussed (pulling, corner tanking, CH rot, WS ranger, etc...). <br />
<br />
Without knowing the levels of the raid it's really hard to say how many you need. L 55's are vastly inferior to L 65's, so that's a wide open range. I'd guesstimate 2 groups of L 65's without uber gear, but a lot more (a LOT more) if most of the people are closer to 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vortecks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We rush him. <br />
<br />
2x pallies (1 each on guard) with shaman slowing and healing the 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Park MA in corner, get agro and nukem down..  <br />
<br />
Vindi will be dead before the guards go down since it is just a pally whacking away at them.<br />
<br />
I usually am on healing the Pallies and with the 2 of them being lvl 65 and a bunch of aa's between them i don't have to heal them too much. just Throw Q on them every 30 secs and then spam MA with Tnargs..  <br />
<br />
A good 4 cleric rotation on CHeals with an aditional healer clr/dru for rampage heals, Vindi will drop sooner then you think he would.<br />
<br />
as stated in previous post, i don't know what your raid size/lvl's are<br />
<br />
Would suggest 4 full groups (24 ppl) Can do with less if you are mostly 65.  A MA with 8K or more hps makes it extreamly eaisier also, since it take Vindi awhile to chew through 8k hps.  4-5 clerics and a sh!tload of DPS.. = 1 ded Vindi<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks, Juujuu. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can also avoid the pulling mess if vindi's guards/pets are still at their spawn points.  Wait for vindi to walk back up to the temple and you can send one group to sneak around him and pull/kill his guards in the area to the left of the temple entrance.  If vindi has been aggro'd since his spawn hawever, his pets will be following him and must be split off or off tanked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We tried a few times to get Vindi solo before we finally just gave up and said frick it... bring it all.<br />
<br />
We used a 65 paladin to quickly get agro on the 2 guards... and then he offtanked the guards for the whole fight... pretty much self healing... with a spot from me once and awhile.<br />
<br />
Pulling the guards, even though they aren't that tough, adds an extra variable to the fight... what if the palaldin can't get agro, what if you can't slow... what if, what if... and then there's the whole low hp agro assist... if you can get them solo, do it... but strictly speaking... we don't really fear them anymore... bring it all... if Vindi comes solo, bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One bard with Fading Memories should be able to get Vindi solo.  Pull Vindi and guards, tag Vindi with MR debuff song (OoS or HoS).  Highsun Vindi back to his spawn point and Fade off aggro.  Use deftdance /disc to stay alive when Highsunning if necessary (range is short).   Bring Vindi's pets to the raid and wipe the floor with them, go back for Vindi after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not seen much talk about rampage, the other key points have been covered.<br />
<br />
You need one dedicated rampage tank, and one person healing them. On the pull they need to get a very small amount of aggro right at the start. This can be before or after the MT aggros, but must be before a single heal lands on the MT and must be low enough aggro that the MT will aggro Vindi without fail.<br />
<br />
A shaman with quiessence and tnarg's can heal almost any 60+ knight/warrior on rampage with no major problems. Rampage can be spiky though so if in doubt, assign another healer to help out. Palladins make good rampage tanks as they can heal themselves if they think its looking bad. If you use an SK on rampage, make sure they don't FD.... I've had it happen and it cleared them from rampage :(<br />
<br />
If you mess up on the rampage tank, Vindi will soon rampage on the healers, and at that point you're looking at a probable wipe because your CH chain will break. <br />
<br />
Other tips:<br />
DS the MT as much as possible, bards are good to have in MT group for the DS and other songs. <br />
If you think mana might be tight, bard in the cleric group<br />
If you can spare it, have a patch healer on the MT. They should start casting a heal aimed to land at about 30-40% health on the MT. If at that time another heal has landed, duck out. If the MT is below 40% (you can reduce this when you're more comfortable with it) then let the heal run.<br />
Test the range and timing on CH chain before the pull. Timing will depend on tank, somewhere from 3-5 seconds usually (for a first time kill, I'm sure some guilds can use far less).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On the occasion that my guild kills vindi, we no longer worry about splitting his guards, we just pull and kill him.  So the information I give you, I can't personally confirm.<br />
<br />
A little while ago, I believe a change was made in kael that made it to where you could no longer warp vindi through the icewall, and this makes pulling him solo unlikely.<br />
<br />
It's also worth mentioning that the last few times we killed vindi, statue, aow etc, we could not corner them unless we used gnome form.  Even shrink multiple times didn't work.<br />
<br />
It's been a while though, so I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
edit: Oh yeah, damage shields own him.  You can very easily get a 100+ point DS on him, which makes him drop like a rock.<br />
<br />
Dont forget rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In my opinion it is essential that he dies.   The foundation of all good raids rests apon the corpse of atleast one dead ranger.<br />
Failing that, a Froggie Tank.<br />
<br />
On our raids, if the Froggie don't die, the Raid failed it's mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">have a ranger use weaponshield disc and go wild on the aggro. Once his disc is about to wear off (12 or 15 seconds I think) your MT uses AE taunt and pulls vindi in to the corner. Hopefully the ranger lives, but it isn't necessary.  <br />
<br />
Sacraficial rangers are not really neccessary any more for agro.  Nice to have, but a good warrior should be able to hold agro well enough without it.  Note if the ranger dies before the awarrior taunts off him, then the warrior will gain no agro from this.<br />
<br />
Shrinking your main tank is important so you can stick the MT as far in the corner as you can to &quot;aow&quot; the mob. If the MT is too fat, the mob won't keep it's back to the raid <br />
<br />
What happens is once the mob gets pushed into the corner with the MT, if the MT is not shrunk, he will start getting spammed 'you cannot see your target'  and will very rapidly loose agro.  MT should be double shrunk for this(unless they are a small race already).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A couple of other things I've noticed about Vindi...  <br />
<br />
First, you may not be able to slow him, but you can cripple him, and it seems to be effective in lowering his damage output a bit.  Rampages in particular seem to decrease when he's crippled, but maybe it's my imagination.  Anyway, it certainly can't hurt. ;)<br />
<br />
Second, if you pull his guards first, and anyone has a pet up, it seems to want to charge Vindi when he's incoming.  Be ready to /pet back off before it gets to him if it does, or it can really screw up initial aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Rampages in particular seem to decrease when he's crippled, but maybe it's my imagination.<br />
<br />
From everything I've heard, things like Rampage, Flurry, etc are all combat procs, so lowering mob Dex (via Cripple etc) should reduce their frequency.  So afaik, it's not just your imagination.<br />
<br />
Of course I've never seen any parses of that, but I've never looked for any either. :p  I've always just kind of accepted it.  And as you said...<br />
<br />
Anyway, it certainly can't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks a lot for all your tips and ideas.  I will forward this to my guildies to help formulate strategies if we decide to hit Vindi sometime soon.</div></div><hr />
