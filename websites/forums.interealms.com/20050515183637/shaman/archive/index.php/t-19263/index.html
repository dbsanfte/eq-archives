<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kuukymunster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, let me start by saying that I know I am going to be flamed off these boards by what I am about to say but...<br />
<br />
I troll these boards alot and most of the time all I read about is how bad Sony is and why are they doing this etc.. Well I personally would like to state that i enjoy Playing EQ. I have tried to quit for 2 years now but constantly get pulled back into it. Now I understand I haven't played the end game (I'm 57) and probably never will as it takes me a while to ding (I'm a Casual player), but what I am able to do in the game is more than enough to make me happy. I play EQ to relax and escape the real life for a bit. I understand that this isn't enough for a lot of you players out there but since I work and am married I don't have the time to play 8- 12 hours aday. So keeping that in mind I can't fully understand the reasoning behind all the complaints. I don't know what it is like to have 200aa or visit teir 3 pop and once again probably never will but thats not the intent of this post. All I really wanted to say was that I'm thankful that Sony puts out a game, faults of no faults, that I pay to play( they are not holding a gun to my head) that I totally enjoy playing.<br />
<br />
You don't have to agree with me(and I'm pretty sure you wont) but somebody had to say it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of us would agree with you at your level. I was still really enjoying my shaman at level 57. Most of our complaints have to do with reaching level 65 and not having anything more to look forward to. The fun factor just seems to slip away. Each expansion seems to regurgitate the same old spells with nothing new to look forward to. I'm glad you're enjoying your shaman. I hope that when you finally reach level 65, the game has changed enough for you to continue to enjoy it as much as you do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a pretty sad day on these boards when someone is almost embarassed to say that they like EQ..... <br />
<br />
Considering this forum wouldn't exist if it wasn't for people passionate about EQ we might collectively want to take a step back here and breathe in.<br />
<br />
kuukymunster, it's ok to like EQ... :) <br />
<br />
I thoroughly enjoy it too... shhh, don't tell anyone... and I am 65 and EP flagged... and I can still have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sony didnt create EQ btw :), they just bought it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If we didn't all like playing EQ we wouldn't care whether ClassX stunk or rocked or anything else. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, everyone who plays this game obviously likes it.  We would all like to see changes that would help our characters out, but for the most part Shamans are my favorite class to play (This is the second one I am leveling up).  I have been playing EQ for a few years and every class complains about what they have and what they want.<br />
<br />
For the most part, there are alot other classes lower on the totem pole than us, so I don't make a big stink about our AAs or spells.  Every class could use improvement, but since SOE has their own agenda, I just take it with a grain of salt....like my tequila :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some times when i am fed up i sit back and rember the game 4 years ago, The game has advanced beyond all expectations and i for one am looking forward to the next 4 years.<br />
<br />
The only this that realy concerns me abou the direction the game is taking is the dumbing down of the game.<br />
<br />
Example;<br />
<br />
The invisisble Bridge in the Deep... What a great experance it was to cross that with a group on auto follow behind me !! boy everyone had to take a min to chill out after that, hehe<br />
<br />
Now compare that to the Bridges in LoY they look great and span huge lava pits with massive Beasties in them,,, try to walk off one, you cant what a let down, no Fear Factor at all.</div></div><hr />
