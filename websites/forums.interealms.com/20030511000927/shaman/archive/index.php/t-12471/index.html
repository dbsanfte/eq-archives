<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else having trouble with this? I've yet to be able to complete it. 3 hearts, 3 pieces to the globe, and I cant get the guy in the castle in the middle of PoV to say anything to be besides 'goofy whiteguy in a suit of armor nods in your direction'<br />
<br />
friggin sucks, noone in my guild has a AD key and we were going to give it a shot last night...couldnt get the quest to hook me up with a key. <br />
<br />
Never been on a successful AD kill, did attempt him once with a pickup raid tho. Anyone else having issues with the quest?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, but i've read that, and while some folks mentioned you could screw it up, I mainly looking for a way to fix it now. I am not flagged for HoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make sure you have talked to every one along the way, and not just skipped directly to the person. PoP introduced a new way of questing that prevents skipping content in many cases. Many NPC's will not respond with a thing or accept items without the preliminary work done beforehand leading up to them.<br />
It prevents multi-questing and just stabbing in the dark at key words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yub, I did it all in order without zoning or skipping folks. I find it hard to believe that since I hailed someone out of order I am screwed for life from completing the quest....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This quest is persnickedety.<br />
<br />
You absolutely have to do everything in order, use exactly the right hailing phrases and have no interruptions - as far as I can tell.  <br />
<br />
When I didn't get a response back from an NPC that was indicated, I went back and restarted the hailing from the beginning.  <br />
<br />
Then it worked fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hail,<br />
I didn't skip any steps either, and the Master Sergeant would only nod in my direction as well. :(  This was about a week ago.<br />
I turned in the hearts and Paralin ate them all.<br />
(It should be mentioned I had to be Gflux'ed up to Paralin, who was walking on the TOP of his tent instead of inside.)<br />
<br />
I petitioned &amp; used /report to show I turned in the items (which Paralin took with a &quot;looks at you with disgust&quot; message).  Six hours later I finally received a response.  (By then I'd already obtained a new razerfiend and arachnae heart)  The GM returned my larvae heart (thank goodness, that was the biggest PITA to get) but was unable to help me with the quest other than warn me to pay close attention to the text.  He wasn't able to reposition the NPC's off the top of the tents either.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, post-patch, I found Paralin inside his tent, but was called away to raid before trying again.  I'm going to try today &amp; I'll let you know what happens.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Well, I did it.  I was extremely careful, and found some things out I think are important.  It took me several run throughs of the text because:<br />
* I left my stuff in the bank &amp; didn't realize until turn-in time. (/smack self)<br />
* I aggroed an undead vassal taking a shortcut and had to zone.<br />
* I died because someone left a crystalline golem ON the bridge between the bridgehouses &amp; I wasn't ready or expecting that. (/smack self again)<br />
*  You can't zone in between any of the steps as far as I'm aware.<br />
*  Several of the publicly available spoilers are missing small pieces of information.  Pay attention to all the text.  The Allakhazam's spoiler I printed awhile back (which wasn't on their site today) and the Safehouse spoiler I printed again beforehand today were missing small parts of the text.<br />
<br />
I'm not promising this is correct, but this is what I did:<br />
The tents are located at loc neg 950 neg 500 roughly.  Sometimes hard to see w/ clipping lowered until you get close.  <br />
<br />
Hail Johon Popoah twice, until he gives you a line of text with &quot;compound&quot; in brackets.<br />
Say, &quot;what compound&quot;.<br />
Hail Johon Popoah AGAIN, at which time he'll tell you to &quot;...leave before there is bloodshed&quot;.<br />
Move over to Paralin Notion.<br />
Hail him.<br />
/say I am brave<br />
/say I will help your company<br />
/say what squad<br />
/say what about that razorfiend<br />
/say I will provide you with assistance<br />
/say what trials<br />
/say what things<br />
<br />
Now, go STRAIGHT (Not literally, but don't fight or talk to any other NPC's.  Definitely don't gate or zone.) to Master Sergeant Aramis Daryln in the bridgehouse (far side).  Be careful to avoid aggro from anything.  <br />
TARGET the Master Sergeant but do NOT hail him.<br />
/say I am here to aid the cause.<br />
(IF YOU DON'T GET the text from the Master Sergeant containing the words &quot;Aerin`Dar&quot; in brackets, go back to Johon and start over!  There is an invisible temporary flag that occurs at this step.)<br />
/say what is Aerin`Dar.<br />
Run immediately back to Paralin.<br />
Hail Paralin Notion.  He'll give you text with the word &quot;prove&quot; in brackets.<br />
/say How shall I prove myself.<br />
Turn the 3 hearts (spider, razer, larvae all in same trade window) in to Paralin.<br />
(Get exp message).<br />
Run back to Master Sergeant and this time Hail him.<br />
/say what glass lair<br />
/say what about Aerin`Dar<br />
/say what company<br />
/say what mission<br />
Run back to the tents where Paralin was, but enter the tent w/ Captain Ryglot Cupperhide.<br />
Hail Capt. Ryglot. (make sure you are close enough to him when hailing)<br />
/say why are you so busy<br />
/say I will help<br />
/say what mission<br />
/say what war<br />
/say I am willing<br />
Turn in the 3 orb pieces.<br />
<br />
The completed orb that he returns to you is your key to Aerin`Dar's lair.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah you gotta do the first part up to giving the hearts all in order without zoning or it screws up.  Then you have to go back and get the text asking for the orbs.  <br />
I did this quest.  I'm one of only like 3 people in my guild who did, that's handy when it comes time to do AD for the recruits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another thing:<br />

DON'T hail anyone else on the way .. not even PC's.<br />

So long<br />

<br />
Nirtox is correct.  I mentioned that regarding the step between Paralin and Master Sergeant, but it is valid throughout the quest in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Hailing anyone out of order or out of sequence screws things up.  This quest is extremely finicky, but easy (once pieces are gathered, which isn't really that hard if you grind in Valor) if you pay attention &amp; don't deviate.  (Which is pretty much what the GM told me!  :eek: )<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
