<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I cast a tigirs on 2 monsters that were pulled by the party in mistmoore and it caught a bitten victim on the edge of it -- Three spiders came out...  <br />
<br />
In the past tigirs did NOT trigger these traps as it does not remove any hit points... but now it *DOES*<br />
<br />
Be very careful...  Tigirs seems to have a very odd effect now -- whereas before it would wake a pet up but not trigger any of the other effects... Now it seems to only wake pets up or release the spiders...<br />
<br />
You have been warned of another stealth nerf curtesy of SOE...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not a nerf....<br />
<br />
Its a AoE spell, those are NPC's. If anything it really should be viewed as a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I accidentally caught a bitten victim also and go aggro. The mob died and a few mobs spawned. The thing that helped most was realizing it was probably a trap and not killing it until the other mobs in the camp were dead. I just tanked it until the group was ready to deal with it. Still, in LDoN, Tigir's ROCKS!!! It makes my job so much nicer and turns bad pulls into something manageable. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">More like something DEADLY if you did not see it coming because it DIDNT work that way before...<br />
<br />
I was upset AND embarrassed when my spell brought spiders on the party... And there were several times today where people pulled to a victim on the ground where I couldnt use tigirs because of said victim.<br />
<br />
Personally I think they had it right before except it shouldnt have made the pets stand up...  slow doesnt do any damage...  Shouldnt kill something at 2% or whatever.<br />
<br />
At any rate it was the surprise that upset me more -- I would have liked to have seen a notice whatever they called it:<br />
<br />
Bug Fix:  AoE slow will now set off traps in LDON -- you have been warned...<br />
<br />
as opposed to your first warning being when you slow 2 mobs and set off a trap adding 3 more making it FIVE at the same time.</div></div><hr />
