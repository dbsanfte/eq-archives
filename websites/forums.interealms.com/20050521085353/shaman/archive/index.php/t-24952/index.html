<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I should have written this a couple months ago, but it has only recently hit me that I think I am really done with EQ. I will probably always log on once in a blue moon to poke around and say hello, and will certainly troll the forums (it's funny, this place means almost as much as the game itself), but I don’t see myself becoming a real EQ player again. I will be playing WoW, and if you are interested in hooking up -- or just want to say hi -- send me a PM or e-mail.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I’ll remember a lot of things from the game; over the years Uggok has taken on a life of his own. I like to think of him with his Spear of Fate hanging on the wall in a nice comfortable house in, well, not Grobb but perhaps Shar Vahl or Paineel, sleeping on his rocking chair and giving unwanted advice to newer, younger adventurers. Of course, I am sure he still goes down to Innothule with Fifi to smash some frogloks to keep in shape.  Someday, he will go to sleep in the town where he was born.<br />
<br />
<br />
To the posters at the Shaman’s Crucible, I think I spent as many hours here as I did actually playing, thanks (and thanks for the 5 green dots, considering all my jackassery over the years!). Especially to Henora, who was always a few levels ahead and willing to help me out with a tip back on Terris. To Sunmoon and all his mods, Thantu, Glorianna, Faern etc, thanks for this board. To the old school shamans who showed me the ropes when I was new – Tudamorf, Ooga, Talamay, Juuju, Tugg, Kazlaaz, Eduin, Boinshar, Nixx, and more – and to the just plain great posters, Ysgwyrthyr, Callir, Eoin, Ceno, Barm, Chutoi, Gart, Jinhelm, Rodahan, Arriana, and all the rest.  Thanks.  This is the best board I have ever seen, and it has been a complete blast.<br />

One of the best &quot;goodbye&quot; posts I have seen too, but then, being a fellow troll, I am a bit partial. Even got me a litle blurry-eyed, ::sniff:: <br />
<br />

I hope you still drop in to the WoW forum area here on the crucible, even if you don't play a shaman.  Hopefully that part of these boards will continue to grow.</div></div><hr />

I love these boards! While I ponder canceling my EQ accounts I doubt I will leave here for some time.<br />
<br />
I know I am under 300 posts, but I have been reading here forever and I  read here quite a few times daily. I love what so many of you have to say, and you are all a nice bunch of folks! It just seems I never have anything useful to add to the conversation :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Best of luck to you my unmet friend.<br />

Take care, and fare the well.<br />

<br />
                        Man you were a nice guy for as long as I knew you . Even Waaaaaaay back when I first met you on TT in EC spaming your jaundiced bone armor for sale . After meeting you that one time i came to you for advice on many occasions . It was a true honor to have played by your side . Eventualy leveling up and joining the same Guild as you and raiding with you was THE single biggest acomplishment of my EQ life .<br />
<br />
Take care bro , It was good to have shared such glorious adventure with you ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry for my tardy reply, but thanks everyone for your kind words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Later Uggok.  Good luck and I hope to stumble into you in WOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Uggok - just cause you leave the game doesn't mean you have to leave the boards.  <br />
<br />
Look at me for example. No EQ account but I post over here once in awhile.<br />
<br />
This is the best board I have ever seen, and it has been a complete blast.<br />
<br />
Amen to that.<br />
<br />
(Even though Gloriana the Wonder MOD - a fellow NCSU grad - doesn't know who Julius Hodge or Phillip Rivers are)<br />
<br />
But whatever you do in life - bit success and happiness to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Faern, you should know I will be trolling here until they shut the place down :)</div></div><hr />
