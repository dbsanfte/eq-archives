<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Every time I load up Rodahn, I get maybe a few steps, or turned around mid-way and BAM!  Crash to desktop or PC lock-up.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, my ranger was not logged in PoK so I can still play him.  But I just want to play my shaman again /cry :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yea we had a guy that was stuck in PoK for a week in our guild. He finally got out last night and was cheering about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rodahn, try logging into another character on the same account and going to overhead view. Then log out and log in with Rodahn.<br />
<br />
I have used that method to get out of continous crashes. I have no idea why it works (for me) but it is the only way I have managed to get back in on my character in natimbi after several attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, will try that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use to crash in PoK. And its always the in the same area of PoK. And it only seems to happen with my new Radeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, I thought I was the only one who would Freeze up in PoK. Every once in awhile my comp will lock up in PoK and I'd have to reboot. I have a pretty decent comp (pent 4 2.5ghz, 512 DDR 2700 RAM, Radeon 9700 Pro) so I'm sorta glad to know that its not just my system giving me problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There was a report that some video cards and drivers had issues with some of SOEs maps. PoK was the big one. Try deleting the map, and letting it get replaced by the new one. This helped a LOT of people I know, they never crash in PoK now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rod my GF had the same issue. Remove your DX9 and reinstall it using <br />
<br />
DirectX Eradicator 1.09  (http://www.softpedia.com/public/cat/14/4/14-4-40.shtml) <br />
<br />
or <br />
 <br />
<br />
 DirectX 9.0 Uninstaller (http://www.softpedia.com/public/cat/14/4/14-4-48.shtml) <br />
<br />
Then uninstall your Display adapter/Video drivers. Reboot so it cleany comes up on win2k/winxp drivers and then re-install dx9 and video drivers.<br />
<br />
Also i have found some systems are tricky with adware and anything running in the back like a exe that shouldnt normaly be there can conflict with EQ's volitile state can cause a crash. Check out Ad-aware (http://www.lavasoftusa.com/) ( free for personal use )and make sure you clean out any spyware files that might be running and conflicting. Run a virus scanner like AVG (www.grisoft.com)  if you dont have one nad make sure there is no viruses or what ever running in the background.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finaly make sure you dont have alot of **** on your PC running, no bonzi buddies or just useless software that is wasting away not doing anything or the trial is over, try to trim down your programs running to almost nothing, this way nothing conflicts and your PC runs faster. Thats right disable that realplayer **** too.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps bud. If not pass it along anyway, i know itll help someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cool, thanks for the help, all :)<br />
<br />
I was able to get out of PoK with many near-lockups along the way, but now am afraid to go back, hehe.<br />
<br />
Will try those links, too, Lit, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmm, I have begun to crash in Pok about 2 weeks ago. Never did berfore and I m running a NVidia Ti4200, not any Radeon. I sure hope it got fixed with the last patch.</div></div><hr />

They disable some dx9 feature requests to your video card. Will make some things run/display a lil worse, but in the same respect itll usualy get things working in many games. Basicly you use this type of command when your card doesnt support the feature and its screwing up the game cause its confused on what to do. Its asking your card &quot; i need you to do such and such &quot; and your card goes &quot; Duh, what ?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Recommend you also try what i told Rod. There is a thing in the PC world known as software decay. Just like your car or anthing in life, things have a tendency to break down after being used. Files packed and repacked and when opened or closed such as dynamic link library being accessed ( direct X files ) tend to just get funked up. This is why microsoft themself recommend as normal matainence you re-install your OS evey 6 months or so for optimal performance.<br />
<br />
Simply removing the right files and re-installing them can sometimes work wonders. Think of it as rebuilding the motor in your car.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
Just happened to me again tonight.<br />
Happened last night as well, and the day before that.<br />
Always in PoK.  On two different machines w/ different video cards (an NVIDIA Geforce4x &amp; a NVIDIA TNT2) on two separate EQ accounts.<br />
<br />
We run AD-AWARE 6.0 regularly (almost daily) on both machines.  The only other program running in the background when we play EQ on our WinXP Home Taskbar is Volume Control.<br />
<br />
Deleting PoK maps &amp; using the default map (from advanced file check)didn't fix it for me.<br />
I'm going to try Karshak's overhead view method with a bazaar mule next to see if I can get out of PoK with it.<br />
<br />
I'd rather not have to go through the whole video drivers hassle again if I can avoid it.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
AD-Aware just found 8 data miners, but nothing in the registry or anything malicious.  The miners were probably from viewing links at Alla's, where I don't pay for premium service so I get pop-ups.<br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=28994 is a thread I just found over at Sony's boards.  Haven't waded through it all yet, but at least we aren't alone.  It is over 10 pages long right now. :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah it's pretty retarded and much worse since last patch.<br />
<br />
3 machines - Radeon 9800pro, radeon 9600something, geforce 4 ti4600  they all crash randomly in pok and then 1018 for 10+ minutes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had a similar problem in Barindi (sp) when at max clip plane. Never found a fix (reloaded drivers and the zone files) so now I just reduce the clip plane way down in this zone and its ok to at least run thru. Might be worth a try to  get your char out of PoK.</div></div><hr />

Might be worth a try to  get your char out of PoK.<br />
Karshak's work-around worked for me today (log in a character not in PoK, shift view to Top-down, switch back to stuck character).<br />
I was also very careful to only turn in small increments while in PoK on several characters.  Large sweeping turns (that used to be just fine, I used to do 'doughnuts' with Frek in PoK while in bearform) seem to be the precursor to a PoK lockup for me.<br />
<br />
I used top-down view and the map to navigate around PoK many times today.  I only had one lockup when I gated my twink cleric from the bazaar to PoK (next to the Kaladim stone).  Crashed hard upon zoning in to PoK.  I'm not sure if it was the same bug, or if I was trying to gate onto a big Ogre who happened to be standing where I'd bound myself.  That, and I forgot to unload cash and gated carrying 23k or so in platinum.  :eek:   That took my spouse and I a long trip to carry to the PoK bank (and we didn't lockup!). :p <br />
<br />
I avoid extended stays in PoK now, just point A-B transit and brief bank/quest runs.  Would be nice to feel safe to work tradeskills &amp; chat there again.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I bet Frekkels is cute in real life :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ordee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For my Windows 2000 machine I deleted the Maps folder and let EQ re-install them all and then deleted all of the CJ_charname_Bertoxx.txt{Something similar to that} files for the character that was locking up. That file seems to be the storage spot for all text your character has ever recieved. I saw it was full of mob aggro messages and quest text from ages ago. Delete all the ones with the locked up character name  and the TXT at the end and try it. <br />
<br />
  For Windows XP. Right click on your EQ shortcut and look under properties for a option to run it in Compatibility Mode. Set the Compatibility Mode to Windows 98/ME. That has kept me lockup free on the XP machine. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Ordee the PLing AFK guy behind that twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Its gotta be hardware or driver related. There must be a commonality among the people experienceing this. I have never had problems like this (other than general lagouts that happen to everyone) and I have a crappy Athelon 1 gig with 512 RAM and a GeForce 2 card, and I am running a 4 year old install of Win ME. <br />
<br />
Watch out deleting files with your character name on them though, or you may end up losing your UI, your Hot keys, your friends lists, etc etc. I suggest moving them, but keeping them handy in case thats not the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I always thought frek was a guy =\<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blazz:  Sometimes those files with your name on them are the problem though. Just FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I always thought frek was a guy =\<br />
<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
I always thought Frekkels sounded like a female name.  I may be wrong, but hey.  Didnt she have a sig or avatar once of a female barb character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It has spread for me, not only do i freeze in pok. I go insta-linkdead when i zone into the bazaar.<br />
<br />
FFXI on full time seems like a viable option now, more than ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have a similar problem in PoTranq, bout one in ten times I zone into there my video goes so laggy, all I can do is stare at my feet and waddle out.  I might try the overhead view trick next time.</div></div><hr />
