<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got bored and /who'ed.. locked up and I've been 1018 for 1/2 an hour ROFL! Doofus factor :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had no problem doing a / in the bazaar.  We only had about 150 people in the bazaar on Brell.  It sounds like a lot, but I've seen more in ToV and Ssra at once, and those were raids going on, not people just standing around trying to sell their 15 copies of spirit of omakin.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">320ish on Xeg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There were nearly 300 in the Bazaar at 1:30 am pacific, on Druzzil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bazaar is one of the laggiest zones in E'Ci.  YOu zone in and the area near the banks is usually so packed everything is in slow motion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, they should seriously remove all unneccessary graphics from the bazaar.  You should be sitting in a grey room with grey boxes cluttered about.  That zone is getting worked over harder than I think it was ever intended to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I could barely move in Bazaar. Every booth was packed with PC vendors who kept their accounts going while they slept. Never thought I'd see the day when I would prefer banking in SH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">337+ on Xegony.  I am thinking 400 will crash the zone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well then the people that are sleeping will be kicked out... should improve zone performance?<br />
<br />
Guess the time to sell and buy will be at night now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Turn down the clipping plane to nada, switch to 640*480 and even with a mediochre video card and 350 peeps on BB I was doing great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Expect the bazaar to be at a bare minimum of 300 at prime times to be honest.  BB is at 350+ and we're a primarily east US server.<br />
<br />
<br />
I forsee breaking 500 at 7pm EST without a doubt.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Tarthug Sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Problem I had was after clicking on a guy, waiting for his inventory to pop up, then clicking on an item, waiting for that item to pop up, no price tag could be found.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's mostly video lag...you could try using the /viewport command to reduce the viewing area to something small like 500x350 while in the bazaar...do your business....get out...then return your viewing area back to normal. Heck you can even hotkey it...2 buttons...one for big and one for small :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>littlra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To solve all these lag problems with so many &quot;sleepers&quot; in zone they should just allow you to sell items on consignment with exisiting vendors.<br />
<br />
So you put items in your trader bag in the bank and an NPC can access this bag to sell items to PCs on your behalf so you can log off while he is selling.  This is what I hoped the bazaar would be like anyway.<br />
<br />
1) It is insane to have to stand in a stall and wait for someone to buy your stuff - this is a game right?<br />
<br />
2) You shouldn't have to leave the game up while you sleep.  This is essentially the same thing as letting vendors sell for you but instead this way you help to lag out the zone and your PC is tied up.<br />
<br />
Giboo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The fastest and easiest way to move around the bazaar is to move your clipping plane down to zero while you are in the bazaar. Works like a charm.<br />
<br />
Then when you are ready to leave just slide it back up.<br />
<br />
Most of the slowdown (about 95%) is due to player models and not environment (obviously) and this will help that.<br />
<br />
Tarthug just saw your post on the same advice ;) and yes bang on thats the best solution for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've done a /who several times in the bazaar with no problems.  I just do it to check the amount of people in the zone.   Regularly seeing over 300 on Rodcet Nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've done a /who about 3 times in the bazaar since yesterday.  Locked up 2 out of those 3 times.   The screen just feezes, but I can still here folks walking about, casting spells, etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I love my Frame Rate in the Bazaar, its like 1 Frame per 5 secounds in the middle area LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hehe there's 500 on Veeshan, there's no lag but it's choppy, the wonder of the PC merchant ability of bazaar makes it worth the chop :) made 3300p while I asleep ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well Verrant indicated that Luclin would introduce a way to wake the sleeper.  Now we know exactly what happens when the sleeper awakes, the next player takes his stall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey Coraz. no standing beside me to sell.. that's my stall! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I predict that before long they will be forced to limit this in some way as by doing this I am sure bandwidth usage to their servers will go up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">logged into the bazaar on e'ci and a /who was 370</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I like it so far. <br />
If you just want to bank, there are lots of other banks.  <br />
<br />
Jaggedpine is pretty but kinda dumb for a lvl 60 to be there.  Nothing worth killing.<br />
<br />
I duoed Lodizal last night with a 56 warrior.  I got the lodi belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">427 Peeps when I logged in on SOl RO, and apparently I'd logged in after the busy time.<br />
<br />
Trouble is, I can't see a time when the amount of people there will drop.  INstead of logging off, people will just Trader all day, arg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think a timeout should occur after x hours of PC vendor inactivity, currently its just silly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On AB at the moment (1:30am) there are 325 people in the zone (there was about 450 earlier) and I would estimate that 98% of them are traders afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">420+ today on the nameless.  Did /who a dozen times, never had a problem.<br />
<br />
No reason to put in a timeout for inactive pc's, that's the point of the bazaar, is to sell things while you're not there.  Otherwise it'd be EC with everyone spamming /auction, and a lot less programming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">390 peeps in Karana at 6pm GMT. had to go on &quot;raid&quot; mode (basicaly all that can be set off, clip lane at mini...) to walk from nexus zone to arena zone where there are way less traders.<br />
<br />
and i see a good point to kick off AFK traders after a while.. :) <br />
<br />
won't wait again 45min for the guy to come back from his AFK for a spell already sold few hours ago but still in /bazaar list cuz if i knew that you can only see 30 items out of max 80 items sold.. i didn't knew that the trader list refresh only occures when trader get out of trader mode. <br />
<br />
Hopefully his wife peeked at the puter and advised me. Too bad it was already sold cuz it was a really nice price...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I locked up and had the same problem for 15 minutes, over 400 on Luclin in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I've done a /who in the bazaar 5 or 6 times.  Twice it kicked me back to the desktop.  As far as kicking people who have been idle for a while that pretty much takes the point away.  I sat at the keyboard for an hour while in trade mode with 450 players in the bazaar.  I was in bear form and in a good area in my opinion and had 3 people look.  Unless your selling something that is extremely high in demand it would take 3-4 hours of sitting at your keyboard doing nothing to sell anything.  I'd much rather just sit in ec or hunt while selling in bazaar chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">520+ in bazzar on VEESHAN wooty woot!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">500+ on SolRo around midnight euro time...<br />
<br />
had no problems doing a /who though..</div></div><hr />

518 on Bristlebane Thursday evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Kinda off topic here, but does anyone have the problem of finding an item with the bazaar search, then going to the vendor and not finding it.  Even after refreshing the search list multiple times.  I saw a hammer of spiritcalling for 1k and cried when i could not find it on PC vendor.  I sent tell to ask but of course they are afk.</div></div><hr />

A few things cause this.<br />
<br />
First, the sellers inventory doesn't update by itself. The sellar has to do it manually and if they're AFK, well, doesn't happen :(<br />
<br />
Second, although you can have 80 items for sale only the first 30 show up when you look at their inventory. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping they fix the first soon. I have a feeling the second isn't going to be a priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yep.  As Azzi said.  Drove me nuts last night.  I was &gt;this&lt; close to getting grp regrowth for 100p. :(<br />
<br />
Next time I see this happen, I'm going to try zoning out and back in, see if that forces a refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Oh, the &quot;update traders&quot; button just adds folks that just became traders, and removes the ones who stopped doing so.<br />
<br />
Quick way for you traders to update your inventory is to stop trading and then restart, it refreshes your available inventory list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I had a problem not seeing the item on a &quot;vendor&quot; tht I wanted to buy. Almost picked up Talisman of Epuration for 100p, but could not see it in the guys inventory. The only-see-30-inventory bug is real. Hope they fix it soon. <br />
<br />
Most I have seen in the Bazaar on E'ci was 415. The average is 390's. I got a toon logged in right now while I'm at work. Since I'm afk, I put my loc in my afk message, to help anyone who may be trying to find me ;). Right clicking on the vendors name is great, but nothing beats a solid /loc.</div></div><hr />
