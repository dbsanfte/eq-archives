<br />
<br />
1- Balance of the Nihil = Increased our disease based slow to 60%. (not too bad)<br />
<br />
2- Plague of Daluda = Disease based dot [145hp x 2.1 min] (your jokeing me right, this is even worse then our other disease dot)<br />
<br />
3- Chaotic Pain = our next cannabalize [167hp - 90mana] (ummm , hello this is like a 15 mana difference from our last one...how is this worth it)<br />

SO, who still loves their shaman ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah no offense but this has been posted a week or so. The slow you mention is not disease based but has disease counters as with most slows. The note to see is that balance of the nihli is -resist and quick casting, but long recast.<br />
The disease dot and the new cannabalize I think I would be right in suggesting the shaman community are not very happy with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">look a little closer on balanc of the nihil (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
 Resist: Magic <br />
<br />
/sigh next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whats the line?  Hello and welcome to last week?<br />
<br />
There are at least 3 threads I can think of debating this already..was this thread needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have no problem with this thread being posted. Since there are several active threads discussing the proposed new GoD spells, I'm going to lock this one. Warbear, please feel free to add your thoughts to the other new spell threads!!</div></div><hr />
