<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
I've been playing a druid in WoW for just under 40 levels (and loving it!). I've been to a few of the message boards for druids, and the signal/noise ratio is through the roof. I'm just wondering how many of you play druids in WoW, so I might have a few discussions with the ol' gang ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been playing a druid as an alt, but he's only 18th level.   So far he's been pretty fun and it's nice knowing I can take mobs three to four levels higher than me in bear form.  <br />
<br />
Currently, I'm focusing on feral spec because it helps me solo, but I can see myself respeccing as I start spending more time in instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played a druid in the open beta and have been in live since day 1. I'm currently 46 and I think I do pretty well. Have done things like duoing all but the final area of uldaman with my bro, which I think is pretty decent at our level. <br />
<br />
Druid has a lot of potential, but needs a few fixes like I think most classes could use at this point. For a new game, they did a pretty decent job with the classes though. Cat form was great till 40 ish, but really lags behind when you can do 90% as much dps in dire bear form with 4x the mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">40 Druid here.  31pts in Restoration.<br />
<br />
Haven't been able to mess around with Direbear yet, but looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">about like Darkpaw -<br />
got my Tauren Druid to 46 now (slowed down on levels after a switch to herbs/alchemy).<br />
<br />
I am not big in to the shapeshifting (dire bear is 20+% of my mana bar), but I do enjoy the class.  <br />
<br />
The druid board at WoW is actually one of the better boards - just skip the threads with obvious whines in the titles  8)'  - that is not to say that it has a good signal/noise ratio, just better than most of the rest.<br />
<br />
The macro board and the professions boards are the only one with a positive ratio of signal to noise.  The professions board is degrading, though, as more people reach the high end issues (did I mention I dropped Skinning/Leatherworking?  Yep - I am a whiner, too).<br />
<br />
As a druid, with OOC and NS, I can heal fairly well, but it is already obvious that the higher instances are going to be trouble.  I was overmatched in Maraudon last night, which should not have been a problem - the shaman could have filled in nicely (he is 6 levels higher than me, after all).  Since he liked getting aggro, and didn't watch his mana (and didn't like to sit and drink) we ahd problems and an eventual wipe.  I am low for this instance, and a couple more levels will help a lot - but I have no expectation that I will be able to be sole healer in the Black Rock instances.<br />
<br />
At 46 my dps is just adequate for solo work.  (OOC in Balance, and rest of points in Restoration).  One add is jsut a long fight.  A second add, even if mob 1 is now dead, it is time to run (unless they are at least 4 levels below me).<br />
<br />
I expect to take the druid up to 60 and see how it is going then.  MOTW will be needed, and I will be very good as &quot;a healer&quot; if not as &quot;the healer.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You will be able to heal well in BRD, but will not be able to do it alone most likely. Last time we went we had two shaman and it was not enough, but we weren't 60 yet, we will see. Tough to seperate the pulls unless have alot of CC.<br />
<br />
I will say in pvp, druids can be either an easy kill or a pain in the ass with all the rooting and moonfire and crap. Never seen a druid use forms to fight in pvp, only to get away.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">29th druid here. Having a lot of fun with the class. I'd love to see more clearly defined skill trees and agree that the class still needs a few tweaks but overall it's fun to play.<br />
<br />
Also switching to water form and just swimming around looking for kelp is actually pretty relaxing.</div></div><hr />
