<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just currious, is plane of torment soloable, and if not why?  Also, how does it stack up against the other planes in difficulty...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure but, if you do go, be careful of the birds. The proc a silence that can really ruin your day if you are not careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LorriLou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've tried to solo in Torment only to end up screaming and running to the zone out during the first bird.  Course, I also suck at soloing so...not sure really....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Birds can be done root/rot i believe.  Like the others said, the silence can ruin your day fairly quickly if it happens at a bad time.  You can avoid these by invising past to the bridge type area.  Singles will be pretty much impossible up there - 3 or 4 can happen.  Most do not summon that i have run into and vp3 has held the duration without md.  Turgs sticks without malos most of the time.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that there is really not a lot of room to work with up there.  The other side of the coin is the exp sucks as$ (at 65...can't remember for 61).  Unless you are looking for something specific, I would avoid it.  It is usually empty for a reason.<br />
<br />
It would be pretty tough (not impossible) to handle I think.  Just make sure you get fully buffed up before you head in.<br />
<br />
And finally...there is only one way to really find out!  Go do it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doing the birds solo is pretty easy once you get the hang of it (that little landing up the hill before you start on the bridges).  I had a bug up my butt to finish one of the inane library quests strictly because I had every piece but that bloody tailfeather.  Got bored out of my mind on those birds and never found a reason to go back.  It's fun to march through there with a friend or two just to see the place, but there's no real reason to return once you've done it.  I love the look and feel of the zone, but it's too annoying to hunt there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One you invis past the birds you have two mobs that will come at once plus possibly a wanderer (or two) that are hard to see.  Binding sight on one of the static mobs then switching into third person helps you look for a clear moment to pull.  Beyond this you'll run into spider traps and groups of mobs.  <br />
<br />
Like a lot of lower end PoP, it could use some more exciting drops to make it worth the hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Consider that it is not called the Plane of Torment for no reason.<br />
<br />
If you are the explorer type, by all means, PoT is very unique.<br />
<br />
If you are merely looking for experience or loot, there are other more appropriate locale's to visit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i soloed, with my shaman, to the traps and then killed spiders to get the gate neck item for my pally...<br />
it was pritty easy, but the xp sucked...honestly i raped the stuff i was killing..it wasn't even a challange.  however, i did invis past the birds.<br />
if i remember right some of the mobs proc root?  the music in this zone is the best in the entire game =)</div></div><hr />
