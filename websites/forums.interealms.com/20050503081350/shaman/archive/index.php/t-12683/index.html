<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rumor has it, if one person in a group gets a flag, all get flagged. It's<br />
been debated which trials/quests this works in. Does anyone have<br />
any first hand experience on which ones work for the group and<br />
which only flag one person?</div></div><hr />

CoD bangle works for group.  Only the one who turns stuff in gets the bangle though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The alternate key quest into Torment works with the one turning in getting the actual key and the rest of the group getting the key put on their keyring.<br />
<br />
It also works with the quest to get into BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you sure about BoT?  There is no &quot;key&quot; (in item form) given to you when you complete the BoT quest and other have poted that it did not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would like to add that the key from CoD can be mq'd. We got 18 guildmates done last night, and one grop had a member with 3 pieces and the 4th on another guy.The person who hands in the last larva flesh gets the disease resist clicky bangle, but everyone gets a key on their key ring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can confirm Plane of Tactics (Drunder).  We got the final medal for my buddy last nite, he did the hand-in, and the entire group got the flag.  We zoned in to Tactics a few minutes later.</div></div><hr />
