<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It took me a while, but I went through Magelo and put together the best possible Shaman equipment kit.  I know some of you who've been around EQ since '99 will really appreciate this one.<br />
<br />
(btw, the wisdom is low because Talamay started life with 15 points into stamina instead of wisdom, otherwise it'd be right on the spot).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ditch the shield and get a book</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would, but i got a shield before i got a book way back then :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah im scared</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What's really scarey is that I met a lvl 56 tonight like that.  split paw gloves, ulthork arms, GEB's, BS tunic, paw, CGS, etc.   I was hoping that it was just a new barb illusion spell they'd given druids, but he was in fact a shaman  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is a joke right? Please tell me it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont care when I see druid shamans, who am I to dictate how they play their game and what not...only thing I hate is when I group with shamans who dont know what root does and ones that always call med break and I never see wince message from them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hate you Talamay.. No wait, I &lt;3 you :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nice!<br />
I like what's in bags better :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still say a Paw in the primary hand is not druidish at all - nothing wrong with some ac, wis and agi in that slot for a bargain price.  Pre-epic I used one all the time when grouping/raiding.  It may look a bit druidish - but it is ac/hp shaman in spirit all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">this brings back memories. what he is putting together in that magelo was some of the uberest non-planar gear pre-kunark. back then this gear was awesome. then wis was as important for shaman as hp was. the game has changed alot with the release of kunark for shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Crunchy MacKiter (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146476) &gt; All.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sheesh.<br />
I thought I told Crunchy to get Ulthork Tunic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">man i remember when i was wearing almost that exact same kit. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">haha, I love it. Classic! Funny thing is I wore a lot of that same stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ormak D'Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I still remember when Totemic first came out and this board used to have massive threads by people who went all Wisdom and said Totemic was Junk vs. AC peeps who loved it.<br />
<br />
Gatorscale legs and BS Tunic were standard back then.  GEB's were endgame loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've still got screenshots around somewhere of Bigguss in a BS tunic, gator legs, a Zaharn's coronet (later to be upgraded with a runed circlet and finally a nightshade wreath- woot!) and a staff of the observers.  At least I never got a testament!<br />
<br />
By the way, to be truly old-school you need to remove the paw gloves.  Those came out later, when Paw was revamped (when they first dropped they were going for thousands of pp each, as they the only droppable glove with any Wisdom at the time.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yeah, it was a joke profile :P.  meant to bring back memories of the &quot;wis shaman clown suit&quot; to the oldtimers.  :)<br />
<br />
the 'ueber' profile on there is what a shaman who did dragon/planes raids might wear.  i forgot the tobrin's eyepatch, though.  <br />
<br />
i remember getting a rune etched helm as &quot;booby prize&quot; my first hate trip.  i wound up wearing it anyway for the 2 extra AC, and because it was &quot;planes equipment.&quot;  <br />
<br />
the stuff in the bags is leftover from what my profile has by default :P.</div></div><hr />
