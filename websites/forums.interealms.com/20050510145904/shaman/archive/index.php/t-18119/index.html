<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">O.K.. I have searched extensively in an attempt to reduce possible /flame for posting.  :p  I was curious if anyone has some good raid info for a guild with about 15-20 low 50's toons.  I am currently unable to play the game, so my information comes straight from these boards, and not much else.  :(  Anyhow, If you need more specifics, ie-class, lvl, # of each, I will be glad to post it.  We are trying to groom our next &quot;wave&quot; of troopers so when they get to a higher level we can actually get our guild moving on the whole guild progression path to the coveted EP's.  Yeah, it's a long road, and we are a long way off, but hey, every guild has to start sometime, right?  I don't forsee me stopping my EQ habbit, so I may as well try to get somewhere in the game!  Anyhow, like I said, I cannot actually log into the game right now to scout zones/mobs for myself, as I am geographically seperated from my processor (hates Iraq), so any inputs you can provide would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're probably capable of doing Kael arena for Thurgadin quest armor.  HoT is out of your league for now, but that's next on the progression ladder once you're all in the 57-60 range with decent class balance.<br />
<br />
If you can get people keyed for Howling Stones, that's always a fun zone.  VS and Trakanon are still too high though.<br />
<br />
Hell, if most people are 52 or less, go do Nagafen and Vox.  They're always a good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, dragons are allways a good place to start, excellent for raiding skills.<br />
<br />
Something people forget from time to time is guild vault, get a guild vault running, motivate people to specialise in trade skills, organise raids around these trade skills and the quests associated with them.<br />
<br />
This should result in good income as your guild sells both the product from tradeskilling, cash loot from these raids and maybe even some of the quest items once people in your guild non longer need them.<br />
<br />
Now you have some money in gthe guild vault you can start buying guild members spells as cashflow allows.<br />
<br />
Obviously you need to manage this whole process well but thats what running a guild is about.<br />
<br />
Also, I assume you do no tall have your epics. Epic raids are great too.<br />
<br />
Aside from those two ideas there is the typical hack - slash uber loot raid of course, like the above poster suggests, you are two low collectively for VS or Trak or the like but they should be targets that once bested you use as a gauge of your progress.<br />
<br />
There are several 'progression ladders' about that you can use also, one good one I saw once was on the Silent Redemption website (a Brell guild) ... it was a timeline of what they killed and when (first times) and is the kind of guide you need.<br />
<br />
I think I may even have one on my guild website, but I'll have to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kael --&gt; ToV --&gt; NToV/ST --&gt; Ssra --&gt; VT/PoP --&gt; Elem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good stuff above.<br />
You'll have plenty of cause to swing by some of the old (not PoP) planes while working on those epics, which can also provide some halfway decent armor - about on scale with thurg, for the most part, and you don't need faction or gems.  Don't overlook tradeskills, either.  One or two high-end tradeskillers can re-outfit half a guild in tae ew alone (might not be quite there, yet) -- which (at least for shamans) is better or on par with the armor you'd be getting in HoT.<br />
<br />
I think more important than WHAT you kill at this point is going to be HOW you organize it.  The most important thing is to keep people moving, killing, and progressing.  For that you need scouts, transportation, and discipline.  Finding a target isn't as important as being able to get to it before someone else.  And neither of those mean anything if your people don't show up on time, or get lost, can't find their way, get killed en route...<br />
<br />
Happily for you, these are things you can work on without being in game.  Make sure that your officers, at least, have updated in-game maps.  Delegate - and make sure that no one person is responsible for scouting, and transportation, etc.<br />
<br />
And for the love of god, have a well-outlined and strict loot policy going in, or fights over it will tear your guild apart.<br />
<br />
Hrm, also - if you can convince your guildmates to avoid exp grinding in the planes, get them to places like Sebilis crypt where they can be adding spells to the guild bank.  If you're using DKP you can offer them in return for quality guildbank submissions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Epics are a fun way to learn raiding. You face a wide variety of mobs and even if the rewards are a bit lame compared to todays loot, its nevertheless great to aquire ones epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, great information above. Souls of the Arcane (Karana) is a guild of roughly 100-150 members, and we've got just 43 over 60. The bulk of our membership is mid-to-late 50s, and there is absolutely nothing more rewarding than taking them on repeated trips to Kael. Why? First couple of times was a nightmare, as hardly any of them have extensive raiding resumes (so to speak). But the last couple of times, it's been smooth as silk. Great to watch them learn their roles and get comfortable, and even better to watch them adapt when their crazy officers (ie. me, heh heh) pull the rug out from under them and switch their roles around mid-raid. We've raided Old Sebilis ... did awful the first time, better the second, and the third time was amazing to watch. We've had a ball in Old Sebilis, and it's really great to see a guildie's reaction when they get chosen to mem that spell drop. Three-four group raids work great in Plane of Hate, they enjoyed that immensely, and you can always take a small raid and head to City of Mist for some fun killing Reavers and such. Epic raids are great ... SOTA loves a good brawl with Ixiblat Fer, and VSR was fun, too. I believe Ixiblat hit the ground dead in 42 seconds on our last attempt, and you should've seen Guild Hall when he died ... pure chaos and excitement.<br />
<br />
LaughingWoman is absolutely correct ... HOW you kill is honestly more important than WHAT you kill. If your GL hasn't made it clear to the guild what his/her goals are and where they'd like the guild to go, do it. Our Council of Souls (officer's corps) is in the midst of that right now. We've got an ambitious bunch, and they're just dying to get PoP flags. Aim for nothing, and you'll hit nothing. We might fail miserably trying to get them flagged, but one thing about my guildies ... they act like they're built outta Rubbermaid. They can take a beating and come back for more, simply because trying is so much fun. The most important thing I can tell you ... organization on the part of your officers will help ... if your leadership is organized and can work together, that kind of thing filters down to the guild members, and your raids will be clockwork. Trust me there, I've seen it happen. <br />
<br />
Light above, if you get nothing else out of this thread, please, please, please heed what LaughingWoman said about a guild loot policy. Ours can be found in the policies section of our site http://www.soulsofthearcane.net/policies3.htm.You're welcome to go look and read.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hello all!  Thank you so much for the outstanding inputs!  I am the GL for our guild, but as per my above post, unable to play at the moment.  I have assigned GL responsibilities to a very good person whom I know in RL.  Our guild is currently sitting at around 140 people, with a nightly core group of 20-30 folks.  There are stragelers that pop into the game every few nights, but the core group will be on there like clockwork.  Currently, we have a handful of folks 60-65, but with a majority of folks within the 50-59 levels.  Most of us that have been in the guild for a bit have a pretty good background with raiding, but none of us have really had to put the effort into getting them set up or structured.  Every raid I have been on to date has been from an invite from other guilds.  I guess what was daunting about it for me was because every raid we did had at least a couple of groups of lvl 65's, and was by no means easy.  The last raid I attended was for my childs tear.  I had no idea that my freinds guild was even doing the raid.  I was in POK buffing passer-by's at the bank and chatting with friends when I got the call.  There were 2 people non-65 level.  Me being the second lowest at lvl 59.  This is typically how the raids I have been on go.  This is why I have reservations with setting up raids on area's for lower 50's level players.  I am fairly new to the game, only been playing since march or so.  We do have players in the guild who have been here since day 1, and we heavily rely on them for info too.  I am kinda curious about a couple of things posted though.  Mainly about Seb and CoM.  Are we after a particular target in Seb, or should we plan on just raiding the zone(minus Lord Trak), and in CoM, can reaver's be taken down with several groups of mid-50's players?  I have done reaver's before, but again, we had many lvl 65 player's who had raided them countless times.  I am excited about the prospect of learning how to raid mobs/zones as a guild though, rather than relying on the guild's &quot;old faithfull's&quot; who seem to know the in and outs of every raid mob.  The core group of folks we have are all really fired up about starting our guild's progression.  So we (guild leadership) decided now is a good time to strike, while the iron is hot.  I cannot speak for most of my guildmates for status on gear, but I don't think I am doing too bad for my level.  Key word is &quot;think&quot;. :D I would love to get my stuff on magelo, but I cannot even get to the site from where I am at. (thank you websense for screwing us, yet again).  I cannot remember most of my stuff, but I know I got a tae ew bp/shield, furry boots, shissar scale gauntlets, earring of the solstice, valorium ring of gallantry, and drawing a blank on the rest.  I will get my wife to email it to me and post it sometime.  I know my HP unbuffed is somewhere near 2K.  Maybe around 2100 or so, not real sure. Again, will have her email it to me, and I will post it.  My guildmates, for the most part, are geared somewhat similar for their respective level's and classes.  When I was playing (2 months ago), everyone that had spells, had every spell up to their current level that they desired, and our guild bank still has a stash of upper level spells from parchments, etc.  We are by no means uber, but at the same time, we aren't on the bottom 50% of guild's with respect to gear/abilities/game enjoyment.  We are all pretty laid back, and just enjoy playing.  We only have a couple of real power gamers, which is what I hear is neccessary to have for a good raid guild.  That is kinda disheartening to hear, IMO.  Many of my guild members share the same employer as I do, and we do not have the ability to camp a mob on a one week timer to beat out another guild to get to it, but I still think we can get the job done.  Again, I REALLY appreciate the outstanding feedback I have gotten from this post, and I will definitely keep you posted with what/who we take out as a guild!  Thanks again!<br />

<br />
Hell, SOTA cleaned Sebilis. The second time we went, we started at the entrance and worked our way through 4R to the Emporer and took him out just for the hell of it. We had 6 groups, so it was MAJOR overkill for the zone, but we ended up with a couple thousand plat and 15 spell drops for guild bank. They were thrilled. The third time, we experimented with a good swim to the lower level, and sat not too far in pulling shrooms and such. Didn't make as much money on that raid, but we got 10 more spell drops and a lot got to see a part of the zone few of us had seen at that point, and information like that is just as important a raid goal as guild bank stuff, IMO.<br />
<br />
Reavers in COM ... oh aye, they can be taken out. We had 5 groups for that raid (five of us were 60+), and the bridge to the castle was carpeted with Reaver corpses. Just keep in mind they're 100% magic immune now, and you're gonna need tanks and healers who are on their toes.<br />
<br />
For both Old Sebilis and COM, you're gonna want a Rogue with a high picklock skill. In Sebilis, 4R is behind locked doors, as are the Reavers in COM.<br />
<br />

<br />
If that's the case you're not doin' too awful shabby, IMO. I've got the same stuff, basically (save for the Tae Ew shield, I have a Tactician's Bulwark and a Shield of Bane Warding I like to switch back and forth between), and am working on the Earring of Solstice quest.<br />
<br />
IMO, you do NOT need power gamers to have a good raid guild. What you need are people who can listen, follow directions, and who are willing to step up to the plate and fill a role they may not be entirely comfortable with. You can lead a bunch of people like that anywhere and kill nearly anything within reason. Believe me there, I've done it. My guild is more of a family than a serious raid-guild, but we know where we're headed and our leadership has a good ideas on how to get us there which means ... in SOTA-language ... we're going. Period. *grin*<br />
<br />
Justice favor your guild's blades. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">in CoM, can reaver's be taken down with several groups of mid-50's players?  I have done reaver's before, but again, we had many lvl 65 player's who had raided them countless times.<br />
<br />
We recently did CoM reavers for a guildie.  Didn't have a rogue, so took the back way in, but could only get to the Ghiosk reaver.  Anyhow, while we were waiting for the rest of the people to show up, our group decided to give it a try.  We killed the reaver (I think 2 additional reavers popped) + ghiosk with our 6.  We were 58 monk (me), 61 shaman (me, no torpor, only CH), 62 ranger, 65 mage, 65 necro, 55 ranger.  My shaman was a little low on mana near the end of the fight, but we really didn't have any trouble with the ranger tanking.  None of us are geared with much beyond bazaar gear.  Our guild -used- to be HoT capable, but a lot of folks left (can check my magelo below to get an idea of our equipment level).  We were probably capable of Velketor, though NToV was most likely out of our league.<br />
<br />
One thing to note: the reavers are immune to slow, not just to magic.  I got the message when I tried to use Cloud of Grummus.  They hit in the high 100s (think about 190 max), but at a decent rate.  I would think 2 groups of mid-50s wouldn't have too much trouble if you have a couple clerics.  The blind proc is kind of disorienting though.<br />
<br />
Are we after a particular target in Seb, or should we plan on just raiding the zone<br />
<br />
Tordail has good suggestions here.  <br />
<br />
I'd also toss out trying deeper, like the sewers and maybe get back towards the reets and juggs.  If you can get down there when Trak isn't spawned, the Protector and Tolapumj are nice nameds to try.  Decent loot + lvl 60 spell drops (read: torpor/malo for shamans).<br />
<br />
We only have a couple of real power gamers, which is what I hear is neccessary to have for a good raid guild. That is kinda disheartening to hear, IMO. Many of my guild members share the same employer as I do, and we do not have the ability to camp a mob on a one week timer to beat out another guild to get to it, but I still think we can get the job done.<br />
<br />
Power-gaming isn't the amount of time you play, it's what you do with the time.  If you all are seriously interested in raiding, you're getting close to being a power-gaming guild, you just have limited play time :)  'Power-gamer' typically connotes people with minimal social (and typing) skills who will KS/Train or do anything they can to get what they want.  In my experience, that's not a 'power-gamer' that's a 'griefer'.  I'd think of power-gamers as ambitious and willing to push their limits.  I know high-end guilds that have classy people and I know high-end guilds filled with scum.  It's a drive to excel in the game, not the amount of play time.  <br />
<br />
i would say you need power-gamers for serious raiding.  they're the ones who have the drive to get them planned, researched and organized, not because they're on all the time.  just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One important suggestion for the beginning of a raid guild:  Try to find a dedicated main tank or two, and start equipping them.  Most Velios and early Luclin fights are straight forward CH the MT fights, and the more HP and better aggro weapon the easier these fights get.  An ogre in the full human RZ cultural set with a copper hammer of striking is probably a good (and cheap to get) start.  <br />
After you got the basic working of pulling and complete heal chains down, you start farming Vindi for the BPs, working your way up to the statue.<br />
You then start looking at the first brood dragons, Zlandi and Klandi being the easiest.  This introduces you to AoE fights where you have to split your healing between MT and the rest of your raid.  Those techniques will last you a long time, until you get to the &quot;tricky&quot; Luclin mobs, IV, THO etc that have special abilities you have to learn to deal with.<br />
My tip on beginner raiding - make sure you announce raids well in advance - but don't ask.  If you ask &quot;when&quot;, you won't raid, ever, there is always someone who can't make it.  Schedule regular raids, maybe on a 4 or 5 day rotation so that you don't exclude someone who always works the &quot;raid day&quot;.<br />
Also, make clear from the beginning what the loot rules are.  If you anticipate a limited participation of your guildmembers (30 hardcore vs. 150 members) I suggest against full random, nothing upsets your hardcore raiders more then a &quot;visitor&quot; walking off with that prime loot on a lucky role to never be seen again.  And it will be your hardcore raiders that provide the progress for the guild as a whole.  DKP, random for the top x in your merit list, straight officer award, there are tons of models our there.<br />
Good luck on your journey, it can be a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am also a guild leader and it sounds like we are in similar types of guilds, though mine is much smaller, being only about 50 mains.  A lot of the advice above is good advice, it would probably do well to listen to it.  Just to give you an idea of where my guild started, what we did, and where we are now:  we started raiding in our low 40s, pre-revamp droga at the time was perfect for that.  It wasn't so much that we were looking for loot, it was the beginning of teaching our members what to do and what their responsibilies are.  We did CoM and Lord Ghiosk with two groups of high 40s, this was also before the revamp, so not sure if getting in there would be quite so easy as it used to be, but the reavers are still the same.  Low 50s we started doing Kael arena with 2 groups, its tough in there at that level, but the feeling of excitement and imminent danger are awesome!!!  Mid 50s we still were back in Kael, but what we did that no one else has mentioned is we started farming Umbral Plains a little.  The plate drops off of the Moktors at the zoneline there are roughly equivalent to what you'll find in Kael, and if you're lucky you'll find the Raldukan or other named mobs up which all drop decent loot for that level.  The other classes armor in there isn't half bad either.  When you get to high 50s in UP you can start to farm Fire/Ice, both of which drop the bracelets that everyone loves so much, and some ok weapons and staffs for casters.  This is doable with 2 groups of high 50s, one even if you have a good slower and cleric.  When you get to high 50s its possible to move into HoT if you think you have a large enough raid force.  We've now moved into HoT with about 2 groups of us, average lvl 60, and thats where we are now.  We're now gearing up to make our first attempts at Vindi.  We still go back to Kael whenever we get new members, its the perfect zone to learn raid tactics that you'll use forever.  HoT is also good as you'll learn to deal with AE mobs.  <br />
<br />
So many people nowadays want to skip these Velious raid zones, they see the so called uberness of the EP and want to get there asap, I don't think they realize the immense value in learning raid tactics that your classic &quot;velious progression&quot; gives you.  I'd recommend getting started doing that type of thing, sprinkle some of the PoP mobs into it where you can and you're able, and eventually (I hope my guild does :) ) you'll get there.  I think the important thing is to set yourself up to be successful when you finally do get there, not just to rush into it as fast as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another good raid target for you are the 'farmable zones' ie Veksar and Droga.<br />
<br />
While you do not need raid forces to do these zones they are/would be good training grounds with the added bonus of some very nice upgrades for everyone.<br />
<br />
Haste belts, nice shaman range items, leather wearing boots, great aggro 1h'ers and places like Droga have triggered quest events that small raid forces like yours would excel in resulting in very very nice items for your levels.</div></div><hr />
