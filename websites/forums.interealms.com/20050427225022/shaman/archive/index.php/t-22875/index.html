<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know i know grouping there is fastest exp blah blah :)<br />
my first char got 60 thru dungeon crawls in sebilis and HS. my second char got 65 in endless hours of pov, pot grinding and i find it VERY boring. i rather prefer hunting in non pop zones just because of the fact im sick of pop and think its too easy.<br />
graveyards took all the excitement of a nasty CR out of the game. <br />
Dying in pop? who cares, rezzers are arround and we have a GY. Dying in Sebilis or the hole is a total different story.<br />
<br />
Any1 has some suggestions? Sebilis and HS are my first option, but maybe im forgetting something here, i never hunted in luclin. are there zones for 50 to 60? Indoor or outdoor doesnt matter. Oh yes, i hate ssrae ;) too long camping for a silly emp key :D</div></div><hr />
