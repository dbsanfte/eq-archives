<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya, <br />
<br />
  Just had time for a quick 30 minute check of the new ship zone. Shaman Spell vendor is marked on the ingame map but doesn't seem to be around, none of the other classes reported seeing their's either. <br />
<br />
The ship/city is surrounded by a forcefield which appears solid down to the bottom of the sea, circling it didn't show any way out. Anyone know how to get to the next zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are shuttle boats that take you to/from that big boat/zone.  You have to get down to the docks near the rear of the boat and catch one of them to get to the Shores of Natimbi or Nedaria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't had a chance to get back ingame yet but are you talking about that same dock where the boat from Nedaria's Landing (sp?) comes in at?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, same dock... same boat, even.  If you stay on the one that comes from nedaria, it pauses a moment, then heads to Natimbi, and the same in reverse.  If I'm remembering correctly, you want to get on one heading towards the front of the boat to get to Natimbi, and one heading towards the back to get to Nedaria.  Doesn't matter too much if you go back to Nedaria though, since you can talk to the Magus there and port to Natimbi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i am under the impression that there is no spell vendor, there is one to hand in a pop type drop and the rest drop of mobs..</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I know is that there's one marked on the map in the new city zone, shrug. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info Kamidari, we made it as far as the temple zone tonight. Rough spot! Trains to zone with mobs hitting for over 1000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alchemy vendor is in the boat, on the inside. <br />
There's a door towards the front of the boat that leads to the bowels of the ship with bankers and many more vendors.</div></div><hr />
