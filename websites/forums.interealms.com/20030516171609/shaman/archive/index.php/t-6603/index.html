<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya!<br />
<br />
I'm a 60 shaman, raid 2-3 times a week *including HoT* and duo frequently with a 59 almost 60 monk. I already have Torpor and a JBB. I rarely buy anything (except spells :/) most have been from raids or questing.<br />
<br />
Now, I've accumulated almost 50k in game what does anyone recommend I get with it? (Trying to share the money with hubby the monk ;) )<br />
<br />
I was thinking perhaps Pox or Malo, and a guild shaman recommended I get Malo. At most raids we have 2 Maloing shamans, and I'm still hoping it drops doing Juggs, Crypt etc. Past experience has been whenever I buy something pricey it drops or someone buys it for an amazingly low price. :rolleyes: The only use I could see using Malo outside raid situations is trying to duo big mobs ie: WW dragons and Guardian wurms ;) -- that's why I'd lean towards Pox is because it'd add to dps in a duoing situation. Someone tell me otherwise pros/cons etc of pox or malo :)<br />
 <br />
Armor upgrades aren't really out of the question either. My magelo is linked below, but if not Here it is: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=215255 <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malo over pox, malo is always mana spent well, it cannot be resisted, only overwritten by malosini, pox will need insidious decay memmed as well to make the most of it. It is, in my experience, a highly resisted dot.<br />
<br />
Going on your profile I'd look to upgrade shoulders and range as a priority followed by neck and shield. <br />
<br />
Dragonwing mantles are nice, sarnak prayer beads or similar with HP for range. Get a shield with HP on it, Bone Braced Buckler, Orb of the Infinate Void. Same with neck, if you're going to be getting cann5 you need the HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buy Malo, do a couple of practice runs on Yeldema with your monk partner, get yourself (and the monk probably) a Yeldema talisman in the process, its a nice upgrade over an ivory collar.  <br />
<br />
Learn the ww pathing and safe spots, then go kill Bratavar a few times for a dragonwing mantle, I spent about a weeks worth of ganking her nightly until I got my first decent mantle (Heavy, 14ish ac, 45hps/mana) and Matchless/Peerless can drop of Bratavar also, well worth the effort, just make sure you keep your CoV faction good, killing ww dragons whilst Kos is a LOT harder.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, same suggestions as Dith really, replace that Jasper ring with a 6/65 though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Guess I should've added, and forgot.<br />
<br />
Was hoping to get Talisman of Benevolence for range...just a matter of finding scout up and people around :)<br />
<br />
Will switch the ring out, sometimes have it, sometimes don't...just depending on the situation. More often than not I'm not wearing the 6/65 ring.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions so far!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree. Buy Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Malo =).  It's one of those spells that you wish you had for those certain situations.  If you don't have it, you kick yourself for not having it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't know about other servers, but Malo is still running between 20 and 25K on BB. I would definitely pick that up first, then go for some more of the gear that's previously mentioned.<br />
<br />
Jormal Dawnhammer<br />
Oracle of Winter<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lionheart3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you said the monk is your hubby ? if so you also might consider if getting the monk something over the shaman may end up helping you more, perhaps a tranquil staff? fungi? i mention those 2 items because i also run a monk/shaman duo (the fungi i trade back and forth depending on situation) but the t staff has helped tremendously for the dou, the massive taunt easily gets mobs off the shamana and on the monk where they need to be. yes the shaman can take hits , its just much more efficient if the monk takes most of them.<br />
get rid of that jasper ring, hell destroy it!<br />
range item .. go to maidens kill those 4 armd mobs by akheva entrance until you get a stone idol 5 ac 8 wis 15 save to magic if i remember right. a 20 ac belt also droips that the monk may or may not want (not shaman euipable)<br />
shoulders .. imbued granite spaulders, 20 ac 10 to all saves<br />
legs:  jaundiced bone legs maybe<br />
gloves:  crystal chitin gloves<br />
neck: kill xi vius type mobs in maidens and get a shrouded medallion 12 ac and i think 15 save to magic , tho this is probably something youd only use part time<br />
better neck item youd wear most times tho is crystalline torque 10 or 12 ac and the focus 3 effect that saves 10% mana on all spell types</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye monk posted a similiar thread on MOnkly buziness<br />

Monk's gear:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In case you aren't convinced yet, I also suggest you buy Malo.  You will use it more than you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KittensDaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Buy the MQ of the pipes for your husbands epic.. runs about 25k our our server (luclin).<br />
<br />
Monk needs a few upgrads that I can spot..<br />
<br />
-- The 19ac 9sta 30 hp boots for starters<br />
-- His Epic<br />
-- Barbed Dragon Scale pauldrons, nice shoulder items for a monk.   (5-7k on luclin)<br />
<br />
I know, shaman board, but hell I play both classes (monk is <br />
<br />
on luclin server as is my shaman).<br />
<br />
Good luck on getting Malo, usually see maybe 1 copy out in the bazaar on the weekends and it runs pretty high.<br />
If you really want to improve your duo, focus on the monk in my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Please move this post to the Equipment Section.<br />
<br />
Save your money until PoP comes out. Never know what will drop in the expansion. Aside from that buy malo. Stats and such is all well and good, but if by some freak the other shaman either have to go to work or die to some horrible mishap and everybody turns to you and say &quot;malo that mob Julean&quot;, what are you going to say?<br />
<br />
Other upgrades like gantru charm etc you can hunt down yourself or buy cheaply in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You need Malo.  You're a half-assed shaman without it.  You're a gimp without Malo.  If you don't have Malo, you are only half as useful as if you do have Malo.  <br />
There is no substitute for Malo.  <br />
I hope I stressed it enuf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After you get Malo, if you have cash left over for gear:<br />
<br />
Artificer's Ringmail Leggings - can be made by a Barbarian Master Smith<br />
<br />
Obulus Death Shroud, or Dragonwing Mantle.<br />
<br />
~Bax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Unfortunatley, malo goes for 60k on Rodcet Nife, and 100k for Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd get malo, and then buy chain legs MQ for ss (hard to find) or thurg (not quite as good but the best thurg piece compared to the others).  On my server, when its occasionally posted on out board, the thurg chain legs mq is about 6-8k.  I bought mine for 10k quite a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If were talking spells, then enough people have already beat it into you by now...Malo, then Torpor, then anything else you don't have (Pox, Avatar, etc), but I get the feeling your leaning towards items as well.....I can't believe this hasn't come up already....buy a horse.<br />
Simple, effective, lots of bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18"># 1 for monk.... buy his epic.<br />
#2 Don't get those dragonsczale paulds... they suck a$$. I'm not sure what to get... I know Chokidai Hide Pauldrons are good but he's probably not above the AC cap so the AC is low on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for all the wonderful suggestions. I did get more HP items and it has helped with can5 *which I just got*.<br />
<br />
Pox and Malo dropped the same night from Talendor and Gore respectively. I was awarded Pox, and no one else needed Malo from the Gore raid so was awarded that the next day. *no shamans were there*<br />
<br />
Guess it's off to upgrade the monk!</div></div><hr />
