<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just out of curiousity, Does anyone know what the approximate ZEM is for an LDoN dungeon?  Im interested in knowing if this is a viable method to level effeciently, especially if the downtown between missions in extremely short.  Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no idea of the ZEM, but I can tell you for certain that my 63 cleric makes more xp in CoD than in normal-level dungeons, and we kill at about the same rate. So I'd say personally that if all you're after is the xp then it's going to be at roughly tier1 PoP level (ie, compare that to where you'd fight if you weren't in LDoN and if it's tier2 or above then it's probably not worth it for you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think anyone knows the exact ZEM number, but I get about .5% of an AA per kill from a full group in normal mode.  This is well below even pov.  I know lots of people that have done their 60's in LDoN, but it is only really worthwhile because you are getting adventure points at the same time as you're getting exp.  It is definately viable, but it isn't nearly as fast as pov/bot.  One of the biggest limiting factors is that between adventures, you've typically got at least a 10 minute downtime of rebuffing, getting new people, people taking afks, etc... If you're in a great group and you tear through an adventure in 25 minutes, you have to wait 20 minutes to get another one (can only do one ever 45 minutes).  That really kills any possible exp rate.  Typically, I ding every other adventure, sometimes it takes three if I started with practically no exp in to the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah that is my experience Jin, about 30% an adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Typically 35 - 45% per adventure, depending on type and zone (kill a boss at the very edge of a huge zone, or a collect 25 where you kill 40 mobs to get 'em).  Typically it's about 40%, so 2.5 adventures per AA.  Figure at best 50 minutes per adventure ... well, you can do an aa in about 50 minutes in Tactics.  Well worth it since you want adventure points anyways, and you don't get as bored like pulling the tactics pit after 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />
