I finally got a job and scrounged up $250.  I want an electric guitar, and need an amp too.  Some of my friends at school gave me some magazines but there are a TON of guitars and I don't know where to start!  I don't know what qualities are essential, which help, and which are just cool.  I would really like to get one now, since my friends say I can get a decent package with what I have.  If you know some kit or something that is a little more, but well worth it, you might as well just list it down too.  oh, and tell me why it's good...  <br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is kinda like asking somebody what kind of car is best to get. Somebody can give you a lot of reasons why to get a certain kind, but when it comes down to it, its a matter of personal preference. I personally have never liked Fender Strats, but that doesn't mean they're bad guitars.<br />
<br />
A couple of things though:<br />
<br />
1) Try not to get something with single-coil pick-ups. It probably won't sound as full.<br />
2) I personally like a Floyd Rose bridge as it gives more versatility than a standard bridge (ie whammy bar). They're a pain in the butt to tune up when you put new strings on, but they work well after that.<br />
3) Pick a guitar with a body style that is easy to play while sitting down. I bought a V guitar (not a flying V, there's a difference) back in the day and loved it a lot. Problem was I had to stand up to play it or put the inside of the V on my thigh which was kinda akward.<br />
4) Look into your favorite guitarists choices. See if you can find interviews with them. Common questions are questions on equipment and why they chose what they did. If you're going for a certain sound, this will give you a lead on attaining it.<br />
<br />
That said, my personal choice, with $250 would be to get a low end Gibson or an Ibanez. If the whole $250 is going to the guitar (I'm assuming you already have an amp) you can get a fairly sweet Ibanez. Gibsons run you a bit more, but they're tried, true, and wonderful.<br />
<br />
As a few examples, I'll list a Brands and a couple guitarists that play them. These are mostly older artists since I dont' feel newer artists show sufficient mastery of their instrument to manufacture any kind of personal sound or style. Just my opinion though.<br />
<br />
Fender<br />
Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix<br />
<br />
Gibson/Les Paul<br />
Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), Slash (Guns N Roses)<br />
<br />
Ibanez<br />
Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, John Petrucci (Dream Theater)<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget to check the used market. $250 could you get you a smokin deal on a great used guitar. Just get a 2nd opinion when you look at it.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your decision</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arroe</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cool, thanks for the info screeling.  i would need an amp though,  i have nothing atm.  I have seen some of those start-up kits in magazines, infact, i saw a cool ibanez one for my price range.  are those kits any good or would i be better off buying the stuff seperate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, take this as a bit of a contrarian opinion.<br />
<br />
I've been a strat guy for about a decade now.  Recently my tele has been getting more play time, but I still own two strats.  It depends upon what you like and what music you like to play.  I'm not much for metal, so I really can't stand Floyd Roses, and I'm not fond of humbuckers.  Most of my guitars have single coil pickups, and I like the definition you get.<br />
<br />
However, none of that really matters right at this minute.  The important thing is getting you a decently made guitar that plays well, stays in tune and (don't underestimate the importance) that you like the look of.  You want a quality instrument that will stick with you for a while, but it's got to be something that makes you want to pick it up and play.<br />
<br />
If I were putting together a $250 starter kit for a beginner, I believe I would spend as much of that money as possible on a guitar, and find a little used Peavey solid state amp in a pawn shop for $50 or so.  The Peaveys won't convince anyone that you're playing through a Marshall stack, but they're dependable, pretty bulletproof, commonly available, and cheap.<br />
<br />
For a guitar, the best ones I've seen lately for cheap have been Yamaha Pacificas.  Solid wood bodies (important), decent necks and fretwork.   <br />
<br />
Yamaha Pacifica 012 (http://www.yamaha.com/cgi-win/webcgi.exe/DsplyModel/?gEGU00004PAC012) <br />
<br />
I'd also look hard at Fender's Squire line, they've gotten quite a bit better in recent years.<br />
<br />
Squier Standard Fat Strat (http://www.squierguitars.com/gear/gear.php?partno=0321700) <br />
<br />
If you have a friend that plays, bring that friend with to the stores.  Have them check out whatever you're looking at to make sure it plays well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the whole, I agree with you Aelitan. I guess I kinda forget that Floyd Rose bridges don't really jive with blues/jazz. As far as the whole amp thing though, sometimes you can get around it if you plug into your stereo and play through head-phones. Of course this isn't too impressive for other people to hear that you just learned how to play Stairway to Heaven. (joking bout the Stairway part.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oatasgai Alenxia</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a Fender Squire about 2 years ago and I have a hell of a time keeping it in tune.  I was on about the same budget as you when I was shopping, but my options were limited since I was looking for a left-handed model and wanted to buy locally.  For about $250 I was able to get it, the usual accessories (stand, strap, travel bag, etc) and a practice amp (don't get the cheapest amp you can, seriously).  The squire has held up pretty well, aside from the tuning issue I have (may or not be common, I dunno) I have no real complaints.</div></div><hr />

They have sales all the time and Guitar Center is their storefront for the website. I would suggest going to music stores and finding what suits your fancy. Simply going on suggestion may find you unsatisified with the sound that you end up with.<br />
<br />
Being a musician myself (drummer of 12 years) I've been through it before ;). One persons perfect sound, is another persons trash.</div></div><hr />

I'd recommend going around to music shops and piddling with their guitars.  Once you find the exact one you want I would order it from a magazine.  It's generally cheaper.<br />

Either a Strat or a Tele.  I'd recommend getting a cheap amp for now.  When you get better--and your ear more finely tuned--you can go out and find an amp that sounds the way you want it.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't put too much effort into finding a guitar/amp that sounds good to your ear--your ear isn't trained enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the record, I use MF frequently, but only up to a point.  I'll buy strings, picks, and other general accessories from them.  For guitars and amps, I need to play them first, unless I get a very substantial return time.<br />
<br />
But then again, most of the guitars and amps I'm into haven't been made for years, so the majority of the catalog is worthless to me.  It's fun to look, though.<br />
<br />
For Oatasgai, I have a couple suggestions.  Not knowing much about the situation, I'll just give you my standard &quot;keep it in tune&quot; advice.  For guitars with trems, it's especially important, but I do it to all my guitars.  <br />
<br />
Lubricate all points of the guitar that will contact the string other than the tuners.  At Radio Shack, you can buy some liquid Teflon in a syringe-type tube - that's GREAT stuff for this.  Put a drop in each slot of the nut, and a drop on each saddle at the contact point.  This will really help keep the strings from binding.  If you can't find this stuff, use a little graphite (pencil lead) or even a small amount of Vaseline.  Just something to keep it slippery.<br />

I have the exact same guitar sitting on your futon :) Well, design looks the same.. which one is it? Mine is a Squier Stratocaster that I love.<br />
<br />
Also, for those looking to get into an electric for the first time, you may want to pick up a guitar effects module. I got a Zoom 505II that comes with about 30 different effects and then you can tweak those to your hearts content :)<br />
<br />
As far as my setup, I got the Squier, a little Fender amp and the module for 400.. so without the module you're looking at 300 bucks.</div></div><hr />

My back used to hurt constantly until we started sleeping on the futon.  And now it's higher off the floor, so you don't have as far to drop when you're getting ready for bed.  :)<br />
<br />
Sunmoon, you're going to be really, really sorry you asked.  The guitar you asked about (shown again here (http://home.cfl.rr.com/amathews/Emery.jpg) ) is a very special guitar to me.  Ready for a long story?<br />
<br />
In 1989, I first really listened to blues music, brought in by SRV (who wasn't?).  At the time, I had an Ibanez RG-550 and a Kramer.  I bought a japanese Strat, and started learning this new language.  The strat was good, but not anything spectacular.  One of my good friends, JP Emery, owned a guitar shop in northern MN called Resound Musical Instruments.  Fantastic shop.  Emma was a few years older than my group of friends, which was cool.  Every day after school we all showed up and played for hours.  <br />
<br />
One day (in 1990) while home from college with my girlfriend, I brought her to meet the guys at Emma's.  On the way into the store, I noticed this sunburst strat in the window.  I asked Emma what year it was, and he said &quot;Brand new, I just made it&quot;.  Turns out he had copied a '62 strat neck he had in the shop, and made the whole guitar from scratch.  He shot the nitro finish in his basement.  I asked him if I could play it (first mistake) and plugged it into an old Fender brownface Deluxe (second mistake).<br />
<br />
About an hour later, I realized I was still playing, Emma was still grinning, and my girlfriend was still standing next to me (third mistake).  The next day, she asked me to drive her halfway home to meet her brother, as she never wanted to speak to me again.  I dropped her off with her brother, stopped at home and loaded up the car.  I drove to Emma's with the Ibanez, the Kramer, an old Music Man amp I didn't use and said &quot;How much more.&quot;  I traded almost everything I owned musically for that one guitar.<br />
<br />
I played the hell out of that guitar for the next 5 years.  I wore the finish off the back of the neck.  The body finish is checked from dragging it through the cold to gigs, there are dings and dents from beer bottles and acid tripping fools jumping on stage.  But after so long with one guitar, I bought a couple more.  And found that I liked bigger necks, so the Emmacaster (now named Pam) wasn't getting any play time.<br />
<br />
Last year for my birthday, my wife asked me what I wanted more than anything else for my birthday.  I said &quot;I want the Emmacaster to be great again&quot;.  So she told me to go for it.  I sent it back to Emma, and he put a new, larger neck on it with my preference of tuners.  Birdseye maple for the neck, brazilian rosewood (legal) for the fretboard, and mammoth ivory (legal) for a nut.  A couple other changes for me to make it fit what I've learned to do, and you have one of the ultimate rock and blues Stratocasters ever to grace the planet.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I used to bring it back in to have Emma look it over.  He used to berate me for all the dings and dents.  But one day his dad took me aside and told me that my guitar was the one his son was the most proud of.  It was the first guitar of his anyone had ever bought, and it was the only one being played live and in bars.  The other ones he had sold to doctors and lawyers, but mine was a player.  He actually took pictures to show to potential customers.  :)<br />
<br />
So anyway, that's the story behind Pam.  She's a 1990 Emery Custom.  And the one I would grab if the house was ever on fire.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the length, I fear I get a bit sentimental about the old girl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arroe</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the info guys!  I am buying a used practice amp from my friend, it's in pretty good condition.  It is an ibanez, regularly sells for $120, I'm getting it for $50.  It has a little built in switch that makes it sound really cool :)<br />
<br />
As for guitars, I'm still looking.  Does anyone have a link to a company site or something with a guitar they have and prefer, that's around my price range ($250).  I know one person put up some links, they helped a lot!  thanks for all your help guys!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buying used has been mentioned, and I think that's a good way to go.  But only if you have someone looking out for you, it's easy to get shafted.<br />
<br />
I've bought most of my guitars used.  Some have been private transactions, some have been with larger used and vintage dealers.  One of my favorites is Elderly Instruments.  I did a little looking this morning, and here are a couple around your price range:<br />
<br />
Fender Standard Strat (http://www.elderly.com/vintage/items/30U-10314.htm)  - $275 - new this would run about $375 - $400.  Looks to be in nice shape, and it has an additional cool feature.  The previous owner installed a Hot Rails pickup in the bridge, which will give it a little thicker sound in the bridge position.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another Fender Standard Strat (http://www.elderly.com/vintage/items/30U-10336.htm) - $245 - this one has a rosewood fingerboard, rather than maple.  They're somewhat different, but for now it's a matter of aesthetics.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you have to get a Strat, far from it.  But it's what I know, and these two I found that fit your budget.  You certainly may find an Epiphone Les Paul or one of the ESP's or Jacksons that may fit your budget if that's the way you wish to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, what a great story Aelitan :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arroe</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice Aelitan, just what I was looking for!  I heard that I need to get a guitar with humbuckers (sp?) though, cause they would normally just make an annoying sound.  Do fenders have these?  I also was suggested getting a Ibanez GX series model.  Anyone know if those are any good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The noise that your friend is referring to is 60-cycle hum, I'm guessing.  Single-coil pickups will be affected by 60-cycle hum to some extent.  It's bad under fluorescent lights or especially by neon beer signs.  This hum is why &quot;hum-bucker&quot; pickups were invented.  A humbucker is two single coil pickups wound opposite with opposite magnet polarities.  This causes the 60-cycle interference to be cancelled.<br />
<br />
Do you need them?  I dunno.  Personally, I don't care for humbuckers.  There are folks that love them and sound great with them.  Some Fenders come with humbuckers, but Fender is known for its single-coil pickups.  Probably the most important thing to think about is what style of music you want to play.  Single coil pickups are great for blues, country, rockabilly, some classic rock and possibly jazz.  Humbuckers are really good at classic rock, metal, modern rock, and jazz.<br />
<br />
If your tastes lie towards modern rock, you're probably best off gettting a guitar with humbuckers.  If you're more into blues (Stevie Ray Vaughan) or country, look towards a single coil guitar.<br />
<br />
As far as the Ibanez you mention, I have not played any of them.  It's likely a korean made model.  Nothing wrong with Korean guitars, I own one.  However, the progression is normally seen as American&gt;Mexican (or Japanese) &gt; Korean &gt; Indonesian (or Chinese).  I'm sure the Ibanez would be playable, if it floats your boat.<br />
<br />
Just one more point on the new vs. used - your first guitar is likely not going to be your last.  If you really get into it, you'll probably find yourself moving into another instrument in a year or two.  A friend once told me &quot;buy used and play for free&quot;.  What that means is you're likely not to lose much money on a used guitar, as long as you don't beat the snot out of it (or cover it with stickers, or drill huge holes in it).  With a new guitar, you probably won't ever get back what you paid for it.<br />
<br />
I'm probably making this FAR more complicated than I should.  Guitar building has advanced enough in recent years that it's hard to find an unplayable dog out there.  Just about anything you choose with a brand name is going to be at least playable.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you'll do fine and really enjoy playing.<br />
