<br />
If you are a fatty, bash to interrupt casting.<br />
<br />
Buff your resists. <br />
<br />
Dispell to pull them, gets rid of dmg shields/runes etc.<br />
<br />
You could try root/dot and get out of their line of sight. But this usually isnt an option. <br />
<br />
Flash of light may work with dots, but preferrable for them to be snared first. /hug snare necklace.<br />
<br />
You normally find at those levels that caster mobs have less HP's than tank mobs, so where preferable, dot and run out of range if doable, or nuke em down quick.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here are some of the things I've learned about fighting mages and necros:<br />
<br />
General rules for pet classes:<br />
1) Mage and necro pets must be rooted and stay that way. Root is preferrable to a slow on pets because it takes SOOO much less mana.<br />
2) Open with malo on the PC to reduce the pets chance of resisting root and to soften the PC up for your poison, magic and cold based attacks. If Malo doesn't stick on mage/necro then try debuffing to remove their resist buffs before recasting Malo. You need to hope the pet doesn't resist root because it will be on you allowing the mage/necro the freedom concentrate on offense.<br />
<br />
Mage:<br />
Mages have all magic and fire based nukes and can nuke pretty hard, not quite as bad as wizzies but painful nonetheless. They have the same Malo line as shaman but iirc shaman get them a level or two earlier than mages. The two best svc/svf items which are affordable at these levels in my opinion are Stone of Morid(range) and Crown of Froglok Kings(head). Put those two on and you have a boost of 50 to svc and svf. Really helps reduce nuke damage. <br />
<br />
Best thing to do with the mage is blind, dot and run around a corner or out of range. If she/he has their spells hotkeyed then blind doesn't help you except to keep the mage from following you and as a distraction. Expect to continue taking damage even after you've landed blind until you are out of range. Keep reapplying your DoTs and healing yourself when needed and keep pet rooted. In PvP, unless you have an extended affliction 2 or better item, your 39 DoT Venom of the Snake is going to do about 300 points of damage over 42 seconds. You can stack Envenomed Breath with this to get an extra 140 or so to speed things up. If you are level 44 then you can use your cold nuke which will do somewhere in the neighborhood of 280 if your opponent has low svc and might be your best bet to take the mage down quick but mages can self buff their svc and svf by 20 or even 30 depending on level and can buff their svm as well. If roots and blind are landing then don't bother nuking, just let your dots finish it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Necro:<br />
Necros can hurt you in SOO many ways. They have some of the same dots as shaman but get them at different levels(VoS at 34 but Scourge at 39). Basically you will need all your resists up except for cold when fighting a necro. Their version of Malo, called Scent of Dusk/Shadow/Darkness etc. is poison based and debuffs fire, poison and disease. It cannot be canceled away but can be cured with cure poison which by the way is your best friend when fighting a necro along with cure disease. The fire based DoTs cannot be removed and will run their course no matter what. You will need regen or chloro to help mitigate the damage from these and high svf can allow you to resist the DoT entirely. Poison and disease based DoTs, as shaman's know all too well, can simply be cured. If the necro is using poison or disease then it should be an easy fight. You DoT the necro with poison based DoTs, the necro DoTs you, you cure necro DoTs then sit down and watch necro die from your DoTs. Necros can cure disease but not poison. If the necro is 44 or higher she/he will generally have really high poison resist due to being perma DMFd. You will need Malo. Generally, keep necro pet rooted and cure DoTs if possible, heal when needed. Use poison based DoTs and your cold based nukes. As with all casters blind can be either very useful or nearly useless depending on whether or not your opponent has their spells hotkeyed.<br />

I hope this info is helpful and I would appreciate any additional suggestions or criticisms of the strategies I use as I play on a PvP server and have to contend with PC aggro nearly every day. Any help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In addition to the excellent advice above, when fighting NPC casters, Flash of Light has been my biggest friend.  If you're out of melee range, they'll run and not cast.  When you get your companion, he can happily nip at their heels.<br />
<br />
Our dogs used to interrupt casters, but I've not seen it (or I've missed the message) for some time now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have the patience, wait until they rebuff Shield of XXX. It has a long cast time for all level ranges, allowing you to land quite a number of spells on them before they finish casting it. A rogue in my guild used to solo caster frogs in Sebilis this way. They were more than halfdead before they finished casting.<br />
<br />
Once you got a spawn broken it is easier since the mobs always start off by buffing themselves. <br />
<br />
Turn on particle effects and learn to recognize the spell effects for the Shield spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mensha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the advice so far!  <br />
<br />
Is there any special advice against druid NPCs?  I'm considering taking on the mermaids in Kedge Keep.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">get ya some focus effect items, like moonstone ring (about 100-200p in bazaar), ones that increase your casting range. root/dot them from outside their casting range. let fido gnaw on them awhile.<br />
