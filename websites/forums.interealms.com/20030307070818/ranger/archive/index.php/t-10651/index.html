<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm bored at work and just had to come up with something that bugs me...it has to be total lack of originality when naming characters.<br />
<br />
I've seen way too many Rogues with names resembling Stab, Stabbz, etc (including the surname McStab more than once)...<br />
<br />
I've seen a ton of druids with Portz or Port in their names...<br />
<br />
Halflings going after Bilbo Baggins (or misspelled derivatives thereof) are next on the list...<br />
<br />
Rangers with Legolas and its variants gave me a chuckle until I found a druid on my server sporting the same name...<br />
<br />
Beastlords with names like Kitty, Purr, etc...<br />
<br />
Clerics with Rez in their first or last names...<br />
<br />
Enchanters with Crack in their names...<br />
<br />
Be unique for crying out loud. Not directing this at anyone in particular, just something that annoys me in general.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Donal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It probably wouldn't be so bad, but that name filter is godawful.<br />
<br />
I had to make a sky stone purchase mule one day in Erudin. I typed in 4 random names and all 4 were rejected. Two of them were probably already in use, the other two were me making things up. <br />
I finally got a name to land with &quot;Talkinboutshaft.&quot;<br />
I've got a friend who tried several cool names for his shadowknight. Again, he was making things up as he went, and probably 7 names were rejected. He finally got Prpleluvmisle as a name. He scrapped it because he didn't feel like dealing with petitions, but the point remains that it can actually be a royal pain in the rear to get a creative name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If the name filter gets angry with me, I just change a little something in the name. eventually it goes through.. haven't had problems yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Myrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not one of those who thinks every name has to have sprung like Athena from the player's head, but I do think that Portzalot, Stabba Backstabz, Gvinn Youcrack and other D00dz namez are distracting, and I tend to avoid people with those type of names -assuming they're going to act as childish as their names sound.<br />
<br />
I also hate seeing the tons of variations on Legolas, Drizzt, Aragorn, Bilbo, Frodo, etc. If you're going to use a name from fiction, don't use a major character that everyone's going to know. Taking the name of a river or mountain in Middle Earth, or someone mentioned in passing whose name struck your fancy is great - but if you type in Legolas, and it's rejected, don't start going about trying to find a variation that works.</div></div><hr />

I would laugh my ass off if someone from another server actually went through the trouble to petition a name that they will never see. :p  That would be the ultimate in anal retentiveness. :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aelitan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We had a problem a while back that still frosts me.  We had a wedding in our guild and got a GM to come to change names for the two of them.<br />
<br />
While there, the GM stopped stripped the name off of our best cleric.  The guy was &quot;Vater Vonleben&quot; which he said was &quot;Father of Life&quot; in German.  I thought it was a neat and imaginitive name.  Apparently, we got the only German-speaking GM on Xegony (Lily or Lili?) and she stripped his name then and there.  He didn't play much after that, leaving the game permanently within a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
The kicker was seeing a level 22 ranger in the next zone with the name &quot;Skidmarks Uranus&quot;.  When we petitioned, we were told that name did not warrant changing.  /boggle.<br />
<br />
They also came after our next cleric, Roll.  Roll began life as Roll Overbetoven, which was stripped.  He then was Roll Aides, which was again stripped.  I've suggested now that he be Roll Overhereitcomesagain but he's not willing.<br />
<br />
I too get tired of four thousand variations of &quot;Billllboo Baginnz&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The worst offenders have got to be rogues and druids but I've seen idiot names on every class.  How hard is it to make an in-character name?  Names longer than 8 characters are tiresome too.

I know it's a mule, nothing big, nothing major, but think about how other people would feel grouped with someone with a name like that. <br />
<br />
Think about it this way. You're a level 60, and so is &quot;Skidmarks Uranus&quot; and you have a half decent RP name, but he beats you out of the group. I don't know about you, but if I am lfg, and they choose someone named Skidmarks Uranus over me, I'd feel pretty worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gnome Paladin - Martinian Rohssi<br />
Gnome Enchanter - Austis Pumontee<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing I hate about the naming policy and the way it is enforced:  It is completely subjective and dependent on the person enforcing it.  I have seen people with Latin/German/foreign words as names that were merely descriptive of their character have their names stripped from them and in the same zone someone with the name Ieatpoop Ueatpooptoo left untouched, not to mention all the knock-offs from popular fantasy movies and books... I've seen a lot of Bombur, Boffur, Glorin, etc etc... varuations.<br />
<br />
On RZ I once knew someone named Euthenasia - DE Necro.. I thought it was strangely appropriate but she darn near got banned, not just stripped.  Not to say she was right, just relating a story.  That was definately a little outside the naming policy.. not that there is a true naming policy the way they have chosen to enforce it.  The way it is now and always has been, it's whatever the GM's/Guides &quot;feel like&quot; enforcing.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if he ever got his name changed, but, from what I heard from a Warder friend of mine, most of the higher end Rangers on the entire server started shouting at him for demeaning the class. I was so proud of the class banding together, it made me happy. Then I met a stupid group in Sol B that got me killed because they wouldn't let my Paladin friend tank and insisted the Monks draw aggro. Idiots.  Everything Balances out in the end.<br />

I agree that it is just dumb when you get to &quot;Araaagornnn&quot; and all (though Aaragorn might not bother me too much), but I think it is a nice compliment to the authors of those books that inspired the love of the genre, which was the reason I picked up EQ in the first place. I think it just needs to be tempered... and you should try to find a less-used name than &quot;Frodo&quot; or whatever. /shrug. Oh well to each his own.<br />
I just get aggravated when I'm in a grouchy mood if I see someone named &quot;Stabyou Intheface&quot; or &quot;Ifilledwithpie&quot; or something like that. Kinda ruins the fantasy effect. But that is a good point, it is their money, I guess they should be named whatever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Eldowin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I don't mind clever phrases, it's the repetitive stuff, like this thread originally started with the title unimaginative names. That's what bugs me, phrases can be very imaginative, but any rogue with stab in their name, any woodelf with a name about how hot hey are, any ogre or troll with fat in their name, anything you see a lot of gets annoying. Legolas would be fine if there was one, spelled correctly or not, just one. most of the legolas clones on my server never broke lvl 20, but they still bothered me.<br />
<br />
but little phrases are fine, unless they are immature, and even then only if in bad taste.<br />
<br />
I always appreciated the names that said something funny, like protectin myassishard (was a druid), but names that are just dumb like noobslayer, even if it isn't overused, just seems really weak.<br />
<br />
when I chose a name I wanted something I could be proud of, something I wouldn't want to change later, and I'm quite happy with my name. But some people just can't stand to try more than 3 names.</div></div><hr />

A character a long time ago was running around with the first name &quot;Dripping&quot; and when she got her last name, she chose &quot;Disaster&quot;<br />
<br />
In my own guild, a fellow ranger is named &quot;Daisey Flowers&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I once saw a high elf (lvl 1 or 2) with the name 'Inyourdreams'--don't think that one lasted.<br />
<br />
There were two ogres with the names Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum and they used to dance and have synchronized moves--probably played by the same person.<br />
<br />
There haven't been too many names I've been disappointed or angry enuf to /petition.  My friend had Mrsoth ('cause he couldn't use Lord Soth ;) ) and was told to change it when a GM saw it, so now he runs around as Sothie.<br />

I do like witty joke names, but the variants of the LotR characters is trite and annoying. I agree with the sentiments of &quot;if you're going to rip off a name, do it right and use a lesser known character&quot;.<br />

And I'm sorry, but unless you are going to make a serious effort at RPing a famous character, stay the hell away from it.  Unless you are going to try to roleplay Aragorn, choose Ara something else. hint hint.  And for for the love of pearl, if someone has already chosen a name close to yours, PICK ANOTHER.  I use Viola for several characters, usually a rogue, since my first rogue on  a MUD was Viola.  Well this newbie jumps onto the server and names herself, a shaman, get this: Violafighter.  I petitioned several times, but the gm's did nothing.  People who make names that stupid should be instantly banned, they are too dumb to play with others.<br />

This is totally irrelevent to the thread but another thing that drove me crazy was how people pronounced names wrong.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I've always tended to go legitimate name first, and surname a sort of word mix. In the case of 823972348234 druids known as wolfheart or whatever, I have to disagree with them.. but if there was only one wolfheart it'd be ok to me. :p<br />
<br />
As such, I have Noggel Nimbelnoggin. at the time, I wanted an enchanterly name, but didn't want one that sounded dumb like Castsalotofcrack or whatever. At the time, I didn't have a clarity spell to begin with though. :p There weren't many people above level 20 at the time either, not in the areas I was in... though I think I remember seeing someone surnamed Coolbreeze which I disliked. Anyway, Nimbelnoggin (was originally Nimblenoggin before my first name got changed) satisfies the enchanterly deal and sounds gnomish to boot. I really like his name. ;)<br />
<br />
My ranger, well.. :\ I tried Dawnlord first (again with the word mix surname)... then Dawnbringer after that was rejected. Dawnbringer was also rejected. I asked my guild for some suggestions and ended up with a resounding cry for Manasponge. This was during the height of the kunark &quot;RANGER DOWN!&quot; era, and I went with it. Note that I always kept track of how many times I died... even at 57 I've only died some 36 times, and never believed in the ranger downness as anything but a joke, so don't throw stuff at me. The name stuck. The only big thing that sucked is there ended up being 829374234 other manasponges on lanys later on. I sorta wish I wasn't the first so it would've rejected the surname.. at the time I didn't know you could petition and get a rejected surname. :(<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my wizard, Nyfael Darkthorn. Same pattern as before. My only regret is Darkthorn can be looked at as two totally different names... but being an Innoruuk-worshipping dark elf wizard, you can tell when you see him. ;) Tough soundin name for what turned out to be a portbitch for my friends :\<br />
<br />
So with my use of word combinations for surnames, I'm not a purist I suppose. Still, I really like seeing good names, names that are original and fit the racial &quot;guidelines&quot; if you will for whatever race the character is. Those really odd names people name their twinks just make me boggle. ;) The odder the better it seems.. totally off the wall random things like Chalk Board. ***? :p<br />

my surname was so good that VI had to make a spell named after me :)  my surname is Eagleeye.  took me more than a week to think that name up and i'm quite proud of it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I can relate to a lot of what has been said here, my first name was thought up by my brother which is surprising since he plays EQ so little (14 nec)<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point of the quote is that my surname was made before the archery spells too.<br />
<br />
Philwen Hawkseye<br />
<br />
How cool is that :)<br />
<br />
Also i did once see an iksar monk with the surname donkeypuncher, saw a few ooc discussing how they could allow it too, and my other brothers first war was called Doctordoom which was when we first encountered the naming policy problem, we had no thoughts of any fantasy character when creating this name though, asked about misterdoom but no dice, had it changed to Timwar as his name is Tim :P<br />

I deliberately went for a last name that sounded like another language. My reason--I am a wood elf, and don't think my last name would be in the Common tongue, but in elvish. Just as names in this world have meanings associated with them, I figured wood elves had names in their own language with meaning as well.<br />

I normally try and ignore them, but some of the worst I will report. To me its taking away the fantasy / roleplaying element of the game ( I suppose in the same manner, it does remind you that is a just a game)<br />

One of the good things about a ranger is knowing what mobs are where, and what they /con to you in advance.<br />
<br />
Every name I tried to pick was either taken already or simply sounded way to far fetched, so I picked something simple that would let other chars know what I was.<br />
<br />
And Tracc was born, 20 lvls later, Ankeel was added because thats what I did best. Track and kill.<br />
<br />
Not all obvious names are boring, indeed some are quite amusing, but when you come across them that are deliberatley rude it kinda takes the fun away for me.... so to all those chars out there with names like Imgod Urpants /rude.<br />

My first real character was my warrior, Taralis (which is basically my real name, Tarania Lissette). Trena is named after one of my best friends in RL (Katrena). Trevawn is named after Katrena and her husband Vaughn (thus Tre-Vawn). I have a Ranger on Test named Periwynkle (one of my favorite colors). As far as surnames go, I think I'm gonna take Trevawn to 65 with no surname so she can be cool like her benefactor. :p To be honest, I just can't seem to come up with a name that's to my liking. <br />
