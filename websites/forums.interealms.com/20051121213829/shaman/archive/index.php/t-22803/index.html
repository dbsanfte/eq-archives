<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's happened.<br />
<br />
Played every class (save Defender) up to at least level 10 (though my Tanker is 15 and my Fire/Fire Blaster is 17), and they all have their 'fun factor', but the game overall is just too repetitive with a severe lack of activities other than &quot;kill to level&quot;.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, the game gave me a new appreciation for how fleshed out EQ really is. Granted, it has 5 years on CoH, but still. Even at launch EQ had a wider variety of TWA's (time wasting acitivites) than CoH.<br />
<br />
/yawn<br />
<br />
NEXT!<br />
<br />
I may actually start up a new Shaman on Firiona Vie and limit myself to Classic + Kunark content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/echo<br />
<br />
My sister swears up and down that things change so drastically after 20 that I'll love it all over again...  Since my blaster is 17, I figure I'll play when the mood strikes me, get to 20 sometime in the next couplefew weeks.  *grin*<br />
<br />
My man and I came to the conclusion that CoH is very fun in an arcade sense.  Nonstop blam blam blam...  Which I'm in the mood for sometimes, much like pulling out a first-person shooter.  The EQ cravings are coming back, though - because I don't think the two games scratch the same itches.<br />
<br />
Maybe you have the right of it.  Start somewhere new.  Though I might have to roll up a bard, I don't think I can stomach the ludicrous downtime in lower-level EQ anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it's confirmed. Wife and I discussed it over lunch. Though we decided to start over on a server that allows for more than one character so we can try race/class combinations that we never tried previously.<br />
<br />
A friend at work plays on Prexus (Ikky Necro named Jarfi Thule), so we may start over there.<br />
<br />
No interest in racing to the end game. No interest in power leveling. More interested in just hanging out, progressing at a casual pace, doing n00b quests for a bit. Oh, and absolutely NO multi-boxing for me this time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But didn't I read on another thread about you turning on all the other accounts?  *grin*<br />
<br />
I agree, multi-boxing is fun for a while, but eventually it reduces the game to a mathematical equation, which loses the fun value REAL fast.<br />
<br />
Fun suggestion - my man and I had a HOOT for a week or two when we made a couple of ogre beastlords (LITTLE BEAR PETS!) and ran them up to shar vahl.  All you have to do (unless they implemented an easier way) is make a throwaway kitty account each of you for the other to get your citizenship papers, and then you can run through all the vah shir newbie quests.  Was a whole lot of fun.  Not to mention how freaked out a lot of kitty PC's were to see big nasty ogres tromping around their pristine little city.  *chuckle*<br />
<br />
I probably would've signed back up by now, but I swear he gets hives when he thinks about playing EQ again.  Good luck to you two.  Crossing my fingers for WoW, like everyone else...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But didn't I read on another thread about you turning on all the other accounts?  *grin*<br />
Yup. Busted I guess.  ;) <br />
<br />
Though not all. We're giving one of the accounts to my brother. He's getting kinda bored with CoH too. We're mainly focusing on our new characters, and will only occasionally play our higher levels. Might use the higher levels to acquire a little better gear for my new Wizzy and the wifes new Enchantress, but I seriously doubt we'll play them as our primaries any longer.<br />
<br />
Waiting for WoW myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aha you can't keep away from eq till you've truely exhausted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, this is a kicker.<br />
<br />
<br />
...because I don't think the two games scratch the same itches.<br />
We resub'd CoH last night for this very reason.<br />
<br />
We talked about it for a few days and came to the conclusion that EverQuest is a game, literally of &quot;epic&quot; proportions when compared to CoH. It satisfies some need for major accomplishments.<br />
<br />
CoH is geared more towards immediate gratification where you can jump in, feel powerful, engage in a few quick battles, then log. No major time investment required to do one or two missions.<br />
<br />
We decided to keep both CoH and EQ subscribed for now and use each during periods of time when one or the other is more appropriate. When we have longer periods of time to spend in a game, EQ. When we only have 30 to 45 minutes to play, CoH.<br />
<br />
Best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
Yeh, pathetic, I know. :) BUT...we're having fun in both right now, enjoying each for their better qualities instead of focusing on their negative aspects. Maybe some day a game will come along that has the best qualities of both games without the pitfalls? WoW maybe? /em hopes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Me and a friend got bored with CoH after a short while (like 2 months), and we had a decent enough SG that ran a group every night.  The game doesn't really change at any level.  It's always &quot;Go to X, kill guys, and save/pick up/defuse X.&quot;  And the third step is optional.  Fights  generally aren't that different whether you're fighting freakshow or 5th column.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fights  generally aren't that different whether you're fighting freakshow or 5th column.  Bleh.<br />
True, but we're right on the cusp of getting exposed to new content (different mobs than we've been fighting so far). Our primaries are level 17, and everything I've read/been told is that content starts changing and getting more interesting around level 20. We'll give it a chance and see what happens. Again though, it's all about the 'quick kill' and immediate gratification that EQ doesn't provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">*grin*  I only WISH we could do the same.  I think he's allergic to EQ now...  We finally hit 21, and will be able to zone into Dark Astoria, which is supposedly all that and a peanut butter cup.  *shrug*  we'll see.<br />
<br />
As a side funny comment, I'd read on the patch message that they were doing *something* with mind controllers to &quot;fix&quot; them.  Since my mind controller is my main, I wandered over to the CoH forums, despite the fact that (in the words of the oh-so-clever Tycho) &quot;...I detest forums of all kinds. They bring human nature into such stark relief that it can be difficult to bear. &quot; (save the Crucible, most times).  Lo and behold, I get there and find that mind controllers are HORRIBLY, devistatingly broken.  Huh, go figure.  I'd switched from my blaster to my controller because I hated not being able to save my group in a pinch.  Never have that problem with the mind controller.  Between Charm, Dominate, Mass Dominate, and Telekenesis - their jaws drop to the floor on a regular basis at the things I pull off.  BUT, I'm usually doing door missions partnering with my man, or maybe the whole 5 or 6 people in our supergroup.  I think the screamers are the ones who spend all their time exp grinding in outdoor zones with random people.<br />
<br />
It just made me think of EQ and how if I'd just stayed away from the EP raiding guild, I might've still been happy with my shaman doing LDoN's.  Who knew?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeh, I read all about how &quot;mind controllers are gimp&quot; from all the whiners on the official forums. All I can tell ya is that I don't like playing when my wife isn't playing her Mind/Empathy controller. She mezzes HUGE groups which allows my blaster to pick 'em off one by one without much danger.<br />
<br />
If what she's able to do is considered 'gimp'?! Hell! Sign me up! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to second everything that has been said here, the game scratches different itches. Friends fled EQ to DAOC, I stayed with EQ. Those friends went to CoH, I stayed in EQ untill a month ago. I tried to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; from EQ, but there is something missing from CoH. I cannot put my finger on it, but I still troll EQ boards, and still want to play EQ. Mebbe its the time investment, maybe its something else, I dunno. I do know that I am going to have to maintain both accounts to feel &quot;fulfilled&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Canceled my CoH account about a month ago with a 27 eng/inv tanker and a 20 ff/rad defender.  My boyfriend had a lvl 40 ar/dev blaster.  I loved the game while it lasted, but it just got to be really repetitive.<br />
<br />
The game's the same no matter where you slice it.  Constantly grind to the next level for the next ability/enhancement slot.  I think it was for lack of &quot;other&quot; things to do.  It's all the same save so and so, go get this, /snore.<br />
<br />
And did anyone notice on almost every class, you kinda feel like you're playing a bard? On my tank I was constantly pushing buttons - taunt that, ae taunt that, attack 1, attack 2, attack 2, attack 1, ae taunt, disc, attack 1....for hours!  You can't really BS in a CoH group like you can in EQ, everyone's too busy twisting :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>MeanieAU</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I totally agree with the comments on repetition etc. I got my tech blaster to around lvl 24 and even tho I cannot stand the carboard cut out trees in everquest i subscribed again to get my last bub to ding lvl 65. CoH just got too repetative.<br />
CoH is the funnest game  but it lacks something that makes you feel your character is more distinct from anyone elses except for the color spandex you wear. Might check it out again when i get sick of standing in PoK lfg or kei. <br />
I am resigned to the fact that I am not a one game person. I need many games at once to keep me occupied as long as I can afford it.<br />
infact as I read more i see that there are alot of multi gamers out there which is enlightening. nothing worse than one eyed eq or camelot players that become gamist. <br />
have fun all in whatever world you reside in<br />

It's hard playing CoH after experiencing WoW, but we're still giving it a chance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Main things i like about CoH is how FUN it is. I mean for short term and shallow play.<br />
<br />
When I first started CoH i ot bored pretty fast so what i enjoyed most was taking a taskforce with some friends online and roleplaying through the story in character...added some of the depth we needed i guess :)<br />
<br />
I like to check back to CoH from time to time. Logged on yesterday after i got back from work and noticed someone with a cape, and that i had some badges...<br />
<br />
<br />
Do the badges show on your costume? are they good for anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The badges seem to be the closest thing to equipment that CoH has.  I can't remember any of the effects, but some are pretty entertaining, like &lt;Pwnzor&gt; or something similar, that you get for completing a story arc at around lvl 23 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">During WoW server downtime on Tuesday (normal weekly maintenance), and in a fit of gaming madness, I renewed our CoH accounts.<br />
<br />
All I can say is...what a waste of $30, but I suppose a good lesson learned. :)<br />
<br />
We played for all of 15 minutes and logged. No interest in going back at all. At least not while WoW is still as much fun as it is. Nah, I'd rather do other things (like music or leathercrafting) when the servers are down, or I just need a break from gaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">*grin*  WoW definitely raised the bar.  I still wish CoH was more enjoyable to play on a daily basis, because the game was FUN in the short term.  Just didn't seem to have any longevity whatsoever.</div></div><hr />
