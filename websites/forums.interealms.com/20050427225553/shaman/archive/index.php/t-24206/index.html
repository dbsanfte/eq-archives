Outdoor hunting = suck.<br />
I only played for a short while during the stress test and never got to experience any of the instanced dungeons, but there was a non instanced dungeon just outside of Dolinaar on the way to Darnassus (NE lands, island off the NW coast of Northern Kalimdor, so playing Horde you won't see it). It was populated with several varieties of Furbolgs and actually had NPC's inside that would give you quests relating to the history of the dungeon. I can't remember the name of the dungeon...something &quot;Den&quot;. Had a GREAT time in there and completed a few of the quests. Got a pretty bad ass 2h sword for my Hunter while in there too (as a quest reward).<br />
<br />
Remember, there is no zoning in/out of dungeons in WoW, so even though you're entering a dungeon you won't have that 'transitional' feel like you get in EQ when 'zoning' into say, Howling Stones. It's completely seemless except for those instanced dungeons (and changing continents).<br />
<br />
What is it about outdoor hunting that makes it 'teh suck' for you? I actually enjoyed it in WoW. Plenty of mobs to go around and no kill stealing (by way of the 'tapping' rule). Are you sure you're not just jaded by EQ, so much to the point that you're requiring some of the old grinds/game mechanics before it seems 'enjoyable' to you? Seriously. I'm baffled by your comment in the other thread &quot;ridiculously easy...back to EQ2&quot;. I read that and my jaw just just went:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depending on your level, try:<br />
<br />
Wailing Caverns - 18-25<br />
Razorfen Kraul - 20-28<br />
Shadowfang Keep - 20-28<br />
Stromgarde Castle - 34-42</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've so far only tried the alliance side and only one instanced dungeon but that one sure as hell put all the LDoN zones to shame. It was Deadmines in the zone Westfall. Its probably intended for level 15+ people. Very nice change between narrow mine corridors and huge rooms with &quot;something&quot; in them (not going to spoil anything). And even the sub bosses in this dungeon were far more entertaining than anything I have met in EQ in 5-6 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">By really easy I mean, its just really easy (so far) to kill anything, I havent even died yet !<br />
<br />
I just always hated outdoors hunting, dungeons are the fun places for me. Outdoors its usually too easy to pick and choose yor fights and escape with no problems and it all feels a bit 'samey'.<br />
<br />
I think it's probobly a hang up from the horrors of fast levelling Overthere/Dreadlands type folks, minimum hassle fastest exp, lowest risk, complete abscence of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whoops and thanks to those who posted suggestions, appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Start fighting nothing but red and orange cons if you're bored.  You'll die soon enough.  *grin*  Seriously, that's what we did, and it was never a dull moment.  Definitely not the &quot;optimal exp&quot; method, but that's not what we were after.<br />
<br />
The negligible death penalties make it a helluva lot more fun to take risks and play closer to that line.  My guess is that you're playing it really safe out of EQ-built habits (must single pull, wait until health and mana are full before pulling, etc).  It's hard to undo all that training, but it DOES make the game really dull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wherever quests have taken me so far there has been no opportunity to fight higher level cons.<br />
<br />
I generally do pull muliples , taunt totem for the win ! health potions for safety !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">my typical set up is to, pull with lightning.<br />
<br />
Earth Shock them for the stun. Then set up Stone totem and fire totem, at the same time meleeing them.<br />
<br />
Repeat earch shock and flame ball as much as possible. Heal if necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">QUEST QUEST QUEST.<br />
<br />
Follow your quests, and pick up every orange exlaimation point you can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">QUEST QUEST QUEST.<br />
<br />
Follow your quests, and pick up every orange exlaimation point you can find.<br />
<br />
There are almost too many quests in WoW. Your quest list will start filling up with orange and red elite quests and those are not always easy to get done. Atleast I have ended up having to turn down quests regularily since I dont want all of them to be elite.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong though, its still fun. And in a way this makes it even more immersive since you know you had to turn down quests in an area so you will want to go back later to &quot;help out&quot;. Atleast thats the kind of player I am - I just cant let any quests be once I know they are there :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The early lowby &quot;dungeons&quot; may seem a bit similar at times but overall not bad.  They tend to be fairly simplistic and short which is fine at that level.<br />
<br />
I have done 2 full runs in 2 different high teen/low 20s instanced dungeons and was *quite* blown away with them.  The presentation and cohesiveness was great.  Graphically they rock, the detail is excellent, and they were quite fun.</div></div><hr />
