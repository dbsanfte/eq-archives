<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont know if im a good PvPer or not. But i dont feel like a good PvPer cause im just letting it all hang out when i PvP. I dont have any set methods or specific totems i lay down, mostly cause i been focusing on leveling and spells and totems been changing. So anyway, im wondering what everyone elses basic battle plans are. I want to formulate a attack pattern that will make me worthy of playing the shaman class ;)<br />
<br />
So far i been dropping magma on melee classes, especialy rogues so they cant stealth off, then ofcourse shocking and healing, lots of spaming healing lesser wave, im 28 BTW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also what talent paths have you been following. Im a lil torn on the melee and the healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Litgruv,<br />
<br />
cant say from real pvp against shaman since I am horde, but keep them snared and keep distance. That's all I got.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Lit,<br />
<br />
     I can give you some tips seeing as I went alliance for my main (35 Pally). As alliance, people put a huge amount of emphasis on killing totems asap. They will almost always stop killing you to swipe at a totem. Use this to your advantage. Don't panic if your totems catch it immediately. Drop a totem when you need attention off of you for a second to heal, DD, whatever, I can almost gurantee you that you'll get a few seconds repreive as they almost always go for the totem, regardless of what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe, I've noticed that too and adopted that tactic when I need a distraction. one of these days they'll learn that the totem isn't what they need to worry about though, and I'll have to adjust again. until then though, let em beat those totems blue! <br />
<br />
strat depends on what class you are up against Lit, I've found quite a few ppl that seem to get totally messed up when you strafe and circle them (maybe they don't expect it from a shaman?), and that's always a good tactic when meleeing. always have a 'bag of tricks' with you too, I prefer sticky glue (roots for 10 sec) and ae devices that you can either quest or get from the AH. that really screws em up, since those are tools that a shaman isn't supposed to have :). shock and grounding totem for casters, alternating those with some strong and fast melee and you can keep them from casting pretty effectively. I find that if they don't root me right away and start blasting, druids and mages are pretty much done for when I move in. I've only fought a Hunter once, and it wasn't an optimal situation =\. I had just finished killing a PVP flagged npc in the Badlands and was low mana/hp when this guy charged over the hill and started wailing on me :). he had 4 or 5 lvls on me as well, so needlesss to say I didn't last long. I wrote his name down though, and I will catch him again someday :). <br />
<br />
only time I fought a rogue was a small battle outside Scarlet Monastery. I killed a female NE rogue at least 4 times in a row (paranoid is a great buff, btw), I think we were both in the 33-35 range at the time. what a blast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never use totems in pvp except for earthbind and grounding.  Everything else is a waste of mana and it is too easy for the person to just hit it once and it goes away.  As you get higher level you'll find that people have learned that shaman totems only have 5hp, and they will just kill them.<br />
<br />
Against warriors and rogues, I just introduce them to the frost shock dance and kite them until they are low, then finish them off with melee.<br />
<br />
Against casters, I charge them and drop a grounding and earthbind totem.  Your melee can take down a caster pretty quickly.  I recommend dagger with windfury proc on it because the interrupts will extend their cast times to a point where you can use earth shock to completely shut down their casting, especially if you have the fast shocks talent (which I highly recommend for pvp).  Also, remember to purge them to get rid of buffs and shields.  This is vital against priests.  Their bubble goes away with one purge and then you can just annhilate them.  Ditto for druids because it gets rid of their regen spell.<br />
<br />
Hunters I treat as casters and melee them while ignoring the pet.  If you have the improved lesser healing wave talent, you can heal yourself at will even when being hit by both the hunter and his pet.  They just can't compete with that and are probably the second easiest class for me to kill (druids being the first).<br />
<br />
Against paladins I do the frost shock dance and hope I have a mana potion handy because I will need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Learn the jump/shock technique: <br />
<br />
While running away from a melee, jump, do at least 90 degree turn, frost shock and turn back while still in the air.  <br />
<br />
When you are jumping your forward momentum will continue so you are still headed in the opposite direction of the player you are kiting.  Turning allows for line of sight so you can shock.  It's kinda tricky but after practicing for a couple minutes on NPC's it should be become natural.<br />
<br />
It makes melee characters extremely easy barring resists.<br />
<br />
Against casters make sure you get close and circle them just when their  spells are about to finish casting.  This buys you more time and annoyes the crap out of them.  Don't ignore your resistance totems either.</div></div><hr />

Very good advice to jump and then shock shock. I started using it last night while defending XR from an allience raid and it helped alot. Even snared they can almost keep up with you if you are running backwards.<br />
<br />
For totems I use Earthbind/grounding a ton in PvP. I also like the magama totem if i know a rogue is near.<br />
<br />
Do the see invis potions work versus stealth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They increase the chance, but its still a check vs level &amp; talents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The best advice I can give about pvp, if you are not comfortable with it or unsure if you are good, is to simply practice.<br />
<br />
Duel friends/guildmates.  Duel groupmates while you are waiting for that last member or two to enter an instance or just random people at your local outpost.<br />
<br />
And join up in some group pvp at the local hot spots like TM in Hillsbrad or Stromgarde in Arathi.<br />
<br />
You will learn a lot about 1v1 and group combat both.  Group combat is especially different and there are a lot of little &quot;rules&quot; you will start to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">how you approach pvp depends a lot on how you've specced.  the most important talents being: elemental mastery, nature's swiftness, improved nova, and improved ghost wolf.  I was a shaman all through beta, and having been 60 on warsong pvp server for a good month now I have a few tips on what to do against a range of classes<br />
<br />
shocks:  be sure you have all your shocks up to date through all levels and handy on your tool bar.  frostshock is your bread and butter against melee classes.  although I'm partially specced enhancement, and an expert jouster/strafe dancer since my earliest day on zek in eq, following to guinevere in DAOC, your battles as a shaman in WoW are going to be won with your spells.  for any melee class the way to go is to snare them with earthshock, drop a fire totem in melee range and kite them around.  against any melee including paladin, you should NEVER lose if you keep your distance and kite.  close in only to finish when they run.<br />
<br />
earthshock is very very important and largely underutilized spell.  in essence it's a nuke + shield bash that interrupts spell casting and silences them versus that spell school for a few seconds.  for casters, particularly mages who can sheep from a distance, you CANNOT win without using this spell.  typically I'll drop a grounding totem immediately to eat their poly or nuke, start a lighting bolt if i can squeeze it in and ES them when i see them start to cast.  for anyone save a warlock, one bolt, one ES, a nova and maybe a swing or 2 = dead caster.<br />
<br />
flameshock, I rarely use since it takes longer to do full damage and also since crit potential of the spell is worst.  the one use is that it's out only dot.  use it on rogues to keep them from stealthing and drop an earthbind.<br />
<br />
as far which totems to use.  ground is CRUCIAL.  you cannot wind many fights without it.  also, for an elemental build shaman like me, NOVA is crucial.  i've often been jumped by 2 or more alliance (since alliance lvl 60 outnumber us like 4 to 1 on warsong) and quickly evened the odds by hitting EM + chain lightning, shocked the lower hp or lower level attacker, stomped and nova.  many times this will KILL the lower HP toon and also have done significant damage to the remaining attacker.  for multi-person fights.  tremor is often crucial in the case of sleep etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jinheim is still here!  *happy dance*<br />
<br />
So far my best information (other than Crucible) outside of experience has been my alts.  I've played everything up to 10 so far (half to 20), so I know the major categories of abilities and spells.  I did it in EQ, too.  I just LIKE knowing what everybody has.  Knowing that the druid regen is EXTREMELY powerful, but takes a very long time to cast gives you that edge in knowing (not only what the casting graphic looks like, but also) what the fellow above said about purging it asap.  Probably should purge the whole group straight off if there's a priest - that's, effectively, some REALLY cheap damage.<br />
<br />
Snare totem is always worth dropping.  I've even frustrated the crap out of someone by dropping the taunt totem - because they're in the &quot;kill all totems&quot; mentality, and hammer away at the thing for precious seconds, because they're sure it's doing something detrimental...  *grin*<br />
<br />
How many Alliance players are really going to roll up and play a cross-faction character to learn what each totem does?  Heh.  If they're going to go nuts killing them, drop cheap ones constantly....(if you're in a group)...death by destraction.<br />
<br />
I'm using a mod to give 2 rows of hotkeys, and have my totem keys lined up in complementary pairs.  Makes it easy to pop down windfury/fire damage totem du jour, or grounding/flametongue (since grounding means I can't use windfury).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use a flexbar UI addon and have 48 buttons on my screen with my main combat buttons grouped in one area of the screen for less mouse movement and quicker actions in combat.  This helps a lot.<br />
<br />
As for tactics, alliance are totem nuts, and have totems as KoS.  What I do is drop lower mana cost totems earlier in the fight, even those of questionable utility.  I spread the totem drops out a little and melees are forced to waste combo/rage on them.  Many of my opponents seem to suck at retargeting so while they waste time switching targets, killing the totem and switching back, I'm happily smoking them or healing myself.<br />
<br />
Warstomp for Tauren is amazing.  AoE stun that buys you time to self heal, ghost wolf if you're losing, or drop a 2 second nova totem to spook your foe with a burst of potent, but unsustainable,  DPS.  With a WS, nova and a frost shock combo (usually with a melee swing in the mix) towards the end of a fight my foe usually gives up or tries to run.<br />
<br />
Purge is your friend.  Purge gets rid of some of those paladin extra lives by dispelling seals.  Purge is key on druids and warlocks.  Purge is sweet goodness.<br />
<br />
Mix up your shocks, frost to kite, earthshock on casters, frost shock to keep hunters in melee, but fireshock is the most mana efficient shock you have should you enter into a melee battle of attrition (not a situation of choice).<br />
<br />
As for builds I put my build on a thread in the main WoW section under shaman talents.  I split my points, shooting for a shock elemental/Imp GW enhancement/ and NS restoration build.</div></div><hr />
