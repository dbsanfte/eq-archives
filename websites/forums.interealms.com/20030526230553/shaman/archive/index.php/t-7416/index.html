<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havn't got PoP yet,i didnt pre order it and coming from new zealand,its not in the shops till the 9th..<br />
 I havnt seen any POP spells for sale in the Bazaar,are they all no drop,or just very hard to get?..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Except for Replenishment (61 version of regrowth) all of the 60+ spells are the result of quests.<br />
<br />
Various mobs in PoP drop three types of parchment, ethereal, spectral and some third type I don't know the name of.  Shaman turn in the parchments to an otter in the Library of PoK. Ethereal parchments turn into level 61-62 spells, spectral parchments turn into 63-64 spells and I guess the third type become 64-65 spells.<br />
<br />
So far, it's a pretty frustrating system since all casting classes (including bards) use the same type of parchments to get spells (they just turn them in to different people).  The parchments are no drop, but the spells are droppable.  There is also no way to guarantee after winning a random to get a parchment that you will turn it a parchment for a spell you actually need.<br />
<br />
Currently, the shaman level 63 spell SLTW is bugged.  This spell is actually purchasable from Enchanter guilds, but you can also receive it as a spell turn in.   Yay.<br />
<br />
Parchments seem to have a greater chance of dropping off named mobs, but I've also seem them drop randomly from various mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm sure as more people start to fill out their spellbooks, duplicates will eventually be for sale in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">fv server i know theres some of us doing the tradem this for this routine...for the spells we need / want. best way to do it really i would think its quicker and everyone wins :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Picked up the level 64 DoT (Breath of Ulthor?) for 10kpp in the Bazaar on The Tribunal last night.<br />
I thought that was an awesome buy (someone else had Pox for sale for 13k at the same time).<br />
<br />
Now I just need 3 more levels...<br />
<br />
The same guy also had the new group STA for 9kpp but I thought &quot;9kpp to give peeps 10 more STA? No f@#ing way - I can wait to get that myself...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some shammies much be getting lotsa spells.<br />
<br />
Whats funny is some trader had C4 (Tranquility) for sale for 100,000pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was in plane of nightmare last night and one of the dark parchments dropped. Lvl 65 spell. Was off random mob fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dark parchment? you referring to the Dark pages? Those are for a cloak quest. <br />
<br />
65 level spell parchments = Shadowy Parchments for turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw someone auctioning to trade true spirit for focus of spirit, but that's as far as I've seen anybody actually selling a PoP spell.<br />
<br />
They are still hot potatoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People are also trading around for spells they don't have for ones they have dupes of.  It's happening on VZ with our alliance Shaman (3 of us), we're just filling out each other's spellbooks as we get dupes.  Sucks trying to win a parchment when you raid around with 4 groups or so :D</div></div><hr />
