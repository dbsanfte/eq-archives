<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I do not know if it is as fast as SolA gnomes, but my 34 troll get froglok faction for mask so it works out for me.<br />
<br />
I park outside Sage/Scribe and pull there with my grouped 51 chanter. The chanter pet chews up the mob and my shammy sics pet, slows and drop poison dot. The CC ability of chanter is very nice when breaking rooms and handling adds. The XP is ok since mobs range from db to red for shammy. The lowest mobs con green to chanter leaving the shammy all the XP.<br />
<br />
I plan to rear the shammy to 44 in Guk (unless someone have a faster place) and then take her to PoJ with my 65 paladin in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoJ (or any PoP zone) doesnt start to get good until the 50s.  After Guk try doing CoM, it goes especially fast since the partial revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will try CoM since faction farmers ruin my XP grind now and then in Guk. Also It probably will make sence for my chanter to charm in CoM.</div></div><hr />
