<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm surprised noone has really asked when this quest can be started. I recommend starting at 39. The Shield Of Bane Warding is Ac25 cha8 Wis20 SVM12 and has a nice graphic. The quest starts in Katta Castlelum. The first mob you need to fight is tormented vah shir in Tenebrous Mountains which is outside Katta. There are two spots where the tormented vah shir spawn at. One is the corner of the wall between Katta and the West grimling mine (-1300, 1700). The other is in the middle of the zone and is a pain in the butt unless you got a full group. I recommend doing the wall one either solo or duo with a druid or ranger so they can occasionally track. Easiest way if you duo is sit at the mine and kill grimlings then check track or just go up to the spawn spot every 6 minutes to see if it popped or to kill the placeholders. The placeholders are darkwing bats and groi baku soldiers. the soldiers drop acrylica bricks, random gems, and weapons. Bats drop their crappy wings which are for anything good. Once you get the 8 skulls, either get a few level 50 friends including a chanter or just get about 2 groups from your guild BEFORE you do the turn in. Otherwise you're gonna have fun killing a guy by yourself then 8 skeletons at once to deal with.<br />
After that the rest of the quest you pretty much need to wait til around 45-50 to finish with a small group. So you might as well go level in Tenebrous after that.<br />
<br />
WARNING!!!! The 8 skulls can take a very very long time to get. I've camped as long as 5 hours before getting one skull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is a real nice shield for a cleric or a druid and even a shaman.  But for me at least the 20wis isn't worth more than the saves I get from my SBS. <br />
<br />
Like you say the skulls are rare but the last fight is pretty easy with one group of 50+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have my ranger parked in Tenebrous Mountains both as a Runner Smacker (Rallic's helped me buy my horse) and as a skull collector.  I have four so far, four more to go =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep I looked at this quest as the sheild looks so good but in the end decided that my SBS was better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just carry an SBS in your backpack for when you need resists, and buy a Skull Marked Shield for damn cheap for when you want more mana.  SoBW is not that much better than Skull Marked Shield.<br />

This is exactly what I did. I debated on getting the shield for the extra wisdom but with Kei and Bear form i am maxed wisdom anyway.</div></div><hr />
