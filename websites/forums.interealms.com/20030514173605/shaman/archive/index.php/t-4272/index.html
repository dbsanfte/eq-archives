<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if some shammy did epic and I would be grouped with him all the time would we both get all the faction or only half of it?<br />
 If this is possible 6 shammys could group and only 1 do the turn ins up to the tear part, then everyone would be ally to Rak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only the person doing the hand in gets faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are 2 sorts of faction hits.<br />
<br />
1)Faction hits for killing mobs. Every person who acted on the mob to get on the Hate List (with a few minor exceptions) or who has acted on some on the hate list gets the faction hit assuming they are still alive/in-game when the mob dies. Unlike the XP, it isn't split up - everyone gets the full hit.<br />
<br />
2)Faction hits for quest turn-ins. Only the person ding the turn-in gets the hit. In the case of MQ-ing, it goes to the same person who gets the quest reward itself.</div></div><hr />
