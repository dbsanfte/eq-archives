<br />
Ok, I got through the drunken Shaman no problem, being as I'm not KOS in North FP. Was reading through the quests section and I see that I have to say, &quot;I will walk the path of the heyokah&quot;. I'm not exactly sure if I did that, hehe. So if I go to Erud's Crossing, will Ooglyn still be up? Hoping that I don't have to start over... Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ooglyn is not triggered by the phrase. As long as you have the gem from FP to set her off and trigger the actual test you are good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kirani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bah wrong thread =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, Ooglyn is up almost all the time.  She isn't triggered by the earlier part of the quest.  I think you just have to give her the gem.<br />
<br />
As an NPC, she swims very quickly.  I'd recommend that you find a spoiler and run to the correct location with levitate and SoW on and then swim down rather than trying to follow her!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As the others said, you only need to give Ooglyn the gem. She should be up when you get there unless someone has killed her, so as long as you got the gem from the spirit, you're good to go. I too recommend you get a spoiler and just go to the /loc as Ooglyn is hard to follow. Good luck with the sharkies! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iscadia Starhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My suggestion is that you take along a tracker/porter (finally, a use for all those droods :p ) and have him track for the spawns you need once you're in the general area.  I lost the quest mobs the first time I tried the test of Patience when my lev wore off at a crucial moment and I sank like a stone.  <br />
<br />
Visibility is VERY poor down there.  Don't wander if you can help it or you'll lose your bearings.  <br />
<br />
Another warning:  assuming the normal sharks are green to you, they will NOT agg on you...UNLESS you've whacked one of the killer sharks.  Apparently they smell the blood on you and just go crazy....  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh, and if you're curious....this test took about an hour the time I did it.  I didn't see that mentioned in either of the walkthroughs I have and I was concerned given Evercamp's reputation for long waiting periods.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jhuild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont know if i'm doing something wrong or what the prob is. I give her the gem and have a char waiting at the log (neg 1600 pos 4200) and she never shows us and my sham eather follows her (or trys to becouse she get hung up on the boat and i can never find her on the other side). or if 1 hour and 20 mins is not long enough to wait, but after doing this part 4 time and not seeing 1 spown i dont know if it is me or if the event is just buged.<br />
<br />
any help will be welcome<br />
 I play on Prexus and my main is called Jhuild (i'm allways on) if you want to send me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From my understanding of reading posts around here it would seem that the recent patch (April 2003) that fixed pathing in many places also caused problems with Ooglyn not going where shes supposed to.<br />
<br />
You could /bug in game when you've found her being somewhere odd, that could help devs figure out where things are going wrong as a loc is added to the form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Jhuild! I'm doing this part right now, silly me for not reading this thread first. It looks like the event is bugged, I'm going to /bug it I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Borreny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just did this part right now actually, and yeah Ooglyn gets stuck somewhere around the sunken ship.  I had my druid aggro her past the ship, then just egress herself to clear aggro.  Once the druid egressed, Ooglyn continued on to the correct location.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it'll work if you have a FD person too to clear aggro, or an enchanter to mem blur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bugged?  I attempted this last night to no avail.  And being a Troll who isn't well liked in Freeport, I'm none to happy.  Here's what happened, maybe it's really broken now or I just missed the spawns.<br />
<br />
I went to the loc in the ocean first, before doing my turn-in to Ooglyn, and scouted just so I would have an idea of where to go.  When I went to do my turn-in to Ooglyn, I noticed some strange happenings.  <br />
<br />
1.) There were 2 Ooglyns.  I actually amused myself by hailing them both and having 2 &quot;unique&quot; mobs standing beside me.  I should've taken a screenshot.<br />
2.) She wasn't stationary, she spawned and then immediately walked out into the water (presumably toward the waiting spot) and then despawned somewhere in the boat.  She (and her clone) would walk this path over and over again. <br />
3.) After doing the turn-in (against my better judgement) she continued on the same path she had been walking and again despawned in the boat.  I can see from the previous posts that this is a known issue but shouldn't effect the quest. <br />
4.) I took the time to Lev and EB myself on the beach before heading to the wait spot.  I wasn't going to bother trying to follow her the whole way.  (Wouldn't have mattered anyway since she despawned in the boat.)  I probably paused for about 30 seconds to a minute before heading out to the bottom of the ocean.<br />
5.)  Went to the waiting spot and WAITED.... and waited... and waited.... 45 minutes and not one spirit to hail.  I talked to some other shammy friends who said &quot;10 minutes for the first spirit, tops.&quot;  <br />
<br />
At this point, I did a petition but had to log for some RL happenings.  Now, I'm gemless again and hoping a GM will give me a hand.  Man, I hated running through Freeport sweating over the random invis timer of mine that always drops at the wrong moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ahrwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First post here...frustrated enough to actually type it out lol.<br />
<br />
Ok, this &quot;Test of Patience&quot; has ganked me twice now.  First attempt I actually waited for 3 hours underwater (at the correct location) and never saw a single spirit....BAH!  Luckily after speaking to a GM, I got my gem back...and with refreshed enthusiasm, I tried again.<br />
<br />
Second attempt...waited yet another 2 hours+ and guess what...NOTHING.  This time there were actually 3 or 4 Ooglyn's on the island at the spawn point, doing a continuous walk into the water and de-spawning into that lovely boat we all know and love.  Hopefully I'll be able to get my gem back from yet another GM...again.<br />
<br />
I'm stumped, I've followed the guides step by step both times to no avail.  GM's have no advice for me, other shammy's are saying &quot;10 mins for first spawn at the most&quot; and all I can think is what in the heck am I doing wrong?!?!  At least now I know I'm not the only one  :)  Any help or advice on this matter would be highly appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its currently broken due a recent patch, GMs and guides may not realise whats going on as they don't have the devs at thier beck and call.<br />
<br />
Try and get your gem reimbursed again and wait until we see a patch messages stating that this part of the quest is fixed before trying again or bring along some folks who can help you train and mem blur the NPCs, see the epic quest faq for a link to a thread where folks were discussing blurring/FDing Ooglyn into action to work around the problem. <br />
<br />
In the meantime /feedback with details about the problem you have had or /bug if you are at the spot where it happens. <br />
<br />
Heres hoping its fixed soon, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you to Yojadi, GM on the Seventh Hammer!<br />
<br />
I tried the test of patience last week and had Ooglah run into the boat and get stuck, wihich of course means none of the quest guys spawned.<br />
<br />
Tonight I turned in the gem to Ooglah again (only takes 20 minutes to get another one).  Since there were three Ooglah's up I was pretty sure it was still bugged so I followed her to the boat and sure enough she got stuck.  I headed out to the loc and petitioned.  Took about 45 minutes but Yojadi was a pure pleasure of a GM, once he verified I was in the zone and had attempted to do the quest correctly he spawned Ooglah and had her come to her proper place under water.  This sets the rest of the quest in motion.  45 minutes later I had my arrow from Abe and my gem from the spirit.<br />

Safe journeys,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I tried the test of patience on friday night and it was bugged for me as well. hopeing to have a friend agro her past the boat for me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did they fix the pathing bug with Test of Patience today?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Northbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ooglyn still gets her large arse stuck in the boat.  However I started from 0 and finished up the Test of Wisdom this morning.  Here is my simple work around.  Just wait for Ooglyn to get almost to the boat, slow her, and swim a bit past.  She will follow you out.  Hit her with Instill.  Back up, sit, camp.  Log right back in, wait for root to break.  She will then continue on to the waiting place.  Everything is peachy keen ducky after that point... :D .  Good luck to ya.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spookem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yup or get a gateing friend to agro her and haul her past the boats and gate worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Is it possible to bind at the wait spot, aggro her around the boat and gate back, waiting for her to show up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kermeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Is it possible to bind at the wait spot, aggro her around the boat and gate back, waiting for her to show up?<br />
<br />
You can do that, but you do not lose aggro using gate.  I just did this today and had a monk pull her with me to the spot, and then FD.  She then stood there for 3 mins, and darted off after saying something.  Then the 4 spirits spawned in order throughout the next 30 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Hoping to get my epic this week. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yup, I tried it before reading this and, wouldn't you know it, Ooglyn came back to spank me. So I ran like hell to shore and camped out, then camped in and gated back to the bind point at the waiting spot. 45 minutes later the Greater Spirit gives me my gem and I'm off to get ready to turn in my Boots.<br />
<br />
I had my Paladin solo the Black Dire the the other day while he was camping a spare Soulfire hilt. Wasn't even that hard with his self-buffs only.<br />
<br />
Once I have those boots I can start the grind to 46 and the wait for the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Finally completed this on Zeb last night.  It took 3 tries in total, 2 of which were yesterday.  Prior to my second attempt, I received a replacement gem from a GM and was told that the last patch had fixed the entire quest.  This is incorrect.  As a matter of fact, it's even more broken now than ever.<br />
<br />
2nd Attempt:  Ooglyn is on the move with no turn-in from me.  I stop her, hail her, turn in the gem to her: POOF!  She's friggin GONE!  She despawned right there in front of me.  Went to the wait spot, no spirits.<br />
<br />
3rd Attempt:  A guide says that there were 2 Ooglyns in the zone when I made my 2nd attempt.  He killed one.  Of course Guides cannot reimburse... back to the GM queue.  <br />
<br />
Six hours later, I receive a gem from another GM.  I figure now is the best time to try it since the previous Guide killed the dupe Ooglyn.  I drag my SK buddy out to Erud's Crossing yet again.  This time, there were still 2 Ooglyns.  1 was standing at her spawn point.  <br />
<br />
After watching for a minute, we noticed that a 2nd Ooglyn spawned at the same spot and then started to walk toward the boat.  So, now, we have 2 Ooglyns.  One doesn't move, and the other doesn't stand still.  This time, I do my turn-in to the Ooglyn who is stationary.  She doesn't move.  She never moves.  But the other one was headed to the boat as usual and my buddy was waiting at the boat to aggro her if necessary.  <br />
<br />
Well, this time, the moving Ooglyn didn't despawn in the boat right away, so my SK buddy aggro's her beyond the boat and then FD's her off.  She continues to the wait spot and the spirits start to spawn.<br />
<br />
So, this can be done, but it's far from resolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Why wait 6 hours for a GM who may not even give you another gem when you can get another yourself in about 20 minutes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Troll + Freeport = Pain in the arse.<br />
<br />
I played for 6 hours, didn't just wait.<br />
I knew he would give me a gem since it was my 2nd try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bearfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">completed this part last night - handed in gem to Ooglyn and off she went - swimming into sea. I read 2 walkthroughs the one on eqshaman and the one on allakhazam, both give the correct loc to wait at. I guessed that something was wrong when there were 4 other Ooglyns walking up and down beach also, all walking to the sea swimming out and a few moments later coming back, walking around in a cirlce and swimming out again. The walkthrough on eqshaman says dont bother if she doesnt show up as its not important, this is wrong it is important. SO i waited and waited etc and petitioned and waited, about an hour or so later a GM spawns and we discuss it and he aggroed her around the boat where she sticks and turns up and then so do the rest of the spawns as per the walkthrough and you should get a gem and a broken arrow and thats that.<br />
so until its fixed you do need to aggor her around the boat - somehow the GM suggested a chanter with mem blur as one method, a horrible quest part for a newbie who doesnt know whats going on - worst part is because its the test of PATIENCE peeps will wait and wait and wait for ages before they do anything, not even knowing there is anything wrong.<br />
So at least petitioning will help - dont bother getting the gem back - tell them to get an Ooglyn to get to the loc of waiting.</div></div><hr />
