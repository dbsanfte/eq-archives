<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i know the general idea is ac/hp is more important than Wisdom.  But is there a minimum wisdom needed?  My 31 barb shaman has a wisdom of 113 with bear form (108 without it).  Is this too low<br />
?  Should i get some more wis items?<br />
  Or should I keep concentrating on gettign more ac/hp gear?  Right now i''ve been working on upgrading my overall ac by replacing my banded hear.  For jewelry i have 2 +2 wis rings, orc fang earring and a polished bone earring.  Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You may want to balance a bit more. Look for wis items that won't sacrifice too much AC/HP's. <br />
At 34 and upper levels HP's will more important as your regen spell will improve. Chloroplast makes a difference. I hover around 134 without bearform and have 815 unbuffed AC. My HP's leave a little to be desired but I'm an Iksar and I fall short on the HP totem anyway. I'm rarely LoM and never OOM. I could proabably use more Wis as a surplus of mana never hurt anyone. But I won't get more wis if I have to sacrifice too much AC. <br />
If you find that you are running out of mana very quickly, you may want to invest in some wis +mana items that give AC as well. That way you aren't sacrificing too much AC. <br />
<br />
If you got a Magelo profile better upgrade ideas can be given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't have a magelo profile because i can't get magelo to work.  In both IE and Netscape 6.2 i get blank profiles and &quot;security exceptions&quot; when i visit it.  But here is what my shammy has right now<br />
<br />
Head: Rygorr <br />
Neck: Rygorr<br />
Face: Split Paw<br />
Ear1: Orc Fang<br />
Ear2: Polished Bone Hoop (has mana conservation 1, how much mana does that actually save?)<br />
Fingers: 2 +2 wis rings<br />
CHest: rygorr<br />
Wrist: Black Alloy and Ulthork Hide <br />
Arm: Barbed Armplates<br />
Hand: Totemic<br />
Shoulder: BA spaulder<br />
back: banded<br />
belt: Thick Leather Apron<br />
Legs: Black Alloy<br />
Feet: Totemic<br />
<br />
Weapon: Beetle Stinger<br />
Shield: Hallowed Koada'Dal Rib Cage<br />
<br />
(I jus today picked up the ulthork bracer to replace a banded one, some ac +1 wis, -1 int)<br />
<br />
I currently have about 100pp although I can easily go to Rathe with the guild for more PP<br />
<br />
My AC unbuffed is 546, HP unbuffed is 646<br />
my stats (with shield)<br />
Str: 124, Sta: 104, Agi 81, Dex: 76, Wis: 109<br />
<br />
Any advice or thoughts?  Was thinking of going to Neth Lair to get a soiled breachcltoh (legs 8ac 3wis) and possibly buying a black sapphire silver necklace 3ac/30mana/30hp but i'd have to lose the rygorr neck 9ac/4sta/10mana/4svmagic...<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Head, Arms, Boots. JB. Almost given away... might be able to get as low as 300pp apiece<br />
<br />
Fingers.... AC/HP rings... 4/45 will run you 80pp apiece tops.<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Tattered Mantle. 100pp probably. 12ac and 20hps = good. DR is nice in Sebilis when you get a bit higher ;)<br />
<br />
Wrist - Not many choices... Sentry is nice because AC is decent, and theres 3wis... don't entirely neglect wis, just put it on the back burner :)<br />
<br />
Legs - Try to quest your totemic. Otherwise, I'd go with Ry'Gorr legs.<br />
<br />
Face - Crystal Spider eyes. These Rot often in velks because they are so common. ask a higher level friend to pick you up one.<br />
<br />
Weapon - Try to get a Jade Chokai Prod or something like it. Spine chill spear / Slime coated harpoon are good too.<br />
<br />
Shield... Definitely Clay Guardian... sort of a poor man's SBS, but it gets the job done. 25 ad and a hefty 50 hps... with the added plus that it's maybe 500pp tops :)<br />
<br />
I know getting the cash for this stuff is going to suck, but if you can replace a piece every now and then, it all adds up.</div></div><hr />
