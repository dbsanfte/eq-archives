Updated to be a group spell and have 6 chances to remove detrimental spells. From experience this a pretty good chance of removing a detrimental spell. Essentially a castable radiant cure 3 for counterless spells on demand. If it goes live like that it will be pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My big problem is we already HAVE an ability to remove detrimental effects from group members. I really appreciate Pure Spirit for a chance to remove detrimental effects OUT of group.<br />
<br />
I'm not excited about the change at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm looking into it a bit more it I guess it's a gain some loose some situation. Still single target but can only be cast on people in group but much more likely to actually be useful. Over all i'd say it's much more useful but it's also going to be a bit of a pain to use since you'll have to rearange groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm split on that. Yes radiant cure can remove from group but it's a 2-3 minute reuse depending on aa's. <br />
<br />
Considering at least three other classes have RC (clerics, druids, paladins), re-use isn't that much of a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Considering at least three other classes have RC (clerics, druids, paladins), re-use isn't that much of a problem.<br />
<br />
Yeah radiant cure isn't shaman only but still couldn't get radiant cures going as quickly as you could cure with pure spirit. Even a group with 6 curer with max haste aa would still only be a cure every 20 seconds which is slightly slower than 15-18 seconds for pure spirit. I'm thinking for something like tallon zek in time that procs some mean debuffs that aren't other wise curable. Pure spirit should be able to keep a tank cure but RC isn't gonna be practical.<br />
<br />
I'm still split on the changes. It is much more likely to cure something now but it's limited to group only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it were a group spell, and castable outside group, it wouldn't be just another pointless and useless spell. I'd make a comment about spell designers, but someone more eloquent and venomous will do it shortly, I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like the changes myself.<br />
<br />
Resplendent Cure has a Remove Detrimental (15) according to Lucy and the fastest recast possible is every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Now, there aren't many (if any) AE's that mobs use that I can think of that have no counters, but I think Pure Spirit in the Test Server form would be nice to have for those rare occassions.<br />
<br />
Certainly much better that Pure Spirit is in it's current form.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This makes the spell totally worthless. The best thing about Pure Spirit was that you could cure people out of group on raids. What a shame.</div></div><hr />

No. I already know that this was the justification for it to be &quot;nerfed&quot;. God forbid we'd get something that others do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NereasAequitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On a semi related note; on test does the spell give a message indicating that &quot;Your target has been cured.&quot; yet?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's what I liked best about it, we got something unique and special. A group cure nearly identical to RC - /yawn.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I am wrong, but Pure Spirit looks like it's single target still, not group...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jkana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To side track a second, will pure spirit remove effects that have counters (poison, curse, etc.) or does it only work on counterless effects?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They made it Radiant Cure 3, without the disease/curse/poison cure.  So the spell has less utility overall.  They should have increased the curing power and left it single target.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you're right. I was actually looking at the Live version still for some reason and Target:type was obviously reading &quot;single&quot;. <br />
The change to group is certainly nice, but I would have preferred it to stay single and be able to cast it out of group, honestly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cast cures on people out of group all the time! RGC twice in Uqua for that lousy snare all the time, or cure disease in Phase 5 in Time, not to mention how many people I could cure at Quarm if Nadox worked out of group.<br />

Yep, taraddar is correct. It's a group only single target cur for detrimental effects.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Group only, but single-target cure. 6 second cast, 12 second recast. Lets assume its affected by spell hastes, so reduce the casting time to 3 seconds minimum. That means 15 total time per cast. Which means that when your group gets dotted, you will spend the next 90 seconds curing a single DoT on your group-=-although you probably won't, since by then the half of the group unlucky enough to be at the bottom of your casting order are probably already dead from whatever hit them... :(<br />

Just some confirmation - are there currently any classes that can remove detrimental effects out of group?<br />
<br />
Yes. Clerics have an AA (with a 30 minute reuse timer) which effectively removes all detrimental spells from a single target. (Purify Soul (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2742))</div></div><hr />

It's because the only Detrimental Pure Spirit has a chance of removing is the counterless kind.<br />
<br />
If the AE has any kind of counters, Pure Spirit is useless against it.</div></div><hr />

This is a pretty key point. If they are going to change the spell to &quot;castable on group members only&quot; they should at LEAST make it &quot;chance to cure whole group&quot;, like Blood of Nadox (cant TGB). Having to spend so much time individually curing group members with a single target spell is ridiculous. Either or, for me, cure whole group in one shot, or singe-targetable out of group.</div></div><hr />

Quoted for truth.<br />
<br />
For the spell to be worth casting at all it needs a decent chance of curing an effect. For the spell to be worth a spell gem, time and mana to me it needs to either affect multiple people or affect people I can not already cure with radiant.<br />
<br />
If these conditions are not met I will only use the spell if I have literally nothing else to do. Since I have the ability to cast heals and I can swing a hammer this is not likely.<br />

Thanks Ry, that clears it up. Works for me, I used it the other night on some stupid epic mobs AE, worked like a charm.</div></div><hr />

3. Does it effect detrimental spells that have counters?<br />

3. No, it's not a cure, it's a dispell for detrimental effects<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that the &quot;remove detrimental&quot; respects disease, curse and poison counters.<br />
<br />
&quot;cancel magic&quot; (a different effect) is the one that kills just non-counter based effects for sure.<br />
<br />
This is now sounding very much like the level 40 monk skill &quot;Tranquil Force&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The major difference is that the Monk skill is combat related and works only on themselves and ours is castable and useable on somebody else.<br />
<br />
Also, the monk's removes 9 detrimental as opposed to our 6.  <br />
<br />
Any monks here who can answer if theirs removes pr/cu/dr based dots?</div></div><hr />

Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease Curse Counter by 16 <br />
2:  Decrease Poison Counter by 16 <br />
3:  Decrease Disease Counter by 16 <br />
4:  Remove Detrimental(6) <br />
<br />
Detrimental is not the same as those with counters.<br />
<br />
Malos is a detrimental and so is Snare for example.  Both of Which can be cured with RC3.</div></div><hr />

Malos has no counters. :p <br />
<br />
Also the live version is still the crappy one so you might want to try that malos/curing game a few times and see how often it works before you form an opinion of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Doh!  You're right Murtak.  Gotta stop doing things late at night.  Tried it again today while awake.  It does not appear to remove Turgur's (counters).  It always gives the message that your spirit has been purified even when it doesn't work.  <br />
<br />
I cast malos on myself 50 times and got the following breakdown for curing:<br />
<br />
# of casts to cure / Frequency / %<br />
<br />
1  /  27 / 54%<br />
2  /  12 / 24%<br />

5  /  1  /  2%<br />
6  /  2  /  4%<br />
7  /  1  /  2%<br />
<br />
If I only rarely need to cast a second time to cure it would be useable.  However, if I can't count on it working it would be better for me to do patch heals and use RC from time to time.  I'm hoping the changes on test move this up to a viable spell.</div></div><hr />

Well since on tests one cast of the new spell is 6 chances to cure or 6 casts of old one in your test that would mean 98% of the time it would have been cured in one cast =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Just tested after the 12-15 patch.  Improved but still not very good.  I didn't write down what I did but did about 30 casts.  Can still take up to 3 casts to cure. =/  Also has real long cast/recast.  Hard to justify using during a fight.  Would only be able to do 1 person, and not reliably.  Patch healing would still be better if needed.  Only good for curing after a fight or removing malos from yourself for those oops! moments. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I used it to remove the TZ (from the RZ event) spell effect. Cured with one cast iirc. I think it worked on the MA outside of my group also. I wish it had the &quot;Your target has been cured&quot; message. <br />

It's more effective than &lt;a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=212&amp;source=Live&gt;cure blindness&lt;/a&gt; has ever been for me. Has anyone ever had this spell work? Seems I just chain cast it on people and they keep saying they're blind. Main place I remember using it was in CoM on the black reavers.</div></div><hr />

the Druid epic 1.5 mob.  Took me 3 casts on myself to clear once to confirm it would work on the DoT.  Then spammed the MT with it but was never able to cure MT.  Mob died while I was still trying to cure.  Druid cured with Radiant Cure.  =/</div></div><hr />

I was chain casting it as best you cant chain cast a long refresh spell, but it never worked.  At one point we had 4 of 6 charmed but still managed to pull out the win.  I dont understand.  Does charm have counters?  I always used a dispell to remove charm.  Would be nice to know exatly how this spell is supposed to work.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

You asked and answered your own question. Basically, any detrimental effect you COULD remove in the past, via a spell like dispells or cures, will NOT be affectable by Pure Spirit. Pure Spirit is disigned to gte rid of effect that have NO current spell-version cure. <br />
<br />
That being said, I am not saying the spell is good in its current form. I have it on a spell-set though, and have used it a couple times, but I tend to fight in all variety of zones, from Time to Ikky Raids to Ikky Singles to PG Singles. Honestly, its not much different than our other cure-spell lineup, like Blood of Nadox and RGC. Situational, but nice to have when I need them.<br />
<br />
Could use a bump though, for sure. If I am going to take the time to mem it, it should rarely NOT cure the effect, rather than visa-versa. It should definitely succeed a much larger percent of the time.</div></div><hr />

Isnt that why EQ is a joy to play? Lots of shaman spells but most of them are extremly hard to land or rather useless.<br />
<br />
You would be much better off bringing some more tanks or damagedealers with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I think EQ is fun to play because of the skill, timing, and strategy needed to progress.  The RNG adds spice to it all.  However, when the RNG dominates it is not fun.  With this spell it's all RNG and not skill or strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I tried Pure Spirit again after trying it on the Blackened Dryad event as above.  This time it worked better but it's really a matter of how the RNG is working.  The latest results I got for 50 casts was:<br />
<br />
# of casts to cure/frequency/%<br />
<br />
1 / 39 / 78%<br />
2 / 8 / 16%<br />
3 / 2 / 4%<br />
4 / 1 / 2%<br />
<br />
Total / 50 / 100%<br />
<br />
You get a &quot;cure&quot; emote even when it doesn't work.  Has an 18 sec cycle (6 sec cast plus 12 sec refresh).  Might be able to get it down to a ~16 sec cycle with spell haste focus.<br />
<br />
You really can only use this to keep 1 player up (probably the MT).  Extra shamans with this spell would increase the success rate.  Unless removing the effect is the difference between success or failure on the Boss mob it would probably do more to go to dps/healing instead.</div></div><hr />
