<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The speed at which OoW mobs hit had brought back the more traditional group makeup in places like WoS.  But it's still sometimes difficult to find pick up groups on my server.  I was wondering if anyone else has solo spots for EXp they would care to share.<br />
<br />
I did some soloing in Noble's Causeway.  The Murks just down the cliff from the tunnel to WoS.  They gave about 1 tick per kill and took around 4+ minutes each using the root/ DoT method.  I'd pull with slow, root &amp; malos them and cast Epic DoT, Ultors and Bane.  With BA4, ET4 and CA1 it took about 2 castings of Ultors, 3 Epics, and 5-6 Bane casts to kill each mob.  They hit for 600ish max and usually around 200.  The were seemed to always resist poison so don't bother with those Dots.  They cast a short ranged poison of thier on that's more annoying than threatening.<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any zones/ camps that folks can add for similiar or better EXP.  Since I'm a root/ Dot'er  some zones simply don't work well because mobs summon.<br />
<br />
Hope we can open up a discussion for post 65 solo spots to fill downtime for regular EXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was doing these also, but had no problems with landing Poison Dots, maybe because I just always pull with Malos, the Root, slow, and stack my Dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what kind of gear you hav Kabuk, but you can probably duo quite easily with a BL, Monk, Pally, SK, Ranger or Warrior in WoS. I even duoed with a Necro there, despite the fact that they summon. We would swap aggro, with him FDing while I healed myself, then healing him while the mob hits on me, etc etc. Also have duoed in WoS with a Monk, a BL and a Ranger. XP is respectable for sure, even if the mobs take a bit longer to kill. Depending who your partner is, you will probably have some downtime as well, which isnt necessarily a bad thing. <br />
<br />
As for solo, the only mobs I have tried so far are the Murks in NC as well. They were a cinch though, and give about .75% reg XP per kill in 66. Not shabby, that probably translates to 6 or 7% of an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I to find Blood of Saryn is rarely resisted after casting malos on mob.  I always cast malos anytime I root dot mobs in the belief that it makes root break less often and the mana cost is recovered in less resist on the dot's.  Xp on the Nobels Causway muckgliders seemed a bit smaller to me, thought it was 1% every 3 kills or maybe 2% every 5, but wasn't watching too closely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dual-box my shaman and warrior and its fine.  Notthe best, but very easy.<br />
<br />
Up to WoS zone in area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To speed up kills a bit, after you have initially slowed, rooted and have dots layed on, when root breaks send in pet (taunt off) and just aggro kit. The jelly boys are slow and run at ~15% health. This really only works at either the WoS and Dranik zone lines as both ends have a nice large kite area. <br />
<br />
Hit box on them are small.<br />
<br />
Only some have the AE, most of those only 1, a few have 2 AE they use.<br />
<br />
Used them to help a cleric friend get his last 10% in 59 and mobs conned white to yellow to him. Xp for him was 1% in 59 and 1.5% in 60. At both levels straight aaxp was 3.5% a kill. In comparison, gargs in PoN (57-58 level) gave 5-6% aaxp at 59-60.<br />
<br />
Solo I have found the straight xp ~1% per 3-4 kills. AAxp 3-5%. As you go further in xp increases, but is nothing stellar.</div></div><hr />
