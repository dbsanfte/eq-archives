<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just saw this over on EQ Vault and thought I would repost it here.  Not sure how many are still useing DX7 but I am.  I also remember all the problems I had on one of my computers and the week or so I could not get it on line when VI upgraded to DX 7.  So this should be and interesting time for alot of us soon:( .<br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering unleashed some important news on the Developer's Corner. Catch the full story here:<br />
<br />
In the next month or so, prior to the release of EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, we will be moving to DirectX 8. This will be true not just for those purchasing Shadows of Luclin, but for everyone playing EverQuest. <br />
<br />
In fact, some time soon, prior to the new interface rollout, we will be giving everyone the DirectX 8 version of the graphics engine dll. This will give players the option of using the new dll to help us find any hardware incompatibilities prior to the time we move to DirectX 8 game-wide. We'll be testing as many configurations as we possibly can in-house, but with the huge number of possible hardware configurations we can't test them all. The plan here is to nail the problems down now and have as many of you updated to DirectX8 as soon as we can before we make the switchover. <br />
<br />
Why are we doing this? Well, you'll need it to use the new interface and we need it for all of the good things it lets us do for the game, primarily improving framerates (yes, even in the old world and even if you don't buy Shadows of Luclin). For a good idea of the new features we'll be able to implement with DirectX 8, check out our latest In Development (the EVERQUEST TECH DOCUMENT at the bottom). <br />
<br />
Upgrading to DirectX 8 is pretty simple. Here's what you do: <br />
<br />
1) Download DirectX 8.0a. Store it in a directory so you can find it when you need it in a few minutes, but don't install it yet. You can find them on Microsoft's site. Make certain to get the driver that is appropriate for your operating system. <br />
<br />
2) Locate the most recent drivers for you video card and download them into the same folder (this makes them easier to find). Don't install these yet either. Do this even if you have the latest drivers installed. If they have a text file with installation instructions, you might want to get that too (or print it out). <br />
<br />
3) Locate the most recent drivers for you sound card and download them into the same folder. Again, don't install these yet, and go ahead and download them even if you have the latest drivers installed. You might also want to get any installation instructions for the drivers. You're going to need to reinstall them shortly, so it's best to have them on hand. <br />
<br />
4) Set your video adapter to the Standard Display Adapter (VGA)<br />
The steps required to do this will probably vary for each of you a little bit. But here are the steps I followed to change this on my computer (keep in mind that I am using Win 98 and the procedure will be different if you're using Win 2k or XP):<br />
a) Click Start, then Settings, then Control Panel.<br />
b) Double Click on Display<br />
c) Click on the Settings Tab. Then click on the Advanced Button.<br />
d) Click on the Adapter Tab, then choose Change.<br />
e) Click Next.<br />
f) Select the radial button (the little circle) next to the option for Display a list of all drivers and click Next.<br />
g) Select the button next to the option for Show all hardware.<br />
h) Scroll to the top of the list and select (standard display types). Then from the window on the right choose standard display adapter (VGA) and click Next.<br />
i) It will ask you if you really, really want to use this adapter. Choose yes. <br />
<br />
5) Now install DirectX 8.0a by finding it in your folder and double clicking it. Follow the instructions for installation. <br />
<br />
6) NOW you need to reinstall your video drivers. Use the new ones that you saved in that folder. Follow the instructions for installation given by the manufacturer. <br />
<br />
7) Install the latest sound drivers for you sound card, also following the instructions given by the manufacturer. <br />
<br />
That should be it. You may want to reboot after this if the last driver installation didn't already force you to do it, just to make sure. <br />
<br />
NOTE: It is important to reinstall the latest video and sound drivers after you install DX 8. <br />
<br />
Yes, if you read that carefully you noticed that I said something about a new interface. We will be releasing a new and impressively customizable interface to all EverQuest players with the release of Shadows of Luclin. I don't have a lot of details for you about the new interface at this time. I can tell you that we think you'll be very impressed with it. The main feature of this new interface will be the customizability that it gives the players. We're still building it, so I can't really elaborate, but there is no doubt in my mind that you'll be impressed, or in the least intrigued. :)<br />
<br />
We wanted to let you know about this as soon as we could to give you as much time as possible to make the upgrade. Please consider updating to DirectX 8.0a as soon as possible. EverQuest runs fine with DirectX 8 now, so you shouldn't see any problems running EverQuest after the update. <br />
<br />
We will be double-checking our audio and video support page to make certain that it is up to date. If you need help with audio or video problems, including finding a driver for your cards and identifying your cards, check out our Audio and Video Support page. <br />

Lets hope this upgrade goes better than the last one<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been using DX8 for a while and recently upgraded to the DX8.1 RC2 version that was released.  Performance is great and it fixed a few graphic glitches that I had.  Getting your system up and ready for the DX8 change is probably a good idea.  Why wait until you have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The reason I have not upgraded yet is my older computer has an older graphics card in it.  Last I checked (which has been several months now) the card manufacture did not have a compatable video driver for DX8.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Upgraded my home system to DX8 and the new Detonator drivers this weekend.<br />
<br />
<br />
While everything is running fine, and video performance seems to be just a bit better, my zone times went up dramatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a moldy ATI rage 8 meg card.<br />
<br />
I had dx 7 on it and it more or less did ok untill VI up graded to dx 7. At that time the gamma setting was fixed but I then got lots of vidio bugs and memory leaks. Things like the 5th time I would zone, all the walls would go black.<br />
<br />
DX 8a fixed that for me even though the old card dosnt offically have dx8 driver support.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure when VI goes DX8, I will have bigtime problems again :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Since I can't afford a new comp at the moment, I'll get a G2 card which will put me at SoL min requirements and hope for the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For those interested in an upgrade check out www.priceline.com.<br />
<br />
The new Geforce2 Ti cards are the best bang for the bucks.  Since VI is implementing the new engine around Nvidia cards it would be best to stick with them.  The first engine was programmed for the old 3DFX cards and still runs very well on them.</div></div><hr />
