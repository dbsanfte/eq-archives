<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other night I sat down and decided I was going to solo some G/W's for Malo.  Well, the slowing part was pretty easy as I made sure I had long pulls to get a few shots of it in.  Here is what I was running:<br />
<br />
4300 hps buffed (had Aego, KEI, Focus, Boar, Agi, Replenish on)<br />
AC of 1050ish <br />
FR of about 110<br />
No Jbone<br />
Horse<br />
<br />
I used Bane, Pox and Ebolt to do the crux of my damage, trying to sneak in an epic here and there.  Got behind in the damage curve a few too many times and had to TMend to catch back up for torpor again.<br />
<br />
I have nada for AA btw.<br />
<br />
So, that being said, I got one to 37% and lost in the end.  Probably had maybe 20% of my mana left (took a stun a few too many times in a row).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now a few questions:<br />
<br />
Mana was a real issue for me especially after having to toss a Mend.  Should I be relying more on straight Bane and Pox and not toss on the Ebolt?  <br />
<br />
Should Torpor be automatically on for me and never let it drop?<br />
<br />
I'm new to the basic premise of this and Skyfire isn't exactly a ressing cleric paradise.  I ended up going back with a 62 Paladin to slap them up some and got Enforced Reverance for someone in my old guild, but honestly I'd like to do this solo.<br />
<br />
Any input would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've soloed a lot of Guardian Wurms and they are pretty fun. It really helps to have Cann5 but you could probably do without it. Use max regen, keep torpor up the whole time and fight on the zone wall to prevent adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you use your dots, do you use Bane and Ebolt and Pox or just Bane and Pox?  Mana was a bit of an issue for me.  Got it to about 30% and then started realizing he was going to have a bear Kabob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you have your pet up? You pet can add a descent amount of dmg to the fight and doesn't need much mana input once the fight has started. Just park him someplace and drag the fight to him once you've got him debuffed.<br />
<br />
You don't include your lvl or a link to your gear so not sure where you stand on that. If you have an affliction efficency or extend afflction item definitely use them. If you don't have either the coldain military bracer is an easy to get extend afflction item.<br />
<br />
For these types of fights there are 2 ways you can go. You can lay heavy on the dots and hopefully kill it before you run out of mana. The other option is the slow and steady method. For slow and steady you just use pet/ JBB/Epic etc for damage and spend your mana healing yourself. It won't die quickly but should die eventually. If you are FM and have mana to burn then you can use a dot.<br />
<br />
As far as healing goes I would probably torpor when ever you get down to 75-80% or so and cann if you aren't full mana. Keep yourself healed and keep the fight going and you will win eventually. Epic when you can, dot when you have mana to burn and let those and pet take him down.<br />
<br />
With more aa skill/better gear/higher end spells it is possible to just dot the heck out of them and have them die before you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">adding plague instead of ebolt will save you alot of mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks guys for all your input.  Going to shift to a steady stream version using Pox, Plague, Bane and Epic and try that instead.  Fast and Furious isn't going to work with my mana base I think.<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn't list my gear, it's why I put the stats down instead.  62 shaman, nothing special.  I changed to straight hp's for PoP since I wasn't mitigating crap with an 1150 ac.  I may shift back to more AC but I doubt it unless I do it in one big chunk on a specific item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kagrobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have done Gw's with a 2 boxed paladin(63), then with a necro (62) and then a cleric (62) ... when i dinged level 60 I decided to &quot;sow my ogre oracle oats&quot; and solo 55-60 lv mobs a bit just to get the hang of mana managment, hp losses and topor.  Here is how i pull and kill GW's without Malo or Pox ( whole reason i go kill them besides the fact that it is FUN!! ) <br />
<br />
<br />
get to island to the east of VP ent get pet up buffed regened hasted ect I have always been cleric and chanter buffed prior to going to SF to do this ( so not a real solo guys ).  Park the pet there, go pull a GW's from either VP ent (static) or a roaming one ( path from VP to zone wall and back rather slow so take your time picking the right one ).  I use lev and sowboots to make it easier.  Pull target with Malo ( i use malonise due to not having malo i have NEVER had it resisted ) start walking the GW back to the island keeping an  eye out for adds, if you do get a add ROOT it fast and keep moving towards island, if you are far enough away when root breaks or wears off the mob will reset till you go near it again.  On the way back to the island slow the mob, and when you get back to the island ROOT it ... cripple, canni canni canni canni Topor back up ... then when fm reslow and use epic ( the dot starts off slow and will not get you summoned right away for a few ticks ) cast plauge ( long cast time and lasts longer than Bane and E-Bolt ... this will get you summoned.  Then cast your favorite line of dots dd or what ever you like best,  rinse and repeat dots until he is dead, I have found that without PoX i have to reslow at about 20% to be safe for the last few seconds of the fight,  I do not have the real nice hp chewing dots yet.  The pet is for nothing more than extra dmg output and he uses war disc &quot;shield&quot; on you when you get low on hp if it is going bad.  Best I have done on this is ending the fight with 80% -100% hp and 25% -45% mana range ... I had a Jbb but sold it due to long recast interupts and just plain borring to right click over and over.  I do have a horse and will sometime sumon it while fighting  depending on how the GW is taking the spells ( i like to shrink 2 times so i do not have a targeting problem ).. I find the most annoying thing is when the GW's drop 4pp heh oh well<br />
<br />
spells gotten in 20 kills that are worth mentioning:<br />
<br />
Word of redemption ( cleric lv 60 group complete heal )<br />
Word or restoration ( cleric lv ?? group heal for ??)<br />
Mask of the Hunter ( lv 60 druid self buff mana regen spell )<br />
lv 59 necro pet child of TT ?( forget the name but made a guildmate without pop rather happy )<br />
<br />
 plus assorted common spells  <br />
<br />
I have NO aa and decent gear overall some items nice some so so, i can self buff up to 255 str 255 stam 230 agi 255 dex and with kei 255 wis ( if you have Infusion of Spirit I recomend using that kraggs and agi stam str dex to get more overall ), i think i have about a 4k mana pool to start with and with Aego Brells i am sitting with 4190 hp area. I have no extended affliction gear ( looking for some ) but do use a improved range 3 item and a ODS for mana conservation 3.<br />
