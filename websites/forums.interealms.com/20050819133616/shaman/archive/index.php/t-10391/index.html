<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all-<br />
<br />
Level 40 Shaman here, decided to go look up Prince Skiratat (sp) to pick up a Brain of the Beaked Bear thingy for range slot:<br />
<br />
Brain of the Beaked Bear <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP Held <br />
Slot: RANGE <br />
AC: 4 <br />
Skill Mod: Meditate +4% <br />
WIS: +4 HP: +4 MANA: +4 SV DISEASE: +4 <br />
WT: 5.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Class: CLR PAL RNG DRU SHM BST <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Not uber by any means, but it might be a fun change from the Goranga Idol and Slime Harpoon I currently use for Wis/AC as needed.  Never had a med increase item, and it's free.<br />
<br />
Never done anything on the Moon before (quit EQ for about a year before Luclin came out) so I get my trusty EQ Atlas map, find the owlbear caves and head out.<br />
<br />
As I approach I see a few green and L blue grimmlings outside the  cave.   Hmm, lets see what happens if I pull one....<br />
<br />
OK these light blue bastards cast like crazy and Summon??<br />
Oh btw the greens hit for 50-60 with my 900+AC.  Did I mention they Summon? Killed 3 or 4 with dogdog but eventually died.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?  I invised into the caves after my CR and all I saw were more of the bastard grimlings.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated, I decided to do this for sh*ts and grins, but now it's personal. Hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Getting the named is a task for a full group of 40s.  You can do it solo in the mid 50s.  Easiest is to invis back into the cave where named is pull out pet and kill the other mobs before named.  Then you have a little time to kill named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you could do this now but you would need at least 2 other 40's ish people. Invis run into cave wipe out the other owlbears as they're no a 1min timer fast and take out the nameds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grimlings in da cave?  Sounds like you were there after one of the wars in that zone.<br />
<br />
If you see either sonic wolves or grimilings up near that owl bear cave, you will not find any owl bears in there.  I dunno the story line, but periodically one of the three groups in that zone will attack another one, and the war results in one type of mob being wiped ut for a period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If there's grimlings in the cave, the owlbears won't be up. As for the summoning mobs, there will often be two or three at the entrance to the cave that are rooted in place and summon. Easiest way to tell until you get them figured out is to pull with a non-damage spell. If they don't come after you, it's a good bet that they'll start summoning you if you do over 100pts of damage. <br />
<br />
The good news is that the princ doesn't spawn inside the cave. I've killed him 3 times while farming pelts for the rallic pack and every time he was among the roamers outside. Dunno if he's triggered or a random pop though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm pretty much an expert on hollowshade.<br />
<br />
Prince does spawn outside, but if grimlings hold the cave there is nothing you can do about it until the zone is reset because the war script really doesn't work. If things are working properly, eventually one of the races (with help) will take over the zone and spawn a named in the Vah Shir fort to be killed.<br />
<br />
As for the summoning mobs these are part of the war event. When a race is currently being attacked a group of rooted, summoning mobs will spawn outside the cave. If you kill them, then the attacking race will win. They all have names like grimling defender or something like that. If the group of defenders is up you don't want to mess with them by yourself.<br />
<br />
As for farming the prince, wait until owl bears are up and kill as many as you can outside the cave. Make sure you loot perfects too, don't know about other servers but can still get 200pp for them in baz on Torv. <br />
<br />
I found best way to kill owl bears at that level is to charm one of the higher level ones rather then using dog dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Btw, Prince Skriat is a wimp.  Far weaker than even the razorbeaks.  I first soloed him at 27th level but it was close.  After 30th he was gravy but i still couldn't do the razorbeaks.<br />
<br />
Best advice to finding him is borrow a ranger friend and slaughter the zone right after a server reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was heading to Shar Vahl one day when I ran across the mob that dropped that item you mentioned.  He was pretty sissy.  It's hard to gauge exactly what level he was, with my being level 65, but reports of him being about level 30 sound fairly accurate.  You don't need to go into any caves at all to acquire one of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all the help!<br />
<br />
I feel better now, and really its my own fault for not having gate memmed in an unfamilar zone.<br />
<br />
Ok Ill load up and try again when the zone is right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tymson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So if the key to winning the war is to kill the defenders outside the cave, is there a way to initiate the war?  Are the defenders always up, or do they only spawn with the message &quot;The owlbears look to the south as...&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been trying to farm the Rallic Pack to finance JBB's, but get increasingly annoyed that the owlbears NEVER seem to be up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The war starts automatically sometime after server reset and continues until it eventually breaks.<br />
<br />
The defenders only spawn after one of the attack messages like you mentioned. I believe the attacking race is listed first and the defending race is listed second. <br />
<br />
If the script is still working properly you'll see an attack message every half hour or so.<br />
<br />
If no assistance is lent, the attackers automatcially lose and the zone continues the way it was.<br />
<br />
If someone kills the defenders the attackers walk right in ignoring all other mobs and take control. <br />
<br />
The way the script is supposed to work is that when one race controls the zone, the vah shir for despawns and pops a named and guards of the controling race. The names drop some very nice loot for their level. They stay up and in control until someone defeats the named or the server resets. <br />
<br />
Unfortuantly, most of the time when a race takes over the named never spawns and the zone stays stuck like that until the zone is reset. <br />
<br />
As for owlbears hardly ever being up a lot of people help the grimlings take over on purpose because when the grimlings are in control of the cave it is the absolute best spot in the game to farm acrylia. With a lot of 1 minute spawn locations you can get a truck load of acrylia in an hour or so.</div></div><hr />
