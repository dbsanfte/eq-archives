<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From Gamespot about the Plane of Justice:<br />
<br />
We also got a look at the Plane of Justice, an interstellar prison for some of the universe's worst criminals, held prisoner by the divine Tribunal (a trio of three gods of justice and a selectable religion choice for player characters). The Tribunal consists of three gigantic black-robed figures that preside over the prison, and depending on your character's alignment, you may actually find yourself at odds with the deities, since some of the plane's criminals may charge your characters with helping them escape as part of a quest. To move on from the Plane of Justice, you will have to duel and defeat the Seventh Hammer, a giant robed figure not unlike the Tribunal, who wields a huge ivory mallet inscribed with the sign of the Tribunal--a set of scales--on the head.<br />

<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is that VI isn't too sensitive to roleplaying issues in their content design.  If you say &quot;Well I don't want to kill my god for roleplaying reasons&quot; they reply &quot;Nobody is forcing you to, good luck with the rest of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly there really does need to be an alternate quest for the key to the next plane tho.  I really hope VI was intelligent enuf to make it so Tribunal worshippers could do an alternate quest that is approximately equal in difficulty.  Heck, make it so anyone with &quot;blue&quot; aligned faction can do that quest instead.  Having two routes to the next plane is infinitely better than having one gigantic bottleneck.</div></div><hr />

Of course, I think VI gave up on this being an RPG long ago, so it's probably just a gankfest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wonder if Verant is telling us it's time to start abandoning the gods completely.  The dragons used to be the gods of Norrath and the mortal races might be kicking the newcomers out of their own private heavens as well.  This would require us to give up our affiliations and take the universe for ourselves and stop being the playthings for large, arrogant toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On the real diety server, this has implications.  Killing a evil god by evil people I can see, killing a good god with good people is not meant to be.  A neutral god, which is the tribune, should not be able to be killed, it is the one who passes judgement.  As far as dueling goes, you dont 'duel' a lv63 mob, you zerg it.  <br />
<br />
I hope PoP is NOT about alot more zerg encounters and real thought is put into it.<br />
<br />
And this multiple zone creation thing, not good for pvp servers because we WANT to see others in there at the same time and fight them on our gods planes!!!<br />

Uhh Land, when in your 2 years and 100 days played has VI shown this sort of &quot;forward thinking&quot;?<br />
<br />
Despite the flashes of brilliance (8th Shawl, Coldain Ring, Drunken guy in Luclin) what has been  modus operandi  since day 1?<br />

Assemble 50 people, buff, attack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The bit that's of interest to me:<br />
<br />
In addition, some of the expansion's quests will feature &quot;virtual areas,&quot; which will essentially be duplicate versions of the areas you will need to explore and conquer to complete your quests.<br />
<br />
I was hoping this was going to be the standard method for the majority of PoP: so that a party could fight against the environment rather than competing with other parties for spawns.<br />
<br />
From the wording above it seems it will be merely an occasional feature.  Thats a pity, the concept is hardly radical, having been used in other MMORPGS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you *must* kill The Seventh Hammer in order to progress in the expansion, that is seriously wrong. I'll have fun killing the prisoners in PoJ, but the members of the Tribunal itself are going to be strictly hands-off.<br />
<br />
There are 2 paths to Jaled'Dars tomb in DN (well, 3 if you include lockpicking), I don't see why there can't be 2 ways to progress through PoJ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait. I know I'm not crazy. Lemme head on over to EQ's website.<br />
<br />
They've changed the name of the Tribunal. They're no longer the Six Hammers, now they're calling them the Council of Justice. Unfortunately, they've yet to change this text...<br />
<br />
The Plane of Justice is ruled by a council of six beings known as the Tribunal.<br />

I could be wrong but to me it sounds like you have to dule the seventh hammer, wich wears a robe......just like the tribunal..it doesnt specifically state that he is on tribunal faction<br />

The problem, I bet, is that Verant went through and they couldn't think of 7 different hammer weapons to equip them with, so they reduced the number of gods they had to make equipment for.</div></div><hr />

Can he be overcome? of course, is he truly dead? well, he'll be back in a few days so I think not....<br />
<br />
As far as the tribunal, that post said nothing of killing the tri-gods themselves, but rather an avatar of thiers this 7th hammer.  If you cant see &quot;the judges&quot; tring to &quot;test&quot; you by &quot;dueling&quot; thier &quot;champion&quot;, then your hopless.<br />

Ok not meaning to be too harsh but I hate people that constantly try to find problems with EQ, I love the game and the minor changes that would make the game better are hardly worth claiming VI is going insane.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to have one-on-one battles where you have to use your own abilities and wits to overcome a much stronger adversary. Or maybe something done with a partner.<br />
<br />
Maybe instead of &quot;The Seventh Hammer has been slain by Kryssniall/Tripoldi!&quot; the message could read &quot;The Seventh Hammer has been bested in a duel by Kryssniall/Tripoldi!&quot;<br />

You're not killing them but you're proving your worth.</div></div><hr />

From what they said the Tribunal is a group of six not seven.<br />
<br />
The Seventh Hammer is their servent that brought the guilty to them for judgement.<br />
<br />
So you wouldn't be killing your gods but proving yourself to them by an honorable duel with their greatest servent.<br />

that's what I got out of it.</div></div><hr />

Good deal.<br />
<br />
Figures that Gamespot wouldn't have a clue what they were talking about. They probably figure that the Tri in Tribunal means three. If there are six, it should be the Hexbunal! We are Shamen of the Hexbunal, dammit!<br />

And now for something completely different. Wankel rotary engine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">They also mentioned about 'creating new areas' when certain events are triggered.   What if you CAN'T Zerg him?  What if the first person to get Aggro is teleported away to a new area with just you and the 7th?<br />
<br />
They also said there would be alternative paths through the planes.<br />
<br />
If you HAVE to kill him as a test of your worth, it is highly unlikely that you'd take a faction hit for it.  Ie; Halls of Testing in TOV.<br />
<br />
Killing the Tribunal themselves is probably a big faction hit; and please please make there be 6 of 'em and make it a 6 Boss fight, that would be the shiznat ;)<br />
New tactics are good. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>pallantides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Normally, I'm just a lurker on these boards, but since I was at Gencon and watched/begged the Eq folks there to show me the Tribunal I thought I would clear some things up. <br />
From what I remember the Tribunal was 6 not 3, although I suppose I could be remembering incorrectly.  To fight the 7th hammer you must appease each of the 6, by facing a challenge from each of them.  Having down all this you will then be allowed to face their champion-the 7th hammar.  He was a straight up melee mob but the 6, if I remember correctly will cast beneficial spells on him during the fight (no heals that I saw though).<br />
He hit for as high as 1620 during the fight I witnessed.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't believe the zones are staggered or stepping stones to get to the next zones.  They really seem to be trying to make all the zones accessible to everyone.  One major change is that there is no longer a need for corpse recovery in any zone (according to those I talked with).  In every zone there is a method of dropping the player bodies back at the safe point zone in.  I was told that this would take about 45 min or so.  An example of this is the Plane of Innovation which is based on I assume, gnomish technology, in which there is a series of sewage type pipes that lead back to the beginning and explain how your corpses come to be dumped back there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wouldn't worry too much about faction yet and the expansion looks really well done.  How it will play is another story.<br />

tri·bu·nal   Pronunciation Key  (tr-bynl, tr-)<br />

No where does it mention the number 3.  I think people assume that because if Tri or because there are 3 puppets in PoM.  Tribunal is a court, barb shaman follow justice, it all works out.  Anyway, it is all speculation at this point.  Odds are there will be 6 members of the tribunal.  I know VI messes up a lot of their own lore but that would be a biggie.</div></div><hr />
