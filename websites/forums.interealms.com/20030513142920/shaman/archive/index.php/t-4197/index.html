<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I often experience the following four types of crashes:<br />
<br />
1)  Everquest just spontaneously closes, with no message whatsoever, and I find myself back at the desktop.<br />
<br />
2)  same as 1) above, except that win2k pops up a message saying this program caused an error, and that win2k is now generating a log.  I have yet to find these logs, and even if I could I dunno how much they would help.<br />
<br />
3)  My entire computer just spontaneously restarts.<br />
<br />
4)  Computer crashes to blue screen of death, with messages of memory error or some junk.<br />
<br />
As for my system, its a duron 800 or so, with 786 megs of RAM, a geforce 2 with 64 megs of RAM, running Win2K.  I have all the latest video card drivers, and sound card doesn't matter because I use the nosound.txt file.  Oh, I run in the new UI but all this stuff happened back in the old UI too.<br />
<br />
Any advice?  I've had one person suggest 3) could be fixed by replacing the power supply, and I may try this sometime.  Other than that, I am out of ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had probs with Win2K also. <br />
<br />
Upgrade to XP.<br />
<br />
Never had a prob since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same problems here as the original poster.  However, today I got a message (the FIRST time I dropped...subsequent crashes yielded no message) that said:  Instruction at 0x77fcb9b1 referenced memory at 0xc22a5a5f.  The memory could not be 'written'.<br />
<br />
Haven't had that problem before new UI, and don't have it in any other program.  I'm using Win2KPro..is upgrading to XP the answer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gotten that one too Valrik.  I don't think XP is the answer (the main forum has a thread where most people say 2k is more stable).  I downloaded the latest service pack for 2k (I figured that with the whole windows update thing, service packs were no longer necessary, but I guess I was wrong) and I think its helped (haven't played enough lately to be sure).  Also, I bought a new power supply, so we'll see if it helps with the random restarting and powering off issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
XP isn't the solution, this is a problem with ALL operating systems since the last patch &quot;fixed&quot; the new UI (the same issue also is hitting people using the old UI as well, so that's not a fix either).<br />
<br />
So since I crash in either old or new UI, I've picked the new UI, so I have something cool to look at as I track down my corpse. :P<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I did fond ONE thing that helped. The DATARATE.TXT number, I pulled it back to 7.0, and it SEEMS to have helped a bit (I will admit I don't know WHY that would change ANYTHING, I have some theories, but I crash less often now and that's good enough for me...) Funny thing is, my wife has the SAME machine specs as me, she does not crash. Ever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Classic symptoms of overheating.  Try leaving case side off and have a table fan blowing into the system.  If that fixes your crashes you have a big heat problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not a heat problem, 'cause I was doing exactly that.  However, I bit the bullet and tried using the EQ Live Chat tech help.  The guy told me (eventually, after checking varoius settings) that I had to open up more ports in my router.  I had the ports set from 1023-7000.  He told me to set 'em to 1023-9000.  I was able to stay connected in the bazaar for like 9 hours yesterday, so hopefully THAT'LL have fixed my problem..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, so I solved my problem, and while I don't think it will help that many others, I figured that it couldn't hurt.  It turned out the problem was with my soundcard (even though I had the nosound.txt file in my everquest directory).  As soon as I removed the card, everything started working fine.  It may have been a faulty card (though I've had it for a few years and it never gave me problems in my old computer), or it may have been that the card was just generating too much heat.  I also think that it could have been a conflict of some sort with the motherboard's built-in sound card.<br />
<br />
BTW, I just wanted to share another problem and solution I found while I'm at it.  The motherboard on-board sound card that I had was only producing one channel audio (I couldn't get sound in my left speaker; this was why I had the other sound card in the first place).  So after wading through 10 pages of tech support forum hell, I found a user with a similiar problem, who had discovered it was caused by an extra spacer in his case which was touching the motherboard and causing a short.  Sure enough, I checked my case, and there was a spacer in the exact same place.  So, if you ever have random problems with your motherboard, make sure to remove all the spacers that aren't actually being used (to hold the motherboard to the case).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am having the same issue while playing.  Game closes and I drop to desktop with no error messages from windows or EQ.  I have three case fans and heatsink/fan combos on my video card and processor, so I don't &quot;think&quot; it is an overheat problem. Mine started dropping me about two or three patches ago. <br />
<br />
I re-installed my system and EQ this weekend, updated all of my drivers and still crashed yesterday when I logged in for a few minutes.  :confused: <br />
<br />
Here is  another problem I am having that started around the same time. I get lag or packet spikes occasionally when I try to cast spells.  This is what happens, click on or press hotkey for a spell, the ping and packet loss numbers remain same but the number on the right jumps up to 4 or 5k for around 5 or 10 seconds. <br />
<br />
I tried switching from a custom UI back to the default UI and the spikes still occured. hehe, I even went back to the old ui and didn't help.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having the same problems?</div></div><hr />
