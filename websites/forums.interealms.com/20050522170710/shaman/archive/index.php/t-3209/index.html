<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last time I was in Sebilis (King.. darn him for dropping the robe again) our Rogue went terminally AFK (Asleep at Frickin' Keyboard) so it was me, warrior, druid, chanter.  We owned the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've done shm/war/war/rng/rng/mnk in Sebilis.  It was a pure beating, but I know exactly what you mean by 'nightmare'.  Melees are the whiniest, neediest, most high maintenence partners to have.  At least necros and mages just summon their pets and leave you alone.  'haste plz' sums it up perfectly.  That was beautiful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hehe. if there is one buff i absolutely HATE casting it is speed. I think that its because we get our best one at level 57 or whatever, and its still worse than what enchanters have at level 50. I hate doing the enchanter's job of hasting people hehe. As for groups with shaman and 5 rogues, its pure paradise in a place like disco. ASSASSINATE rules!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If it's me and a bunch of tanks, I make sure that only one gets and maintains aggro - he gets the best buffs.  Everyone else gets JB armour buffs because buffs cost too much mana for the recieved benefit.<br />
<br />
Haste however is a dramatic improvement to the group.  Ya it's a pain keeping up with it - but I'd rather keep up with haste then buffs since haste gets me more exp :)  Even our &quot;crappy&quot; haste is a nice boost.  I slow first (unless they are beating them down super fast) heal second, haste third, and buff last.  <br />
<br />
hehe come to think of it - that's the best part of JB gear - casting buffs on stupid tanks for free mana - they have no idea what's on em anyways, nevermind realizing they have a lesser buff on them.<br />

aka becoming a cranky shaman as he gets older - stupid needy tanks ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Group Buffs baby.!<br />
<br />
Mmmm. I love them since the change to effect. Sure they don't last quite as long but Everyone needs Focus and Stamina and agility. .<br />
<br />
Hush you Dirty casters.! You get focus too. And that damn cleric too. Eat focus you stinking Wizard!<br />
<br />
Oh and to top it off Take a group regen too! HAH!<br />
<br />
(yes I have lost it.. Wheeeee!)<br />
