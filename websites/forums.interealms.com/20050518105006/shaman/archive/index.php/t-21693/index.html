<br />
However, I had a couple of ideas and wanted to run a sanity check by the folks on this board:<br />
<br />
1) Add a mission difficulty between 'Normal' and 'Hard.'  Normal MOBs hit for 388, Hards hit for 988 and mitigate slow. Add an 'Intermediate' where MOBs hit for 688 and only certain ones mitigate.<br />
<br />
2) Allow augments to be recycled.  Don't change them from ND, but lord, we're jsut REMOVING them from an old piece of equipment - not DESTROYING them.  I understand the obsession with time sinks, but this is punitive in nature. I already SPENT the time (or points) on the augment.  Note this could apply to GoD augs as well.<br />
<br />
3) Scale points for successful missions under the 90 minutes. For example, normal mission, you complete it in 78 minutes so you get 51 for the win and 12 ( 1 point per minute) for a total of 63.<br />
<br />
Intermediates could be 2 points per minute and hards 3.<br />
<br />
Thoughts ?</div></div><hr />

Thoughts ?<br />
1) Agreed. Long overdue.<br />
2) The best solution I've heard is simply let us choose whether the aug or gear is destroyed, so augs can be salvaged off equipment no longer used.<br />
3) Not sure about this one, would be too much reward for the normals for well equipped folks.</div></div><hr />

In response: <br />
<br />
1) Oh, I personally have no issues with spreading out the fighting to different camps although I wish targeting in Guk were better (what a joke)<br />
<br />
2) I agree 100%<br />
<br />
3 Well everyone is doing collects and slaughers because they are easier (lets be honest).  I think that boss kills and rescues need to be made more attractive somehow.  Maybe more points or better loot - loot being the easier fix.<br />
<br />
4) I agree 100%<br />
<br />
5) Dropped augments currently suck anyway so no biggie unless they beef them up.  I agree that either XP or loot needs to be kicked up a touch since I have found LDON to be not as popular as it once was.  I do not think that the lack of popularity is due to people not enjoying the adventuring rather the rewards are better elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Frankly the XP is probably appropriate for regulars given the limited risk, additional playing enjoyment, LDON points, adventure stone, etc. but the loot is maybe a bit low compared to just grinding in BOT, etc.  I think the easy fix is to have better augments.  <br />
 <br />
6) I agree 100%<br />
<br />
I also think that an intermediate setting would be a wise idea to impliment, and for the life of me I dont know why Sony didn't tweek the LDON raids to make them risk/reward appropriate.  I personally think there is a gap in EQ content for the 12-18 peep mini raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was just talking to a friend of mine about LDON changes that could give a really quick / short term boost to the casual player crowd, and even a few of the raider crowds.   Some of this is pretty much what you said.<br />
<br />
1 - Adding of a medium option.    Without quoting numbers for the hits... I was thinking along the lines of BoT.    A random smattering of slightly slow mitigating mobs, but mostly just harder hitting, standard mobs.<br />
<br />
The points, xp, average plat, dropped augs, and loot would be somewhere between the normal and hard.   Really I'd settle for just the points/xp if SoE wanted to get lazy and not make new items... but ideally... items that are better than normals, but not the very nice hard items.<br />
<br />
2 - Remove and Re-use Augs.   Even if they made the augments SLIGHTLY more expensive as a trade off... it's so friggin stupid to have to buy an expensive augment, and if you happen to get lucky and upgrade that slot ... all wasted.<br />
<br />
3 - All but the best focus items should be on the merchants.   Along with more FT / Regen options, and even some unique effects.<br />
<br />
The &quot;best&quot; should not be... I think most people agree that the raiders should get access to the best available... it's part of the reason they're out there raiding and commiting so much time.<br />
<br />
But there should be more options to allow the gear gap to decrease... not disappear... just decrease.<br />
<br />
So if you want a 30% range... or 30% healing focus... it's there for you... the cost can be high for the specialized higher focus items... but there should be an option.<br />
<br />
4 - LDON raiding... it had so much potential... and flopped... for just about everyone... but mainly the non-hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
You can keep the objectives and style the same... but go back and re-vamp the difficulty settings.<br />
<br />
Allow for a very wide range of guild &quot;skills/strengths&quot;... all with appropriate rewards. <br />
<br />
As an example...<br />
<br />
Kunark Level (&quot;Easy&quot;) - Main boss approx equal to Trakanon<br />
Velious Level 1 (&quot;Medium 1&quot;) - Main boss approx equal to Vindi<br />
Velious Level 2 (&quot;Medium 2&quot;) - Main boss approx equal to AoW<br />
Luclin (&quot;Hard 1&quot;) - Main boss approx equal to Emp / VT Boss<br />
PoP (&quot;Hard 2&quot;) - Main boss approx equal to one of the harder Ele bosses<br />
LDON Current (&quot;Hard 3&quot;) - Current LDON raids... very hard <br />
<br />
That might look like a lot... but it's actually very simple... and provides a clear upgrade path of AVAILABLE raids for any guild to try.<br />
<br />
Mom and Pop guild can say &quot;We're trying a medium LDON raid on Monday night... &quot; and plan for it, knowing it's up... and can try a couple of different camps to learn it.<br />
<br />
Loot would scale of course... there'd be no reason for a time guild to kill an easy LDON raid unless they were really bored.     But if you're a small guild, or just learning to raid... there's something for you to do.<br />
<br />
And most importantly... LDON raids always being available (except for the built in delays... but you're only competing against yourself).<br />
<br />
Also the mobs and sub-challenges of the raid would scale.    The Trakanon level raid might have just normal LDON mobs in it... while the hardest would be just like it is now.<br />
<br />
I think these are 4 easy options to implement really... I think the SoE dev team could do these changes in a couple weeks or less... and it would be AWESOME for everyone, but especially the more causal, or less hardcore guilds.<br />
<br />
I think there's more wrong with EQ than just LDON... but I think some LDON changes could give a great boost.<br />
<br />
On a related note, this is a great thread on Graffe's about what is wrong with EQ... not a flamefest, but instead a nice discussion:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Medium, an idea much cited but for some reason never implemented, whether its not possible, or whether its seen as pointless by Soe who knows. <br />
Another idea I think would be beneficial that if you go over the 90 mins then you get half points instead. For the lesserequipped, it gives them a better chance of salvaging some points on hard,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes to recycling augs<br />
<br />
not to partial wins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1)  On the recycling of augs...  add a solvent that sells for 1k and allows removal of the aug intact.   Adds a decent money sink as well as allow recycling of augs.<br />
<br />
2)  Redo the difficulties.  Keep &quot;Normal&quot; as is (400 hitters).  Reduce &quot;Hard&quot; slightly and rename &quot;Moderate&quot; (800 hitters), and make a new &quot;Hard&quot; (1200 hitters).    Points would be 50, 100, 150 for a win.  Adjust drops accordingly with the new &quot;Hard&quot; dropping Elemental and Time Phase 1-3 quality items.<br />
<br />
3)  Add new tiers of purchaseable loot at 2000 and 2500 points that are similar to Elemental and Time Phase 1-3/Kod`Taz quality loots.   Add better purchaseable augments similar to what is found in Ferubi and Kod`Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/disagree with the bonus points for successful ldon under 90 minutes.<br />
<br />
If you finish a dungeon with alot of time to spare, you should have done a medium (as you propose) or a hard one.  Perhaps bonus points can be given for hard under-time successes?<br />
<br />
Add this to you list: allow raids for any level, not just top tiers.  I'd love to take a team of lvl 30s from my guild into an ldon raid!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ccoderman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">recycling augs - oh god yes that is needed..... i have ldon arms that will be fully aug'd soon... 2300 points in augs on a 1492 point item... sucks that if some really nice arms come along i have to pass on them or spend another 2642 points to move the focus effect to a different slot.<br />
<br />
fully agree with the medium setting... normal is too easy, hard requires me to find the right people to group with, with a medium setting and ~600-~700 hitters i would be able to enjoy ldon much more<br />
<br />
i'm bloody tired of doing collects and the occasional slaughter, make rescues and assassinations worth the time involved by increasing the points rewarded.<br />
i'd glady spend closer to the full 90 minutes in an ldon normal adv doing an assassinate if i was going to get ~80 points, the time spent running back to camps and rebuilding groups instead of getting at least some xp makes ldon unattractive, or worse waiting for the lockout timer because you blazed through the dungeon too fast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1)  On the recycling of augs...  add a solvent that sells for 1k and allows removal of the aug intact.   Adds a decent money sink as well as allow recycling of augs.<br />
<br />
I agreed with most of it, save this part that I've quoted. 1k is way too much for any regular player between 20 and, say, 65... just to keep an augment. 100p... ok, I can see that, but 1k is way out of line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm going to jump around here in quotes.<br />
<br />

<br />
The problem here is Hard would need to be equal to Tipt as far as the risk/reward.  Now, who wants to deal with a LDoN version of Jihro for the loot.  Level 70 will change things though.  Firguring Normal 65 = Hard 60, normal 70 = hard 65 (which sucks as I normally AE normals).  So what will hard 70 be like?<br />
<br />
<br />
LDoN raids are currently very imbalanced.  The VT level raid is not VT level as far as risk/reward goes.  I could take 36 people and clear VT (w/ coh bots) in not much more time then the VT level raids take.  I do agree that there needs to be a Ssra (XTC or AL boss) level raid though.   <br />
<br />
The lockout time though on failed raids is what kills LDoN raiding.  People loose interest if the have to wait 5days on a failure.  If anything, this should be 18hours (so 1day).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yep lets us be able to remove aug,<br />
the bottom bits need to be redone level 20 gear you pass level 20 by miles before you get enough for 1 piece.<br />
ability to sell back items that you u/g for maybe 75%.<br />
imtermediate level yep:)<br />
more items maybe some better ones available after you have done 100 hard adventure. 130 to 150 hp? type?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All great ideas - I'd welcome any or all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I want a point multiplier. After doing 30 adventure you get a multiplier to the points earned per adventure. About 3 to 4 levels of multiplier Id think. So after 90 adventures you are rolling in the points. Also I want more camps(3 at least) to come out with each expansion. And I want some better focus augs for more points, like time stuff. I think all of us non raiders see ldon as the shining beacon of hope for us in this game, please please let it be.<br />
<br />
The multiplier would be nice cause just like raiding you would have to invest some initial time without substantial rewards but after putting in your time you could start to get outfitted faster.</div></div><hr />
