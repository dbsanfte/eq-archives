<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Haven't logged on to the test server myself to check, but the lists floating around with all the classes aa's shows shaman to have two pet related aa's in their class specific aa list.<br />
<br />
While I don't care to discuss he merits of those two aa's, I find it disturbing that we are consider this half pet class - not a pet class when it comes to features, gear, pet buffs, pet power - a pet class when it comes to aa's. I'd like for them to make up their minds. If we are a pet class then give us full access to pet related game content, if not stop wasting aa slots with stuff that really does us no good. Of course, I doubt SoE could come up with 2 different aa's in the week befoew OoW is coming out, so realistically there is no hope for anything different.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is that skills that have been repeatedly stated by SoE aren't our main abilities are getting all the aa's, while what inherently makes Shamans Shamans, buffing, debuffing, dots and heals, get at best minimial attention aa's wise.<br />
<br />
Oh well, just 2 more aa's again that I will never touch.<br />

<br />
Ability: Advanced Pet Discipline Description: The first rank of this ability allows you to give your pet a &quot;&quot;focus&quot;&quot; command so it will not attack any opponent other than ones you directly order it to. The second rank allows you to tell your pet to not cast any spells. Usage: /pet focus, /pet nospell. Cost per Level: 5<br />
<br />
so now pet 'focus' will do what IMO pet 'hold' was supposed to do. And the pet 'nospell' will be very useful for us shaman, considering all the spells our pet casts. ;)<br />
<br />
Can't really get too excited about anything until you actually see the real deal on opening day. I suspect this may change a little before the go live date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes - the pet AAs give you the warm and fuzzy feeling that SoE cares about shamans doesn't it?  Think of the thought and effort spend developing these for shamans....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gee... as I remember it pets USED to be focused automatically until they killed it.<br />
<br />
They would chase a fleeing mob to hell and back rather than stick around and fight the mobs hitting on you back at camp.<br />
<br />
Then sometime in Velious(?) they changed the pet code so that they would fight a mob until it turned to flee and then break off to attack the next mob on their hate list near them.   Or something like that.<br />
<br />
I never could figure out the exact rules for pet engagement of multiple targets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems to me that if there're more than 1 mob in the fight, my pet will continue attacking his current target until I &quot;/pet back off, /pet follow me&quot; or another mob in the fight reaches the point of &quot;low health aggro&quot;.  Then the dog beats the low-health mob down and returns to its original target....all the while casting SoS and Sunstrike. ( :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
Seems this new waste-of-an-AA is designed to prevent my pet from doing both of the above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the new pet AAs are a little goofed in terms of thier usefullness...and it seems that SoE could find a better use for the AA slots...<br />
<br />
the real issue i have with our pets is the lack of DPS they put out.  I Have no problem with the fact that relitive to how mobs hit now a days, they have REALY low HP.  they just don't put out enuogh DPS to make them worth futzing with (unless we are in a low dps type group/to use them as a speed bump while pulling/kite group.)<br />
<br />
i think allowing our pet to be affected by pet foci stuffs would be a step in the right direction...perhaps increasing the pet's dps output a tad bit as well.  honestly these are better fixes to the problems shaman face with their weak pet, way better than more crappy pet AAs we wont use...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some usefull pet aa's they could give us?<br />
A.) Pet corpse stays on ground with same timer as PC's (only visable to master) you can loot back whatever you give him. (wahoo! pet can carry all of your precious copper!)<br />
B.) The ability to perma name your pet. <br />
C.) Equip your pet like yourself with the invetory screen, only have the slots avalable to pets of course.</div></div><hr />
