<br />
For the last month I've been trying to log into this site.  I've tried resetting my password and it would tell me that I needed to put in an email.  I put in an email.  It sends me a link to click.  I click the link (that it just sent me), SOMETIMES it sent me my updated userid and random PW... great, so I go to put it in, and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, it threw me to another page (remember, it just sent me the email with the link), saying my email wasn't valid and to use a new e-mail address.  So I put in the same email, and do it all again.<br />
<br />
But now, NOW I'm back in.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
I just had to get that off my chest.</div></div><hr />
