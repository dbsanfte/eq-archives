But, I don't know for a fact.</div></div><hr />

One would hope they operate like all of our other buffs. <br />
<br />
i.e. eminently stackable (nife + ebolt + plauge + pox + ultor + saryrn for example /drool)<br />

Accually, druid dots of the same line stack, I logged on my 45 druid to test this, to make sure. I could stack Stinging Swarm (lvl 14 magic dot), Creeping Crud (lvl 24 magic dot), Drones of Doom (lvl 34 magic dot), Drifting Death (lvl 44 magic dot), all on the same mob for a decent ammount of damage per tick, tho not very healthly on my mana - it did work. I would asume the bane line stacks...my shaman only beeing 42, ill be getting the first and 2nd curse dots to test this out - but im sure someone else could get them easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Today I tested this using curse and odium. Casted them on myself, they seemed to stack just fine, (forgot to check if they were both doing damage at the same time but the icons were there) will do more tests when I log in later. I'm still working towards getting anathema and Bane but it's a pretty safe bet they will stack as well, just like our poison and disease dots.</div></div><hr />
