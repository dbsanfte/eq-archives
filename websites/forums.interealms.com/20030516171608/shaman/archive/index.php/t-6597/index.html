<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to ask help from fellow cats and well what the heck all shamans for tw9nkage gear for my shaman. He is currently level 31 and I want to get him gear to make most proud and that I wont have to replace anytime soon..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My Magelo below.  Everything I've gotten has been single group type stuff or bought for less than 1.5k.  I'm not uber by any means, and I still get 943ac and about 2100hp's selfbuffed at 59.  Some stuff to look at getting if you see it in bazaar for cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Started a Kitty Shammy and love her. My main is a 56 SK so I was able to accumulate a fair amount of cash to twink with.  I think I had 9k to twink with and feel like I made the most with the cash.  To be honest most of this gear was purchased by buying low in the Bazaar, and I really didn't have to spend tons of time there to find good deals.  Just wait til an item you want is being sold by many peeps and you can usually get an excellent deal.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm a battle shammy and tried to strike a balance between AC/HP and WIS.  Another great thing to increase WIS is to buy a Misty Thicket Picnic and one of those tea drinks (Oakleaf Tea?) and place them in your top inventory slot.  They add awesome stats (+10 wis).  Just remember to eat a ration and water every 30 minutes or so and you wont consume these.<br />
<br />
I just dinged 40 with a defense of 195, and I think buffed (Nimble, Shield,Fury, Talisman)  my AC is 940ish and HP are 1450.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did the totemic armour quests, and was disappointed that I outgrew them by 44.<br />
<br />
Then I bought an ikky regen BP, that rocked my world. Still does, although I'm working on natural regen now so that I can try for a thurg or a SS bp instead.<br />
<br />
Before the totemic, I wore banded and loda kai armour, this is my first char, my primary, so I was/am always broke :)<br />
<br />
I remember getting the eye of trust, a Seru quest that just requires running, at around 24. You poison katta guards for a nice 2 wis 2ac range item.<br />
<br />
I'm still using my totemic helm, and I just did the coldain military wristguard quest, but that requires someone about 51+.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I click on the magelo properties for both of you, I get gibberish.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Check my magelo as well. Almost everything is bought or hunted for around Shar Val, except for my kitty cloak, the newbie quest is worth it if you can find others for the sonic wolf bane part.</div></div><hr />
