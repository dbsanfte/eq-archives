<br />
some say that the Tear can no longer be MQ by an epic'd shammy.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do know that it could before.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone who has their epic has sucessfully mq'd this piece with someone AFTER November 2002.<br />
<br />
thanks :-)<br />

(edit to add that the date of the change I heard about was around november 2002)</div></div><hr />

I had done my epic back in November, my faction got reset to indifferent, but all I had to do was pump my Truespirit faction back up to max -- was easy.</div></div><hr />

He did every step himself, and did not do any extra steps for faction increases.  I turned in the tear (was max ally), he looted the scale, and received his Spear of Fate (he was ally but not maxed) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He was maxed; he would have seen the max message had he turned in a tear. He just never got a chance to verify his max faction status.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If this has been addressed pls point me towards the correct post... has anyone done a MQ of the epic since the LoY patch?  Saw a post on Allhekazam (sp?) that said it was nerfed, but with no details.  I'd like to know if it has been done successfully since LoY.  Any and all details appreciated !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I MQ'd a tear for a guildmate. He got his scale and when he handed it to the sentinel in EJ got it eaten. He says his factionwas max'd and the sentinel told him something about not being experienced enough. Assuming the facts are correct then there is now a level limit for the spear.</div></div><hr />
