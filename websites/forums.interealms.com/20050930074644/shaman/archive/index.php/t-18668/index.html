<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zrrak420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did high pass keep for 54 and 55 but it wont work for 56.  Where is a good place to solo now?  When I have the time I do ldon or planes group, but alot of times it's better for me to solo cuz of afk's and stuff.  I'm looking for somewhere where the exp can at least compare to the exp modifier in hhk.</div></div><hr />

First off, unfortunately that is not gonna happen. HHK type experience is now gone, if you solo.  That said, there are several spots mentioned in the first couple of pages in this forum.  The ones I personally used are as follows:<br />
<br />
Dulak - Dandolak's Run.  Nice and blue, single pulls and you can buff up and summon dog dog just to the right of the entrance once you get on the boat.  Good cash and gem loot.  Can usually net 600-1000 per hunting session here, depending on the length.  Plan on dinging 59 here if I do it solo.  The Lady Druila may be DB here at 56 as well, I never hunted that boat so I can't say for sure.<br />
<br />
Dulak - Soulstripper camp.  Everything down here DB and the shot at the Soulstripper, which still sells for 4-5k.  Single pulls with only one wanderer to be concerned with.  I have probably gotten 5 or 6 soulstrippers, sold em all for 4-7k.  He is a nasty mob though at 56 you should have no problem.  Was here last night still 80% dark blue and 100% dark blue if you pull from beyond the SS and leave the stuff near the bridge alone.   Though if you do this camp I recommend taking out the cleric at the bridge.  He CH's and that can be a bitch if the Enraged Soulstealer manages to get up there.<br />
<br />
Chardok - Zone in.  Single pulls at 56, EXP modifier in zone.  Did most of 56 and a couple AA here.<br />
<br />
Nadox - I solo'd at the back end of the temple, right near Torg zone line.  Single pulls, good repop times some decent loot.<br />
<br />
Katta Guards - I did Nathyn's mansion.  This is about the fastest exp of all listed above, but it is mind numbingly boring, no gems, crap loot and did I mention boring?<br />
<br />
Katta Guards - Bank.  I always hunted the Nathyn's with my Shaman but my Bard did the bank guards as well.  See above for the fun factor.<br />
<br />
Tier one yard trash - Never liked this, lost too much mana and health for it to be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
That was where I spent 56-58, nearly 59 where I am now when I solo'd.  Grouping was always better experience, but like you that is not always an option.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
One place to add, Velks. On my server the room is called BR - straight ahead from the entrance on the ground floor. 7 mobs in the room, mostly single pullable, sometimes you get 2. XP is slightly better than Nathyn's or the Dando. Loot is fairly sparse - you get a few crystaline silk threads for Coldain shawl, very few crystaline silks, a few assorted velium bricks, blocks &amp; pieces (which sell ok in bazaar). <br />
<br />
There's one godly earring which drops in that room though. The blizzard hunter in one corner is placeholder for the Fierce blizzard hunter - summons, doubles for low 200's. The one time I fought him had no trouble landing slow. Dropped 2 of the helmets - nobody wanted them :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zithak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love velks and go there alot. Great exp , and can make alot of cash selling the velium.  Another place i go is to PoD. Right in front of zone in there is a island with a bunch of tsetsian flies. There is a 3 spawn that is all solo pulled, and then there is 2 pulls after that. I usally just kill the three. Exp there is very nice , and flies berely hit for anything when slowed.  Just keep in mind it is the plane of Disease so getting plague to land is not worth the effort. Just use bane and evenomed bolt. Two of each then a final bolt to finish it off and they should be dead :)</div></div><hr />
