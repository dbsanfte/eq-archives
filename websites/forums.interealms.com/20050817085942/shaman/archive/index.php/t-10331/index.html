Love Malo, though I'm still training myself to not hit slow first.  Also have Focus/Khura's Focusing, which is just ungodly expensive, but better than doing it singly.  Still need Torpor, as well as maybe Avatar, plus still need VoB.<br />

Time to dive into the AAs.  Got one so far... on to Cann V.</div></div><hr />

BTW I have gotten into the habit of Malosini'ing before slow.  What I discovered was that in PoP zones I'd take a godawful beating if slow was resisted, but Malosini has the same resist check and nowhere near the aggro.  I don't think I have ever pulled aggro from a tank from even two resisted Malosini's if the tank had already engaged when the spell landed.<br />
<br />
Once Malosini'd I have no problems slowing, and the cleric/MT love me for not taking aggro on an unslowed mob.</div></div><hr />
