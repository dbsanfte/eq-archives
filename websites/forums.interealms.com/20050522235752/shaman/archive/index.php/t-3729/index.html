<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on the protection of the cabbage quest recently with a few friends.  We're almost to the point where we have 3 complete sets of the stuff for the quest, one for each of us.  That earring would be a huge upgrade over the ivory imbued ones.<br />
<br />
It just occurred to me recently though that it might be possible to trade all 9 potc items for a jbb.  They seem to sell for roughly the same price on my server (15-20kpp).<br />
<br />
Anyone have any opinions regarding which would be a larger upgrade for a 52 shaman? <br />
<br />
Is this a fair trade or is one side of this trade getting robbed?<br />
<br />
Is there some other upgrade I should be looking at?  I could probably sell some junk off one of my alts to raise funds if I needed to.  (I have a iksar regen bp I'm not really using).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For the amount of work involved, I would take the earring over the JBB. The JBB will be useful to be sure, but all you have to do is mindlessly camp it in sebilis anyway, the earring is sooo much work.<br />
<br />
Keep your earring and camp the JBB :)</div></div><hr />

No contest.<br />
No doubt.<br />

Unless you're a leezard, then they don't do anything for you except make other shaman crutched gimps and slightly tint the color of your sky.<br />

<br />
I guess it all depends. I've done the earring 4 times and done it pretty trivial for me but then again i can do the sickle, demi-sec, and cabbage all on my own easily. I can get the other 2 foods from a guildmate easily, the pottery is easy other than the irritating camp for the oxide or buying it. Robe isn't bad other than trying to catch one of the 250skill taylors on. The fishing pole is just foraging on my druids while i'm on a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's an excellent point.  I'd certainly ask them before I did this.  Gear in a game is not a good reason to piss off friends.  :)<br />
<br />
Basically, my friends and I have all been pitching in to acquire all the parts for this quest, splitting the work according to who has which characters, with which trade skills and spells:<br />
<br />
My tasks:<br />
 - my 30 karana druid forages and imbues things<br />
 - my 20 ranger acquires iron oxides<br />
 - one of my characters does the brewing<br />
 - my shaman does easier pottery &amp; smithing combines<br />
 - my chanter enchants clay and metals<br />
 - provide tons of bank space to park partial supplies<br />
Friend #1 (wizard):<br />
 - quad kites wyverns and farms plat &amp; gems<br />
 - provides us with a few GM tradeskill contacts<br />
 - does some of the easier tailoring combines<br />
Friend #2 (ranger):<br />
 - forages some stuff in places my druid cannot go<br />
 - has a 30 tunare cleric to imbue things<br />
 - also provided some misc cash<br />
<br />
and so on.   A fairly reasonable &quot;commie&quot; way to divide up the labor.  We're actually each putting in about the same amount of cash equivilents, either in cash or items.<br />
<br />
It has been a lot of work, but since we're all pitching in it hasn't been that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've only seen the prices for the gifts drop, specially now that the bazaar is out. The Robe of the Solstice used to go for 7-9k on my server, but now it's down to around 5k. If you solo a lot, I'd try and get a JBB while you can for it. Sure, the earring involves more work to get, but the JBB is a lot more rare. The JBB is a much bigger upgrade for you if you solo, and even some in groups, specially if you get a cheap horse so you can med and click it at the same time. However, if you're not a fan of soloing, the earring would be best to help get your mana back that much faster, plus the stats on it are very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The JBB is not just a solo toy. I use it on most raids after I debuff. We just killed DaVyn 2 nights ago and I'd be frightened to count how many JBBs I pumped in him between malo, 3 turgurs and torporing the rodding wizzies. I use it in exp groups too.<br />
<br />
POTC is a nice earring, but any part of the triumverate (epic, fungi, jbb) is class defining. I can't fathom why anyone would think otherwise.*<br />
<br />
* The comment comes with my condonlences to our Iksar brethren who cannot use the item. And before anyone throws innate AC bonuses out there, be sure to subtract 17 from that since that the bonus we get from the JBBP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I think the PotC quest is awesome, and that the JBB camp is lame.  I've worked hard using my tradeskills to make extra peices for the PotC quest, so I could trade them for the stuff I needed, and I met several cool people and had a good time doing it.  For my JBB I scoured the auction channel for weeks and wound up shelling out 20k.  IMHO, EQ needs a lot more PotC-type stuff, and a lot less JBB-type stuff.<br />
<br />
That being said, go for the JBB.  I remember reading somewhere (shaman FAQ maybe) that most equipment really won't make that much of a difference.  The one exception, the source said, were items that let you get mana-less effects.  While the stats on the earring are very nice, they are just stats, and there is no way in heck that flowing thought I is going to make up for the mana you can save with JBB.  And don't let people tell you JBB is only for soloing either.  I rarely solo theses days, but I use the JBB constantly, the moment after I've slowed the mob and sent my pet after it.  Assuming no resists, I can do 1/3 of the DPS of the best warrior on my server (he parses at 100 damage per sec, and with no resists JBB does something like 33 damage per sec).  <br />
<br />
In summation, the JBB itself rocks, I just wish it had been the result of some epic quest and not just a rare drop of a random mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">JBB all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, since the only people who suggested the earring over the jbb were saying that the difficulty of the quest is the reason, I guess I'll probably try auctioning that trade and see if anyone bites.  I don't mind doing the potc quest a second time.  I've been kind of having a good time with it the first time.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the advice.  <br />
<br />
Now, the only question is can I find someone who will do the trade?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also the expected level cap for PoP buyers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lemme see.  I decided to do the POTC quest the day before the new UI was implemented.  I found someone selling the 4 hardest parts for 11k so I bought those.  Today I logged in and browsed the bazaar till I found 3 other of the items.  Now only missing two, I entered the /market channel and advertised WTB Lotus pie and Demi-sec Champagne.  I got both for pretty cheap, 1k and 500 if I remember right.  I guess all told I spent around 14k for the quest.  But the important thing was that it was NOT a time sink for me.  <br />
<br />
Eleventy billion times harder than the JBB?  Hahah, I think not.  It was simple as heck to acquire what I needed, only took money.  I can make money easily tho.  <br />
<br />
For you who already are set up to cheaply acquire the components, I would DOUBLY say that you should auction them off for 20k while you can still get that much.  Then just do a search in the bazaar.  I saw a JBB for sale on my server in the bazaar tonight.  Guy wanted 20k.  Bit spendy but hey, if you don't have one it might be worth it.  <br />
<br />
Oh and I got my earring tonight.  Certainly a nice earring but it's merely equipment.  The JBB is a TOOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You have to consider this also:<br />
<br />
Can you find anyone willing to sell you a JBB?<br />
<br />
If not i think you are better off with the earring. And having that will be more effective either earning money for the jbb or for camping it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, both of my friends said they were fine with me doing whatever I wanted with my 9 gifts once we have 3 sets.  One of them even suggested we make 5 sets, letting me trade one of them for a JBB and they split the money from the 5th one.<br />
<br />
So I may not have to choose between these after all.  Maybe I end up with both!<br />
<br />
Now the only question is how long is it gonna take us to find a 250 skill tailor and a 250 skill smith to do our last couple combines for us and what are they gonna want as compensation.<br />
<br />
And of course, will anyone actually want to trade me a jbb for a potc set?  We're also talking about convincing a couple guildies to help me camp the JBB.  Maybe I'll get lucky at the camp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">JBB JBB JBB! I once sold mine, and regretted evry second hence, until i bought another. It is a much better tool and a huge upgrade. PoTC earing has good stats, but thats it, JBB has a freakin sweet effect and decent AC to boot. (Not considering FT1, which is crap imho, especially when thats the only reason it sells for 20k or so)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tossyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Keep the earing as FT Items stack, I have Earing of the Solistace and Flowing Slime Boots and working on prayer shawl, that with AA in mental clarity 3 you will be able to cast Ice Strike at 1/3 the time and recover the mana faster medding and doing more Damage per second... Check the cast time on the right click on a Jbb... At 60 I ditched Jbb as by the time it went off mob was either dead or 250 odd DD on a guild raid was useless and my time was better spent Choroblasting a Guildie or Debuffing Mezzed mobs....Good for solowing but FT items all the way as far as Im concerned.. Better AC items out there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you can tell a difference between using the quest earring and the ivory imbued earring in regular play I will be very impressed. In my opinion some people are too obsessed with shiny trinkets that wont make any noticable difference for them :)<br />
<br />
The JBB will change the way you play dramatically.<br />
<br />
The ironic thing is that most of the people that will have no problem getting the quest earring are the ones that will benefit the least from it when you look at their overall stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i recommend getting JBB...much better than any stats. you can always save for a solstice earring later...the price will only drop with time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">hehe Tarradar, I'd be interested in purchasing from you if you have a reasonable price. Name's Lorudcee, or you will likely find me on Nakal, if you're interested. If your prices are good enough I might buy 2. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hail,<br />
<br />
I am NOT in an &quot;uber&quot; guild.  Or even an uber wanna-be guild.<br />
<br />
I bought my JBB at auction after months of saving and a week's worth of solid hardcore selling jewelry w/ a 250 skill jewelcraft enchanter.  Took about 2 weeks of INTENSE searching to find a seller once I had cash in hand.  The JBB changed my play completely from 47-52.  As I level, it has less and less importance, but it is still nice to have.  A valuable tool that I don't want to ever give up.<br />
<br />
The Fungi I wear is guild equipment on permanent loan to me, received at level 52 I think.  It also has made life MUCH easier for me.  I don't want to ever part with it either.<br />
<br />
My epic was attained at level 53, and could have been completed much earlier except for some faction issues related to patch-changes and raid scheduling for Kirn.  It wasn't a high priority for me to finish after I picked up the Fungi, as the REIF (another guild loan since returned) I was poking with was doing just fine.  Now that I have had it for awhile, I'm still very happy with my epic.  It isn't as valuable as either the Fungi or JBB imo, but it is still one of the items that changes the way you can solo.<br />
<br />
I obtained my earring of Solstice this week.  I haven't changed the way I played one whit since I equipped it.  The extra AC &amp; wisdom means the hollowed pixie rib will rot in the bank forever &amp; I'll likely be replacing some other equipment slot for more ac/hp when I see something nice.  But in no way is it game-altering for me.  <br />
<br />
I don't see myself banking the earring of Solstice any time soon, but to me it is nothing more than a nice equipment upgrade.  Very similar to when I replaced my JB gaunts with Coldain Skin gloves awhile ago (thanks for the tip Gloriana!).<br />
<br />
I am my guild's pottery expert.  I decided when I'd finally get to wear one of these earrings, as the Golden Idols of Tunare were our main obstacle in getting these earrings en masse.  After finally taking a break from raiding, I whipped up over a dozen idols, and handed them over to a guild officer.  The earrings are much more valuable to other classes, but are still a nice piece of jewelry for shaman.<br />
<br />
I saw someone auctioning a few days ago to buy all 9 pieces of POTC for a JBB.  I almost asked our guild leaders to make the trade for one of our other shaman.  The only reason I didn't was because the other shaman are on probation.  If the deal is still available afterwards, I will make the recommendation.  The JBB isn't impossible to acquire, but it is a major time-sink.  My guild has already invested the time into tradeskills, so POTC components aren't anywhere near as hard to acquire as a rare drop deep in OS for us.  YMMV.  I think we have a stack of everything but idols in our bank, and our supply of idols is limited by our supply of iron oxides and the spare time of a certain shaman. ;)<br />
<br />
JBB&gt;FT1 earring w/ stats.<br />
YMMV.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
