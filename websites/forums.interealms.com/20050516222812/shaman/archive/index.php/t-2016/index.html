<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just hit 51 (hooray a title!) and started to actually think about the AA button now after looking longingly at it for a long time. <br />
<br />
To me the increased regen looks the best to spend my first points on as for us that equates to increased mana return, but what about the other 3 after that? (i.e. to attain the min. 6 for lvl55) and then what do you people think are the most useful after....<br />
<br />
I realise that this all depends on how you play your char but certain of the options look far more useful to me than others.. some advice would be nice please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jhendlasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My suggestion is to ignore AA skills until you're at least a full yellow into 60.  They're nice, but not so good that you can't play the game without them.<br />
<br />
If you insist on delaying making yourself more effective in the long term, then put the first 3 in innate run speed (for those indoor zones.  I didn't do this, and it's irritating when I need to ask the raid to wait up because I made a stupid mistake), then either innate stamina (for more base hp) or regen if you aren't level 60 yet with Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Increased regen isn't all it's cracked up to be. Get a fungal instead. Also, run speed is better than innate regen. I'd focus on getting 60 first, then worry about AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to agree.  60 first, AA later.  Definitely run before regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got Run1 after splitting my exp in 51/52, and then continued on with normal exp. I've been happy with my decision. It's not much, but it's noticeable. Remember, you don't have to run faster than the monster indoors, you just have to run faster than your slowest group member :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A buddy of mine has cannabalize 5 and run speed 3.. for some reason I like the idea of being able to cannabalize for like 1900 dmg hehe.. then torpor myself :)<br />
<br />
Assuming I have 1900+ hp *to* cannabalize ;) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jhendlasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gormadoc.  He's only level 51, he needs another 8 levels before he can even get Cannibalization (canni 5), and at least 1 more after that till Torpor. Yes, that's a good combo to have, but remember the level restrictions. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wasn't talking about anyone in general ;) I was just stating what combo I thought was the best.. and I'm not even messing with AA til 60 anyway ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Find the advice a bit interesting really - at 51 i'm still getting a half to a third of a blue for a kill - if this directly transfers to the AAxp bar surely it would be better to go for your AA as soon as possibly before  say 56 - 57 when you're getting a sliver of a sliver of a sliver of xp for a blue then? or am I missing something fundamental here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i believe the amount of AAxp you get is not proportional to 'how much the bar moves' <br />
<br />
here is how xp works to the best of my knowledge:<br />
<br />
killing mob_01 gives you 500xp points<br />
<br />
you need 10,000 to level<br />
<br />
so killing mob_01 20 times will get you the level, so the exp is 1/20th of what you need.<br />
<br />
lets say you level, and now you need 20,000.  mob_x still gives 500, just its 1/40th now instead.  same amount of xp, but less significant on the total amount you need.<br />
<br />
and AAxp would have a set amount for certain points too as i understand it, so even when your only getting 1/40th of lvl exp, you might be gettin 1/5th for AAxp<br />
<br />
<br />
or thats how believe it is :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Remember, you don't have to run faster than the monster indoors, you just have to run faster than your slowest group member <br />
<br />
hahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The advantage to doing AA exp before level 60 is that you don't have to fight level 45+ mobs in order to find blues.  1/4 of the mobs in uper sebilis seem to be under level 45 depending on what camp you are at.  Plenty of light blue mobs in howling stones.  And plenty of light blue mobs at the first few camps in chardok.  The risk becomes higher, as you have to fight and FIND higher level mobs, and you loose out on some great solo spots like city of mist and CS wyverns. <br />
<br />
I still think that you should wait until 60 to get AA exp, but I think it would be POSSIBLE to earn aa points at a faster rate at lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I might of started earlier.. but I was level 56 prior to them adding aa to the game ;) so figured what the hell.. <br />
<br />
My guild goes against high end mobs.. and the best thing I can to is get to 60 :) especially since I'm their only real shammy hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your guild goes against high end mobs and wins with no real 60 shammy? =p  Impressive!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehehe.. ya ya =P.  Well they go into high level zones like HoT and stuff like that!  I consider any mob I can't solo to be high end lol.</div></div><hr />
