<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">regardless of the faction question I remember reading on someone's news page... possibly tritons that they were AEing in SH and getting redicculous ammounts of xp, so to compensate, they gave the guards crazy mr and tons of hw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guards in Shadow Haven have their own faction, Defenders of the Haven or something like that.  I'm 99.9% certain that everyone in the Bazaar and Nexus are on beta neutral (always indifferent to all), so they would be unaffected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saviola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so?<br />
<br />
did someone try them?<br />
<br />
or the guards in fungus grove? what faction are they on??<br />
<br />
Thanks for any reply!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They have millions of HP, i know of a necro that soloed on but took 2 hour plus to take ooone out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, some guild discovered that they were easy to AE and were raking in an AA every 20 minutes.  The next day, guards had a million HP each.<br />
<br />
I've never tried to FG guards myself but I remember a trio that did.  Took them a while (10 minutes+) to bring one down and for not very good exp.<br />
<br />
So basically, don't bother with guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">there was a crazy gm event i stumbled upon in SH-a civil war 8) looked like the human-type guards vs. the short race ones ,hehe-needless to say this musta been after they changed them b/c each guard took battlespam from other guards for at least 15 mins each,most hits for 135 lol.... people were hording around corpses to loot,so i got curious.Was on my wizzy at the time,lvl 60,everything that was fighting was dark blue.I nuked the mobs when low on life and the ones i got the last shot on i got exp for-anyways,my whole point was this was the most incredible exp i ever saw lol,too bad i didnt see the event sooner-i left with over 4 yellows of AA and killed maybe 10 dudes... a shame they have HP like that rofl....8(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they used to be like 2.3% xp per kill.. instant respawn.. 20k hp or so.. the 1 guard (valobolo? valobo? something like that) near the echo zone heading to the deep was single pullable and you could get AMAZING xp at 60. I was pissed when they nerfed it, oh well, hehe.</div></div><hr />
