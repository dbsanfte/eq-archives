<br />
I noticed something incredible as I hit 50 recently. With a Truesilver Champion 45 dps 2hs, with a minimum dmg of like 107-160ish.<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=3660<br />
<br />
I do approx 100-140 dmg per hit with crits around 300dmg... seal of command crits are usually 250ish with some up to 400....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now here is a thread off the other boards by a lvl 26 paladin....<br />

<br />
Very true. <br />
<br />
At Level 26 I respeced because I had enough to get SoC and keep Healing useful. <br />
<br />
Weapon damage with Verigan's fist is 100-130 per hit on an even level critter. Weapon crits are maxed at the low 300s, most of the time in the 250 range. SoC procs for 130-160, crits are from the 250-400 range. <br />
<br />
Other procs do stack as well. I found a potion that added low level shadow damage for 30 minutes. Was amazing to see a weapon crit of 220, a SOC crit of 340, and a shadow bolt of 54 all in one swing. Critter went from 90% to dead instantly. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thats nearly the exact same numbers I do at level 50.<br />
<br />
Thats seriously ****ing broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, and they are &quot;fixing a bug&quot; that will effectively reduce hunter ranged dps by 15-16%.  <br />
<br />
So, what class does the lead developer at blizz play?  I want to know what I should reroll as to avoid the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh yeah... and adding the ability to repair armor to Engineers... rather than .... Blacksmiths that actually MAKE armor.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shrewed, let's not forget the &quot;awesome&quot; changes to Seal of Command! Instead of a Holy damage proc that was able to be parried, missed, and dodged. We get to exchange all that for it's ability to be resisted. Doesn't seem like much to whine about before you factor in 2 things:<br />
<br />
1.) Seal of Command deals Holy damage. Holy damage is supposedly unresistable and unmitigated by armor. Nice for higher con/elite mobs. Even with it acting more &quot;proc-ish&quot; by not being able to be parried, dodged, or missed, being resisted flat out means it will be even less reliable then before.<br />
<br />
2.) Seeing as it's going to be resistable now, alot of Paladins are confused as to what base stat the seal will be using to crit now. Currently it acts as a melee ability, influenced by agility. Many Retribution (read 'Looking For damage') Paladins thusly ended up with agility heavy builds - raising normal melee critical chance as well as Commands critical chance. Logically speaking, since Command will be resistable it seems like it is going to be treated as spell ability, which is influenced by intelligence to critical. <br />
<br />
SO, what does all this mean? It's really to early to tell. I'm waiting on the Blizzard response to this, as there are several posts by Paladins waiting with baited breath for this answer. If the changes are implemented as above, then it's arguably a triple-screw for the majority of Paladins (myself included).<br />

<br />
I am seriously getting tired of the online gaming market. The theory behind these games was to prevent the hackers from altering the game and having the the company provide content and support. However now the devs have turned into something that is indistinguishable from SUPER hackers that destroy your gaming experience and alter your characters at will.<br />
<br />
I just want a good mid evil game (ala jedi knight 2 outcast or something but in the midevil genre).</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing I truly appreciate about WoW is the ease of leveling. Why not finish the grind to 60 on your Paladin and support some alts? In 3 levels and some cash hunting I will be enjoying practically everything but a Shaman on Bleeding Hollow (look for Indalecio's return on Hellscream!). Surely there are things left in WoW to  entertain you and keep you excited.<br />

Arei the Treant is now PvP-enabled. If Horde players attack himwhile Alliance players are escorting him, the Horde players will nowbe flagged for PvP. <br />

this is funny, just because it is one of the most satisfying things to do, destroy an entire party when they are trying this quest, won't matter to me much though.<br />

Crimson Conjurers will no longer roam in pairs. <br />
Crimson Conjurers can now only have a max of two &quot;pets&quot; at one time. <br />
<br />
stopped us cold trying in strath last night, those conjurers were throwing me around like a rag doll, literally, ha.<br />
<br />
Drop rates of very high-end gems have been somewhat increased on rich thorium veins. <br />
<br />
they are also reducing drops other places, this sucks still.<br />

you do realize doan's drops have been nerfed, right? Specifically they nerfed it because of rogue farming, a long time ago. They no longer sell well, have not for a long time, as you know from my time in SM, it is actually counter productive to farm doan, the time it takes to do it you can get more money by far just regular fighting.</div></div><hr />

Wow, for once I agree with ya. I never did the stealth in and kill him thing, but last time I helped a low level friend kill him I got his dagger for selling. Was only worth like 10s, originally it had been like 2.5g.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Bahahaha my unbroken streak of picking the next class to be nerfed continues unabated. Wooooooooot!  The rogue Seal Fate bug has been nerrrrrr, er, fixed which hoses dagger rogues like me somewhat.  Personally I think rogues in PVE remain beyond abusive regardless.  I'm just glad they hammered paladins again:<br />
<br />
- Spirit of Aquementas destroyed. Was about to finish this pita quest so that I could take over as healer in our crew given that other than offtanking the paladin class is pretty weak. Doh!<br />
- Seal of command change.  If as suspected this is now a magic effect and not a holy melee effect... ouch. That removes the last smidgen of dps that paladins were clinging to- dps that at L60 is pitiful compared to my L35 rogue I might add.<br />
<br />
Shrewd and anyone else that is big into the solo/single group PVE game- I cannot recommend rogue highly enough.  They are like the closed beta mages, only far, far, far more powerful. Think CB mage but with infinite mana, much higher dps and you get to keep your invis and pick locks abilities. Once you try out rogue you are going to have a very hard time returning to any other class in the PVE game. To put things in perspective, I've stopped 2 box PLing my rogue- the paladin winds up slowing the rogue down, even ungrouped.<br />
<br />
If starting each and every fight with a 500+ pt crit at L35 sounds like fun, rogue is your class. If making gold hand over fist is your cup of tea, rogue is your class. The only caveat I'd add is that if you don't have a regular crew, be warned that at high levels you'll be one of the other 6 million rogues LFG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This does matter in pve, something I have said before, but oh my lord do rogues absolutely suck at tanking high level mobs, wowser. Just the roaming abominations in strath are a terror, level 57-58, warriors last probably 4 times as long as I do, it is amazing. The tank has to go, you have to stop the instance, sucks, we had a tank get disconnected last night and had to stop :(<br />
<br />
You still do not wish to try combat though, if you think rogues are fun in pve now, you just wait! I average 350-500 dps per fight, every fight, from the front, side, rear. And even with awful tanking abilities, when evade is up, plus BF + AR the damage is really disgusting and for 17 seconds or so I am a tank, out of every 5 minutes hehe.<br />
<br />
But you are right, for solo fun, rogue is just really neat. Only the hunter I think, is better in pve as a solo, and then it is marginal anyway.<br />
<br />
I use my rogue to twink my mage, and sometimes 3 others thorugh SM all the time, I almost never need to heal, non stop fighting, no other class, period, can do that because of mana restrictions.</div></div><hr />

Priests have already been nerfed hard and they will continue to be nerfed- it ensures they remain the lowest played but most wanted class.  I have played priest through Wailing Caverns and already I want to claw my eyes out.  You get to watch health bars, not the fight and not the dungeon. It is horrid. You also get to drink after every major pull. Every 30 min when fortitude drops you get to drink X 2. You're also the person everyone looks to when people die or you wipe- yay me!<br />
<br />
I could still put up with the monotony of heal bot if gear mattered, but it absolutely doesn't. +dmg gear was nerfed into the dirt and every stat other than int/sta is basically worthless for a priest.  Yay, another 10 int on this uber robe! Wooooooooo hooooooooo, this totally changes the game for me! I'll be able to do things I never could before! Wooooooooooooot!

I mean, it is a gamble to even take a windrider to a contested area on my server, roaming groups of 5-10 level 60's just waiting to nail people when they get off hehe.<br />
<br />
What did they nerf for priests recently? Only thing I remember was the mind soothe thing, correct? Priests seem to do pretty well in pvp if they are not jumped and the jumper has fear immunity. Vital to pve, but so few of them :(<br />

Its hardly overpowering. The only thing it does is keep the group from standing around for 10 minutes waiting for my rez sickeness to expire.<br />

Overall im happy witht he changes. <br />
<br />
- Shaman totem icons where fixed.<br />
- Training costs reduced. thank god. Im the poorest level 50 i know. The 3 warriors in my guild where the 3 richest chararcters. i noticed their skill cost was increased.</div></div><hr />

Even I've got to admit this is overpowering.  Now when you barely lose a fight you can immediately rez with mana and finish them off.  Just like warlocks but they need the help.  <br />

I had this fun fight with a warlock when he was using his infernal.  It turned on him mid battle so I killed him.  He was pretty good and I barely won.  But the infernal then started killing me as I was low on mana.  Well the warlock just rezzed up and finished me off.  I can hear the nerf cries getting even louder if shamans are allowed to do this.</div></div><hr />

I think even with rez sickness he probably could have killed you in that situation. Rez sickness doesnt effect spell damage.</div></div><hr />

It knocks spell damage down a bunch in shamans.  My earthshock usually hits in the mid-high 300s.  During rez sickness, it hits in the 80s.  Even DOTS and Lightning shield are markedly reduced (LS from 177 to 40s) during rez sickness.  The only thing that still casts normally are the heals so during the 10 minute rez sickness counter all a shaman can do effectively is heal folks.  This change to no rez sickness after reincarnation is a big deal to shamans that dungeon crawl much.</div></div><hr />

I stand corrected. Thanks for the info Krup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I guess if you barely lost a fight you could reincarnate and possibly then beat your opponent. However keep in mind you come in with maybe a third of your mana and health and the cooldown is 40 minutes to 1 hour and takes an ankh to use. I don't think this will be a huge problem. It will help a lot in instances which is what it is intended for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It's 20% mana/health, which is basically 1000 mana for me.  This is enough for two shocks, or one shock and a heal.</div></div><hr />

It was my assumption, rez sickness means all damage reduced 75%, all attributes by 75, ac reduced 75% as well? our shamans are out of any fight for ten minutes after a wipe.<br />

Nope.  LoH drops mana to 0.<br />

Yup, it was pretty heavy handed.  That said I read on the Sageras boards that everyone's assumptions on the rez sickness removals were wrong and that rez sickness is only being &quot;fixxed&quot; where a warlock uses a soulstone to bring back a shaman.  Everyone else was coming back OK, but shaman were being brought back with rez sickness, which is a bug.  Might be wrong as I have never been rezzed by a warlock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Never even thought of the pvp implications because no one in their right mind used it, but it sucks big time in a raid, our shaman are usually our only healers unless our priest is around. We suck too, wipe all the time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">LoH returns some mana.  I haven't looked into why but I assume its from talents or something.  <br />
<br />
Yes there is a bug where Shaman self rez overides soulstone if the shaman is carrying an ankh.  It's quite annoying and I've stopped carrying ankhs altogether because I would often forget to hand them to a warlock I was partying with.</div></div><hr />
