<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Isn't this game supposed to be fun? I look at the events today, and I realise, it has been 99% frustration, anger, and desire to (literally) kill people. This isnt what I think of when someone says the word 'fun'.<br />
<br />
The people who play this game are just TOO STUPID. They are selfish, brainless, clueless, careless, unprofessional, and are hugging the line between normality and mental retardation.<br />
<br />
I think i'm going to retire my shaman. No, I'm not here for attention or wanting someone to convince me to stay. I just had to vent this because I'm afraid I'm going to break something.<br />
<br />
Again, this is supposed to be fun. I dont see how I can consider all of the **** that happened today, the day before, etc. etc. 'fun'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irmm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If the game is not fun for you no more then quit becuase you are right when saying it is a GAME and it is suppose to be &quot;FUN&quot;. On the other hand maybe it is time for you to take a break from EQ take a couple of days off or weeks come back and see if it is the same if it is then quit.  It is a game just a game to be played for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I highly recommend you take a break man. You are correct in that this game is supposed to be fun. When it stops being so you need to either quit for a while and do some other activity or change how you play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have been living in a cave, aka my job.<br />
<br />
Did something happen today that I should know about, or was this something that happend to you personally?<br />
<br />
Either way, I definatly think you are ready for a break PennyAntics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did something happen today that I should know about, or was this something that happend to you personally?<br />
<br />
It was just a series of events, most composing being trained on, mobs sniped by selfish guilds or people, being scammed , killsteals, the usual. I've experienced plenty of this before but never so much in such a small time frame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's still a game Penny - take a week off and you'll feel a lot better . . . it'll give you a chance to regain your perspective.  This happens to everyone eventually.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no ****, iv'e been playing this game almost 2 years and ive quit for 1 whole year split up into 4 sections so abour 3 months each time, take a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Play on a pvp server ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Coraz might have a point, although that might make the problem worse before it makes it better.<br />
<br />
Then I got frustrated with the game about a year ago I went to RZ and started a ranger.  It helped that when someone realy pissed me off that I could actually KILL them, or at least make an honest attempt. I didnt go on a rampage and kill everyone that I saw..just those folks that really made me mad.  After about 20 levels and a 3 months later (it takes longer to level on the zeks...the constant watching your back DOES get old after awhile) I went back to my normal server feeling very refreshed.<br />
<br />
It could make it worse though.  I've heard that lately the Zeks have become even more uncivilized and the griefers run rampant in some zones.  That would not be fun to have to deal with.</div></div><hr />
