<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In an on-going effort to provide the highest level of Customer Support, we reviewed our In-Game Support methods and have made some changes that we believe will greatly benefit our customer base. <br />
<br />
We have shifted the manner in which our In-Game Customer petitions and emails are handled and gone to more of a &quot;global queue&quot; approach. There will no longer be a single Game Master present on each server. Instead, teams of Game Masters will assist those servers with the greatest need and longest waiting times. In addition, a dedicated team of Game Masters will also be responsible for answering In-Game email inquiries. We are confident this change will grant an even higher level of Customer Support by providing faster response times while continuing to provide all of the dynamic quests and events you have come to expect. <br />
<br />
Game Masters will continue to have a strong presence in Norrath, while providing greater customer satisfaction. In fact, you will most likely see more of them on your server in the future. <br />

Arse.  Sucks for those of us with awesome GM's.  Gonna have to share em now!  Can also almost garauntee that this will actually lead to a reduced level of customer service for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol.....<br />
<br />
Can win fer losing. Why not just see what happens instead of saying its going to blow tree monkeys before it happens?<br />
<br />
Hay at least they are trying. Our lead GM on xev rocks. Hopefully she can spread some of that good GM cheer around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only really sprang to mind as I just finished reading a chapter in a Bill Bryson book.  In the opening paragraph of the chapter:<br />
 <br />
 ...corporations do things to make life easy for themselves and then pretend it's for your benefit.  You can usually tell this is happening when the phrase 'for your convenience' or 'in order to provide a better service for our customers' appears somewhere in the writing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then read that press release.<br />
<br />
That and our server GM is bloody great and I dont want him buggering off to sort out other servers problems and us getting a crap gm (selfish but what the hey)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think a GM pool is a good thing since there will always be a GM online?<br />
<br />
I would agree except I highly suspect the next step will be having fewer GMs. Fewer to go around means your server may have even LESS attention. This has very little to do with good CS (though Verant will spin it that way).</div></div><hr />

Just what is an &quot;awesome&quot; GM? I've had nothing but problems with GM's over the years.<br />
<br />
And the &quot;pool&quot; of GM's.. read between the lines.. it's reduced customer service. They are terminating &quot;X&quot; number of GM's and the ones left, have to service all the servers in a rotating manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is the reason I have a warning on my account for no reason. I killed a guy once,and a blue server gm gave me a warning for corpse camping to the point of corpse decay. Bad idea imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The lead GM on the Rathe is a tool. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Vaylin rocked.  Best GM Rathe ever had!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can't say I mind.  Ours is about average.  I'm guessing the really hot brunette one they had is gone though.. I still want Shiften back.. they can keep the stupid panda **** all they way (GM post shiften, pre current GM who helped me get my epic back.. ok I'm biased)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I seem to recall DAoC having the GM pool instead of one assigned to a specific server. I also seem to recall people whining about the substandard service as well.<br />
<br />
How Verant CS interprets policies varies from server to server as is. Currently you know how your server GM will react to a specific incident which means you know whether or not to even bother sending in a petition. With all CS personnel rotating you have no idea what sort of interpretation you will be getting on a daily basis. Should make for some interesting encounters, particularly between a servers &quot;uber&quot; guild and a GM that has never interacted with them before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can see Garreth's point when you consider that the GM before Vaylin went crazy one day and decided to disband Garr's guild. :P He got promptly booted out on his ass.<br />
<br />
I still say Vaylin's a tool, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gosh, will have to wait and see how this pans out. I know someone who guided on and off for a year and watched them do it several times - even for guides getting in contact with the server GM could be problematic. If they werent guiding at the right hours then they were just as powerless as players when it came to issues the server GM needed to deal with. <br />
<br />
Thinking about it, it was the senior guides and guide team that really made the server tick, the GM was just there to do all the things they lined up for him. So long as they keep those teams in tact it may actually be an improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only problem is that former GM's are moved to a different pool, so I'll never see Zalumbas on TM any more :/  (for example)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No GM could possibly be good enough since they took away our Mennix :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm, wonder what happens if the GM is called to a server they play on (if the GM's play)?  Or will they still have the policy of not responding to their home server?<br />
<br />
GM says, &quot;Hello, this is GM XXX.  Member of the guild you just KS'ed from.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Have fun with lead GM Tilol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cazic had a good GM...took a promotion and we got stuck with Tilol.<br />
At least he was on alot...unlike the old days of &quot;please petition in a couple days when a GM is available&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sigh and Xev's GM started being proactive when she was online. Doing stuff like attending Naggy raids to prevent ninja looting if asked, and generally trying to make life easier.<br />
<br />
I don't want to share, I could get one of the jerks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail,<br />
<br />
I miss our new server GM Vharyon already. :( What an awesome guy.  And now he's floating.  If you see him, tell him Frekkels says hi.  He's very knowledgable about our epic faction issues btw.  (He also tole me our epic is now the one he hates the most, lol.)<br />
<br />
Naggy raid Magus ninja petition response time last night by a floating GM was under an hour btw.  Kazann was the GM, and he did a good job, resolved it in very little time.  (Probably helped that the ninja admitted guilt...)<br />
<br />
I do think this is a sneaky down-sizing attempt w/ the typical Verant spin labeling it as a feature.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />

Just what is an &quot;awesome&quot; GM? I've had nothing but problems with GM's over the years.<br />
<br />
Really?  I've petitioned about a dozen times, total, over the last 2 years.  My *only* complaint about the Bristlebane GM/Guide service is that I have yet to have an reply in under two hours from the time of the petition.  Our server GM--Beghn--has impressed me mightily the 2 times I've gotten his attention.<br />
<br />
Guess I'm either lucky or have good GM faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yea, Bristlebane has had some extremes for GM's.<br />
<br />
Shiften was good, a lot of people really liked him. I never had much exp with him so I'm neutral.<br />
<br />
Then came Dasimarr Pandapunk, who was making enemies from day 1. I am so glad this guy no longer works for verant.<br />
<br />
And then Beghn. At worst, people were neutral about him. Those who interacted with him a lot are the ones who know that he would bend over backwards to help. I loved that guy, and I hope he is the one who you get a response from when you call the GM pool now. He's good.<br />
<br />
Akhilles, did you ever deal with Beghn? If you had a bad experience with him I would like to hear the details as it would be the first one I heard of.</div></div><hr />
