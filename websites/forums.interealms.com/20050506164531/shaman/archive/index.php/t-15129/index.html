<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so thats basically my new goal..  kinda out there.. but i dont think out of grasp..<br />
<br />
so anyone have any ideas?   i want little mroe hp before i attempt it.. aiming for 6khp 1200ac.  as well as LR 5<br />
<br />
so any suggestions or anyone think it's possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if I remember he triples for 800ish doesn't he?  I know he doesn't slow, I'd say you could do it with that much hp and AC if your chain is tight enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">anyone can tank vindi if they have enough clerics...and kill him fast enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got 6k+hpts buffed, 1300 or so AC with LR5, ID5, I doubt i could tank him, if he was slowable and had a very tight CH chain, maybe its doable.<br />
doubt you could hold agro though.<br />
<br />
I am sure some of the more advanced shaman here could do a much better job at it, but id be suprised if it was done.<br />
<br />
Since i trained LR5 and ID5 i have an overwhelming urge to steal agro from the MT, unless agro manegment is critical of course. That gimp bird in Solro Alyxir is a fun one to tank, i managed to steal agro for nearly half the fight the other night, flurry drakes in ToV are quite fun also.<br />
<br />
I recommed training those abilitys. <br />
Its good out tanking rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah we all were doing vindi long before tanks were breaking 8k, long before LR5 and 1200 ac and level 65.  6k on a shaman with 1200 AC is very doable, just make sure you spam the tained breathe is all and have good healing to back you up</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhh, yeah, but shamans don't have Parry, Riposte, 240 dodge,250 defense, or Defensive.<br />
<br />
I evade 16% of all hits thanks to Parry/Riposte/Dodge, shaman however, do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agreed.  Part of what makes a war good is not only the ass load of hps they have but the ability they have to evade and mitigate the incomming damage.  Shaman just dont have that skill.  <br />
<br />
Not saying it couldnt be done mind you.  Just real hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I'm not mistaken there was a thread linked to most class boards from eqdruids where they had a druid tanking him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that I would like to see, must have been one hell of a tight CH chain. <br />
I want to try now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you have enough clerics, I'm sure a pause 15 could keep you alive, maybe even a 20, it's just a matter of finding the right timing for your chain, and chaining disempower is way more aggro than tainted breath<br />
<br />
edit: also LOL for wasting 15AA on stamina</div></div><hr />

<br />
only wasted 8AA, just wanted to see how much of a gain i could get out of maxing it in magelo, didnt know id saved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have tanked vindi with 2 clerics healing me after the war i was playing went down.<br />
<br />
<br />
He's a gimp, didnt go under 50% hp with the ch rota.<br />
<br />
<br />
6500hp 1350 AC buffed, and lr5/id5 (magelo AA outdated) and just chained EB .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">have ramp tanked him recently.  Was alot of fun.  The first attempt at him (I was with a very young guild just helping them for fun) the MT went down and I got to tank him for a minute.. however I was chain healing myself since the clerics weren't experienced enough to know to switch heals to me as soon as he main tank went down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=476795<br />
<br />
This guy is in my guild &amp; tanked vindi  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There's Shamans who could tank the AoW just fine nowadays. Don't see the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">its just a matter of keeping aggro, not taking the punishment with today's gear.</div></div><hr />
