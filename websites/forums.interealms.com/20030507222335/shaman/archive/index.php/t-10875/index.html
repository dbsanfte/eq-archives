<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.<br />
<br />
I dinged 59 last night (woot!) and now I have reached a fork in the road.<br />
<br />
I can easily get PoP groups (ever since I hit 58 I have to /role because I get constant invites). So I could sit down for 2 good days of grouping and hit 60. BUT then...<br />
<br />
....I would have no money to buy my spells.<br />
<br />
I am already missing 11 50+ spells (levitation, enduring breath, primal essence, pure blood (never even heard of this one), remove greater curse, Donlo's Dementia (again, never even seen this one before) tigir's insects, acumen of dar khura, talisman of the raptor, pox, voice of the berserker) and I only have malo for lvl 60 spells. I get my spell list from spdat, so I can understand that some of these spells may not actually be spells...<br />
<br />
So, were can I go to get some ok cash to save up and get these spells in Bazaar (although another problem here is that I rarely see them...) and get some ok xp at the same time?<br />
<br />
On MM, Seb is always overcamped (ppl fight for mobs every night, literally) and Chardok is overcamped (same problem as seb).<br />
<br />
Not to mention that the ONLY time I've ever seen torpor for sale, price in the bazaar was 100K+. People who don't buy my potions must think I'm rich.<br />
<br />
So, I'm stuck. I can hit 60, but I would be missing alot of spells then, or I can slowly grind thru 59 and make some money in the process so I can buy some spells and fill the void in my spellbook.<br />
Soloing is not a problem for this Epic Iksar. I soloed 1-51, and still solo part of every level (it's just more fun to group now that I'm wanted...)<br />
<br />
What do I do? Where do I go? I'm in a newly formed guild, and we don't have the numbers to raid some of the zones I need spells from.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I am no where near 59 yet, bu the thinking in my guild from the 65+ shammies I look to for advice in such matters is to level to 60 asap and worry about the spells later.  Once you get 60, you will be able to go and do more that will enable you to ge those spells, including raids where the spells drop.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry too much, many of the spells you listed I too am missing, just got Pox last night. <br />
<br />
You already have Malo, so you're much further along than I am. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You probably wont see Levitation for sale, same with Everlasting Breath and Primal Essence. You don't need pure blood because we already have a better spell (Disinfecting Aura). Remove Greater Curse is also a very rare spell - have seen it sold twice for 50k. Voice isn't really that important unless you're soloing. IMO it would be &quot;better&quot; to get 65 and go for Malos / Quiescence,  instead of wasting money on spells you should soon pass up for better ones (Malos, Quiescence). With grouping in PoP you can get some nice items as well to start on your spells fund.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am 63 and still have no pox let alone malo or torpor.  You can get the focus spell in the bazaar fairly cheap and I wouldnt bother getting the group version because eveyone in pop really want focus of souls which you get at 62.<br />
<br />
Plus at 61 you get a big upgrade in your pet.  Give him 2 of the mage summoned swords and watch him go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Consider yourself damn lucky to have malo and get 60 asap to put it to use for your guild. 60 flies by so fast that I just went ahead and got 61 to get the pet(very nice, btw) and replenishment(25 per tick regen). Now I'm 100% in AA and take every opportunity I get to group for GWs, Emp and raid anywhere where 60th lvl spells drop :)<br />
<br />
I don't have malo, torpor or pox yet but 61 is a great level to be despite that.</div></div><hr />
