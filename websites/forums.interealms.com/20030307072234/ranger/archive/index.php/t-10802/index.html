<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haroun Zehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen a number of people comment that they are saving their AA points for the PoP Expansion.  I wanted to make sure everyone saw this excerpt from last week's Patch Message:<br />

<br />
Important Notice about Alternate Advancement<br />
<br />
When a character has 30 or more AA points, they will receive a red message stating: <br />
<br />
Warning: You are currently over the earned Advancement point limit of 30. Please spend some of your stored AA points. You will not be able to earn further AA points until you have fewer than 30. On October 21, 2002, all points over 30 in your AA pool will be deleted. <br />
<br />
It seems appropriate that Advancement points earned prior to the release of Planes of Power be used for abilities from earlier expansions. In addition, many of the Luclin abilities are pre-requisites for Planes of Power abilities. When the servers come up on October 21st, all unused Alternate Advancement point pools over 30 will be wiped.</div></div><hr />
