Is it only worn effects, like Fungal regrowth and regen augments?<br />
or does abilities like Convalescence, Call of the Ancients or natural troll/iksar regen, etc. count to it as well?<br />

Just like FT and ATK caps.Only worn &amp; tribute effects count towards the cap.  Spells do not.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think the worn regen cap is 35, I thought it was much higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello<br />
<br />
As far as I know, it is worn regen (armor + augments) + tribute regen. <br />
<br />
Regen from spells, race, etc does thus not count.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless its been recently changed the worn cap is 35 or 36ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe that 35 is correct.  My question is why cant the FT cap be the same as the regen cap?  Seems only fair to me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It seems to be consistent through EQ that Sony sees 1 FT = 2 regen.<br />
E.g. when looking at tribute, you can get 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 regen, but only 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 FT.<br />
The same with our canni spells - the conversion is approximately 2 HP for 1 mana.<br />
<br />
For worn regen/FT, this means that either the worn regen should cap at 30, or the worn FT should cap at 17.5 FT.<br />
<br />
Whether this is fair or not is another thing, but I find it is OK. Considering how much damage a caster can do for 1 mana, going from FT15 to FT35 would heavily increase the dps for some classes, while other classes would be stuck unchanged - too unbalancing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think it's a game design decision.<br />
<br />
It seems sensible to me too, given that mana regen effects (point for point) have a bigger effect on you compared to HP regen effects (point for point).<br />
<br />
If you check out items of the same &quot;level&quot; (e.g. ldon items at the same price etc) you will often see that mana regen 1 equates to regen 5, and mana regen 2 to regen 10 etc..<br />
<br />
So it makes sense to me that the regen cap is higher.</div></div><hr />
