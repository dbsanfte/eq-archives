<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This forum is much more friendly then ign; it gets pretty hectic there, though trolling for forum trolls has it's moments.<br />
<br />
But what class will YOU be tomorrow, and why?  <br />
<br />
Being the epitomy of Shamanistic communities, a large number of you are going to be Shaman (And why not? They rock!)<br />
<br />
Me, personally, I am going to start with an orc hunter.  <br />
<br />
I like ranged combat, but I dont care for being mana-reliant.  And hunters get mail armor, and can tame a fuzzy-wuzzy widdle pet!  And i'll call him George, an' i'll hug him and squeeze him, and...<br />
<br />
Er... Enough about that, though.  I will certainly have a Shaman character as well, but primarily a hunter.<br />
<br />
14 hours, 13 minutes to go until Gamestop opens...<br />

<br />
What race will you play?<br />
Orc, Tauren, Troll?<br />
<br />
I know in EQ the difference between classes was pretty much a matter of taste, but are there noticable advantages/disadvantages to playing a certain race in WoW? It seems most people are advertising the crap outta being a Tauren Shaman, but I think the Tauren looks horrible compaired to the Troll. I'd hate to be gimped right when I start out.</div></div><hr />

You should hear me, as I traipse along the frozen tundra of Lambeau - er Dun Morogh...<br />

&quot;Who's more Dwarf than me?!&quot; (I actually say it out loud with a horrible British accent.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am making an Orc Shaman.  I just love the shaman concept overall.<br />
<br />
My second would be an Orc Hunter becuase they are just fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am torn, only a few days of OB and I leveled up a Rogue and Warrior.  The rogue was awesome and the warrior felt kind of gimped (rage is far too slow building up, but that could change with any patch).<br />
<br />
I am leaning toward Alliance and Hunter or Rogue. <br />
I have more combo's I want to try though.  A druid and shaman will no doubt be on my roster as well.<br />
<br />
I can't get too excited about being a cow errr tauren.  I wonder how fast the name Angus gets taken by a Tauren on each server? Followed shortly by the rest of the Longhorn's menu I'm sure.  Night elf males with rabbit names will be popular too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tauren Shaman.<br />
<br />
I love the versatility that shamans have.  They are a great class for surprising people in PvP, especially casters, lots of frontload damage.  Decent solo class, not as quick as a hunter or warlock but decent enough.<br />
<br />
Tauren because the PBAE stun has saved my ass in a PvP fight already and it great for getting a heal off.  That and Tauren get higher nature resistance and 5% more hp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Theres no real difference in the stats each races.  With only a difference of a few points, it is VERY easily made up with equipment.  <br />
<br />
Racial traits, on the other hand, are different.  All three of those races' traits are AMAZING for shaman.  I'll key on the big ones:<br />
<br />
Orc:  25% resistance to stun and knockdown (WOO!),   Axe specialization (You can train 1h axe as a shaman, and with enhancement talants, you can learn 2h axe.  A 5 point difference isn't too bad.  <br />
<br />
Trolls:  Berserking, when you're weak on health, gives you a solid melee AND spellcasting haste.   +5% damage against beasts is decent, regeneration isn't too shabby.  Throwing weapon mastery is complete crap. :)<br />
<br />
Taurens:  Very good selection here, too.  +5% bonus to your health, +10 (i think it's 10) nature resist, Cultivation (+10 to your herbalism skill.  A lot of shaman choose to be alchemists so it's helpful), and War Stop is a PBAOE quasi-uninturruptable stun (.5 casting time.) that can affect 3 targets.  <br />
<br />
All three make great shaman.  Tauren lands will be slightly less populated, because they aren't quite as popular (No idea why) and it's isolated.  So, leveling will be a little easier there, IMO.<br />
<br />
But, orcish 25% resistance to stun/knockdown and troll Berserking are EXTREMELY nice traits.<br />
<br />
~Detton<br />
<br />
ps.  Another semi-class/idea I want to try is a duo with my brother, Shaman+Warlock, stacking Stoneskin totem with Curse of Weakness for some easy leveling goodness.  Not sure if i'ld be the Shaman or the Warlock.  Both are nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My release race/class choices in order of most likely to least likely:<br />
<br />
1. Night Elf Hunter.<br />
2. Troll Hunter.<br />
3. Gnome Mage.<br />
4. Human Warlock.<br />
5. Dwarf Paladin.<br />
6. Orc Rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think Hunter's are my favorite class. I played a Troll Hunter to level 17 and a Night Elf hunter to level 9. Also, I'm pretty sure I only put the Orc Rogue on the list because the male Orc /dance is hilarious.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tauren Shaman<br />
Orc Hunter<br />
...and my token Alliance character, Dwarf Paladin<br />
<br />
I'll probably also dabble in Troll Rogue.<br />
<br />
Edit... oh yeah, the why part... <br />
<br />
-I love the versatility of the Shaman. <br />
-With the latest Paladin overhaul I like the fact that they now require some strategy and forethought, they are now fun.  <br />
-Hunter, well, I shoot guns and bows in RL and have done some hunting, plus I like the way the pets are handled.  <br />
-Rogues are just a fun class...sneaking up behind someone, rifling through their pocket before you slash their throat, kick them in the groin, give them a few quick shots with your daggers and then gut them... c'mon.... C'MON.... you know you love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tauren Warrior.  No buffing (well, some shouts I guess), no healing, just whacking mobs :).<br />
<br />
I think warriors will be relatively rare due to all the nerfs and supposed gimpness advertised in beta.  I like to be a sort of uncommon class rather than tauren_shaman_643.  To be honest, after 4.5 years of being a shaman in EQ, I am staying as far away from a shaman in any other game as I can.  No reason, just bitterness I guess.  Plus I sense a nerf bat on shamans, also based on beta whining.  Blizzard seems to be listening to whiners, particularly a class is perceived as overpowered in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Warriors still pretty popular, my guild will have two out of ten people as warriors, 2 rogues, 2 shaman, a druid, and god knows what else.<br />
<br />
Shaman are incredible, but they are not invincible.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shamans are versitile, and people mistake that for powerful.  They are VERY balanced for the situations, whereas other classes aren't balanced as well.  <br />
<br />
I fear a nerf bat, too, and it will be completely uncalled for.  Other classes should be brought up to that level.<br />
<br />
The reason they are good in PVP is because the three different talant lines are EQUALLY powerful, and provide three different ways of fighting.<br />
<br />
People that complain that they get owned by them all the time are just too lazy to adapt to a fight on the fly, and dont like thinking too hard, so they whine about them being overpowered, hoping to get them knocked down to the point where you can turn on auto-attack and win.<br />
<br />
Personal rant about that, sorry. :) I'm installing the client now, so i'm in a bit of a chatty mood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Aye, I wasn't implying that I thought shaman's needed nerfing.  But I've read the cries on the WoW boards.  Particularly for PvP, when a class appears to do well, people go nuts and so far, it looks like Blizzard listends to the masses (see warrior &quot;changes&quot; hehe).  That's why I expect to see them &quot;adjusted&quot;.  I agree with you, I wish they'd just add to the other classes rather than take away.<br />
<br />
That said, my brother played a shaman in beta, and at level 15 grouped with my warrior, I could never get aggro from him.  And since I was never getting hit, I couldn't even generate a lot of rage.  It was pretty sad actually.<br />
<br />
But yeah, shamans are great right now, and I think you'll see a lot of them being played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I remember when the warrior Berserker stance got nerfed :(<br />
<br />
Someone posted a video, about how a warrior - using the uberest of the uber equipment, in a controlled situation (Fighting extreme low-AC caster type mobs) with enemies 4-5 levels under him (he was max level, too) was killing an entire fortress out in 5-10 minutes.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard ACTUALLY THOUGHT it was a problem.  I'm worried it'll happen to Shaman too.  But, i'm primarily a hunter, and while I think a Hunter is great, everyone else (it seems) think they suck, so no worry there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, there is also a video of an UNARMED paladin killing a fully armed warrior out there too. :)  Mission accomplished by Blizzard hehe.<br />
<br />
Beware the paladin nerf-stick too hehe.  Like I said, Blizzard seems to over-react a tad on class balance issues... at least that's my opinion.  I hope the trend doesn't continue.  Particularly if trying to balance around PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They fixed warrior taunt some in last patch, my brother seems to be doing fine with aggro. Got rogue 6 and mage 5 during a long lunch, 4 more hours of work, gah!!<br />
<br />
Is level 15's already, lucky peeps.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, taunt no longer costs rage points.  That was a great change and helped to alleviate the problem I mentioned above.</div></div><hr />

I dont think they need explaination ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Right now my top candidates are Shaman, Hunter, Warlock, or Priest Horde and Gnome Rogue Alliance.<br />
<br />
I played a UD warrior in CB but never got a chance to try it after the last fixes...  rage-free Taunt would have rocked for sure.  Good news at least.</div></div><hr />
