The majority of EQ players hate the sound of Canni and Wolf Form. If we could mute those two sounds out I think a lot of us would be a lot more happier. Please add this in a patch!<br />
<br />
If you can think of any other annoying sounds please add to this thread<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

and i'd rather be able to quest a canni muffler, maybe I could slap a big &quot;FLOWMASTER&quot; sticker on the side of my head or something.</div></div><hr />

EQ sounds are repetitive and boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nosounds.txt is great for people who don't like all sounds. I happen to like the other sounds. Just a few that are annoying. Like, when a magician is summoning a pet or shamans using Cani every 5 seconds, those are annoying.</div></div><hr />

Its amazing that a game that has so many boring timesinks that you can watch TV and/or read a book while playing can still be attractive after 3 years. /boggle Bumadan</div></div><hr />

I use the sound of the canni spell to time when next to cast it...saves me having to stare at my health bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree, the canni sound effects are the only way I know when to cast again... without it I find myself staring super hard at my health bar or hp counter and giving myself an awful headache...<br />
<br />
Maybe not the best effects but at least they are useful...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">go into settings - general and turn down the sound realism some, it won't get rid of cannibalize but it'll get rid of the wolf howls.</div></div><hr />

Ditto here too.</div></div><hr />

I wear headphones and after an 8 hour raid got a ringing that lasted about 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Yeah i have lowered the volume but EQ doesnt work that way, if you get close to a noise or get summoned the sound gets way way way jacked up and you get this horrible noise.<br />
<br />
With all that, i like hearing EQ sounds. i close my eyes sometimes during raids and the mob noise tells me a pull is incoming. also tells me what kind of mobs so i can be ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you have ringing ears 2 hours after you stop playing I think you should seriously consider playing without sounds. I dont know what its called in english but some musicians develop a constant ringing after being exposed to loud music/sounds and I dont think that is anything you want to risk doing too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called tinnitus. It's a condition that is becoming more common with the use of personal stereos/headphones. <br />
<br />
For anyone who's interested more information can me found at www.tinnitus.org (http://www.tinnitus.org)  and at www.ata.org (http://www.ata.org/)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My pet doesn't howl anymore and I like the sound of canning.<br />
<br />
Get your pet spade or neutered, the howling stops as will that annoying part where they rub up and down on your leg ... actually I miss that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hehe ive seen Motorhead live, they arent that loud, i went to a Danzig concert and had seats next to a speaker. Man i lost hearing in one ear for like a day and it rang all the next .<br />
<br />
This was only one time during EQ session that my ears rang for a few hours becuase we were pulling a part of Vex Thal that has nothing but  robe dudes and thier noise +cann noise+specter noise+zone atmosphere noise+ fighting noise just was too intense. <br />
<br />
on average they ring just a few minutes a night after a 6 hour eq session. They really they need to fix the  bugged volume . Its the reason i use headphones in the first place. So many things they need to adress i doubt this will get looked at til some time in the distant future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Honestly, I think the repeating bird sounds in FV are the most annoying, but that's just me. ;)  <br />
I like to talk to my significant other while playing EQ, so I keep the music off &amp; the sounds turned down just enough to hear what's going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The day I installed luclin, and my pet got a new model, he stopped howling. I was quite pleased.<br />
<br />
Being able to selectively turn off sounds would be great, however.</div></div><hr />
