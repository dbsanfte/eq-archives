<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>roscopecoltrane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I thought about a new class based on processes for the next Everquest expansion and would have like to have your opinions about it.<br />
<br />
It would be a melee-type :<br />
- damage table of the warrior<br />
- mitigation/avoidance of the monk<br />
- leather armor <br />
- hps of the ranger<br />
<br />
The class could choose between shapes, and each shape would grant it a process with its melee attacks. <br />
<br />
Type of processes :<br />
- Stun (0 sec / up to the level of the player)<br />
- DD (2 damage / level)<br />
- Lifetap (1hp / level)<br />
- Snare (30 sec)<br />
- Root (30 sec)<br />
- Heal over time (3 ticks / total of 2hps per level)<br />
- Mana tap<br />
- Slow (1 percent / level)<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, choosing to turn into a Werewolf at level 36 would grant a lifetap process of 36hps.<br />
<br />
AAXPs would be a great way to specialize or improve those processes to make it useful to a group/raid :<br />
- an AAXP that makes the lifetap heal the whole group<br />
- an AAXP that makes the stun lasts 1, 2 or 3 sec<br />
- an AAXP that makes the mana tap add mana to the group<br />
- an AAXP that makes the DD less resisted<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
Why I think it would be fun :<br />
- Variety of shapes and abilities<br />
- Nothing really similar in the current classes (except elemental pets &amp; warders )<br />
- Not another Hybrid based on current classes<br />
<br />
Why I think it would not be overpowered : You have to rely on processes<br />
- so if you are the slower, the slow could land too late<br />
- If you have 2 mobs to slow, you have to process on both<br />
- the power of your process scales with your level<br />
<br />
Why I think it would be a useful class :<br />
- You can more or less solo, provided you turn into the right shape at the right time (slower, then healer etc...)<br />
- You can be useful in a group, provided you choose your right function (In a caster group, turn into mana-tap shape etc...)<br />
- Two of the same class can play together in a group an still have different functions.<br />
<br />
So here it is, let me know what you think of the concept, the AAXPs, the different shapes etc..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last thing that EQ needs is another class that can do pretty much everything.  I'm sure it would be fun to play but it would be overpowered.  Too much like bard, anyways.  They can do anything depending on what songs they have memmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you should reroll as a bst</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like pie.   mmmmmm pie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">cake &gt; pie thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think this idea flies at all, sorry.<br />
<br />
You want to give a single class the ability to choose whether they stun, snare, root, or slow. The other ideas are just not worthwhile given the maximum dd/heal. You talk of a stun that goes from 0 to the level of the player, then have an aaxp that will make it 1, 2, or 3 seconds.....<br />
<br />
Basically you are just taking the most useful attributes from each class and putting them into 1 class so that they can feel useful. I don't think this idea will go far. Sorry if this doesn't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd really rather they make some efforts toward fixing some of the (broken) classes people have been putting time into for 2+ years now instead of introducing yet another new class.<br />
<br />
Maybe take a couple of these ideas and stick them on the poor warrior class so they have a reason to live, and I'm sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no.. its a better idea to break the current classes even more while making a new super-class that everyone and their mothers will jump to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The shapeshifter concept is interesting for a new &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; class.  For balance, I would think there would need to be a fairly long reuse timer on shapeshifting, like an hour or something.  You would be a utility class that could fill many different roles, but you would have to decide and commit to a particular role upfront when joining the group/raid/adventure.  This would make them much less flexible than bards, but maybe have a similar range of possible ability sets, and they cant do everything at once, like slow, melee and heal all in the same form.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps the shapeshifter can only channel from the abilities of the other members of her group, so that certain forms require that she be grouped with both a shaman and a rogue, or something.  Maybe the attacks or debuffs or buffs are all stackable &quot;amplifications&quot; of abilities already present in the group, or combinations thereof (10% chance of ice comet proc added to rogue's attack, when grouped with both wizard and rogue, etc).</div></div><hr />
