<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Woland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I have a few questions:<br />
<br />
- Is a barbarian spiritist's hammer useful for soloing in the mid level range?<br />
<br />
- What is the default Venril Sathir faction for a barbarian worshipping the Tribunal?<br />
<br />
- Is spirit of cheetah generally useful as an escape spell?<br />
<br />
Any insights appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1)Don't know about the hammer, since I don't own one.<br />
<br />
2)KOS<br />
<br />
3)I'd say it's useful, but in a very limited way. If you have the spell slot for it, it's nice to have up, but it has a very long refresh time. I prefer to use root as an escapse method or gate. I never use the spell because I need my slots filled with more useful spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I the old days we used it only as a travel spell. Would cast it right before we zoned have blazing speed for 18 seconds and it would refresh on the zone so then we would hit it again for another 18 seconds. Used to be able to make it almost all the way through say Wkarana before both fell off. <br />
<br />
Well anyway I think they fixed that sometime back and generally its on page 50 of the spell book now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always had it up when fighting in OT and guess what? I was never killed by a goon in 5 lvls there. So I guess its situational and can be useful at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I cant comment on SoC, since I dont use it...the faction default is KOS...very very KOS....and the hammer is unreal when soloing (whenever it begins to proc...30-something).   <br />
<br />
Hope that helps, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Barbie Spiritists Hammer... It's pretty good, but there are better you could mabey get.  The proc is nice, but the delay almost warrants the necessity for haste item.  At 60 I can meele most things in Karnor's to death with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes,in pk server.if you hit button at a right time.<br />
<br />
no,i never use it in blue server.you don't want to waste a gem solt for it.sow alone can save you from most trouble situation.with root,slow,gate etc you don't really need soc.</div></div><hr />
