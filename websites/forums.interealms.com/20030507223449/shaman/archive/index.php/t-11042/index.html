<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...was very good to me this weekend.  Got range item THREE times.  Grats me, my cleric, and my druid - Mr Wizard has to wait.  Great place to PL - had my SK there - continual pulls and exp seems very nice (for him - 58, I don't group and he gets it all).  Two of the drops were within 30 minutes of eachother.  Now if those goofy GW would just get a tad more generous - that place really bores me - the fights are adrenaline rushes, but way too infrequent.  Killed 3 GW in about 6 hours of camping VP entrance and hundreds of those EW.  Oh well, allows for some TV watching.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats!  Sounds like some nice drops.  This thread caught my attention because I just moved my shaman/ranger duo to ME for some exp grinding.  Moves pretty fast as long as I stick to the lower level mobs (otherwise kills take a couple minutes), last night I got a goranga idol and three hoops of magi'kot (dang lore items).<br />
<br />
Haven't seen the chief spawn, but I could very well be in the wrong place, over where the five spawn around a tree to the left of the DSP entrance, near the walled 4-arm area... or can he pop anywhere gorangas pop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He spawns at 5 around the tree place.  Camp up in corner there.  Great spot.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Perfect, that's where I've been... think I'd be ok with a 58 ranger/54 shaman?  I haven't had any problems with any other mobs, been hunting the goranga shaman as the highest level mob in my normal pulls.  I imagine if I can get a slow on him, it wouldn't be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Might have problem landing slow on some of the high end apes,  I am never resisted at 63 ( should say VERY rarely).  Once slowed they all pretty easy.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah, four hours last night, still no chief sighting.  Not that I'm after him specifically, but it's something to look for that keeps me from getting bored out of my skull.<br />
<br />
I've been landing slows on the level 57 gorangas, so I'm guessing one more level shouldn't hurt (he's 58?).  I'm looking for him mainly because he'll be the highest level mob I've killed without outside help.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But...good exp no??  I am pling my sk to the tune of an orange bubble per nite (about 4 hours) - he is 58 now - 59 tonite.  And no trains!<br />
<br />
I killed him 2 times last nite - necklace both times - phoooieee.<br />
