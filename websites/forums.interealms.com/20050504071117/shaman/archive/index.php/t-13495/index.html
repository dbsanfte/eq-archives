<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some constructive feedback - I've recently started over from scratch on Firiona Vie.  In the past I've 3-boxed my lvl 65 Shaman, 63 SK, and 60 Druid quite successfully.  With this trio, I've been able to use the SK to tank mobs in Tier 2 Planes, have shaman slow, and use the druid for heals, dmg shield, buffs, and evac.  It's been a blast.  Now that I'm playing on Firiona Vie, I've gotten my shaman (my first character thus far there) to lvl 42 and things are going well.  I'm getting to the point where I'd like to create the rest of the 3-box team, and I'm second-guessing myself.  Just from my own experience, I've personally been extremely satisfied using an SK for the melee portion of the team.  Great tanking ability, great agro control, FD for pulling and escapes, self-heals (limited of course), a small pet for DPS occasionally, etc.  However, having *just* played this combo already for quite a while, I've been wondering about using a different melee for the job.  Monks are fun - but I've pretty much ruled them out due to the lack of versatility that other hybrids,etc offer - combined with the fact that end-game Tier 2 hunting makes me nervous with a monk doing the tanking.  Warriors are fine - but again, I enjoy the versatility of other casting hybrid classes.  This has led me to the Ranger or Paladin.  Paladin's (I'm not sure why, I cant put my finger on it) don't excite me - maybe it's the DPS, the fact that I do not identify with a paladin from a roleplay standpoint, etc - just not sure why.  The Ranger however, seems to have some good utility - Snare, Harmony, Tracking (would love this for finding mobs), limited healing, and Archery - and seems the logical choice.  My question is:  How well would a ranger in the endgame (60+) do in tanking a slowed mob?  How well would the team fare by comparison?  The Shaman, SK (and occasionally healing druid) have had absolutely no problems on PoV, PoS mobs.  How would a ranger do - just from your experiences?    I'll probably post this question on the Ranger's Glade as well.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I'm considering making the 3rd member of the team a Druid again - mainly for healing purposes - but also for Evac.  I'm a dungeon crawler at times, and getting out of some dark hole has never seemed easier with my handy druid around.  I actually thought about Cleric - the REZ would be extremely helpful, as would the buffs.  Any thoughts or advice on this?  I guess druid might be more helpful if I went with a Ranger tank, whereas an SK tank could just FD while the shaman, cleric could gate if things go bad.  <br />
<br />
As a three year veteran (almost 4), I'm looking to finish my EQ days with a trio of fun :)  Your input is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Paladin has the nice ability to gain aggro easy with stuns, which is a huge plus if you're boxing imo.  Also, I'm pretty sure paladins can do a 90% rez, not sure at what level though.  Additionally, their heals are pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't have the resources to trio; I do have 2 accounts however.  I use windowed EQ to play.  <br />
<br />
My shaman is now 46, and my main (ranger) is 56.  Ranger has his epic and some decent gear... runs about 2900 hps and 1100 AC with my self buffs and shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for 60+ PoP; I can speak for KC, though.  I hate pick-up groups there, but duoing in a quiet spot is fun.  Using this duo, I can clean up the dog tower + extra...  LCY... even did the WL room one time.  This is without the 51 shaman heal (600).  Ranger can single pull most of the time, shaman slow, and let ranger smack 'em down.  At the end of each fight, just one Stoicism will top off the ranger, and you're ready to rock.  Keep ranger fully shaman buffed, and dogdog hasted.<br />
<br />
Getting adds is a little tougher, but as long as the shaman slows all of them, it's very doable.  Sometimes on the tougher named mobs, I'll snare pull with the ranger, root it about 30 feet from the shaman, make sure it's slowed... then have ranger/dogdog engage.<br />
<br />
I can't wait 'til the shaman is 51+ and the ranger is 57.  <br />
<br />
You already know the benefits of a shaman, but I can tell you about a ranger.  Snare is a godsend.  Ranger melee, with a little work, is excellent.  While pallies and SKs can taunt very well, don't forget about rangers; when we turn it on, I'd guess even pallies/SKs would have trouble taunting off us; of course most of the time it's preferred that a mob hits a SK instead of a ranger... but it's nice to have that ability when needed.  Track is just awesome; You can see everything spawned around you without having to move.  In outdoor zones, rangers can single pull with the best of them, using Harmony.  Rangers have a decent damage shield.  They have decent buffs that stack with shaman buffs like Strength of Nature and CoE and the skin line.  And when a ranger gets his AAs, becomes a arrow-flingin' force.  Rangers can root, and even spot-heal... at 57 they get the 300 pt heal, and eventually they get chloroblast.  They can invis, see invis, regen, DoT, nuke...  they compliment a shaman very well.<br />
<br />
The only downsides to a ranger is their defense ability, and they can't FD :)  But I feel better tanking a mob as my ranger knowing that it's slowed... in most situations a ranger can tank a slowed mob, albeit not as good as the plate classes.<br />
<br />
I love the shaman/ranger combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">shaman/ranger combo is awesome if the ranger is well equipped... other than that i'd rather have a plate class.. i have the same characters 52 ranger 55 shaman =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have thought about this a long time And I have come to a conclusion.<br />
<br />
The shaman is definitely THE best duoing/trioing class. There is no question. Slower, Healer, and good buffer wrapped into one. Can contribute a fair amount of damage too. So there is your foundation.<br />
<br />
Second that you -need- is a tank. This again is a no brainer. Paladin or Shadowknight. of those two, Paladin is superior, simply because he can heal himself a big better, and those stuns are a great aggroer plus an excellent save when your slows are resisted. <br />
<br />
so that leaves your last slot open. In my opinion you obviously need a DPS class, so that narrows it down a bit. With a paladin tank, I would definitely go with a ranger for snare + pulling abilities on top of thier great damage (made even greater once you get the AA bow abilities). With the SK, snare is no longer needed but A good way to pull is, as you lose pacify and harmony. In that situation I would go with a monk. A mage would also be nice if you thought pulling wouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
I really can't think of much (That isn't a raid quality mob) that can't be trioed by an experienced and talented paladin/shaman/ranger 3-box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for your input - unfortunately I don't think I'm skilled enough to control 2 Melee characters at the same time - so the 3rd spot would need to be a cleric or a druid.  But I do appreciate your ideas :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmmm well if you think about it once you get the ranger to being capable of contributing reasonable damage with the bow, you can just turn him on autoattack and make sure the pally stays out of LOS. Other than that you wouldn't have to do the fine adjustments you have to do with most melees - &quot;You cannot see your target!&quot; &quot;You are too far away&quot; etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just so you're not misled: I wouldn't recommend a ranger as a &quot;fire and forget&quot; type character to 3-box with.<br />
<br />
Archery doesn't have autoattack yet, unless you have a gamepad or similar device. So an archery is sitting there hitting range attack constantly - it's on a par with cannibalizing all the time. :)<br />
<br />
Plus, an archer is continually moving around adjusting position trying to avoid arrows vanishing.<br />
<br />
You also need to be level 59+ with a significant amount of AA for archery to be worthwhile as a main form of combat for a ranger, except for Trueshot discipline once every 72 minutes. AM2/3 is where archery does enough damage to consider using it over melee, it's 27+ AA for AM2, another 9 for Endless Quiver unless you want to be summoning arrows all the time.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, a ranger would add DPS, snare and utility to the 3 person group, but I understand your wish to avoid playing 2 melees. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Paladins make FAR superior tanks to rangers.  Even when they're not quite as well equipped or AAed, they're better tanks (not talking the difference between elemental ranger with 500 aa and random 65 paladin in PoV, but like the difference between two of those classes in the same guild).  They also have res, even though it's only 90%...who cares?  So you'll have to kill two mobs instead of one to get your death exp back.   :p  Also, with Heroic Bond or Valor (I think) and shaman buffs, you don't even really need virtue or aego in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Maybe a mage for the last slot...good &quot;fire and forget&quot; damage with pet...can summon items for dogdog...focus items...nice nukes...CoH.<br />
<br />
Or instead of mage, wizard.  Snare, evac/ports, big booms...like a druid without healing and larger explosions.    :p<br />
<br />
Necro'd work too.  Snare, pet damage, dots, and those spiffy new group buff heal/stat buffs or whatever.  I dunno, no necros in my guild, and I hardly ever saw one back when I was grinding out AA in pickup groups.  But &quot;in theory,&quot; it could work for you.   :D <br />
<br />
Heh...if you did paladin, shaman, and druid...you'd have A LOT of healing power right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If your going for a druid and a shammy, I would take a SK tank over a Paladin.. They are cooler, meaner and look better ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Psylocibe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looking for some constructive feedback - I've recently started over from scratch on Firiona Vie.  In the past I've 3-boxed my lvl 65 Shaman, 63 SK, and 60 Druid quite successfully...<br />
<br />
i myself play a 3 character team that i am very happy with - shaman, mage, and cleric.<br />
<br />
on my first PC i play a shaman and a mage switching between the two using EQ windows.  the shaman is able to slow, dot, root, and send in pet.  he is easily able to step in and take aggro from the pets in an instant and tank a slowed mob when its needed.  my second character is a mage, who is able to send in pet, nuke, and summon useful gear and pet enhancing items.  he is very easy to play as a &quot;bot&quot; because i can send in pet and switch to him for nukes once i have the fight under control.<br />
<br />
on my second PC i have a cleric who sits still on a horse and provides healing to my other characters.  the pets can be healed without the cleric gaining aggro so it is very easy to keep him from getting hit, but he can easily tank a slowed mob if need be.<br />
<br />
this group gives me a ton of flexibility and i feel i can take on virtually anything i can land slow on.<br />
<br />
i have two-boxed a shaman + melee combo before, but when 3-boxing, i feel that i am more comfortable not using melee as they require more attention/positioning to be close to their full potential.  i play my shaman as my &quot;most active&quot; or &quot;main&quot; in my trio, and the for the most part just use hotkey macros for the two &quot;bots&quot;.<br />
<br />
i'm sure you could substitute a druid for the cleric and still do very well.  you could also substitute your favorite pet class for the mage, but i really enjoy having summoned pet items and the mage pet tricks such as reclaim and chain-petting.<br />
<br />
good luck, i hope you enjoy whatever combo you decide to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have you considered a wizard for DPS and evacs instead of the druid?  If you do go ranger, that covers snare and track, so wizard would be a little more versatile, no?  Of course, that leaves your shaman as the only real healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Paladin = Tank, Rez, Pacify, but more importantly &quot;Stun&quot;.  You will need this against any mob that can gate or heal.<br />
<br />
Shaman = obvious all around.  Buffs, Heal, Slow, non-KEI dependent.<br />
<br />
Necro = Snare (you need this), Fear, Mez (comes in handy), mediocre Heal over time, non-KEI dependent, DPS, FD, decent pet.<br />
<br />
In the earlier stages of the game, you won't have a good amount of healing power, but it will be enough to get you by.<br />
<br />
This will give you the most options for the different types of camps.  I think that this would be the most versatile and fun combo, not necessarily the &quot;best&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">your previous setup sounds very good, shm/sk/druid.<br />
<br />
a piece of advice that i will give you is: if you decide to make a cleric instead of a druid.. and then change from sk to ranger.. i think you would win out that way.. but if not, keep sk/shm/dru and thats also good.. with cleric you wouldn't have the advantage of evac but you would maximixe hp and healing ability for the trio as well as having a rez available whenever.   <br />
<br />
What i don't recommend is getting ranger/druid or paladin/cleric.. it makes a lot of the hybrid's abilitys obselete, so go sk and get the necros abilitys in there.. improve the array of things you can do.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just went through a similar conundrum, making the perfect trio.  I had been 2-boxing a Beastlord/Druid and wanted to add a 3rd, and ended up picked a Shaman.  So, to answer your question, do a Beastlord/Druid/Shaman trio!!  With a Beastlord you have not one, but two tanks!  The Beastlord himself can tank really well, but a fully buffed Beastlord Warder can tank even better in some situations!  Plus you get the added bonuses that a Beastlord brings, like the &quot;Spiritual Purity&quot; line of spells (a group clarity/regen combo spell that rocks, maxes out at 9 mana/9 hp per tic), and you get awesome AA like Paragon.<br />
<br />
Beastlords really are DPS machines, and unlike Rangers they can actually tank well (swapping out between the 'Lord and his warder).  My Beastlord is currently 56, my Druid is 55, but both are on hold while I raise my Shaman up (currently 27, I started a new one other than Busstah on a new account).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another vote for Sham-Pally-Necro here.  This trio has everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shaman/Paladin/Necro is what I'm working toward at the moment.<br />
<br />
All three can crowd control. All three can heal. Two can rezz. One can FD out to save time on a CR or pull. One makes a flawless aggro-control tank that can heal and rezz, interrupt casters, stack buffs, root-park adds and take the beating while doing so. Another can slow, stack buffs, heal, deal damage. The third can heal, mez, help regain the others' mana in a pinch, do insane damage and FD out in case of a bad pull that can't be handled. Hell, now that my Paladin has SU3 I can trio them in CoD for great EXP before work.<br />
<br />
You've got everything going, except for evacs. But I don't plan to just trio, anyway. I know many good Druids and Wizards who feel unwanted in groups, and who I'd kill to have with me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">shm/pal/necro . <br />
<br />
at low lvls you will rock your way up , at higher levels you'll have to learn to alternate heals on your pal with the shaman and the paladin . <br />
stun/heals/buffs + necro pets/dots/snare/fd +shm slow/pet/buffs/dots<br />
<br />
that should be a winner for a tri-box . pull with necro with snare or fd or whatever you need , paladin will catch aggro really fast with stuns , shaman can slow after pal has aggro or before mob comes back to camp ( snared by necro ) . <br />
after that , toss in pets/a dot or two , watch the pal health , toss a heal or two with the shm , maybe a heal with paladin ...<br />
mob done , cann v , restart cycle .<br />
paladins get a 90% rez at 60 i think  ?  very usefull . shm and necro don't need kei . might be usefull for the pal though . <br />
<br />
your first combo was pretty good all around , sk could get aggro/fd/etc , dru can sufficiently heal , shm can slow and have fun around .<br />
changing this combo will make you loose the evac/DS/superior healing character ( but you gain another hybrid with a good healing capacity ) , for another class that will instead hasten the killing (necro pet+dots , then just sit the necro , hes out for the fight as you stay mostly inbetween shm/pal ) and that will refurbish your mana when one other character is low on mana .... <br />
<br />
<br />
personal favorite 2-box: <br />
shm/mage duo . <br />
(sorry not a trio)<br />
this is a two boxing , easy to do/manipulate where you don't have to constantly switch .<br />

While I often have duo'd in PoTactics as Shm and Sk, an extra cleric or enc would make life so much better. I usually end up grouping anyways so this isn't a problem. Sk's add alot of versatility to the group and can still tank group mobs well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">reguarding last post by lordkaldron , the planes over plane of tactics might be frustrating xp wise to tri box , requiring a lot of shifting between the boxes and a maybe frustrating xp gain ( slow dps / difficulty of 3-boxing ) but will assure you of being able to do anything . <br />
some problems i find relevant , for example when you want to add friends to your 3 box , healing might be more of a problem and efficiency of group will be a notch down , du to main healer ( clr ) , main CC ( if enc ) . i think the nec/shm/pal would be easier to deal with if you get friends to join you . <br />
bad point about shm/nec/pal is that sometimes you will find yourself lacking sufficient healing capacities to do some encounters/grouping ( where you would require a cleric or druid )  . the other side of the coin is that you should still be able to find spots that you could take for better xp , easier tri boxing , and adding friends will not result in control troubles between your boxes . <br />
<br />
if you had a partner to pick ( a rl friend that would level with you ) that would not require your control ( and where you'd be able to stay in control of your own char for the time of the grouping ) , i'd ask my friend to create a necro , the combo shm/necro complements each other fairly well , with the added need of attention from both classes ( slow/root/dots/heals from the shm , snare/dots/pet( charm works especially well with shm partner rdy to root mob when charm breaks+malo ) / readiness to flee ( due to int caster hps ) from the necro . both pets and cumulative dots ( and slow blah blah ) makes partnering with a necro fairly rewarding and highly productive . try it )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow!  Thank you all once again for the overwhelming input! :)  It's much appreciated.  It's obvious that there's a wealth of experience here at the Crucible from all you folks!  All of these are such great suggestions.  After much consideration, I believe I'll be going Shaman, SK, Cleric/Druid (alternating between druid or cleric depending on where I'm hunting).  It's a little low on the DPS side and a little hefty on the healing side - but considering how hard PoP mobs hit, I've found in the past that it matters less to me how long a battle lasts, as long as the outcome of the battle is the same rofl :)  That may seem silly I realize.  I have to admit that the Necro option sounds extremely intriguing - but considering that I have decided to stick with SK (I just love em), I felt like I would have too much overlap, combined with my lack of comfort playing a pure caster class in a 3box situation.  I would probably feel different if I had actually played a Necro before by itself - allowing me to get to know the class and what it's capabilities/limitations are.<br />
<br />
I posted the same requested on the Ranger's Glade - and those responses were so helpful as well.  One poster actually made the decision for me - when they stated that since the Ranger (in my personal setup) would most likely be tanking 99% of the time - you've basically removed the great benefit of being a ranger at high lvl - the archery DPS.  Combined with the lack of FD, and the lack of frontal stun-immunity (my SK would be Ogre), and some other factors - it made me decide against Ranger.  Ranger is one of those classes I think I'd enjoy most playing singly - as the only class I'd be playing in a guild.<br />
<br />
I guess my overall goal would be to gain experience by myself during those times when I can't group (I prefer grouping actually - it's less work on my hands and more fun hehe), and to do some neat things that most don't attempt (Zlandicar, Va'Dyn, etc).  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your input and help :)  It's been much apprecated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The most perfect combo I can dream of is Paladin, Shaman, and Rogue.<br />
You'll have your DPS with the Rogue, making mobs die faster and exp gain will be good, plus rogues are easy as snot to equip.  Even their epic is really easy.  <br />
<br />
You'll have your Paladin which is a great tank, and adds REZ to the mix so when you wipe, it won't be hard at all to get your little trio back up and on track again.  Also ITU for undead dungeons, and can greatly damage undead things.  <br />
<br />
The rogue can also let you into dungeons that require a key for doors in them.  Like Howling Stones, City of Mist (trio for black reavers would be easy enuf), and others.  Plus rogues are good at draggin bodies.<br />
<br />
The shaman works on every level, giving decent healing, good control via slows, roots, and pet/dots for extra dmg.  <br />
<br />
That's my suggestion anyway, but the beauty of the shaman class is that it can stack with almost any class combination you want!  Tho it does help if you can include all the things you'll be needing.  With my combo you'd lack snare.  Or, rather, lack &quot;castable&quot; snare, since the rogue can get various snare-proccing weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Shaman, Mage, Necro.<br />
<br />
Three pets. FD puller with necro.  Necro can rez at some point with the soulstone.  Necro can snare.  Mage can rod and nuke.  Shaman can, ya know.  Unconvention but might be worth it.  Shaman would be puller in most cases, IMO, unelss splitting.<br />
<br />
Best thing is if any of your &quot;tanks&quot; die, do you really care?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I agree with the shm, mage, nec.  Mages are often overlooked like necros are and go really *really* well with shm.<br />
<br />
You could probably be killing high reds by aggro kiting.<br />
<br />
shm: dot, slow<br />
nec: dot, pet, get insane aggro with snare and then kite<br />
mage: pet, nuke<br />
<br />
The great thing about aggro kiting is that this way, the mage and shaman can unload with nukes and dots and not worry about gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
Up until tier3 you won't really have to worry about having a real tank, but if you want that tank I would suggest an sk over pally.  Many people say pally over sk because pally's can heal themselves.  Umm, that's what lifetaps are for :)  When I would duo with my sk friend I wouldnt really heal him at all because he was always tapping.  Plus, sk's can be ogres so no stun and higher sta.</div></div><hr />

those would be my choices.<br />
<br />
The important thing is having snare and either can do that so its really a question of what you want. Ranger has more utility, SK has more pure tank power. Personaly i wouldnt go with a pally. They are great , but you want something that can fill in as many gaps as possible and the pally just isnt going to fill in anyhting that the other 2 arent already. You wanna bring as many abilities to the table in the 3 characters. Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Thanks again :)  The problem I see with attempting to include another melee in the mix (for example, a shaman, SK, rogue combo or similar, is the fact that I could see myself getting wore out trying to constantly position and reposition both melees.  At first glance one would think, &quot;well, I could just pull the mob, and keep the SK in the same spot and keep movement to a minimum&quot;.  That might work to some extent - but the issue still remains when you consider pressing the Taunt button, lifetap and other agro spell hotkeys, as well as the Evade and Backstab hotkeys on the other EQ session for the rogue.  I think after about 5 mobs I'd be exhausted :)  However, I must admit if given the choice, more DPS (ie: a rogue, etc) would be fantastic.  A &quot;fire and forget&quot; type of class which would minimize keyboard input would be most conducive, and it seems Mage, Beastlord would be a little more suitable for this.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your kind suggestions!  They've been awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You've got the ability of the paladin to 1) buff 2) hold agro 3) rezz! and the ranger can single pull almost anything, plus is uber damage.  Worst comes to worst, have him kite the add!</div></div><hr />

We have been able to trio all content through elementals.  A ranger is a perfectly adequate tank through tier 3 pop.  And the ranger I grouped there with is only now working on his tanking AAs (CA/LR).<br />
<br />
So I can say for sure that SHM+DRU+RNG is a fine trio through all the content you are talking about.  It may not be the &quot;perfect trio&quot;, but it'll get the job done just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ranger paladin shaman.<br />
<br />
I view ranger as the new monk in terms of ideal shaman melee partner.  Paladin there to tank and backup heal and rez.<br />
<br />
Oh and I see someone there above has the same idea, woohoo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Vizxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You could always try Sham, Necro, Bst. Those 3 do nicely together. Me (sham), Wife (Bst) and friend (Nec) just did our first Trio LDoN at BB together. Finished a collect 26 with 30 min to spare. It was nice because any one of us could stand up to the mob if needed and all of us could slow. My druid is almost 65 and I want to try it again with him instead of shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I would do shm/pal/dru for 3 boxing for simplicity and utility.  You get Tank +90% rez, +stuns, +group heals, Slow +HoT, +buffs, +ghetto CC, Ports +heals, +DS, +evac, +snare, +whateverdruidsdo.<br />
<br />
Having melee/melee/priest would be too much to juggle around.<br />
<br />
If you really want to make it interesting, try bard/shaman/ranger combo... twist, canni, archery...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I have a trio that consists of SK + Shm + Clr.<br />
<br />
I started with SK + Shm and with the Right AAs on them both I could duo mini nameds in BoT.<br />
<br />
I later on added a clr and the clr was not so powerful until later on with more mana and AAs, really needed for that class, much more so then for my shm imo...<br />
<br />
After getting my 3 chars well equiped I can do alot.<br />
<br />
Clr CHing and Shm spot healing and doing what a shm do and SK doing the tanking, pulling (a sk is very good at pulling with diffrent strats) its working out great.<br />
<br />
Best two things I have done would be 3boxing plate bp guy in BoT towers and taking a friend that two box and kill VZ in potactics with our 5 char crew.<br />
<br />
Another fun thing I did was getting woodelf crown for all 3 chars, looks pretty cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Best 3-box I've ever seen is a guildie of mine who regularly does Tactics named, and has been known to take the occasional BoT tower boss. He uses no melee classes whatsoever, and simply relies on charmed mobs for dps and tanking. Druid, Enchanter, and Cleric. He'll often use 2 charmed pets even (diaku+boar), holding back on the cleric until one of the pets dies, then starting in with a mini heal rotation on the remaining pet, using the cleric and druid. Things will often go bad when a charm breaks at an inopportune time, but he seems to be pretty quick with the evac. He can usually get anywhere he wants to go fairly quickly with a combination of evacs, ports, and pacify.More often than not, he's right back in 5 minutes later, with no casualties, ready for another try.<br />
<br />
I've never seen a better 3-box setup myself, and never seen a more skilled individual either. And before anyone suggests it, no, he isn't time, or even elementally equipped. I'm only sorry that it doesn't involve a shammy...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">And have several friends that do.<br />
<br />
It comes down to your goals.<br />
<br />
Several things to considder.<br />
<br />
1) Moving is a pain in the arse. follow does not work tooo well.<br />
2) Set and forget chars are good.<br />
3) chars need to be able to tank a little while or avoid it completely.<br />
4) pulling is important<br />
5) rezzing is important cause you will need it.<br />
<br />
Goals...<br />
<br />
1, People go oh my ****ing god when you enter a zone....<br />
<br />
Shaman and two mages.<br />
<br />
Highest level of dps you can possibly put out.<br />
One high maintenace char (sham) two set and forget dps monsters.<br />
<br />
2, You are the backbone of your guild and are a raid god<br />
<br />
Cleric/chanter/warrior.<br />
guild = good tank and as many clerics as you can throw at it.<br />
Chanter means haste/mana regen and pulling.<br />
<br />
3, guilds get your home phone number and offer you free oral sex.<br />
<br />
Cleric/Cleric/Necro<br />
You can heal rotate by yourself any raid up to tier two pop named.<br />
You can rezz your own cleric in the case of a whipe.<br />
You are a GoD specialist.<br />
<br />
4, questacidal maniac<br />
<br />
Chanter, druid, pally.<br />
Go places, meet interesting people and keeeel them.<br />
<br />
5, xp aa whoreamundo<br />
bard wizzy cleric.<br />
bard kites, wizzy finishes em off, cleric fixes the mistakes.<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my opinions 8)<br />
<br />
I also love a sk and mage with my shammy. mage is better with ldons, its hard to run more than on char on a fast moving adv 8)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">im just hoping you didn't pass my post when scrolling down to see the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if your going to the best tanking, and some decent coverage of heals and dps, use this.<br />
<br />
<br />
MEAT- Warrior or Shadow knight, i suggest never using a paladin (they are the weakest tank, and have almost no utility, unless your running a hospice)<br />
<br />
Utility- Shaman, Mage, Wizard or beastlord (these are your utility classes)<br />
<br />
-shaman for the swiss army knife effect, decent heals, decent buffs, great slows, and effective CC.<br />
<br />
-mage, like the shaman, has summonables that help such as levi rings and so forth, pet dps is nice, thier nukes are great.<br />
<br />
-wizard i would choose wizard last, why you ask ? wich primary healer are you goign to add ? if its cleric, you need some more punch, so add a wiz. if druid, go with mage or sham.<br />
<br />
-beastlord add these guys if your going cleric and would like the added dps and utility, slightly better than the shaman, the beastlord can also offtank, but can not heal as well as the shaman, slows are so close you won't notice it.<br />
<br />
Healers - Druid and cleric.<br />
<br />
-Druid, more dps than the cleric, but less ehaling, less overall healing utility, BUT he does pack evac's Soe, and other goodies, if you go druid pick up a shaman or beast, you may come up light in the hps area but you can make that up with some of the gear you can farm.<br />
<br />
-Cleric, big daddy bomb healer, has more dps than the shaman, and more healing than the druid, can save you in almost any situation if played right, has the best HP buffs in the game, can turn a bad situation into one you can walk away from. if your going Warr, beastlord, cleric<br />
there is almost nothing you can't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'd have to say Warrior, Enchanter, Cleric.<br />
<br />
Or, if you want to be just plain 00BER, Moe, Larry, and Curly.<br />
<br />
The Shaman/SK pair is an effective albeit incredibly hackneyed combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Since it's been over a year since I last posted in this thread (lol) I'll give my new thoughts on a &quot;perfect trio.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaman, paladin, druid.<br />
<br />
You got:<br />
slow<br />
paladin buffs (which can rival cleric buffs)<br />
focus<br />
stat buffs<br />
regen<br />
haste<br />
druid 9s<br />
snare<br />
tracking<br />
evac<br />
druid nukes<br />
DC pet<br />
shaman dogdog<br />
stun<br />
rez<br />
undead nukes and SU3<br />
IVU<br />
teleport<br />
Spirit of eagle<br />
excellent healing between shaman/druid/pally<br />
LoH<br />
<br />
the list goes on and on.  That's my perfect trio.</div></div><hr />
