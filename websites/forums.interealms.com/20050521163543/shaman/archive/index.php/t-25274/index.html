<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a guild raid planned for the Plane of Fear last night, I want to get an epic drop for my SK alt, and a few others need some epic drops.<br />
<br />
I deliberately chose a patch day, so that the Golems would be up, but when we zoned in, the whole zone was empty, is this normal ? I'm sure I read that the golems spawn on server-up ?  We waited about 90 minutes, but nothing spawned. I petitioned, and 3 hours later got a reply to my trader (I'd gone to bed ) saying &quot;Some mobs spawn at ramdom intervals after server-up&quot; (wow who knew ?) but not a whole zone surely ?<br />
<br />
I was about the third person to login to the whole sever, and I was sat at the Fear Portal in Feerrott, so I'm sure no-one else cleared it.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else been into Plane of Fear on a patch day, and if so, was it empty ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I've understood, all the trash mobs are on a 2 hour spawn time, so if they don't spawn on server up you need to wait a bit longer. either that or someone beat you to the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's been like that for ages. Literally been that way since it was the zone to farm for armor back in kurnak or prekurnak days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the &quot;tricks&quot; in the old days when there was a horrible CR situation in Fear was to intentionally try to crash the zone. Then, when it came up, it would be empty and bodies could be recovered. I think its been like this since since the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Plane of Fear has always been an odd zone on patch days. I led many Fear raids (/shudder) for my former guild, and I always used to avoid patch days. Most times, there would be a full respawn in the zone the next day, and twice I had to wait three days after patch for the minis and Cazic Thule to be up again. I gave up a long time ago trying to figure it out, lol ... a sacrificial Ranger with an insta-gate potion works for me. :p</div></div><hr />

Repop was somewhere between 12-14 hours.  Dr00ds were the worst about only showing up in the short windows each day when their armor-dropping mobs were expected to spawn, back when the 24/7 farm was going...<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, if the zone went down for some reason, you pretty much had to holler at a GM if you wanted to see it spawned in anything like a timely fashion...</div></div><hr />
