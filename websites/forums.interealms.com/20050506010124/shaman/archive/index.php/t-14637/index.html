<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hippiefrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just to let off some excitement so I can sleep I have to tell y'all that I recieved my Tear from Fear alittle while ago.<br />
<br />
I almost didn't allow myself the chance to get it as our guild had a raid set to begin at 12pm cst, otm was called at 11:45cst so I waited till then to log on as I have my son on the weekends.<br />
<br />
Well as the time comes and I log in they called a OTM early and were already in Fear by the time I got on. So 20 minutes later I was the PROUD owner of the Tear.<br />
<br />
OK I believe I can sleep now, but I'm still stoked as I KNOW our guild can take Lord Rak without a single death AND in under 2 minutes. Gotta love Bards and there songs.<br />
<br />
I'll stop rambling now. Night all!!!</div></div><hr />
