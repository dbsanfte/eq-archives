<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah, THIS quest. The never ending hellish kitty cloak quest :)<br />
<br />
I'm mostly there, I need a reboot so I can get my kitty bard mule her owlbear bits. (Got the rogue, warrior and beastlord bits off of actual players).<br />
<br />
Two questions.<br />
<br />
1) I haven't been able to get the guardian sonic wolf fang. I've checked this reboot, and the king guardian wolf isn't spawned... although the wolves are in their corner of Hollowshade. I suspect this is why the fang isn't dropping, as I got the grimling guardian bit with the grimling chief alive, and the owlbear bit with the prince sketat alive.<br />
<br />
So is the guardian fang dependant on - 1) the king sonic wolf up, or 2) the king sonic wolf up AND the sonics taking control of at least 1 territory they normally don't have? I'm hoping 1, as I hate to ruin the war for others.<br />
<br />
2) The quest goes vague after the Dar Khura garrison's cloak. EQtraders then says to perform 3 tasks the scouts give you, bring friends. How many friends? Any particulars I should bring along? I'm hoping to drag at least 1 tracker, and a group of high 50's/60's along, but with so little details, I don't know what to expect.<br />
<br />
I assume that the tasks take place at the 3 poles with skulls in them in th grimling camp? (3 poles, 3 scouts, I'm assuming).<br />
<br />
Does the war need to be in a particular state for the scouts? Grimlings need to be alive?<br />
<br />
I'm hoping for a reboot now.... petitioning my hide off that they reset the war, but my only real hope is that they reboot the game so I can finish my quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have gotten a lot of the guardian wolf fangs from the two guardian wolves that stand in front of the cave.  It's a rare drop but not so rare that you shouldn't get it in a couple of hours.  Never seen one drop from any other wolf but that just may be my luck.  Let a bunch of them rot when I was selling elder wolf hides for money.<br />
<br />
I haven't done the officer's cloak yet but is it my understanding that you need to keep the officer that goes on the raid with you alive until the grimling commander spawns at the camp(15 minutes to over 2 hours I have heard).  The commander will drop the item you need to give to the officer and another that you need for the acrylia caverns key.  As to numbers, the officer will give you a hint as to how many you will need when you start the raid and it seems to be a consensus among those who have finished it that you should bring at least half again more unless they have worked together before (i.e. raiding experience).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info. :) The quest gets very vague at this point. I've killed the guardian wolves in front of the cave, but I'll try farming them more. Was the king wolf up when you got them, or just the wolves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Catty, which server do you play on?<br />
<br />
Today, I farmed the guardian wolves in front of the cave for about 4 hours, farming other things in the downtime... I practically exterminated the sonic wolf species, and not a single guardian fang dropped.<br />
<br />
Giant fangs dropped, but that's not the piece I want.<br />
<br />
What does the guardian fang look like? The icon I mean. Plus, no elder wolf hides dropped off of the guardian wolves, are we talking about the right cave? the sonic wolf cave in the east? Hor rare are the elder wolf hides? Because I am not sure I'm farming the right thing.<br />
<br />
This is slowly driving me insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got the guardian fang.<br />
<br />
Then disaster happened...<br />
<br />
I went to turn in my sonic weapon.<br />
<br />
I read the notes &quot;give it to the person who gave you the quest&quot;. Well, Jaima gave me the note to take to Lupiz, so maybe she was the person who gave me the quest - it was 4 months ago when I did that bit so my memory was hazy.<br />
<br />
I turned in my sonic weapon and my apprentice cloak to Jaima.<br />
<br />
[Tue Nov 05 19:44:44 2002] Jaima Seyel says 'I have no need for this item Harvyst, you can have it back.'<br />
[Tue Nov 05 19:44:44 2002] Jaima Seyel smiles and says, 'Very good.  I am glad to have you here.  I hope your studies have proven to be worthwhile thus far.  Our sect is challenging, but we are vital to the survival of our people.  Our research and ability to commune with the spirit world has allowed our people to overcome the challenges of the wilderness here.  Here, take this bag.  It is time for you to face your first real challenge.<br />
[Tue Nov 05 19:44:47 2002] You have cancelled the trade.<br />
<br />
And at that point I went disconnected.<br />
<br />
I rushed to log back in - now I dual box, and only Harvyst's machine went LD.... coincidence? I think not....<br />
<br />
And my cloak was in my cursor. A bag was in my inventory slot. And the spear was NOWHERE to be seen. Not on the ground, not in my inventory.<br />
<br />
I've petitioned and emailed a gm, done two petitions already as the first one expired, a guide says I hopefully will get it back, but *SOB*, that was FOUR MONTHS of work.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how long it will take before a GM answers my call? I've been waiting six hours already, online. :(<br />
<br />
This just breaks my heart. I don't know if I have the patience to redo the whole quest over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play on Zebuxoruk.<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about your loss.  I hope the GM can fix it for you.  Only time I ever petitioned I got a response from a guide within minutes but it took 5 hours for the GM to contact me.  I did get Hollowshade Moor repopped so I could get some items to make a reactive sealant soak for another kitty.<br />
<br />
The Elder Wolf Hide only drops from Ghowlik hiimself(his rare, Elder Wolf Jawbone is his common) but I kill the guardians because I get aggro from all the wolves for some reason.  Only mob I ever got the Guardian fang from was the guardian wolves.  It seems to drop anytime the wolves are home reguardles of wether ghowlik is up or the state of the war.  It is a rare drop so luck will determine a lot about how long it takes.  Took me a week to get the first one, of course after that they dropped like rain, except when there was another shammy in the zone that could use it. LOL<br />
<br />
If I remember right after the part where you need to get the guardian wolf fang and the two other parts (grimling cheiftains staff and owlbear guardian talon) you need to combine them in a box with the journeyman's cloak and return that box to General Avila in Grimling Forest to get your garrison cloak and a note needed to start the wars.  That's where I left it off since I still can't get enough of a force to do the raids.<br />
<br />
I looked over EQtraders notes on the quest and if you still have the Journeyman's cloak you should be able to continue the quest by handing that to Ahom Guzin in the tunnel leading to Grimling Forest,  so it may not be a total loss.  I don't think you will need the weapon again but you will need to recollect the three items again.  The weapon sucks anyway,  I have never used mine for anything more glorified than a scratching post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, last night Rodcet crashed.<br />
<br />
Which turned out to be a blessing. Because after 8 hours of being ignored by GMs, the GMs swarmed the server, depopping planes and handling problems.<br />
<br />
So I petitioned again.<br />
<br />
I got a wonderful godess who descended from the sky, and gave me back my spear. At this point I had almost given it up for dead, and dragged a friendly rogue around the moor, given hides to a beastlord to help his tailoring.... :) begged a claw blade from a beastlord.... So I got all the pieces except the beastlord bit as spares :) I'll find some lucky vah shir to give them too. I was going to give them to the beastlord but the blade and the sleeves are for the other classes.<br />
<br />
I got the guardian claw as someone was clearing out the cave for Gowlik, it dropped within 15 minutes. Much faster than slowly pulling them from the outside. :)<br />
<br />
So now I'm up to my garrison cloak, and hopefull will russle some friends up to help with the officer's quests in a bit :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help Catty :) Dealing with the Hollowshade moor is an aggrivating problem, especially when idiots decide to make the whole moor grimling/sonic wolf....</div></div><hr />
