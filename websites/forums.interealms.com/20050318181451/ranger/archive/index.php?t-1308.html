<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atlantus</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have much time to play for hours on end anymore so I'm looking for a good place to solo for 57+. I tried WW fear kitting but got tired of dealing with the adds. So any other place, including Luclin, where I can log on for like an hour get some solo exp and log off would be great!<br />
<br />
As always, any help would greatly be appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, one place pre 60 I found I could solo blues was in Scarlet Desert on top of the mesa hunting the revs. This was at 59, they proc a disease dd (not sure if it is a dot as well) and hit fairly quickly. I did not find it very efficient, too much downtime for me (granted my equipment is average for my level and no Fungi), you can try the Grey if you have an EB item or a bunch of fishscales and take out golems. Personally I think WW would be better for you, but from the sound of it you are kos to CoV because you mention adds? I keep up my CoV faction and solo in ToV gorge, never had a problem with adds, rarely I would run into a velium wolf on a pull, but I never had a problem fear kiting two mobs, just took a bit longer and had to med after. Like you I don't have tons of time to play anymore and my hours are odd, heh I usually just go solo in FG now that I am 60. Boring, unexciting, but easy xp, and fits best with my time allotment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont recommend soloing in either of the gorges though. Adds are better avoided near the coastlines, specifically in the north west area in my opinion.<br />
<br />
In Timorous Deep, go for the Raptors. Same old panic animal kiting.<br />
<br />
In Dawnshroud, you can do the Rockhoppers, although it is not as efficient as WW or TD, since a some of them will be green at most will be light blue which is annoying. A few true blues there though, but few and far between.</div></div><hr />
