<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quote from shaman area on the main eq site (a reply from my complaint about the level 67 'suck' pet)<br />
<br />
&quot;Re: 67 Pet no upgrade from 62 pet? <br />
<br />
I spoke to Rytan about this and he did say it is not working as intended and will be fixed.  Unfortuantely he did not give me an ETA on the fix other then soon.<br />
<br />
Kytherea ~~The Orange Halfling...sometimes sweet &amp; sometimes sour~~ &quot;<br />
 <br />
And guess what, it affects necros too.  That's the one thing that might just get this fixed (or just theirs) in a decent amount of time.<br />
<br />
Go Go copy spell exactly.  Our lvl 67 pet should not be able to be killed at around a 50-50 rate from our lvl 62 pet.  Go figure SoE.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you don't know who Kytherea is, well, she's a community manager who speaks with the dev team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is especially sucky since the pet is our first 67 spell. What a laugher. My one OoW spell so far and it does . . . NOTHING!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is confirmed though.  I got a reply directly from the development team that said that the 67 pet is summoning the 61 pet.  It is NOT intended, and they are are looking to fix it 'soon'.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this isn't the same 'soon' as the one where people got their ward AAs refunded!  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soon is in the eye of the beholder.  Look how 'soon' it was that we got the refunds for the broke ward AA.  Other classes problems will be ALL fixed and neated up before they even start to look at us.  And then we will be ignored, since we are 'working as intended'.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do not have /hate for this game.  I've played since the second month of release.  I've grown to love the world and the people I've met.  But, I'm getting disapointed on how the shaman is being asked to bend over and spread em.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is sad, quite sad. Something like this it wouldn't seem that hard to fix. Can anyone else think of some complicated reason they couldn't punch some new numbers in the code to fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is what happens when they dont have people betatesting an expansion.......errhhh wait.....didnt they invite a lot of people to do that? Even some of the people complaining here?<br />
<br />
Nevermind, even I could come up with atleast a temporary upgrade to our pet that would dampen the amount of complaints. It would take approximately 2 minutes. If SOE is using the excuse that it also affects necros to make it sound more complicated they are just pulling your leg. Its not the same spell, so they should in no way be connected. So it would be 2 + 2 minutes to fix both shamans and necros. Not 200 or 2000 minutes.<br />
<br />
But why do I care - I'm still not sure I will ever make 67 AND get the rune.<br />
<br />
PS. And its at 61 that shamans get a pet not 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">People couldn't betabuff to 70 in the beta, and I didn't have time to level all the way through 65, just to hit 66.  I was only in beta for about 2 weeks and spent most of it testing how soloable the mobs in Dranik's/Bloodfields were at different levels with different characters.  I also tested Tasks because that was what they asked us to test in the last few days (and I feedbacked about how awful they were).  But I didn't have a chance to test any of the 66-70 spells/content due to limited time and restricted options on betabuff :(<br />
<br />
I'm sure that I am not the only one that felt this way about the beta.  There were some level 66-70 players, but they usually had been in beta from the beginning, or had helped test a specific event and been bumped to 70 or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He, at least our pet that is summoned works.  Mage post 50 fire pets have be broken for, oh....., 4 years now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whaa?  This is the first I've heard about it, what is broken about them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They fixed 50+ mage pets. err, kinda. They used to cast nukes only up to level 34 or so. not they can cast stuff like Ice comet. and atol's spectral shackles. Most mages want thier pets to only nuke though, and not even melee. so in a way, they are kinda still broken.</div></div><hr />
