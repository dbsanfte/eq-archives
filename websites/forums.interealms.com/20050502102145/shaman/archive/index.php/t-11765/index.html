Is there a soft cap on AC for shamans or the more the better?</div></div><hr />

my 2 cents:<br />
<br />
HP &gt;&gt;&gt; AC for shamans (and most other classes too, except tanks maybe, where HP just &gt; AC)<br />

If you know a gm smith(these are player made, not trivial at 250), you might get them cheaper still. The recipes are very simple, made just like banded only you add in a temper made from CT lizard blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HP first all the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Get to 1000ac unbuffed&quot;<br />
<br />
Seem to me when I reach 1100ac buffed I get hit noticeably less, compared to ac below 1100. This is especially true for NToV and below. In PoP on th other hand, everything seem to hit equally hard no matter what ac i have :)<br />
<br />
Didnt someone parse this a while ago, and showed effect from shammy ac all the way upto 1200+, where it topped off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AC is important , but not as important as hp. at 65 im at over 5200 HP raid bff which to me feels kinda low.  i need to be at 6k or more , but that is going to require time cause the gear i need cant be bought , it must be raided for and i just joined a new guild which means no points :(.</div></div><hr />

I would like to see proof that ac past that point makes more of a difference than added hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree, me to - even though I jumped on the hp train like everyone else...<br />
<br />
Can some of the ac monsters here please parse some fights with high/low combinations of ac/hp against varying mobs? :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was an AC freak till 59 or so then switched over to HP's, but I have just recently got my AC above 1100 unbuffed (went down to around 1k buffed) and there is a big difference.  Most of the people I see that say &quot;HP all the way&quot; already have AC at or above 1100.  But it's all a judgement call, see what works.  There's no way to say you need X ac or what not without an Enourmous amount of log parsing.  <br />
<br />
I've seen quite a difference even in PoP with higher AC.  But since I have no logs, I may just making it up =)  (Oh look he missed 3 times in a row, must be my AC ! ! !)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HP owns all.  I have actually lowered my AC recently with my gear choices to improve my HP.  Now that my guild is doing elementals, I expect that I'll be able to increase the AC anyway, so not a big deal.   Personally, I've found HP to be way more useful in PoP zones than the few extra AC points I've sacrificed to increase my HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">HP &gt; all.<br />
<br />
I will always sacrifice AC to get the highest HP that I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used to be an AC freak till about now, but still I will not sacrifice mad AC just to get 50 more HP. IMO I will be able to get gear for both sides eventualy. Raid buff I am just under 5k HP (like missing 30hp) and almost 1400 AC which is pretty damn good for me. Keep in mind I have like 24aa and I dont have ND or anything to give me boost in HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">with reasonable ac, then HP &gt;&gt;&gt; AC,  I used to have 1100ac unbuff and now almost lose 100ac over time after some upgrade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">HP's &gt; ALL (within reason). I always heard 1000 AC was good to aim for though.<br />
<br />
Want more HP's? Get ND(3)!<br />
I am sooo looking forward to ND(2) pushing me over 3k hp unbuffed. And I still got a bunch of slots that need DECENT raid-level upgrades.<br />
<br />
Wanna get hit less? Get Combat Agility then Lightening Reflexes (possibly next on my list after I get ND(3)).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and compared to BD cultural... Tae Ew armor is piss-easy to make.<br />
<br />
I've made quite a few shields at modified 240 skill and lower.<br />
<br />
As a 65 shaman you can easily solo CT entrance for the Tae Ew bloods (and solo Windscorn in Dulak for Iksar blood).<br />
Faster if you duo there with a friend though.<br />
Just use the new PoP root spells to split the mobs.<br />
CT zone line is nice and close if you manage to F#$@ it up.<br />
<br />
Also if the original poster could post a magelo link then we could make other suggestions. Just a thought!<br />
(Skyshrine armor is not bad though - its certainly the best of the 3 Velious quest armors!).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Non PoP encounters 1000AC unbuffed<br />
<br />
PoP encounters 1200-1250AC unbuffed<br />
<br />
My estimates may be slightly off, I have CA3 and LR5, so never really know if those PoP misses are coming from AC or LR. I know there is a huge difference in BoT at 1100 compared to 1300AC.  <br />
<br />
At 1358AC I can easily tank mez 2 adds in a BoT group with just Quiesence on me ...... at around 1100AC, I can only handle 1 with Quiesence (need Tnargs + Quiesence to tank mez 2 at 1100AC).<br />
<br />
Please note, by tank mezzing all I mean is I gain huge aggro (Malos+Turgurs+Blood+Bane), and then just keep Q on me while I meditate on Lizzy .......<br />
<br />
Never parsed, don't know if I am unlucky with only being able to do 1 consistently at 1100 AC, or whether its AC, CA or LR making a difference.<br />
<br />
Pure subjective post only ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">AC is definitely useful. Gone are the days of ac not mattering and hps being the key factor in survivability.<br />
<br />
In high end pop encounters, IE elemental planes, the tanks are finding that ac is as important if not more important than hps now. Ac is having a very definite impact on how hard a mob hits for.<br />
<br />
For example my guild was in PoF last night killing some named. One named we where killing hit for up to 2924 (ouch that really hurts) and rampages every round even when crippled. Our mt was getting hit for an average of around 1200 a hit. Our rampage tank was getting hit for an average of 1900 a hit. Thats a pretty significant difference for a ~200 point ac difference. I've seen reports from furor and other high end guilds doing the gods and such that it continues to make a difference threw 1900+ ac.<br />
<br />
With that said how ever I'm not sure how realistic it is for shaman to try and get thier ac up to that high of a level. If we could it would definitely be worth it. I have no trouble beleiving that 1350 ac or some other simular achievable number for a shaman can make a significant difference for shaman only lower end mobs like BoT or PoV mobs etc. I don't expect to be tanking that mob we did in pof last night ever tho =)</div></div><hr />
