<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Things like:<br />
-what levels can hunt there<br />
-are there different sections for different levels and if so how does one get to the different areas<br />
-XP good or bad<br />
-what difficulties might I find trying to hunt there<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for some new zones to XP in and I notice that there seems to be a lack of information on this particular zone however I did find some people who suggest this zone can be hunted by a group as low as 45ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">XP is pretty bad.  Levels needed would be at least 45+ in my opinion.  There are a lot of green mobs here as well, unless you go real deep.<br />
<br />
Mobs will spawn randomly and out of thin air.  Sometimes opening doors or walking in a certain area will spawn a mobs.  Mobs hit hard and are very social.  Slow works about half the time, as does Snare or Root.<br />
<br />
Loot sucks.<br />
<br />
Some of the mobs proc an illusion spell, turning the player into a random creature.  Fun, but annoying.<br />
<br />
45ish might be ok with the first few sets of mobs, but I would not try to go deep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Advice? Don't go there unless you are raiding a mob (grieg, servitor etc)...SERIOUSLY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, thats exactly what I was looking for. I had a suspicion that the zone must be a bummer since I haven't been able to find much info on it. Oh well, guess I'll have to wait til the rest of my group gets LoY and we can check out those zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you check www.eqatlas.com for zone info? have you looked at the  Beastiary  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=139) for that zone. From what I have read/heard is that it can be a nasty zone even for low/mid 50's..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's like nearly every mob is an undercon in there, with random abilities (flurry, rampage, immune to attack speed). They pop when you reach certain points, so you have to deal with adds.<br />
XP is crappy too.<br />
<br />
Only reason to go in there is to kill named mobs (Servitor, Grieg)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only reason I wanted to go there was to say I had been there, and to get my Philosopher's Stone.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">been bout 5 feet in, killed 2 mobs, watched group members turn into random mobs that don't look the same to everyone, and we left.<br />

I went to Greigs End and I didn't even get a stupid T-shirt!</div></div><hr />
