It's the 60hp per tick upgrade to Q.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, let it roll around in your head a bit and think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well think about this. As a healer in PoP its not the over all amount of healing that is the sweet spot in our HoT, its the heal per tick. Even in BoT your fighitng mobs that hit for single-double rounds of 400-500ish and your 300 a tick Q is Supposed to keep up which is does ok, you have to hit a Tnraggs once in a while, but basicly its &quot;ok&quot;. god forbide any strain coems on you though, cause you will fall behind no matter how hard you work if your group is pulling very fast and your slowing.<br />
<br />
Now BoT isnt the sweet exp spot no more, we are talking PoE and PoW and SolRo, all these places where mobs mitigate slow or simply hit harder. To deal with mobs hitting for about 100-250 more a hit, we are getting a 60 hp a tick increase.<br />
<br />
Does that put it in perspective a lil bit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do fine in most cases with just quin up on my monk duoing with shaman.  Occasional Tnarg when doing mobs hitting for 550+ With can 5 mana isn't ever really an issue.<br />
<br />
the cleric one is 500 a tick but it is more mana and clerics don't have shamans mana regen capabilities.  Only a 140 point diff it isn't really that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But with SCRM quiescence already overheals canni5 :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If they did make this our ancient and gave everyone access to the new canni I might actually be reasonably happy with the new spell selection.

not if thwe lsow was as is but 75%, this was 400 to 500 , canni the same , then i think it would be ok.<br />

Oh wait Spear of Torment and Blast of Venom they've already indulged in pointless spell upgrades before.<br />
<br />
Is it not possible to put a cure on this? Is it not possible for this to be a better heal than this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least that way we would have some sort of passive mana regen, and combine it with canabilise and our mana regen would get a real cool boost.<br />
<br />
If they really wanted to give shamans a bigger role in the group then allow this new spell to be any in group, rather than self only.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hmm reading the posts here it seems you people think that the ancient can is a good thing ...<br />
<br />
Have you looked at the spell detail ?  it isnt Radically effectient compared to can 4 148 for 81 mana vs 688 for 360 mana .  Now I know what some of you are thinking well at least it is quicker mana but that isn't even right  Can 4 has a pretty quick reuse time but the ancient can is quite long 18 seconds  vs 3 seconds.  YOu can gain almost 500 mana in can 4 during the reuse of the ancient can.  IMO that makes it worthless and I'm happy it is the ancient spell I wouldn't use it even if I did get it.<br />
<br />
it should be something like 300 hp for 180 mana and same reuse as can 4 for an ancient spell that one would be nice down to 1.6666 hp per mana vs 1.8 hp per mana of can 4 and 1.9 hp per mana on the ancient in its current form<br />
<br />
but in any case I don't think it matters to much can4 + can 5 aa mana is never a problem with me anyway.  Just kinda dumb to make this an ancient spell when it isn't as good as the old one in game already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i wouldnt say we are overjoyed by the new canni, but in that it reduces the times we need to canni, it is an u/g, it means we can increase mana at the same rate but not stuck to spending all that time canniing we can actually cast other stuff now. thats is where it is better , but it not much of a direct upgrade no.<br />
i would wish it was nearer 800 hp for 425 mana. (but as is is still agood improvement to what we got)<br />
we dont want another canni where we have to cast it every 6 seconds that is the point alot of shaman made, mainly because we cant if we slowing , healing extra which is way the canni is in th right direction.<br />
<br />
the other spells are just so bad we are happyy for any imporvement at the moment.<br />
<br />
but they need the change the dot and slow, they are all but pointless at the moment. the quin is better be really need to be much better to have any real effect.<br />
if they change to dot to a new higher pet i think i would be happier, least i might be able to use the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Edit: Bara ninja posted before I hit reply :)<br />
<br />
You're forgetting one important thing - how often do you get time to chain cast canni for 20 seconds? Not very often in my case. How often can you spare a few seconds to hit canni once every now and then? Almost always.<br />
<br />
Its all about saving time so you can get on with other stuff, whilst still getting decent mana regen.<br />
<br />
The hp-mana efficiency doesn't bother me much, I've got quiessence and SCRM, add in the likes of replenishment, SD, bard songs etc and the I'm not so worried about my health.<br />
<br />
Also dunno where you got 500 mana from, don't forget the casting time plus the recast time on canni IV.<br />
<br />
The way I see it you can get nearly the same mana back in teh same time, for a bit more health, but have all the time inbetween to do anything you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Xarrais, one of the primary complaints of shaman (you know, aside from the ****ty dots, ****ty buffs, ****ty heals, and ****ty nukes) is that unlike every other class, our mana regen is active, rather than passive.<br />
<br />
We're casting canni all the time.<br />
<br />
Over the 18 seconds, this get back about what you'd get back from canni 4.  Leaving us 18 seconds to do other crap, like cast a ranger-level nuke, or pass out ridiculously short-lasting FAs.<br />
<br />
It is bull**** that this is &quot;ancient&quot;, when something like this (a bigger canni) should have been in with PoP anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">but it isn't as good... on my shaman I mostly just do a can 4 after each spell I do.  I don't care much on the active part it is the best mana regen in the game.  It isn't much diff from me having to hit Fkick every few seconds on my monk hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Can we make a forum for Shaman alts?!<br />
<br />
Gonna be nice, Sensei and just say &quot;You play a different game, which makes certain things hard to understand&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I look at the new Canni as something that is truly wonderful.  It strengthens all kinds of shaman.<br />
<br />
1)  The Social Shaman:  you only canni once every 18 seconds, that means you have time to chat and talk to people and still be efficient.<br />
<br />
2) The 2Boxed Shaman:  you only have to hit the button every 18 seconds, means you are concentrating on your other character a lot more and thus more focused = better<br />
<br />
3) The Active Shaman:  loads of time to do other things (move, melee, cast etc).<br />
<br />
4) The Power Shaman:  Alternate this new spell and Canni4 while this is refreshing for more mana regen than ever before.  <br />
<br />
I'm just so sad that it is the ancient spell.  Why couldn't they have made the crappy disease dot that instead.  Who cares about anopther 2 min duration dot.</div></div><hr />

For an expansion to bring in money, people need to buy it<br />
For people to buy it, they have to want to buy it<br />
If you restrict access on 75% of the expansion like GoD seems to be aiming at, that isnt much buyers.<br />

A mainly raid expansion aimed at VT/Ele/Time guilds with Ancient spells?<br />

Guess casual got shafted in the rear<br />

btw Sony, not all of us enjoy sitting on our backside for 6 hours only to die then wait another 4 hours and finally get some flag that is only part of a flag.<br />

The new canni spell is the best one we are getting, but Sony ruin it all by slapping 'ancient' on it.<br />
<br />
Were the old ancient spells not a 20% increment from which they were based? (Scourge of Nife being 20% better than Bane of Nife?)<br />
<br />
Then why is our new Q not our ancient?<br />
<br />
This canni is a huge upgrade, one which should be accessible to all, and not just raiders.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">wow, so over 3 ticks, this spell does approx 1/3 of a single round of mob hits. WHOOPTY CRAP. If mobs attacked eveery 3 ticks, this MIGHT be good. 360 is pathetic when fighting stuff that triples for nearr 1k a hit and mitigates slow, which is what we are fighting. If you arent fighting this style of mob, dont say our healing is fine. Cus at this elvel, its NOT. OMGZOR, my shaman bot can heal me in BoT. Hoody hoo, so can my friend's ranger. Any of the 3 plate tanks can tank for a group in the elementals, with no significant loss in exping. Why can only 2 of the 3 healing classes?<br />

Give us an ancient version of this, 500 a tick, and from raid zones, and then we'll talk.</div></div><hr />

Have you looked at the spell detail ?  it isnt Radically effectient compared to can 4 148 for 81 mana vs 688 for 360 mana .  Now I know what some of you are thinking well at least it is quicker mana but that isn't even right  Can 4 has a pretty quick reuse time but the ancient can is quite long 18 seconds  vs 3 seconds.  YOu can gain almost 500 mana in can 4 during the reuse of the ancient can.  IMO that makes it worthless and I'm happy it is the ancient spell I wouldn't use it even if I did get it.<br />
<br />
it should be something like 300 hp for 180 mana and same reuse as can 4 for an ancient spell that one would be nice down to 1.6666 hp per mana vs 1.8 hp per mana of can 4 and 1.9 hp per mana on the ancient in its current form<br />
<br />
but in any case I don't think it matters to much can4 + can 5 aa mana is never a problem with me anyway.  Just kinda dumb to make this an ancient spell when it isn't as good as the old one in game already<br />
<br />
Efficiency IS NOT what matters. Cann v is no more efficient than can 4 yet every shaman I know say it's the best thing since sliced bread. What it does have is a significant increase in volume and that the same thing ACP has.<br />
<br />
Cut and paste from last time this topic came up<br />
<br />
ACP is currently more hps converted over time than cann 4 with significantly less time spent actually casting. As it stands it's a HUGE upgrade and total replacement. Sure you can't chain cast it but Big fing deal. You don't need to chain cast it and thats what makes it so good.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain<br />
668hps converted into 360 mana.<br />
Total time including recast ~20 seconds.<br />
Time actually spend casting 2.5 second.<br />
<br />
Cann 4 (2.5 second cast time 3 second recast, 5.5 total time per cycle)<br />
4 casts of cann 4 (being generous assuming no lag and perfectly chain casting 3 might be more reasonable comparison)<br />
592hps converted into 328 mana<br />
Total casting time ~22 seconds<br />
Time actually spend casting? ALL OF IT<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see i can convert 668hps into 360 mana every 20 seconds spending 2 and a half seconds actually casting leaving me 18 seconds to cast other things OR i can do nothing but chain cast cann 4 and convert 592hps into 328 mana in a little bit longer time. I'll go with 1 cast for more hps over the same period of time thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Sure you can get a bit more mana regen by getting 3 casts of cann 4 inbetween cast of ACP but is that really needed? ACP is already bit of an upgrade on the mana regen rate side of things and it a whole lot less clicking and time spent gaining mana. Sure I might mem both of them in a post res in a hurry situation but for normal usage ACP will replace cann 4 in my spell line up no question.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Did you even look at the casting comparison above, or are you simply ignoring it?  You can get more mana in less time with the new spell.  Not to mention that fact that you could actually, oh I dunno... baybe cast other stuff in between casts of the new one.  Hard to squeeze in much in the 3 sec recast on Cann4 without slowing your chain casting.<br />
<br />
Edit: Well the post I replied to is gone...  Guess he read the chart, and will perhaps mem it after all. ;)</div></div><hr />

who among us would not consider that an amazing and practically mandatory effect?</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ has turned into a game of doing something in quantity in a short period of time.  I can have all the mana in the world and convert it back in great strides, but it doesn't mean I can keep someone alive who can die very quickly.  You need a healing spell that can heal a single burst in quantity to keep someone up, not a healing spell that does diddly numbers you have spam and pray the person doesn't die or you yourself don't get summoned.  The new Q upgrade doesn't help either.  <br />
<br />
The same goes for doing damage to a mob.  Why else are the 15 other classes (including beserkers) constructed to do this (or have alternate means like charming).  But shamans aren't?</div></div><hr />

I really do not like the idea of our new cannibalize being an ancient spell, but at least now we get one spell that is an improvement outside of our ancient spell :/</div></div><hr />

You're posting some of the details for the cleric's -group- 1200 hot. The 300 mana single target one you probably meant to post to show how our HoT is better also has the added benefit of  curing poison/disease every tick(something people often forget about when comparing the two)</div></div><hr />

Wrong try again. The cure hasn't been on the spell since back in the kurnak days and never actually worked so was removed. They don't forget them because they aren't there. <br />

<br />
Yes, its called Spell Casting Reinforcement and its practically mandatory for most shaman.<br />
<br />
Most of the other healers are getting direct heals inprovements in the 10% range.  20% looks pretty good in relation to that.  <br />
<br />
But IMHO with the way content is structured in LDoN and what we can look forward to in Gates of Discord I'd prefer a direct healing upgrade, especially for raiding shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Just have to understand, botting a shaman for the benefit of a monk is not at all like playing an active shaman.  When I've played my monk with my shaman, its the monk getting the attention and the shaman left with his thumb up is hiner.  Monk aggro just isnt good enough to be very active with a botted shaman without tanking with the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">-edit-<br />
screw it, my browser must be acting funky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">20% is ridiculous ,it don't solve any healing issu. Mob hit way to hard for Q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">A thought to please shaman would be make healing AA's effect HoT ticks. PLEASE!!! /sigh I'm going to bed, wake me up if GoD becomes worth buying.<br />
<br />
EDIT: WTB a patch heal worthy of Elemental level raids. I'm going to hold my breath. /sarcasm off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">yes an aa to increase amount per tick, aswell as the duration at moment would be handy. or even if they are affect by healing aa we have. so you can get critical ticks and improved amounts per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Yes this new heal is nice...for me to poop on.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and PL a Beastlord with your Shaman, you won't regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I bought q for 35k tonight it usually goes for around 65-75k. My question is should i resell it for a profit? Will this spell cost less or be easier to obtain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">There are three reasons, i use Q regularly and not one of them can benefit of a 60 hitpoints/tick-increase  :( .<br />
<br />
1. Self-healing Canni = old Q (with SCRM) is more than enough to cover that already<br />
<br />
2. topping off non-tanks = old Q is sufficient, in most cases some of the last ticks get lost anyway (i don't wait, until a 4k caster is down at 50 percent, just a matter of group safety)<br />
<br />
3. healing or lowering the impact of AE damage = no lvl 65 player will die with 10 more or less AE dps hitting, i doubt anyone would even notice the difference.<br />
<br />
So on paper it is a 20 percent increase, but i don't see the same impact in practical gameplay. Why improve HoTs (where we are OK except the lack of a group one) at all, when those updates could help to lessen our core issues?<br />
<br />
Krakle,<br />
<br />
wait a few weeks for any decision imo. It's likely, that several spell lines will change a few more times (hopefully shaman ones as well ...).</div></div><hr />
