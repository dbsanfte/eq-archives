<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, as I said in title, not even sure this is the right forum.<br />
<br />
I never subscribed to LOY and havea couple of questions.<br />
<br />
1) Do you still get the free bag?<br />
2) How does SoE determine which toon gets said bag?<br />
3) Is LoY available in the new (term may be incorrect) &quot;Gold Pack&quot; which apparently contains SoV, SoL, and PoP?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't remember that you get a bag with LOY..<br />
<br />
are you refering to LDON perhaps? if so:<br />
- you get the bag if you buy the CD (no bag if you register/download online from SOE site)<br />
- you are the one who select wich toon will get the bag with the command /claim , not SOE (carefull: 1 bag per account)<br />
<br />
and i don't know for your last question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The free bag was for people that purchased LDoN retail.  All I got for LoY was blood of nadox and armor dye that doesn't make me look like a level 12 shaman in banded.</div></div><hr />

I think the gold pack just goes to PoP.  If you want LoY you can get the Everquest Evolutions pack, I think that has everything up to ykesha.  You'd still have to buy LDoN though.</div></div><hr />
