<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just sitting here, thinking about the various modifiers on items, and thought of one that I would like to see.  I was wondering if anyone else thought it was a good idea, or if it'd be too overpowering, or what.<br />
<br />
Alright, you know how some items have modifiers like &quot;Shielding +3%&quot;, or &quot;Dodge +5%&quot;?  What about items with &quot;Cannibalize +2%&quot; or something?  Every time you cast Canni4, for instance, and you had a &quot;Canni +2%&quot; item, you'd still take 148 damage, but instead of getting back the 82 mana (per Lucy), you'd get back 83.64 (rounded up to 84) mana.  Would an effect like this on items even be worth the time/effort?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 2%? No.<br />
<br />
I love the idea though, the effect just needs to be bigger. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats a great idea.  I'd love to have an effect like that.  I agree that 2% seems a bit small, but (WARNING--CYNICISM AHEAD) it would probably be considered unbalancing if it were any higher than 2 or 3%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about 1-2% per item and a full set armor with mods that total to 7-8% all in all?<br />
<br />
I like the way set armor pieces enhance eachother like in D2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">True, I agree that the modifier should be higher, but I was only using as an example current + modfiers, which are usually in the area of 3 or 4%.  'Course, that's also 4% of a skill that is up over 250, so it equates to much more.  Certainly a 10% modifier wouldn't be too out of the question, I don't think.</div></div><hr />
