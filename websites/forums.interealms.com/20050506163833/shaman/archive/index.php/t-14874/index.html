Several partial zone revamps coming to the Live servers.  Droga and Nurga will be moving from Legends to the Live servers with our next update.  Along with those zones, we have completed partial revamps of several other zones:  The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and Velketor's Labyrinth.  We chose these zones to update based on feedback from players, and have implemented changes that will make these zones more entertaining to play in.  If you haven't been to one of these zones in a while, you may want to go back and revisit them after our next update.<br />
<br />
 <br />
UPDATE (7-7-03) - Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen issues, the partial revamps of The Deep, Charasis, Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and Velketor's Labyrinth will be delayed.  We apologize for the delay, and will update you when we have more information.</div></div><hr />
