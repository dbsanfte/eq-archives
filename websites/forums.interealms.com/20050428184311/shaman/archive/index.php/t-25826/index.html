<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys:)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if I could possibly solo on the plane of fear?  I have never been there, but since it was setup a LONG time ago, i kinda thought maybe it was do-able.  <br />
<br />
Also, has anyone soloed the tear dropper PHs? (i know the little iksars are easy, the ones before them)<br />
<br />

You can solo in fear but your not going to be soloing the tear drop ph terror (one we can solo). Your hp and ac is just way way too low.<br />
<br />
It's time to replace your belt, back, jbb, and if you have torpor/quie fungi tunic with hp items. Keep the jbb in a bag ando nly wear it when you use it. Fungi if you have torpor/quie is basically useless throw it on a twink or if you don't twink you can sell it for upgrades for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am currently doing a lot of LDoN to get the EF Chain Shirt, i have a cryptrobber's tunic that has better AC right now...but I find myself using the fungi to keep the mana flowing:)  And i know i should ditch the JBB, it is just a fun toy.  On the back though, i chose the Lodizal Shield because of the nice resists, what would you suggest I upgrade to?<br />

<br />

<br />

how's your funds and what do yuo have access to group wise? My magelo is a good choice on my primary as it's all relatively easy to get and my hp/ac is a good deal better along with high wis. If you want to get fancy though you can do my upgrade at 65 magelo which is mostly omens but a decent jump in hp and a huge jump in ac/resists.<br />
<br />
First thigns first is 65 with quie. Then you can drop the fungi simple enough useless then. Second let us know what you have funds wise and if you have friends you can group with. If so omens quest equipment is a nice choice but my magelo is pretty fair one to go with the first one is basically all bazaar and easy to buy/get but gives good gains for you.</div></div><hr />

The iksar broodling only spawn on the death of a golem, and AFAIK 2 of the golems DT every 60 secs.<br />
  Last 2 times I went to fear (in last 2 weeks) we went for enchanter/war epics and broodling just sat untouched. Actually I was able to log on an alt to come get a tear and my monk has one in case I run accross a friend that needs a MQ.</div></div><hr />

As far as I'm concerned yo ucan't be a true shaman without Q. That spell makes cann5 a reality. Once you get cann 5 as long as you have malo or malos your good there. Really just need to upgrade hp/ac like I said my magelo is what I would look at to start.</div></div><hr />
