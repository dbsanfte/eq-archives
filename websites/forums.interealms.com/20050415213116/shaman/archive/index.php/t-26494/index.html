Regardless, I'd like to know what the effect on the shaman community is going to be should the changes to Leopard/Panther go live.</div></div><hr />

They are really getting annoying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seriously...anyone that would quit their shaman over a stupid spell like Panther has no business playing a shaman in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seriously. I mean, heaven forbid that Panther be the straw that broke the camel's back. It's not like they were using this spell to re-envision the class. We're still king of the hill for slowing, although we partially suck when doing so. We can heal like a Paladin. Nuke like a Ranger. DoT like a dead Shaman.<br />
<br />
Whereas we once leapt tall buildings in a single bound, we're currently wheezing into the oxygen mask trying to look down the pretty nurse's shirt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The issue isn't panther in a vacuum.  It is:<br />
<br />
(DPS)<br />
- Panther Nerf<br />
- Panther Nerf as a core component of 'reinvisionment' strategty<br />
- Non-shaman DD spells getting DPS tune-ups with over-aggroing, already-too-weak DoTs being ignored<br />
<br />
(Debuffing)<br />
- Significant increases in the usefullness of BL's and enchanters as slowers.<br />
<br />
(Healing)<br />
- No resolution on 'how will we heal' per the 'reinvisionment' <br />
- Paladin heals upgraded to par with Shaman<br />
- Most (all?) other non-priest classes that can heal got upgrades<br />
<br />
I was more than fine with the class in the OoW era.  The observant person will notice that EVERYTHING ON MY LIST is pretty much DoN era changes.  NONE of them are good for us.  I play the game for fun, and being nerfed, if only relative to others, in virtually every important aspect of my class is  quite   simply   NOT   FUN.<br />
