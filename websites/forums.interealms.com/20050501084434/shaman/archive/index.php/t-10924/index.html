<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smacko Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Was in a fear raid last night and wiped (surprise surprise). Did the monkly thing when i saw the proverbial hit the fan and FD'd. However, someone managed to kill the child before they died. soooo.<br />
<br />
With 10 secs left on corpse and me being pretty much the only one left in the zone, i looted the tear, which was supposed to go to my shaman Guildmate.<br />
<br />
Is it possible, and has anyone done it, to MQ the tear for the shaman epic? Believe the tear is to go to a True Spirit in CoM.<br />
Is this a faction issue? or is it just not possible?<br />
<br />
I'm an agnostic human monk if that helps.<br />
<br />
Can anyone detail what i can do to get my faction up?<br />
<br />
Any help or info would be greatly appreciated, as my shaman friend is pretty pissed right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smacko Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What if, and its a big What if.<br />
<br />
I can get my faction up to max ally with TS?<br />
<br />
Been reading the forums and i'm a bit confused.<br />
<br />
I take it this only works if i'm a shaman or is it worth a try?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input<br />

<br />
Class is quite relevant. If it isn't a shaman, it gets eaten.<br />
<br />
There are more than enough reports present on these boards of non-shaman going through the effort of getting max-ally Truespirit and having it eaten (and not a single one of a non-shaman sucessfully doing the turnin) that there is no reason whatsoever to believe you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Make sure whomever killed the Child gets a 'slap in teh face', it despawns in approximately 30 to 45 minutes, a lot longer than the 7 minutes the corpse lasts for =(<br />
<br />
My comiserations go to the shaman in that situation though, I was in a similar situ before when we killed a golem with a pickup raid, but wiped to the adds after loosing too many to DT's.   I managed to stay alive for a good minute or 2 and the entire time was spent staring at that child, unfortunately I wasnt the only shaman present that needed it, half of me was screaming gank it and grab the tear incase it despawns before we recover, the other half was too worried that if we did recover quickly, I'd feel utterly terrible and basically be a ninja looter.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately my strong sense of guilt won over and I died next to the child, we recovered a couple of minutes too late and it despawned.<br />
<br />
Morale of the story, unless your going with overkill, pre roll the tear and make sure its killed/looted fast, if your raid does wipe and the winning shaman is already dead, kill and loot unless you have a camped cleric or know for sure that the raid will recover fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shamans start with indifferent Truespirit faction. Agnostic human monks start apprehensive -- not good enough, max faction won't be high enough. There's no way for you to MQ the child's tear, so you might as well destroy it.<br />
<br />
This may be true for all other non-Shaman classes as well.</div></div><hr />
