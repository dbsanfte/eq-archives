<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Makwa Claww</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmm I was wondering...Whats a Good Duo for a shaman?<br />
<br />
I allready have a Shaman/Monk combo but I would really like to try a Caster.  <br />
<br />
Shaman/Mage <br />
<br />
Shaman/Necro (Started PLing necro just tonight)<br />
<br />
Shaman/ ?<br />
<br />
Mainly I want a Pet class, but I can work without it as well  Pros/Cons please. (Its just easier for me to buff a pet and let him melee rather then the caster)<br />
<br />
A weird thing I noticed while PLing Necro...I gave his pet some 2h weaps I had rotting in the bank (Axe of Frost was one for sure) and I was expecting 21-22hits tops...pet was hitting for 40-50 damage, somthing new? (Level 4 necro pet btw with harness and haste)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm i have yet to find a Duo class that isnt an asset.  Warriors are a lil harder cause they eat up your mana for heals, etc.  I would think 2 boxing a necro would require ambidexterity(250)  theyre almost as intensive and busy as shamans, especially when doing recourses etc.  They make amazing partners for the shaman, but Im not sure that would be an easy 2 box experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you referring to two-boxing or actually duoing with another person?  If you're two-boxing, I would say the mage would be the best bet.  Just have him send in his pet and then hot key some spells and you're good to go.  Not to mention that he can muzzle both his and your pet and you should be in good shape.</div></div><hr />
