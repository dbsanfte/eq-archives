<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried search but can't seem to find what I am looking for.<br />
I remember reading a thread that showed a trick to display the hotkey for cannibalization as pressed when there was still time left on the refresh timer.  Can anyone point me to the thread or explain again how to accomplish this?<br />
Also, and this is sad I know, but what is the key to cycle through targetting mobs?<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">as for your first question, I'm not sure about the answer.. my cannibalization hotkey looks depressed when there's reuse time on it, and I never modified it.<br />
<br />
However, the second option, I believe it is defaulted to F8(same key as nearest NPC). You need to go into the keyboard section of the options menu and change it. I have mine set to &quot;`&quot; because it is right above the TAB key, which I use all the time to target myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no default key for cycle target, but like yourself, I have mapped it to the ` button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not sure if i understand your question exactly but if you lost your cani5 hotkey you can make a new one by going to your AA screen ( v is the default ), highlighting cani5 under the class page then click the &quot;make hotkey&quot; button<br />
<br />
the hotkey will be on your curser<br />
while its greyed out after use you can click it anyway and it will tell you how long till you can use it again<br />
<br />
i use f8 to get my closest mob target<br />
for other targets i use /assist or click with my mouse</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either you've mis-phrased this or I have no clue... if there is time left on the refresh timer, then the Canna button will be depressed by default. If you want the canna key to NOT be depressed, you have to use the /doability ## hotkey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think maybe he is talking about the /alt activate commands for canni.  I don't use them persoanlly but it may be possible to do what you are asking with one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps that is the problem, I simply made my own hotkey and added<br />
canni blah text<br />
/alt activate 47<br />
<br />
I'll try it from the AA menu and see if that works.  I am also using a custom UI so that may be a bit outdated too.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If your cann5 key is a custom hotkey that calls the alt activate #, then that is why your key does not appear depressed when unavailable. As far as I know, the only way you can get a cann5 key to appear depressed is to use the one from the AA window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have my cani 5 hotkey as number 5 on my bank, this fires off cani with the cleric calming text, then targets me and casts BoTrushar. On number 9 I have the hotkey that you make with the aa selection screen. I can see at a glance if it's greyed out and often just press the &quot;9&quot; hotkey if I want to see how long before I can use it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have my canni hotkey from the aa screen beside my /alt activate one on page 10 of my hot keys. I noticed after the last patch that hitting the aa one to check time left makes you stand up now, if you are sitting. I'm not happy about that change.</div></div><hr />
