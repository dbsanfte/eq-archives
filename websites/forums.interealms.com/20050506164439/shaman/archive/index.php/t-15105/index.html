<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so people complain a lot about our epic, and it needing an update. Well, on my server's board, I found this link to make your own weapons. Kind of cool, so let's see some posts of what you would want the epic to be (serious or tongue-in-cheek, I don't care, it's fun to play around with lol)<br />

<br />
Just make the DoT longer, the ratio better and add a nice lil proc since out melee skills suck.</div></div><hr />

Lower the cast time to at least 2.5 seconds and Time's Antithesis is perfection in primary slot form =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only thing wrong with the epic is that its stats need tweaked. lttile more hp/mana/resists and 5 more to each stat and it'd be just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would like it if the DoT was changed to just do flat damage, and not splurt. If it kept the same damage, it would be 95/tick for 15 ticks.<br />
<br />
Other than that, considering the weapon is on the order of 3 years old, it is still quite good. It would be nice if the mana/hp listings were flipped, but really you can't argue the stats considering how easy it is to get, and how old it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Plus (as I alluded to on another thread) the Shaman Epic  LOOKS  cool.<br />
<br />
After 3+ years playing this game, with PvE and PoP et al, doggone it - the Spear is STILL one of the cooler looking Epics. <br />
<br />
Ragegiver is an awesome weapon, but it doesn't have a red feather and I can't remember the particle effect.<br />
<br />
Monk? Yeah, glowing bubbles....(I hate having to explain why a kick ass 61 Monk has bubbles coming from his fists. &quot;Just started the bath for the kids by putting in some Mr. Bubble and doing a style or two&quot;<br />
<br />
Warrior? I don't think Warriors even GO for their epic anymore. Twin wanna be light sabres....ooooooo<br />
<br />
Cleric? Sorta looks cool, but let's face it - the &quot; limp &quot; look is not in.<br />
<br />
Necro? Quack. (Necro's REALLY got screwed in this department)<br />
<br />
Drood? Quon said it best. &quot;Port your ass back to a time when you were relevant.&quot; (Dr00ds are the Albs of DAOC)<br />
<br />
Bards? Cool weapon, but I can't remember if the particles are even that pronounced.<br />
<br />
Nope. Nothing says kick ass like a towering monstrosity, in ARMOR, with a mutt a spear and a shield. (WIS Shaman take note).<br />
<br />
Shaman: &quot;I'm here to kick ass, slow mobs and chew bubblegum. And I'm all out of bubblegum.&quot; (Maybe Tundra root)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">here's an idea that some people have toyed with in the past, but not much was said about it. Hows about a piece of epic equipment, say a BP, that has a very unique design and texture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SK Particale effect is small black skull(s) that orbits the handle, and the semi-transparent blade is very cool looking.<br />
<br />
Only seen SK like twice on Zeb.<br />
<br />
I used to be a Wis shaman but am slowing converting to HP/AC/Mana gear, trying to hit the 2kHP/1kAC mark. ;)<br />
<br />
And I'm still using all my Epic Pieces (Boots, Shield and Spear).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cut the epic cast time in half or less and make the dot a bit more powerful.  Or have it lifetap :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">umm let me get my epic first then I will rant...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sham epic is still pretty good until you get stuff in the Elemental planes and higher up.  All of the shamans in my guild use our epic as thier primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't have a probelm with the stats, just the long cast time makes a portion of the epic useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the shaman epic is outdated, very short cast range and splurt dot takes too long to do full effect. its fine for kunark era however.<br />
<br />
I doubt there will be an epic part 2 since its been 3 years since the las epic. the people who gave you epics are long gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd love a long arse quest for some no stat gear that looks cool as hell, just for the SSs.   We got plenty of stat gear out there already, let the people obsessed with biger and better work on something else and leave the quests to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Lower the cast time to at least 2.5 seconds and Time's Antithesis is perfection in primary slot form =(<br />
<br />
No way in hell this need to be changed..<br />
3 secondes is Fine &amp; VERY fast when you don't have to wait for spell gem to ungrey after a Malos or a resisted turgur to recast it.<br />
<br />
Turgur has a recast time of 6 sec.. so you can have turgur landing only every 9 sec<br />
With the spear, it's 1 turgur every 3 sec.. <br />
<br />
Without <br />
Casting malos <br />
T=0<br />
Malos land<br />
T=5<br />
Gem ungrey <br />
T=7<br />
Casting Turgur<br />
T=7<br />
Trugur Bounce<br />
T=10<br />
Gem ungrey (all but trugur)<br />
T=12<br />
Recast Turgur<br />
T=16<br />
Turgur land<br />
T=19<br />
<br />
With it :<br />
Casting malos <br />
T=0<br />
Malos land<br />
T=5<br />
Casting Turgur from spear<br />
T=5<br />
Turgur Bounce<br />
T=8<br />
Recast Turgur from spear<br />
T=8<br />
Turgur land<br />
T=11<br />
<br />
8 secondes faster on a 19 sec thingy is a big improvement in my book.<br />
<br />
This is Epic2</div></div><hr />
