<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ticharary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went with a guild on my server to do this, and after about 5 attempts we had to give up. However, they have had success before at doing this, just not on that night. I'm kinda curious of how others approach it. <br />
<br />
questions:<br />
<br />
Do all your Rangers lay back with bows?<br />
Is all clerics in group or do you put them in MT and ST group?<br />
How do you go about getting the w0rd out &quot;I need cure curse&quot;?<br />
At what point in fight do you suggest kicking Trueshot?</div></div><hr />

The strategy has been talked about quite a bit, but this isn't an easy fight by any means.  Here's what I do, as a Ranger, when fighting AL.  Firstly, get your dex as close to 255 as possible before engaging, and pop in Eagle Eye (whether it makes a difference or not is a bit debatable at that level, but hey, every little bit, right?).  Secondly, when the other melees are called in, hang back until the mob is crippled or otherwise AC debuffed.  Once that's done (or if you find out, for whatever reason, AC debuffs aren't taking place), get in position, fire an arrow or two to make sure you have good LoS and nobody's blocking, then pop Trueshot and go to town.  Probably the best place to stand is near the top of the ramp, on one of the raised ledges along the ramp.  When TS is finished, go in and melee.  Maintain max melee range, which is actually right at the top of the ramp.  The ramp is where you want to be, since most likely the casters will be hiding under the little ledge next to the ramp and that's where you'll mostly likely be in range for heals.  Know who's healing melee, so you can watch for oom messages.  Don't wait until you're at 40 or 50% health to ask for heals.  If you have an abundance of non-chain clerics or a bunch of shamans and druids, you can wait till 50 or so to start asking.  Have GHeal up, just in case.  Personally, it doesn't make much sense to ask for a cure until the end of the fight, since the AE will just keep hitting you anyway.  Concentrate on keeping yourself healthy.  WATCH YOUR AGGRO.  The MT and rampage tank will be getting stunned a lot, so you have to be very careful about how much aggro you incur.  Try to refrain from Jolting, as it will quickly sap your mana (the AE tricks the game into thinking you have a much lower mana pool).  Put away high aggro weapons, and use Jolting Blades if you have to.  From that point on, just remain healthy and you've done all you can do.<br />

This fight is a real blast when everyone knows what they're doing, and a disaster when they don't.  Even when everyone knows the score, one or two mistakes, and it all unravels.<br />

For your troubles, AL drops a beauty of a weapon for most Rangers, the Keen Edged Cleaver.  Great ratio, good stats (HP and magic save especially), and best of all: no annoying aggro-inducing procs.</div></div><hr />
