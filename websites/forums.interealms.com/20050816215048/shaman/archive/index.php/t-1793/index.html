<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i personally wouldnt use a macro for any spell casting. if on the off chance that you fizzle, you cant do anything till all steps of the macro are complete and you lose that time. i have never used a macro for canning, just stand and hit 3 (or whatever hotkey canni is on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fifner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The macro is good.  If you are concerned about losing time from having a macro for several canni's in a row and one failing then set up a macro to stand, cast canni, sit.  Sometimes canni fails or sometimes the zone is lagged and i can't cast or sit, respectively.  This is not a problem for lost time because my pause time is set fairly short and I can immediately sit myself by pressing sit.<br />
<br />
I highly suggest using the macro, it is well worth it and saves much typing.  <br />
<br />
Play around with the pause time if you want until you are satisfied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To include fizzle redundancy, have your macro look something like this:<br />
<br />
/sit off <br />
/pause 2, /cast 3 <br />
/pause 2, /cast 3 <br />
/pause 14, /cast 3 <br />
/sit on <br />
<br />
(stole this from soupypoopy on this thread http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=161)<br />
<br />
See how there's three casts there?  That's bascially in case there is a fizzle or two.  If the first one (or second if the first fizzles) succeeds, the others will just not cast.  This gives you three chances to cast in each cycle.  Pressing the hotkey will stand you up, cast cann once (even if it takes three times to get a successful cast), then sit you back down.  You just need to press it every few seconds... or create another hotkey to press this one over and over.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My Canni 1 macro looks like this:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 4<br />
/pause 3<br />
/cast 4 <br />
/pause 11 (or 13, I forget)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
<br />
That way it stands me up if needed, casts once, has an &quot;in case of fizzle&quot; check and sits my rear back down.  Works pretty well for me.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />
