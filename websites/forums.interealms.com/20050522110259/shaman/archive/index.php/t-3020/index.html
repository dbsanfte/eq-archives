<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting some practice in soloing dragons recently (no success yet :( - being kos in WW is a pain ) and I am going to tackle some of the aoe'in dragons after I get yeld dead a few times. Obviously going to need some insta click items to help negate aoe dispell. <br />
<br />
First of all a question reguarding WW casting dragons - the times I have fought them they seem to dispell random buffs and not just the first ones. Anyone else notice this? If thats the case its going to make life alot more of a pain. <br />
<br />
Now on to the clickies - <br />
<br />
Blackfur boots<br />
Shrunken Gobbieskull earring (15+ kills of drach. and no earring :p )<br />
Coldain rings (not really an option for me at this point, the shorties and I dont seem to get along very well)<br />
bracer of the hidden (insta cast see invis, is this shaman usable?)<br />
<br />
please add to my list so I can determine what is attainable solo. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tunare belt is also instacast but is raid rather than solo to obtain.</div></div><hr />
