<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am afraid to play Ldon today due to the fact if the servers come down while you are in an adventure you will get a loss.  I know a lot of people don't care but I am big into stats.  407 wins 10 losses.  I think 10 is a little high.  I am confused about what was stated about Ldon difficulty and being 66 or higher.  If you have a group that is all 66 or higher are the mobs still geared towards level 65 players?  If so can this be countered with playing hards?  Or am I mistaken and mobs will be adjusted towards the level of players?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MLE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As I understood it (and I might be mistaken), there are no adventures planned that are more difficult than level 65 hards are now.  So, everything you get from the time you ding 66 until you are all the way through 70 will be the same level as a 65 hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is my understanding as well. I saw quotes (actual, I'm assuming) that they didn't leave it very easy to just scale up, and that once OoW is broken in and immediate issues are resolved, they will consider adding one or more difficulty levels to LDoN, but it's not even on the table yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did an LDoN last night and had 3 level 66's in the group. The level 66 group leader could not get an adventure, one of the 65's had to get it. When we finished the 66's got 51 points, the 65's got 49 points. Quite dissapointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wonder what happens when they ding 67, will the 65's get 47 points then? haven't bought oow myself but no way near 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seems that while 65+ people cannot accept the mission (bug), the ending rewards get toned per level still, based on the highest member of the group. Basically similar situation when you get in one group people with levels between 60 and 65, the highest level ones get more points, rest get lower amount. So yeah, if you're lvl 65 and group with lvl 70 one day in LDoN, quite possibly the reward for lvl 65 will be low, in 30's maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rewards for 65+ group members should have scaled up, not 65- scaled down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why? Thats how every other level of player has to have it, why should 66+ people be special?  The fact is, LDoN's are going to be jokingly easy for a 66+ group until they add in harder versions, giving out additional points by scaling up would only make things worse.   I just wish they would have taken the time to add a level 70 Hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why? Why the hell not. I get 51 points at 65 that should never ever go down. LDoN are worthless as it is, doing it your way makes it even more useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The whole LDON point system is messed up even before OOW came out. The way the points scale accroding to level really needs to be looked at. I don't agree that just because you got a lvl 66 on a normal LDON that all the 65's should get a lesser amount of points. That just don't make sense. Yes with a lvl 66 it is going to be easier but then again killing tunare with a bunch of lvl 66's is going to be easier as well but you dont see the reward from killing her become less. I look at points and loot as being the same type of reward because they both lead to the same thing, better gear.<br />
<br />
SOE should revamp the whole LDON point system in one final shot when they fix the OOW issue.  If you are X level then you get Y points for a normal and Z points for a hard and it should have some sort of progression from lvl 20 on up to lvl 70. A lvl 45 lets say should not get 8 points on a crawl when a lvl 25 gets 3 or 4. IF they did something like this then it won't matter what the lvl cap is at all because the formula would be in place and adjustable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did an EC LDoN last night with 3 characters.  Level 66 got 52 points, Level 65 got 51, and Level 60 got something in the 40s (cannot remember exact number :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It'll switch to automatic hard when the average group level is 68 as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This concerns me alot because I recently dinged 66. Will my desirability go down in LDoN because I'm level 66 and the 65 group members will now recieve less points for an LDoN? This just doesn't seem right to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did 3 normal Ldon today.  Groups are harder to get together now as everyone wants to do OOW or God.  At level 66 and regular exp at 99% and aa at 10% I was getting around 2% regular exp and 3% aa exp.  Not good.  Winning and adv gets the highest level 51 pts (for us it was level 66) the next highest level got 49.  Myself, a chanter and druid were 66 the other 3 were 65.  It is true that level 66 or higher can't get adv's it must be a 65 or lower.  Also you either gonna have to go all AA or all Exp because ldon exp sucks for 66 but if your not paying attention it won't bother you.  Being a ldon lover I never plan on leaving completely but it sure sucks my group options have become very very small.</div></div><hr />
