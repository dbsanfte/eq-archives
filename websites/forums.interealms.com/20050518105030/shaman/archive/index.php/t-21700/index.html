<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got virulent paralysis 1 tonight. Sounds kinda useful, so I spent my 3 hard earned AAs on it.<br />
<br />
Dinged it in BoT, made a hotkey right off and slapped it onto my shortcuts. I then proceeded to VP the vast majority of the IS mobs I was slowing and it did not land on a single one of them. This was in a good 3-4 hour sessions. Just like SoE (i expect), thats a lot of VPs!<br />
<br />
So is VP1 just useless or what?<br />
<br />
Does VP2 have a better chance of landing that VP1?<br />
<br />
Pile of pants from what I have seen so far :(<br />
<br />
thnx in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IS = inner south.<br />
<br />
If i remember right south is high in DR.  BoT isnt a good place to check resists fro stuff, cause each wing is difference and when they are low to resists one 1 thing, they are high on everything else ( from a shaman view ).<br />
<br />
<br />
In time you will see the use of VP. Heck even go up a level and do the storm riders, i bet they are lower. I just got VP3 finaly and 1 and especialy 2 were great. I cant wait to try 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IS is the inner south on my server. The mobs that drop sandstorm gems. vindl miltis and jord protets etc. Is that a disease immune wing? That would explain it....<br />
<br />
anyone confirm?<br />
<br />
whats the other wing if S is immune to disease based spells?<br />
<br />
ta!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, the sand/south/Gaukr wing is indeed immune to DR (and thus VP).  I seem to think a second wing is also ... don't remember which, I'd guess wind/Laef (whichever direction that is), but don't quote me on it, its been a long time since I've touched BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">true. it's called the earth wing on my server...lower middle upper earth, but ya. disease immune. air (the one with laef) is also disease immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty sure I used to have problems with VP in the water wing as well. <br />
<br />
Some zones VP just won't be useful in, but most zones VP and especially VP3 will be an amazing tool for root parking, or just getting extra room when you're in trouble. <br />
<br />
Onto your question about if the next rank lands better. It doesn't. From the looks of it none of them have a resist mod and are just normal disease resist. I do find it to be fairly reliable against most mobs and very rarely breaks early if you use your disease debuff.<br />
<br />
I didn't think VP 1 was all that great at first, but now that I have VP 3 I couldn't go without it. Not only does the root last longer, but the knockback gets much bigger too. Well worth it IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">VP works good in lightning and water, alright in air, and all the mobs in earth are immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah IS is inner south, which is nearly immune to disease...only chance you have to land a disease based spell is to debuff it and even then its tough. VP 3 is, without a doubt, one of the top 5 AA we have access to.<br />
To really maxamize your VP power, debuff their DR first, it really makes it stick the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To answer your question, VP is far from useless.  I find VP very useful.  It's a great situational CC method, I use it all the time in LDON among others.  I only have VP1, would love to upgrade it but have other important ones first.  The fact that it's disease based is a bonus in most places besides BoT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">great, thanks you all for the info!<br />
Makes me feel a lot better knowing BoT is the exception (esp IS / inner earth)..<br />
<br />
appreciate the help as always<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In the earth wing (brown) the mobs resist disease totally.<br />
In the water wing (blue) the mobs resist both poison and cold.<br />
In the fire wing (purple) the mobs resist fire.<br />
In the Air wing (white) mobs resist most things, but magic, a good amount of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So is VP1 just useless or what?VP3 is almost perfect for soloing diakus in Plane of Tactics. <br />
<br />
Pull with disease debuff, then hit VP.  In maybe a hundred encounters with diakus, I have had a resist on VP once.  One time.  Only once.  <br />
<br />
VP3 lasts for a bit over two minutes.  It refreshes in exactly two minutes.  Thus you can cast it again before it breaks.  Because VP has a timer, you can tap the key before it is refreshed, and it will tell you how long before you can use it again.  So you are never surprised:  you know that it is going to refresh 12 seconds from now, and you stand up and cast it as it refreshes.<br />
<br />
In all those encounters it has broken early one time.  Just once.<br />
<br />
So.  VP is not quite perfect.  It has failed to be perfect twice in ... oh I don't know, 80 encounters?  Maybe 110 encounters?  Somewhere in that range.<br />
<br />
As others have said, it is also quite useful in LDoN for auxiliary crowd control  Cast disease debuff, cast VP, mob is punted off to the side and parked for 2 minutes.  Pay attention to which add you punt:  pick a melee only one (healers will be quite capable of healing even though they are punted off to the side).  Also make sure your group knows that if they nuke or melee or sic their pet on your parked mob, they will  break the root effect early.  With VP3 plus slow and quiescence, you'll soon find it easy to crowd control two adds in normal LDoN:  you VP one and tank the other, while your group dispatches the third one.<br />
<br />
VP1 and VP2 have the same characteristics; they just don't last as long.  <br />
<br />
Just remember:  always disease debuff first, and VP will stick for full duration on many many mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the advice<br />
<br />
Final question. when you say debuff disease, do you use malos first then malicious decay, or just malos or malicious decay (or is it insidious decay ;p )<br />
<br />
thnx again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doh! Sorry forgot that lol<br />
<br />
But thats actually a bit of a pain, so now to use VP effectively you need to have MD loaded? *takes a spell slot*<br />
<br />
double doh!<br />
<br />
So do all you that use VP keep MD loaded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">no.  I extremely rarely use MD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I never have MD loaded. I use VP1 all the time in LDoN`s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never use mal* in Easy LDoNs, period. It's easier to just cast slow twice if needed. I find VP is resisted about 1 in 8 or 10 tries in Easy LDoNs. That's acceptable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ashkani:<br />

BOT is just a bad testing grounds. Take your newly earned VP to an LDON adventure and stand your ground when you're faced with an overpull ... root, VP, and you've got a nice set of split mobs ready and waiting to be slowed and plowed through. If you're dealing with a mob that just HAS to be VP'ed or you're not going to have any fun ... slap a Malicious Decay or two on it, and then VP. That's really great for soloing, BTW ... but when I'm in a group (Hard LDON for example) I do not have a spell slot free to devote to MD. I'm using Malos and Turgur's. I don't use any kind of a debuff in easy adventures, though, unless the mage/wizard is getting resisted quite a bit. Quite honestly, I haven't noticed that VP gets resisted all that much. Sure, sometimes it'll bounce in that ONE moment that you REALLY need it to stick, but that's why you use a spell slot for good old-fashioned root. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Be advised, Diaku Death Knights (SKs) can break VP like its nothing.  They *consistently* cast some spell and it breaks VP.  And then you have a pissed off, unslowed Diaku on you.<br />
<br />
Anyone have an idea of what spell Shadow Knights get that they might be casting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It would be so very nice if they either added disease debuffs to the malxx line, changed VP to a poison check, or (probably the best option) added a nice malicious decay clickie or two somewhere.  That way, VP would save me a spell slot a lot of the time.  As it is, in most places, I need to either have MD up to ensure that VP works, or else have root up for when VP does not work.   Would be nice to load slow, Q, Tnarg's, malXX, canni, bane, FA, a DD and still have reliable rooting capability.<br />
<br />
It's a nice AA anyway, and extremely nice in a couple zones, but it could be a lot more convenient.</div></div><hr />
