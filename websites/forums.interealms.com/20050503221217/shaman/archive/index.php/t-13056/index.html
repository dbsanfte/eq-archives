<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would of posted this in the Tactics forum but didnt want it to get lost among 600 equipment check posts.<br />
<br />
There has been something missing in my shaman's life fro about 8lvls or so now, real combat.  I got a horse, I got a JBB, I got my Epic, and all these toys lead me to sitting around on my pony, maximizing my mana/hp regen and dps.  Oh friggin BLAH.  Sure I can maul nonstop, and tank on my horse for dogdog, and with Torpor and Cana4 never have a mana issue, and xp goes up faster solo in Tier 1 than it ever will in a group.  But that has gotten rather mundane to me, and I realized in Seb the other day that I've almost forgotten how to play indoors.  This is all very disheartening to me, since one of the reasons I picked a shammy is I saw what they do crawling a dungeon solo.  I'm less than 2 AA from Cana5 and I figure when I get that, I wont be needing my horse quite as much and can get back to what I love of the shammy and being on my feet and in the fight.<br />
<br />
So here is the question:  What are some of your favorite weapons and ways to play IN TEH FACE.  In preparation of my upcoming adventures I impulse bought a Soulstripper and SCHW, too bad I forgot I never used 1hblunt in my life.  But 140skill points saved up, fixed that.   So any experiences with the Soulstripper or some good 2hbs.   Just trying to get some input from shammys out there that have been more tank-like than myself lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Although I remember tanking In, as you say, The face as recently as SoL, I find that I am unable to effectively tank PoP mobs well, or at least the PoP mobs with the more lucrative exp modifiers.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, its back to root/dot, unless you're fighting low end PoP mobs with high end PoP gear.<br />
<br />
The key issue is that mobs hit fairly hard, much harder than you can effectively mitigate with torpor/quiescence, so you spend rather a lot of mana just keeping yourself alive. This is with 1300ish AC and CA3 mind you. If you have more, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't have much experience tanking mobs post 60, so I can't comment on that, but this is what I can comment on.<br />
<br />
Soloing in Dulak with soulstripper, The mobs on the first two boats double for up to around 120 per hit.  With Regrowth, AA regen 3, around 950 AC (in my no drop), canning down to 3 bubbles of health (only have about 1600 hp self buffed) I slow, epic, then switch to soulstripper and tank mobs Hasted with Alacrity and Belt of the Grimling Skullcracker (11% haste) with HoS + Rage (around 226 Dex with those up) And I have to canni durring the fight in order to not proc when I'm at full health (I figure to maximize my mana and health regen)  I proc 5 - 15 times in a fight.  I stopped Dotting other than with Epic, and only other damage is with Soulstripper and Alpha pet.  doing that I can keep first boat (8 level 45 spawns) clear before repop.  I have almost 1000 atk with those buffs, 200 skill in 1HB.  Hope that helps some.  Remember... in terms of staying power, (especially in PvP) the proc on the Soulstripper is actually a 150 point life swing.  And with the frequency, its too nice to ignore...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before I got my epic...<br />
<br />
JBB + Dathor Great Hammer (74/95 2hb) was an amazing combo.<br />
<br />
Deal 263 dmg with the JBB and hit for 310 sometimes in between JBB strikes.<br />
<br />
But it was crappy on my fingers to turn off and turn on attack at the appropriate time to keep the regen from the horse.<br />
<br />
Nowadays at 65 though, JBB sucks, Dathor Great Hammer sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aaaaah no Valka, you're completely out of the subject here. It was not about tanking &quot;In The face&quot;, but rather tanking &quot;IN TEH FACE&quot;...<br />
<br />
... which is after all quite different...  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tier 1: IN TEH FACE is fine and fun.  mobs hit for 284 or so, double attacking.<br />
<br />
Beyond Tier 1 PoP mobs hit for 500+ double and tripple attacking.  It's not that much fun tanking them as their damage output is simply too high - every single fight is really hard work when you do it in teh face.  It is possible, but you need more then your own self buffs to do it (Virtue, Brells, KEI).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At times, I'll root park/slow an add, PA/haste myself and hit VOtB, yell &quot;GOING POLAR!!!&quot;  and attack.  My group members always laugh, because I don't do it often and it's a surprise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First off, try &quot;in the face&quot;. That mispelled l33t d00d t4lk is getting on my nerves.<br />
<br />
If you tank in PoS or PoV, you DONT need anyone else's buffs. You can do it if you are 3k+ hp self buffed. But old boy is right, a nice addidition is a god virtue, go bribe a cleric with a few dots before soloing up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Still possible to tank IN TEH FACE right up to Tactics if you pick and choose your mobs sanely. Trick to that is, of course, to not try tanking mobs that mitigate your slows. You can pretty much tank everything that doesn't. Personally, I'd rather root/dot because it'll use less mana in the end (I end up full after each kill using Blood/Breath/epic continuously). Quiescence with SCRM should be able to keep up with the DPS of almost everything you'd be tanking, might have to throw in a few DD heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In Teh Face is from an old rant written by a moron D00d who thought that shaman should be nerfed.<br />

We use 'in teh face' here on the crucible to honor him (/snicker).<br />
<br />
You can look up the original thread here somwhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In PoP, past Tier 2, IN TEH FACE is dead.  <br />
<br />
Take me as an example.  If you look at my magelo profile you'll see 41% haste, 48/40 2hb, 40/38 1hb, and 22/23 piercing items.  You'll see all my melee skills maxed at 200.  You'll see that unbuffed my hp exceeds 3000 by a good margin and my ac is around 1200.  I have ND3, although no mitigation AA's.  Self buffed my hp is about 4400 and ac is about 1250.  Raid buffed I have 6100+ hp and 1300+ ac.  Granted there are many shamans that exceed these stats, but I'm pretty typical of a decently equipped prophet.<br />
<br />
With an approrpiate set of buffs (Spriit of Predator, Vallon's Quickening, Ferine Avatar, Talisman of the Daiku, Focus of Soul, Primal Essence) my str and dex reach my current cap of 285 and my attack sits close to 1300.  On a typical yard trash mob in a Tier 3 zone (BoT, HoH, Tactics, Tower of Sol Ro) my melee output goes something like this:<br />
<br />
whiff, whiff, whiff, whiff, whiff, 226, whiff whiff, whiff, 4, 100, whiff, ....<br />
<br />
My ability to absorb damage is equally compromised.  A typical Tier 3 mob that doesn't mitigate hits at a must faster rate after slow than I can keep healed with Quiescence.<br />
<br />
You get the picture?  If you solo in PoP past Tier 2 (and even in Tier 2 depending on your equipment) forget everything you learned about IN TEH FACE.  It doesn't exist anymore.<br />
<br />
The prophet that solos in PoP is a cross between an ineffective dr00d and a half-assed necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was the battle shaman.  From the 40's to mid 50's I had higher AC than most of the warriors in my guild.  I'd slug it out with a barb spiritist hammer and my wolf at my side.  When I hit 60, I did the obligatory Yeldema solo.<br />
<br />
PoP has been very humbling for shaman.  I tried tanking but it's just silly to let the stuff pummel you when you can root it and spend your mana dotting instead of healing and wiffing with your joke-weapon-of-choice.  I pretty much stop soloing when they nerfed affliction items.  I was enjoying my fast and long lasting root spell.  I know it's not a huge deal, but it was like having pineapple added to your pepsi.  Bleah.<br />
<br />
I've been trading my heavy AC gear for druid-ish junk with HP's instead of wisdom.  I don't cast slow on the pull or I become a splot when it's resisted.  I sit on my horse and malo first to buy time and safely.  Our claim to fame as the &quot;big mob soloing class&quot; is dead.<br />
<br />
Holy Cats, they've turned me into a caster!<br />

Don't even get me started on mitigated slows.</div></div><hr />

You and me both Barm.  If feel like a sissy prancing around rooting mobs and dropping my second class dots on them.  If this is what I wanted to do, I would have started a necro.  Only reason I don't is I can't tolerate the thought of trying to start a character from scratch and getting it all the way to 65 and flagged for tier 3 PoP zones.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually considerign this.I cant tank anymore and the only way I can solo is necro syle. Might just be more fun to start a necro and REALLY solo with him :P<br />
<br />
Tradeoff is necro is not much of an addition to a group compared to s shaman... but that seems to be changing too. Lots of groups seem to be taking necros for damage nowadays.<br />
<br />
Dunno. I love my shammy but I made him to be able to solo and group. Seems like im stuck grouping now, and soloing isnt as much fun :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">TO CLEAR SOME THINGS UP:<br />
<br />
Before PoP was released and actually during the beta.  There was TWO running debates.<br />
<br />
1.  Thott's Graphs<br />
2.  The arguement that a shaman (a priest) could tank mobs.  (Mind you the clerics were given the ability to tank properly much later after PoP)<br />
<br />
Right before the Beta was to be released MITIGATION was reported to have been slapped into the expansion PoP.  And by slapped in, I mean a sloppy job.  Infact the idea of mitigation of slow was so sloppy, it did not work for a good chunk of PoP's first release and caused a lot of deaths.  Because slow would actually roll over into a form of haste for the mob being slowed.<br />
<br />
I theorize, and I don't speak for other shamans.  That Verant or SOE as they are now known, &quot;based on these TWO big debates on two different sites,&quot; may have thought that shamans were too powerful.  And in a last minute attempt, Verant introduced sloppy mitigated slow code to PoP which took some time to fix after release.<br />
<br />
And if you don't think a person's complaint about the strength of a class can get them nerfed your very wrong!!!  Just look at Furor's (from [Fires of Heaven]) post and complaint about monks and Warriors.  That got monks nerfed pretty hardcore.  Thank god they finally fixed some of it.<br />
<br />
But in all essence, it is not worth it to tank the mob any longer.  Especially... not in BOT or the elemental zones.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Ironically, I stopped playing my 61 necro because I thought shamans were much better soloers.  Now as a Prophet.  I am very happy with my decsion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">IMO this has nothing to do with shaman per-se, we are just on a bad defense table, and when mob attk goes up, the corresponding ac/defensive skills needed to mitigate it also rises. In SoL we could mitigate a respectable amount of damage with 1200ac (on most mobs) even on the priest table, before that I believe it was 900ish, for PoP I would suspect the magic number is much much higher. It's nothing new, its mob-flation to deal with the mud-flation caused by new items/aa.<br />
<br />
As for the monk argument, monks were taking less damage than warriors tanking boss type mobs, due to their better defense table/higher defensive skills. I'm not one to nerf anyone, but that seems slightly unbalanced for a class with so many other abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">TO CLEAR SOME THINGS UP:<br />

<br />
Could you expand on this? I'm stuck in the AA doldrums in a small guild and cant get into the advanced plains. I'm wafling on starting a necro cause of the amount of time and pp (torpor!) invested in my shaman. How/Why does a 65 shammy solo more effectively?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I theorize, and ...That Verant or SOE as they are now known,... may have thought that shamans were too powerful. <br />
<br />
Very good point Gag.  Since before SoL, I and a number of other shamans, kept insisting that shamans were not as powerful as many posters on these boards were apt to claim.  The combination of Turgur, Malo, Torpor, JBB, and Fungi Tunic, all Kunark additions to the shaman's tool box, produced a powerful class.  Add in Bane of Nife, Pox of Bertoxxulous, and a pretty decent pet and shamans were very powerful.<br />
<br />
After Velious, it became obvious that EQ developers sought to level the playing field.  This perception of shamans as the most powerful class was evident in SoL as well.  It's not that shamans didn't increase in power in these expansions.  Rather, other classes increased in power faster than shamans.<br />
<br />
Finally, with PoP, shamans have been put in their place.  At level 65, we are in many ways much weaker than most other classes.  PoP is about keeping high DPS players alive for short periods of time.  The shaman contribution to this formula boils down to buffs.  We make a decent contribution to hp of players, top off melee relevant stats (primarily str and dex) and then hang around to watch the mobs die.  Our heals are underpowered relative to other priests, our DoTs too slow, and our DD's irrelevant.  In this thread we've shown what has happened to shaman soloing ability.<br />
<br />
So shamans have been solidly nerfed at level 65.  Enjoy the lower levels while you can guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Finally, someone who reads. <br />
<br />
It's more than obvious, that after the first Kunark shaman completed their spellbooks and began wreaking havok, that we were a tad...um...too gifted. <br />
<br />
It's just been leveled out now. Nothing to cry about. <br />
<br />
I can't remember who it was, but a fellow posted here once about the shaman class: &quot;It's like an old classic car. It doesn't have all the shiny new buttons and whistles, but it's still a mighty fine ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bless that guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually if you're careful and keep Torpor on you at all times it is possible to solo mobs that double hit for 400-500 a pop ... as long as you can fully slow them.  I have had some success doing this with mobs that summon but it is tough, but the rewards are great.  Not sure if this is possible in Tactics but it definitely is in Storms, havent tried Valor.   Dog needs some proccing weapons and all the good summoned gear (well muzzle and belt are good), epic is not necessary and frankly, tough to get off without letting Torpor drop.  Bane and Pox do well for damage.  Anyway try it but be careful it's not easy (especially in my gear ..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">it's very possible with torpor in tier 2 and up.<br />
just not worth the effort and time.<br />
as sissy as it makes me feel i root dot when i want to solo.<br />
but i suck at that too, sincei dont have poxx ultor or saryn =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's possible to tank the mobs near zonein in solro with just Q and a tnarg's now and then. They triple for 650ish or something iirc, but they are crap exp.<br />
<br />
Root dotting is the way to go in pop sadly, simply because it's much more efficent. ~1000dmg per tick tends to kill mobs rather quickly.</div></div><hr />
