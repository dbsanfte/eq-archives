<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So lemme get this straight. If we got a hypothetical 1800 pt heal, we could barely heal worth a damn in gates content. So when the level cap is upped to 70, mob dps doubles... is 1690 going to cut it?!<br />
<br />
Giving us the same raw % upgrades just widens the gap between us and content, since content dps is based around cleric healing. The raw difference of hp healed per second continues to spiral out of control. Does anyone at SOE even understand this? We still wont be able to heal one round of attacks before the next round lands. Healing was essentially our number one complaint, and this is the sorry spell they present us?<br />
<br />
Bitch now, or wait 6 months for a change. If anyone expects SOE to actually tune it in beta without massive uprising, I have a bridge to sell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i've thought this for a while. a %change compared to clerics doesn't mean anything .. SoE needs to hire a math major .. urgently .. proportional increases won't cut it you need to be a lot closer to a 1 to 1 increase aka a linear increase in healing power not a proportional one .. <br />
<br />
the easiest way to think of things is that in ldon, 1 shaman can heal a group, in PoP you need 2 shaman to heal a group .. in GoD you'd probably need 4 shaan to heal a group .. and now with a new expansion and of course an increase in mob damage, you'll probably need 8 shaman to heal a group .. <br />
<br />
even with healing going up proportionally and with us still being %43 as good as a cleric (what a dumb idea that was) .. the amount of shaman needed to keep a single tank alive in a run of the mill situation is now going up exponentially.<br />
<br />
Maybe if they made Quiessence stack like dots stack, then 4 shaman would be able to keep a tank healed .. but not this way</div></div><hr />

why dont we try fixing what we have now instead of worrying about the future expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or here's an Idea! They could make more challenging encounters in ways besides simply upping mob dps *gasp!*<br />

Of course we all know this is utterly unlikely lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gotta agree with gangas on this one. Current content is broken, so who really cares about future content until the current is fixed. Alot of us are complaining we haven't had the proper linear increase in power since kuark in so many areas, maybe if they fixed us now we wouldn't have to worry about what the next expansion has to offer.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why we can not do both.<br />
<br />
I agree, the new heal is not enough. It would have been barely adequate for GoD. When Omens coems out we will just be in the same situation we were when Gates went live.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Because I dont think the guys working on our new spells and content are the one on the current revamps, allowing us to have our cake and eat it too? Or if they are, because they might limit any healing upgrade we get now, so the projected omens upgrade is seen as welcome? Or because a heal of 1690 for level 70 mobs indicates how out of touch the devs are with our current inadequacy, that they think its an acceptable amount for HARDER stuff.<br />
<br />
Lots of reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">why dont we try fixing what we have now instead of worrying about the future expansion?<br />

Because the future will soon become the present, and will need to be fixed eventually.  The sooner its changed, the less friction there will be to change it.</div></div><hr />

So you think it is easier to accept the 1700 heal in Omens and ask for a 1800 heal for Gates then to ask for both of them to be upgraded? :p</div></div><hr />

Actually, it probably is based more likely on healing rates than cleric healing as such. In God the design appears to make the assumption that you would have a primary healer and a backup healer and for that reason dps is higher than in previous expansions. Its a different paradigm. If clerics/druid healing is increased in proportion to ours, parity with GoD will likely be maintained, even if the dps is increased.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that is flawed logic, thats like saying your dps is greater than said mobs hit points, and your tank will barely ever get hit.<br />
<br />
ever do a tipt trial ?<br />
<br />
i have done 29 to date.<br />
<br />
had 5 bracers of exploration rot. no spells, some quest pieces and a few augs (two).<br />
<br />
out of 29 of those tipt runs, our tank went down 20 times from enrage, he swung just once and the riposte + melee killed him. even turning it off attack the mob is insane DPS no cleric can heal it alone, even with heal crits.<br />
<br />
trash mob dps is out of control, hitting for 1500 tripple / quad ...<br />
<br />
then add on the 650+ dd proc (wich goes off every hit)<br />
<br />
you now have a mob that quads for 2150+ and also kicks !<br />
<br />
you can one round most tanks, and knock a 10k tank down to 15% in one round.<br />
<br />
this expansion is crap, its not even manageable, its all about how much your LR 5 and ID 5 fire, nothing more than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I suggest you get a new MT then, if he has gone down 20 out of 29 times to enrage he is plain and simple just incompetent. Mobs enrage do it at 10%, any tank with half a brain knows to switch attack off before then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mobs enrage do it at 10%, any tank with half a brain knows to switch attack off before then.<br />
<br />
you can't switch off attack when the mobs hitpoints are so low that even my 925 nuke does 6% of thier life.<br />
i know lots of tanks that dive when the mobs enrage. the hit points are so low when they hit 25% people turn off attack, but they have good chances of losing aggro and wiping.<br />
<br />
so basically you did answer my question, you have not done tipt.</div></div><hr />

I just hope the Clerics in your groups have plenty of mana.  I personally don't like it when melee can't figure out how to time ENRAGE.  You are now forcing a Cleric to time the ENRAGE with his heal, instead of just having a tank hit a button?!?!  After 75% of even a GoD mob, if your tank doesn't have enough aggro to turn auto-attack off, you need a new tank (Not to mention that hitting the taunt button will not cause a Riposte).  Nukers shouldn't be casting until 25% anyway with mobs that only last 30 secs.<br />

im guessing you haven't been there either ?<br />
aggro turns on a dime there, i cast slow im taking for 1 or 2 rounds unless the warrior proc's his BoW fast enough.<br />
<br />
if i get healed, the cleric is gone (druid certain times) reason the cleric dies, who uses CH on tipt ? no one, he uses or (she druid) thier new GoD heal wich drops alot btw. it can crit for almost a CH ammount.<br />
some times its hard to even pull aggro off the bard or monk pulling.<br />
some mobs respond more to certain situations, tipt is very hair trigger.<br />
i land 2 crit heals in a row during the boss mob fight, i have to either<br />
<br />
1. slow down on healing (wich could kill my tank) or<br />
2. keep chaining and become rampage tank until i die</div></div><hr />

When are you casting Slow to get aggro that you NEED a proc in this day and age of Warrior Taunt?  OK, thats a trick question...but it is better than before :D<br />
<br />
I don't own GoD, but as far as I know, only the mobs DPS and HPs have changed.  I haven't read any aggro changes or friends that do go there haven't said anything.  Hell, I was under the impression that slowing there was a waste of mana because the mobs were down to 40% before you could land the damn thing.<br />
<br />
But outside of that, it still holds true that melee should know when to stop attacking an ENRAGED mob.  Taking a round here and there will happen, but not every single mob.  It's a timing thing, kinda like learning when to cast slow with each tank you group with IMO.<br />

And I would rather not have to fight the same battle over and over and over and over and over . . .<br />
<br />
Lets get it ALL fixed now. Our healing sucks. Gates healing sucks. The proposed healing sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">you can't switch off attack when the mobs hitpoints are so low that even my 925 nuke does 6% of thier life.<br />

<br />
A cursory examination of my magelo would make it pretty obvious that I've been to tipt.<br />
<br />
If your MTs are attacking through rage, get new ones. Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A cursory examination of my magelo would make it pretty obvious that I've been to tipt.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
with your warrior and not your buff bot im guessing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">with your warrior and not your buff bot im guessing<br />
<br />
If you look at both, you will see that both have been to Ikkinz, and therefore obviously both have been to tipt.  <br />
<br />
And since we are talking about common sense on the part of warriors during rage, yes, I'm probably a lot more qualified than you to talk about it. Any warrior MT that attacks through rage on a routine basis on anything other than trivial mobs is an idiot and a liability. Get rid of him, and find someone who knows how to play the class.<br />
<br />
Which brings up another question, if your warrior is taking a thumping to that extent, why are you nuking instead of healing? One of your earlier comments suggested you were doing that.<br />
<br />
Re-reading your posts I think you are probably experiencing the effects of poor tactics on the engage. Particularly if you are using a monk/warrior combo, there is no reason for there to be an agro issue with a BoW wielding warrior, or any issues with rampage, unless poor tactics have been used, or someone has acted out of order on the pull. That is especially true on short intense fights, such as the tipt boss.<br />
<br />
[Edit] One other thing, the tipt named doesnt enrage. I couldnt remember before if he did or not (named in Ik dont for example) but I happened to do a Tipt run for a backflag today, and can confirm that he doesn't. So if your tank is going down 20 out of 29 times, it has nothing to do with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You also have to look at the potential HP of melees.

<br />
Not really. I would be surprised if additional hp from levels amounted to much more 5% of what people have now, whereas the margin of increase in spell magnitude generally is larger than that. For GoD it was originally 10%, and in many cases later got ramped up to 20%. I expect the same will apply to OoW. Increases from  new gear would amount to more, but that primarily affects very high end people and in any case has nothing to do with levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">/shrug.   The gap between 60 and 65 is very noticable.  Gear and AA's play a large roll with it.  Why wouldn't it be with 70?  Stat caps will probably increase and who knows if there will be new HP AA's.  It all adds up before you know it.  Shaman heals have been scaled from level 1 since original release, but only with percentages, not with the factors of gear, AA, hp per level, hp per stam point, etc.  The game has taken a gigantic leap from the days of level 50 to today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think from 60 to 65 it was roughly about 100 or so hp per level for Yella, I'm not sure what it was for Mok, but it was rather less. 65 to 70 will probably add a few hundred hp only, compared to what people allready have its pretty minor, and certainly wont match the increase in spell magnitude.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure about stat caps increasing, they might, but even if they do the effect will be pretty slight. You dont get a lot of hp from STA over 280 or so, for example. Since they are putting all these melee modifiers on the new buffs, it sort of suggests that any stat increase wil be of very minor impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The real power from levels comes from the decreased hit rate and average hit mobs will have against a level 70 character, which basically translates into &quot;more&quot; HPs against everything we are currently experiencing.</div></div><hr />
