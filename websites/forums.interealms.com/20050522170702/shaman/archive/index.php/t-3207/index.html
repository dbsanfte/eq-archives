<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm about 3 points from canna 5, and I was thinking I'd power through them between raids this next week.  I had a couple of questions for those of you who already have this skill.  Several of the information sites seem to have different numbers on Canna 5.  There seemed to be some different numbers on this board as well, so . . .<br />
<br />
1.  What is the refresh time on the skill?<br />
<br />
2.  Is 1948 damage the correct number?<br />
<br />
3.  How much mana do you get?  (1200?)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!<br />

P.S. Maybe we should add this to the FAQ . . .?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1924 damage --&gt; 1005 mana, if memory serves. 3 min refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really?  That's disappointing.<br />
<br />
Canna IV = 82/148 = .55405<br />
Canna V = 1005/1924 = .52235<br />
<br />
So Canna V has a lower ratio than Canna IV?<br />
<br />
Of course, it makes up for it a bit in sheer volume, but still.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/shrug, you do see different figures bandied about. 1005 seems a bit low to me, I pretty sure I can cann5 when oom or thereabouts and then cast a Khuras at 1250 mana.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Does 1924 Damage<br />
<br />
Gives me roughly 30 - 35m per cast.  Max Wis, good +mana items ...<br />
<br />
If I'm dead oom (cant cast 30 mana root) and I Cann V I can cast Khura's Focusing after 2 Cann IV casts ...<br />
<br />
Khura = 1250 Mana<br />
Cann IV = 84 mana returned?<br />
<br />
Unable to cast root &lt;= 29 mana at start<br />
<br />
Worst Case 84 + 84 + 29 = 197.   1250-197 = 1053 mana.<br />
<br />
Best Case 84 + 1 + 0  = 85.  1250 - 85 = 1165 Mana.<br />
<br />
Unsure how much mana is regened standing, I have FT6 in items at the time of test.  Might have been 1, possibly 2 ticks.<br />
<br />
If we assume I regened naturally, standing (no horse) 30 mana during the test period I end up with possible mana given in the range of 1023 to 1135.  So if you assume 1075 you'd probably be pretty close.  <br />
<br />
Someone with more inclination and/or time than me could likely pin the number down more exactly.  I'm pretty sure it is higher than 1005.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess I'd bet it is whatever the ratio Cann IV gives applied to 1924 dmg.<br />
<br />
My experience would suggest Cann V gives more than 1005 mana, and certainly less than the 1200 figure you cited.<br />

<br />
I was wondering, how we hotkey these skills other than the 'make hotkey' button that's given on the AP screen.  Is there a /doskill # system that they have worked out for alt skills?<br />
<br />
yer pal,<br />
ssik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it's 47.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Use the ability, then shift+ up arrow to see what the command for the ability is. You can make any kind of multi line hotkey with the ability command in it.<br />
<br />
The disadvantage is the &quot;make hotkey&quot; one is greyed out and comes back when the ability is refreshed, I just hit &quot;v&quot; to see when mine has recycled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">haha, is it really /doskill?   that was completely arbitrary.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh don't get so caught up in efficiency. Time &gt; efficiency. Cann 5 is awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so I click can V, then while it's casting (while I'm using it), I shift / up arrow key?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">refresh is 3 mins.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you the number of times it has been a lifesaver for me.  The ability to instantly get ~2 bubs of mana back is pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
I only have about 3300 mana or so, so 1924hps for 1066mana is pretty good.  Almost a third of my mana.  :)<br />
<br />
BTW - One of the reasons you might be able to cast khura's focusing if you have less than 1250 mana is specialization check and mana preservation items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so I click can V, then while it's casting (while I'm using it), I shift / up arrow key? <br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I was answering how to make a hotkey for Canni 5.<br />
<br />
The way to do it is to get the command EQ uses. So use your Canni5 hotkey, then press shift+up arrow to see what the command is, my memory's a little hazy but I think it's /alt ability 47. Pressing shift+up arrow will show you the command.<br />
<br />
My cann5 macro looks like:<br />
/gsay Using Canni Disc<br />
/alt ability 47<br />
<br />
I can't guarantee the second line, which was why I recommended using shift+up arrow after using the ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Henora-<br />
<br />
I thought specialization and mana preservation checks went through once the spell has been cast, therefore you still need the amount of mana the spell says, but once you cast it it doesn't use that much mana? wow that's kind of muddy, but i hope you understand what i'm trying to say...that's how i interpreted it, anyone KNOW how it is calculated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thats what i had thought as well Shenlon.  but dunno really, 11 AAs till i get canni5, theres a small chance i am counting down :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shenlon-  <br />
I understand what you are saying.  yeah, heh.. I guess I really don't know for sure, I just assumed it was all part of the initial cast.  There's lots of stuff that it checks for right, fizzle, range to target, mana cost, I just assumed it would include specialization and all that in the calculations.<br />
<br />
My experience with Khura's Focusing seems to support it, sometimes I am able to click it with much less visible mana on my bar than other times.  wooo scientific evidence that is!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't think anyone said it yet, so in case you wonder: casting time is instant.<br />
Like rabid bear refresh time counts on when you're offline. (Though that doesn't matter much since it's 3 mins).<br />
<br />
It's very fun to use when your group's cleric is least expecting it. Make sure to gsay something like AGRO AGGRO~~!<br />
<br />
Actually, that is only funny when it doesn't get you low hp aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">EqCaster says its 1924 hp--&gt;1066 mana. Its usually correct. This is the same ratio as Canni IV. Specialization shouldnt matter in this case, since its checked after you have cast a spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Had a bit of fun with it last night. Usually I have my hotkey set to warn my group that I am using it, but last night I didn't have it up (so I could see the refresh).<br />
<br />
Shortly into a pull, I hit the key and my health dropped to 2 reds. The bard in my group panicked and hit his DA song. Really pissed off the cleric in my group because he was in the middle of casting Aego on me when DA went up.<br />
<br />
Still laughing over it. Although I did bring out the warning key for the rest of the night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casting time is not instant, you can duck and interrupt Can 5.  If you duck and interrupt, the three minute timer does not start over, you can use it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yep, short cast time, but definately not instant.<br />
I interrupt all the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Lucy lists the recast time as 69 seconds.  I assume that Lucy is incorrect and it's actually 3 minutes as two people stated. . .?<br />

1 AA point and 2 bubbles to go!  Soloing in FG is sick exp.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Canni5 will completely change how you play your shaman. It rules.<br />
<br />
Just another bit of into. After you use canni5, if you click the inactive button it will show you how much time you have left until you can use it again.<br />
<br />
Just to be safe, when I'm checking how much time I have left on canni5 I duck first, that way if it becomes active while I'm checking it, it won't go off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Soloing in FG is nice xp, but sucks the sweat from a goats testicles in terms of enjoyment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The syntax is /alt activate 47<br />
<br />
Is too bad it's called Cann5 now, in beta it was called Massochism. I think that would have lent itself to cooler emotes and casting messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Cann5 is alot of fun for scaring clerics in exp groups...but not wise to use it in ToV without Aego...catching a bad resist roll on  AE while casting cann5 without Aego = sumoned, and torpor often isn't enough to save you :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Ah yes, you guys are right you can interrupt it so it can't be instant. Must have been confused with rabid bear. Been a few months since I last played ;)</div></div><hr />
