<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Siren's Grotto<br />
Where: Otter Cheif camp on CS Beach<br />
When: 8:00 PM - 12:00 PM EDT, Thursday, July 12 <br />
Level Range: 50+ <br />
Requires: CS fang or ability to get self to CS<br />
<br />
This raid will be limited to Two Groups. Others not selected are encouraged to meet at the Beach, however, to act as replacements if those selected do not make it. <br />
<br />
G1: <br />
Shambul<br />
Traz<br />
Cyrssi <br />
Cleric <br />
Sinfutura<br />
Zadu<br />
<br />
G2: <br />
Chmee <br />
Arsecn <br />
Aaeamdar<br />
Bearan <br />
Bemidian<br />
Razma<br />
<br />
Reserves: Canoe, Mathilde*, Anuin, and Feadil<br />
<br />
Requirements:  Attendee's are encoraged to bring some DoTs/Jaspers for Symbol and if you have some sort of EB gear, it will help limit that issue when we are underwater.<br />
<br />
Objectives: We are going to be starting on the Cobalt Scar zone line and moving as deep in as we can get.  With some of the recent changes to the zone, we will also be regathering information that we collected earlier on the mobs there.   Both Chmee and I will be on earlier than the Start time.  If all members are avilable we will start earlier, otherwise we will take those who arrive early and do some experience hunting at the zone line area, including seahorses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mathilde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Would love to go. If I can get a CS tooth by then count me in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I edited the first post for groups.  We are still missing a cleric, but Mathilde, if you are able to get to CS, you would fill that role.  Since your post indicated you did not yet have a fang, I have not put you on the list yet.  Because we are going to be exploring unknown area, the chance of death is significant, and we will need a cleric or 59 Paladin to sign up for this to be a go.  If we don't get one signed up by tonight, we will hunt the seahorses and Bulthorks at the zone line for a bit, to see if we can get a late comer there.  If you need transportation to CS, please be on at least 15 minutes ahead of raid time; I would like us to be in the zone, buffed and fighting by 8:10.  I will be on by 7:00 and of course available to get folks where we need to be.  See you all tonight.</div></div><hr />
