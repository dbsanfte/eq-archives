<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, this is a bummer. The clicky on our Epic 1.5 is no longer targetable on other groups. Kinda sucks, was a VERY nice feature, especially on raids with AE mobs. <br />
<br />
Of course, SOE didnt announce this change in the patch. I am not sure it was ever intended to be targetable on otehr groups, but that seems like a REALLY dumb mistake if it wasnt. I don't really see it as all that overpowering, either. Just handy.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure it was ever supposed to be /tgb'able, but something like that seems like kind of an obvious thing when you're creating new spells. Maybe it's not (I admittedly know jack about game code), but sheesh. I just wish it'd been put in the patch message, up front and honest. Too much to ask? Perhaps.<br />

Was it a ninja nerf or was it a bug introduced with the patch which would explain why its not in message.<br />

Buggered if i know :).<br />
<br />
Maybe pawing through all SoE sites is the only way.<br />
<br />
Maybe Rytan may deign to visit The Crucible again and happen to read this post ? :).<br />
<br />
Get Grimbear to ask ?.<br />
Although he hasnt posted for a while so maybe hes too full of the xmas spirit at mo :).<br />

Its not just our epic, or epics in general. It is all clickies with group buffs on them, from ornate chanter pants to primal cudgel.<br />
<br />
Sounds buggy to me.  Think there's even a thread mentioning this already. <br />
Woot! Found it rant thread on bugs and resists (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=25275&amp;highlight=primal)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's good though, it means a raid will need more than 1 shaman. Each group in a raid should have a shaman. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yea i noticed that... i usually aim for the DPS group and click it on... but it didnt work... i didnt think any more of it...<br />
<br />
*sigh* must of been way over powered for us to TGB it...<br />
<br />
is Radient cure tgb too? im sure it was.. but not any more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">is Radient cure tgb too? im sure it was.. but not any more<br />
I dunno. Dont know about Ancestral Aid either, havent checked. I know AnAid was TGBable as well. <br />
<br />
This is kinda a lame ninja-nerf if all those abilities are no longer TGBable. Grim, if your reading this thread, please ask whoever about it. I posted on the SOE shaman board, but who knows if anyone will ever respond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">is Radient cure tgb too? im sure it was.. but not any more<br />
<br />
Radient cure has never been target group BUFFABLE since it isn't a buff. Just like regular group heals aren't targetable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It was never intended to be tgb able..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It definitely should be tgb'able. No reason why it shouldn't be. It's got a 10 min recast time on it... you tgb it and that's the way it goes LOL. <br />
<br />
Could you post a petition on it to see if they respond. This will at least let the GM's in on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm gonna miss doing MGB Group Primal Essence in the Bazaar, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Has it been confirmed that clicky's have been purposefully nerfed or do we just figure that its over and done with?</div></div><hr />

No idea, my post on SOEs board never got a reply. Maybe if Grimmbear is reading this he can look into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It was nice to have the choice to epic other groups, but at the same time far to often the Main Tanks group ended up with what should have been applied to my own in my own haste of casting it. =) I thought yesterday i had messed up but my group ended up with it, never dawned on me they had ninja nerfed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Okay, I'll ask on the summit forums.<br />
<br />
Tarelina, your signature image is too tall for the Crucible - max height limit is 100 pixels :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For my part im poking around about this over on the correspondant forums too . Im sure Glori and/or myself can get an answer as to if this was an intended change .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok here is the word on this:<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;We had a bug where any item that was a group effect could be cast on any groups, not just group members of the item owner. This wasn't a specific issue with just the Shaman epic, but with any item that had a group buff on it. We fixed the bug so that all items that have a group buff can only be cast on group members.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the responce I recived after asking about this Issue . Hope that clears up any questions ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Question,<br />
<br />
What was the reasoning behind not allowing people to use clicky group buffs on other groups?<br />
<br />
Was this reasoning brought up after such a time as items with clicky group buffs were introduced into the game?<br />
<br />
Basically, is there a single item out there that they wanted to nerf, but they ****ed up and nerfed them all instead in classic SOE fasion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Super overpowered when I put GPE on the whole raid and they all got +20 Stamina - was probably an exploit and I didn't even know it. *whew*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Is there anyone still on the dev crew from back when the primal cudgel was put in the game?<br />
<br />
This was not in anyway a FIX, this is currently a bug that this stuff isn't working and of the things that people should be raising hell over i would say put this on the list.  Not that I have a cudgel, just the way they are dealing with the issue blows.  When people bitch and moan and complain about sony doing things messed up its when they do things like this.</div></div><hr />
