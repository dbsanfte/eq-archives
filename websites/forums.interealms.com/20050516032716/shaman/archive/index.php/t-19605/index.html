<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild was setting up to do Vindi last night (which we took him down) But while we were waiting for peeps to show up. We were pulling the Arena mobs for about an hour or so.<br />
<br />
I am lvl65 and I was casting Lvl51 Turgur's Insects (we had more the enough melee and healers that the mobs did not have to be slowed) But if I cast Malos first no Resist.<br />
<br />
If I did not cast malos then the Giant would resist slow 3-5 time once in awhile no resist. but 90 percent in that hour resist at lest once and on the high side resisted 3 times or more.<br />
<br />
by the time I was casting the 5 time the mob would be down to about 14 percent heath but I kept casting slow just to see how much how often I would be resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check back with your people and ask if somebody was &quot;pre-slowing&quot;. Beastlord, Enchanter, Bard, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was the only Shaman. No Bst, No Bard. And only one Chanter and she was not slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What would &quot;pre-slowing&quot; have to do with anything?  And for that matter, what would the level of the spell have to do with anything?  My 61 ranger still casts his level 9 snare and has no more problems getting resists as he did at level 9.<br />
<br />
Do people actually think spell-level and pre-slowing have any effect at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think I get the point of this post...  If it was getting resisted a lot without malos, but not with malos, cast malos first.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You know, I've always been a touch skeptical about preslowing making us resist.  But the other night, we had a group in loy killing whatever named were up.  A number of times the bard preslowed a mob incoming while, not one single time did my slow land on any of those mobs.  Maybe I was bugged or something, but I had no trouble slowing anything else.  I'm 63 and the bard is 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not sure I understand either, Kami. Then again, I'm a Barbarian with a rather thick skull. At any rate, I've slowed arena giants many a time. My guild took Vindi out earlier in January (a momentous occasion for us!!) and I was (as always) main slow. I had nobody pre-slowing, though I did have a 65 beastlord with his 50% slow (he hadn't bought the 65% one yet) on backup and a 56 shaman with Turgur's ready just in case we had more mobs than I could handle quickly (we have rather ... adventurous ... pullers). I had very, very few problems with mobs resisting. The few times I did have a resist, I'd malosinia, then cast Turgur's, and stick the slow no problem.<br />
<br />
If your folks had the mob to 14 percent, I have not much clue as to why you were still trying to stick a slow. Start looking for the next mob to slow, nuke, toss a heal, canni ... something. Slow isn't going to do you much good by the time 14% rolls around -- at least not on Kael arena giants.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">don't worry too much man, i was in the arena today for a pickup AoW raid, throwing my slow around on everything with my TA, and I was getting about the same results as you without malos.  Just mobs there require a malos first to land slow easily.  They don't hit very hard, at least some of them, but malos would be required to land it with any first cast frequency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am sorry the point I was trying to make was how &quot;easy&quot; our slow is resisted. <br />
<br />
Yes I know that when a mob is at 14 percent health there is no reason to be still casting slow. but I was doing it to see how many times they would resist.<br />
<br />
At lvl65 casting Slow on a Light Blue mob I dont think it should resist 3-5 time. yet it was happening over and over.<br />
<br />
Now for newer zones like LDoN I would say that I get about 50 percent resist rate on mobs with the first cast of slow.</div></div><hr />
