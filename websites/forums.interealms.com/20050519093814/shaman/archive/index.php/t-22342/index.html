<br />
Now lets hope they get the other messages we have been trying to get them to listen to as well.<br />
<br />
Kudos to SOE if they get it right when it does go live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tell me you are on Prexus so i can bet some plat.  i would almost give odds there is an 'emergency' patch after the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm with Cattywumpus on that one. The changes they've said will be made with this patch are worth a few days' wait, IMHO. Emergency patch? Sure, more than likely. The man who wrote the letter Glori linked (damn, I can't remember his name, ugh where's my caffiene) said there were some &quot;backend changes&quot; coming. That almost always invites coding trouble of some sort, I'd not blame them for an emergency patch. EQ is a complicated bunch of code, after all. It'll be interesting to see if the changes go Live correctly the first time.<br />
<br />
Kudos to SOE for taking the time to proofread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am now going to wait for the &quot;OMG cant they keep to a schedule&quot; rants to begin. I feel sorry for software companies these days. Your screwed if your late, and your screwed if you put out buggy code, and your screwed if you have a date thats too far away and your screwed if you put it out on time, with no bugs, but didnt fix EVERYTHING in the world wrong with this single patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OMG, can't they keep to a schedule?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I imagine the day and a half (and counting) outage of fv server has something to do with the delay.  Everyone is busy not fixing that problem first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They're testing before pushing live.<br />
They're keeping us informed.<br />
<br />
Glori, fess up:  You and Lenardo replaced some of the Sony folks with pod people, didn't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im with Shandy.  I dont think these are the same people that we have come to know at SOE.  I mean..look at the things they are saying now :<br />
<br />
When we update, we want to be sure that the update enhances your play experience; pushing code too quickly doesn't do that.<br />
<br />
::boggle::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I bet its all working 100% but pet shrink still does not work! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, it looks like Blazz beat you to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well that clears up my crazy rumor theory that somehow people passing the VP key around on FV were getting access to the new VP upon keying to the old one, and that they just locked it down and made up some story to stop people from doing it UNTIL the patch and VP revamp... dangit...<br />
<br />
I guess it really WAS a hampster shortage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The backend changes they're making will near certainly be the new AA system for them. Meaning AA refunds, rewriting descriptions &amp; adding new AAs will be made much easier for them (one of the reasons Berserker AA's have been delayed)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and they're nerging SoW, making it slower too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I predict a disaster!  Armageddon! O noz!!<br />
*gulp*<br />
ahhh, sweet sweet beer, you'll always be my friend</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Am I the only one that REALLY appreciated that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fuudce  fungi's are going nodrop next patch too  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's where the &quot;if&quot; comes in.  I'm as suspicious as you are that they will still screw it up somehow.<br />
<br />
Besides, I never take sucker bets.  This is SOE were talking about.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i always offer sucker bets, they are born every min.<br />
<br />
that aside, don't you all realize by now they are only making minor adjustments when we need to make a serious turn?<br />
<br />
we are hosed and not going to be fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sounds like they are finally getting the message about pushing buggy code live to soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think they're postponing to test the changes you are nuts.<br />
<br />
Their dev team just didn't finish the promised upgrades yet so they pushed them back.<br />
<br />
Test.<br />
<br />
Where do you guys come up with this stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Always been one to resurect the old 'uns :) Just like me Gangaskhan :p<br />
<br />
I'd rather have bouncing patch dates than a full day of:<br />
&lt; SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE &gt; We screwed up again, and are bringing all servers down for an emergency patch. Estimated downtime is unknown, but Rytan &amp; Brenlo will be serving free drinks in the lounge while you wait. Please form orderly queues behind the guy with the huge axe, and behind Moe Sizzlak. (no clue what Moe is doing there)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You're going to get a full day of that anyway. <br />
<br />
Just one if you are REALLY lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The test server is a joke. What exactly is tested on there? I'm sorry but the 5 devs who test on there aren't enough. So many problems with it that I wonder why they always have tons of problems when they patch stuff..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We are all going to log in after the patch on the 14th as BL's.  That will be their fix to Shaman.</div></div><hr />
