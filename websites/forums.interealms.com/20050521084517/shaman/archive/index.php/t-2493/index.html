<br />
Not seen any mention of this dropping at all.<br />
<br />
I did tonight. Shissar Mystic, on the way to Creator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol, check hell for ice?  I figured they would never fix that, or it was dropping off some single obscure mob somewhere huh?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info  :)<br />
Even though it is nothing real special it is a spell I would use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">um....any idea what mob it dropped off of? hehe named or basic mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A Shissar Mystic. as he said. /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How about a clue on the location / difficulty of getting to this mob. Is this a one-group thing? two-group? three-group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on the way to jails :)<br />
<br />
1 grp can do i think, we killed him twice today, dropped primal essence too, so wee :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Joror mentioned it to someone the other day and it was looked into, and finally fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wonder if it is his rare drop or if it is wired as a drop on the whole floor.  Nice to hear it has been found tho.<br />
<br />
Bonestorm, go find me those Ancient spells now ok?? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, snakes and golems in Ssra are casting ancient spells now, too.  Resisted Scourge of Nife or whatever.<br />
<br />
Shissar Mystic dropped Group Acumen for us today, too, spawned again in about an hour.  Seems to be a common drop + semi-rare at worst spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Too bad it's a pretty useless spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Group see invis will be useful sometimes I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Runak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Err... I had hoped this would be a little more special than group acumen, like group Celerity or the like.  Seriously...<br />
<br />
This will only be useful for dummy buffs before some fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">vision is actually a problem for many :)<br />
eqw seems to darken stuff down alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey! He was on track tonight in the temple and we couldn't find him! Is he a random spawn or does he spawn in a particular place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Around the door to HP/Creator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If so i gotta get a group/small raid and go to ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Primal Essense? Eh? Thought that was only a clicky on a few shammy items. Thats not a castable spell is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
not an ancient spell.</div></div><hr />

Bad info.  Far as I know that particular spell was only in game in form of an item click.</div></div><hr />

I just want to make sure I get the spell list updated correctly. I'm at work and don't have the SPdat in front of me. ;) <br />
<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura  - Ssraeshza Temple / Shissar Mystic -level58?<br />
Primal Essence -  Ssraeshza Temple / Shissar Mystic - level??<br />
<br />
He's a named spawn with PH? Located before the Creator , near the room with the jail/forcefields?<br />
<br />
I just follow the zergs around in Ssraeshza; is this before any of the key locked doors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No, my friend told me it wasn't behind any locked door.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course i have no proof, and this is one of those &quot;my friends cousins roomates&quot; thingys, but i know a guy who CLAIMS he looted it ancient nife somewhere in ssra.  no proof, didnt ask anyone else in his guild, which had apparently raided luclin like a mutha, but other then that, no clue.<br />
<br />
He was a cool guy though, my friend bought a JBB(for me, yay) of him :D</div></div><hr />

Bad info. Far as I know that particular spell was only in game in form of an item click.<br />
<br />
i will also add it's a right click buff of the hammer from hoshkar and my info are pretty good, thank you very much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Except that it comes from silverwing, not hoshkar.<br />
<br />
Better get new info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Primal Essence dropped tonight on Brell as well from the same mob.  It was behind the locked door on the way to Arch Lich.   Grats Ulver.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yeah, can be behind locked doors or unlocked ones. Just a matter of luck and clearing spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Cool primal essence is a scribed spell afterall.   I have the group primal essence hammer (group only and unable to cast on others outside of my group) but would be nice to have a spell version for those that like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">So it's sounding like the  Shissar Mystic is just a random spawn snake then. Not a single specific spawn in 1 location ala the Deranged Underbulk. Good news indeed.<br />
Spell list locations updated. Thanks for info guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Random? Not entirely. By saying he's only been found on the 2nd floor on the side on the way to the HP/Creator you've limited most of Ssra. Thank god I don't have to clear the Rhag2 side as well to get my guildmates copies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Anyone got maps to ssra or links to maps?  I only know the ways to Rhag1 and 2 and a couple other places in the ssra temple.  My guild has been in NToV and ignoring Luclin for the most part.  That'll happen when your guild has the great fortune to be uncontested in NToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">From entrance, furthest right door, follow along, go up, and kill anything that moves once you get up top. With luck, you hit a mystic once you go forward. If not, you need keys, luck and effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Doesnt anyone think its silly for a level 52 luclin spell to drop in Ssra? Is there something about this spell that Im missing that makes it &quot;uber&quot; .. does it stack with avatar or something heh? Or what? It seems like just a mini avatar that doesnt require a component?<br />
<br />
I mean for scribing.. seems like an awesome clicky effect.. but to scribe it it seems ridiculous to me that it drops in Ssra if its a 52nd lvl spell.. should drop in fungus grove or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">it spawned in the same spot both times we killed it i believe.<br />
<br />
i dont know excact 'cos  shm's sadly rarely pull on raids :) <br />
up the last tube towards jails, 2-3 pulls from there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">We spent like 3 weeks in there( still in there) and as far as shaman spells, we got the square root of jack dammit.=\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">this is new last patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">One useless spell, and the other is almost as useless because it's crippled with stacking issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Primal essence is a nice buff but will not stack with AGI buffs (single or group) or Avatar (I think due to AGI boost on avatar).  It will stack with STA (single or group buffs) as well as Focus line of buffs.  I have not tried it with strength or dex though since at 60 I never use those ones.   <br />
<br />
Myself, I like it for I get an extra 70 STA (RH + 20 from primal) so more hps.  Tanks like it for the extra eye candy.  <br />
<br />
I would not run this spell down for being useless though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Primal essence conflicts with avatar, but it's great for those who don't have avatar yet(yes, there are some of you out there, c'mon, fess up!) and for casters and priests who aren't going to be proc'ing primals anytime soon.  Adds 60 HP to my shaman and 80 HP to melees.<br />
<br />
The primal cudgel is also great as a way to buff your whole group when you keep getting debuffed by mobs.  I often treat it like a junk buff placed right above my gobby skull earring's grim aura, SOW boots if applicable, sometimes ultravision cast from bracer, making it buff number 3 or 4 usually.  It's one more item mobs have to work in deeper to debuff.</div></div><hr />
