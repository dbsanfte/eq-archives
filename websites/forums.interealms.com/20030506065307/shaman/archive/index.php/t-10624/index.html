<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Weeellllllllllll thanks to the nerf i am looking for 1 maybe 2 new bracers.<br />
<br />
I had been using a Serpentine Bracer, the only reason i kept it was for it's Extended Affliction II  but now it's a worthless piece of junk.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest a good bracer. I am willing to spend 1 maybe 2k on it. Or alternatively a good bracer drop that i can pick up myself (i have a lvl62 druid m8 that can help, maybe a 55 neco too) or a quest (same help applies). <br />
<br />
I was going to get a Coldain Military Wristguard, it still has good stats but my want for it has waned somewhat.<br />
<br />
Check my magelo in the Sig for the rest of my equipment....<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chains of the Accused or Barbed Rubicite are decent bracers.  MQ of Thurg bracers usually obtainable in that price range as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some nice bracers....i had been looking at the various dragonhorn bracers found in the Western Wastes<br />
<br />
AC +12 to +15<br />
WIS +8 to +12<br />
CHA +4 to +8<br />
<br />
altho the lower of them (Worked DragonHorn Bracer) is more within my price range</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't speak for your server, but Chains of the Accused are usually rediculously cheap on Fennin. 3-800pp from what I've seen.<br />
For a lower level, probably the best value I can think of.<br />
May have a required or recommended level since its PoP gear, you'll have to forgive my ignorance if it does</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Barbed Rubicite is the way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Panou Balou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agreed with Wipl, boost a bit your resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Barbed rubicite is not really the way to go for a lv43 shaman, unless he has a bag slot that absolutely needs keeping warm for the next 8 lvls.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Considering how easy the quest is, I think the Coldain wristguard still has a lot going for it. It's (from memory) got about 13AC and 5 wis ... there are very few buyable bracers with higher AC.<br />
<br />
Of course the Barbed Rubicite has HP too. Personally I wear one of each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Take whatever you can find that has the most HPs on it. Any Shaman who can Canni should be going for HPs. The Coldain Military Wristguard is nice, as is the Barbed Rubicite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">coldain bracer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4839) is way to go i think . <br />
Also consider the option of getting goblin skins and salts for eventually getting  spirit wracked chord (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12318)<br />
This may take till lvl 60 to get if u a casual player but truely an awsome item at any level<br />
<br />
Grobbles</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Coldain bracer would be fine or you can just go to the bazaar and look for any bracer with 12ac or more.  The chains of the accursed is also quite nice but may have a recomended level.<br />
<br />
I would not spend any kind of big cash on a bracer untill after you get your JBB.<br />
<br />
Also I would ignore what that Prophet Chikarsis said about HP.  At his level hp is king but the air must be getting a little thin because at your level or  pre Can V and mobs with very high attack ratings in PoP... lots of AC give you very nice damage mitigation.  You will be much better served with picking equipment that has good ac on it for now.</div></div><hr />
