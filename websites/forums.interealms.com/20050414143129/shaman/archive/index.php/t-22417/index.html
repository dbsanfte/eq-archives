<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently went from Dial-up to a shared DSL connection (via a router).  The router is made by Net-Gear and there is only one other computer on-line besides mine.<br />
<br />
Since then I have had the following two problems with EQ: Periodically, and at random, I will lock up when zoning. Also, I will just stop loading. (Usually after the Character selection screen).  CNTL-ALT-DEL will allow me to close the EQ connection, but my computer remains frozen. I have to completely turn it off and back on again.<br />
<br />
During these times there is no information coming from the router. I have connectivity, but no action. (Hmm sounds like my...never mind)<br />
<br />
I scan disk and defrag regularly. I also run Window Washer and Spy Sweeper as well as Trend Micro's on-line scan.  None of the aforementioned three show any viruses.<br />
<br />
This leads me to believe it's a hardware problem relating to the router, but the infrequent and at random and theh combined stopping of my HD during loading has me thrown for a loop.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my in-expert opinion it sounds like your router is blocking some of the ports when you zone. If I remember correctly you can change from port to port when you zone, but I'm still not sure why this would lock up your PC rather than make you go LD.<br />
<br />
Have you turned off the routers firewall? or made your pc the one that's using the DMZ.<br />
<br />
There was a lot of problems with Net-Gear routers a while back. I can't find the post atm, but if you search the EQ tech forums for Net Gear you should find them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It may well have nothing at all to do with your router. A large number of people on the eqlive tech forum have been complaining about system lockups when zoning and loging on. A related isue seems to be numerous graphics problems like white landscapes and distorted skins. These problems are cleanly across all system types and video cards (ATI and n Vidia) top end and low end alike.  As clear as I can tell they messed something up fairly bad in the last set of patches with video memory and are using up the entire amount of available memory to the video card (even the 256 megers) and causing the system to lock. You might try connecting with good old dial-up to see if the problem persists for you before ya go crazy diagnosing the router. If the problem persists on dial-up I'd recomend heading over to the EQ Live Tech Forum and see if there is any recomendations there that may help.  Good luck and let us know how it turns out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Leez-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is it a Linksys router by any chance? I had heard many horror stories about folks having trouble with these. Check SOE's tech support for the fix. I use a SMC router and have had not a single problem with it. In fact I think it was a port issue, Im not sure what covered in SOE's fix, but at the very least I'd try updating the firmware for the router to the most current version.</div></div><hr />

I'd almost bet it's a router problem. A quick search of the tech support forums at eqlive.station.sony.com pulls up 8 pages of posts relating to problems with Netgear routers. Hope you get it straightened out Faern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Check out which ports you have blocked on your router, too.<br />
<br />
http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n100495.asp gives a list of common applications (including EQ) and what ports they need open.</div></div><hr />
