<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few months ago I was having problems lagging in LDON's - especially when I had multiple MOBs and text flying about my screen.  The then solution was to turn off the Journal.<br />
<br />
My question now is, does the text that writes to your Journal also write to your HDD and if so what is the file name?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I think it throws everything into the &quot;userdata&quot; folder in your EQ directory. I'd check in there first.</div></div><hr />
