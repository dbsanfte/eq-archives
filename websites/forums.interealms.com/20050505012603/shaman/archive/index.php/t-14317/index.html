<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I'm 52 and I have all the parts for my Blood of Nadox quest spell except the gunthak water.  So, I begrudgingly head towards the fort/town in guthank to start ripping up the greenies and occassional light blues for the rare drop.  Get my pet, alpha him with shivs, haste, you know the drill . . . and proceed to reak havoc as I walk around the fort.  First guy drops a flawless aquamarine.  Few mobs later I get a star ruby.  Few guys later a black pearl, mirthril amulet, gunthak type weapons (3pp a pop or so), about 4pp cash per kill, etc. etc. etc.  After about an hour, maybe a bit longer, I finally get the gunthak water drop, Woot!  Head to get my new spell and sell off.  Hmmmm, where did all these gems come from?  Made about 400+ plat in an hour or so and didn't even realize it.  So, if you are 40ish and need some cash, and xp at that level, this would be a great spot for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are one lucky SOB!  I huned my rump off there and never saw anywhere near that kind of cash that fast.  <br />
<br />
I've seen those things drop, but never in that time frame.<br />
<br />
Congrats on your score!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Headed there the other night (lvl 47), put the hard on and went to work. With KEI and virtue, spent about an hour killing everything, and walked away with about 500pp worth of loot. Not a bad days work!<br />
<br />
Would have been a lot better if I had actually gotten the flask, but I am MORE than happy to go back there and make some more cash!</div></div><hr />
