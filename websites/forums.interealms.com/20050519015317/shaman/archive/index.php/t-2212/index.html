<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to ask before I go goofing anything up...Is the Banker in Halas on Rogue faction? Can I lose my ability to bank with him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes and Yes.<br />
<br />
If you're KOS to the banker, don't turn your back to him, he's a rogue mob and backstabs pretty hard I think.<br />
<br />
I'm dubious to Halas rogues, the old Langseax of the Wolves quest lowers Halas rogue faction every step of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They fixed that a long while back. He's no longer on Rogue faction and the quests in halas no longer lower your factions with the rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fun wid bankers *giggle*<br />
<br />
Da one Gerka like is da girly banker in HHK...  she hates me and is very kind of wimpy.  Every time mez go bank in HHK she pound her puny little fists on mez big Ogre chest.  All da local population stands around and gigles as mez make comments about bad customer service and such.  When done mez just root her den run to zone.   Mez not want to get her stuck somwhere so dat the people dat need her can't find her.<br />
<br />
Mez get a big LoL when a druid asked mez if I needad an evack. LoL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Halas banker's still dubious to me, as are the rest of the Rogues.  Everybody else is ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SO Njorls? Cappi? Who's correct here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Still dubious to the banker as well all the Rogues of the White Roses.<br />
<br />
The banker is still a rogue (as all bankers :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, I was down in Runnyeye helping a lowbie friend get a Blackened Alloy Medallion, and the banker aggroed on my friend.  I rooted him, so he aggroed on me.  I then right-clicked him and proceeded to change my money and put a few items in the bank while he pounded on me.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, nobody else was in Runnyeye, so I just killed him when I was done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I remeber a change to stop people being KOS to the banker in Halas. I think it was to change it so that certain quests no longer decreased your faction with the rogues. Lanseax may have been one of them<br />
