<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ApemanShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you ask me, all this talk about balancing slows and our healing abilities is bull****. <br />
<br />
Why ?<br />
<br />
I don't know what server you guys are playing on, but anyone not realizing its getting harder and harder to make groups. Always the problem of looking for a Main healer, and most people too scared to fight unless they have a cleric or enchanter in the group. <br />
<br />
So what if they make shaman a better healer and with our slows, this way groups can be built faster and spend more time fighting than waiting for a group or assembling a group. <br />
<br />
At the moment I can take 5 melee and run through a DON mission (its a little tough) , if I have a cleric/Druid or enchanter its a bonus. <br />
<br />
People love me for doing this and I get myself and others exping and upgrading gear through DON points. AND JUST HAVE FUN!<br />
<br />
I say give shamans and the druids the better heals, so we can play instead of coming online and waiting 1 hour for a dam group. <br />
<br />
In short, giving shamans and druids the better healing abilities will open up more opportunities to build groups and hunt in places where most people wont dare without a cleric. We need the  healing power due to population decreases on servers.  <br />
