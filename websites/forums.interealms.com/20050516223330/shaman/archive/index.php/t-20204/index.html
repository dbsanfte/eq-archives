<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sonechka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I searched the forums for questions relating to Naggy raids and got some answers and ideas, but most were directed at more specific questions (ie:group only idea for Nag, duo, etc). My question is less specific, i guess.<br />
<br />
Tonight is my first raid. On Naggy. I &quot;grew up&quot; mainly doing LDoN's and recently, grouping in PoJ. I've been told i'm good to have around in a group and handle my job well in such occasions. I have a pretty good reputation on the LDoN side. (I'm not bragging here, just trying to give more of an idea how i work in such situations).<br />
<br />
Anyway, my question, as one of the higher level shammys in my guild (the only higher one is a 52), what would you recommend, in general. Which spells should i have in my list, what role should i play, how do i play such a role? <br />
<br />
I've been playing EQ for a grand total of 4 months and raids and raid type situations are completely new to me. Tho i have been reading everything i can get my browser on, i'd still like to hear it myself from the mouths of my elders.<br />
<br />
Yeah, so, any help, suggestions, thwaps on the head of &quot;get a life n00b&quot; are apreciated. I'd really like to be the best i can, and what's better than getting it from the people that know best.<br />
<br />
thank you, ahead of time...</div></div><hr />

Before even entering the zone you will want a set of resist gear. I seem to remember 80 fire and magic resist being sufficient, but more cannot hurt. Try to not loose too much mana and HPs for your resist gear but freely sacrifice AC.<br />
If you are the elchemy take also make resist potions, if only for yourself. <br />
<br />
Assuming you do not have any higher level player along to buff you . . you will be doing a lot of buffing. On the bright side the fire giants repop very slow, so after clearing them you got ages to buff.<br />
<br />
Make sure everyone has a set of crap buffs before you start. The part you will be doing is Harnessing of Spirit, Stamina and possibly Agility on the main tank(s). If you do not have a druid/enchanter along you might also need to buff resists (magic and fire). If you have the buff slots (and mana and time) regeneration buffs might also help.<br />
<br />
The buffing will need to be organized and fast, or your buffs will begin to wear off right as you charge Naggy.<br />
<br />
During the fight you will probably be healing unless you have a large amount of clerics, in which case you will be nuking. Do not rely on Stoicism as your heal because Naggy might just dispell it. That means chloroblast, possibly stoicism on yourself if you can protect it with a click buff item.<br />
<br />
You do not have any debuffs that will land on Nagafen so do not even try. Just heal your group. If you have any mana (and time) left over try to check the health of out of group people, clerics first, then the damage classes, and throw them heals if they need it.<br />
<br />
Pay attention to your heal channel so as not to overheal the same person.<br />
<br />
Oh, and heal the people who are standing still, not the ones who are running away. Odds are they will do more running then damage, no need to waste your mana on them if you can heal someone who contributes.<br />
<br />
That is all I can think of for now.</div></div><hr />

LMAO!!! I went on one Naggy raid, and that is exactly what they did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before the raid, purchase a clicky buff item (telescope is 100-200pp, made by tinkers, and works fine but doesn't last long; better still is something like shrunken goblin earring but this is pricey). Also buy some resist gear, search the bazaar and sort by FR/MR and see what you can find cheaply. Velium blue diamond kit made by jewellers is decent.<br />
<br />
Your real role on the raid day is buffing people before they move in. You'll want to coordinate with the other shaman there, I'd suggest by splitting up the buffs rather than the groups. You'll quite likely have to cast some &quot;crap&quot; buffs too, which will get hit by the dispell early on. These act as a sacrifice, protecting more important buffs like HoS, Symbol and Clarity. Setup a channel for the shaman and arrange who will buff what, then check with group leaders that they are ready (i.e. buff slots cleared, or crap buffs in place etc) and buff a group at a time.<br />
<br />
Due to the AE, the most important thing on a naggy raid is hp and resists. Anything that gives hp or resists should be near the back of the buff order, things like agility are less important and should be one of the first buffs (if used at all).<br />
<br />
Once you move in, forget about casting stuff on Naggy - you won't land slow or cripple, and your dps is not good enough to make a difference. Your job once the fighting starts is to help keep your group alive. If your group is doing fine, keep an eye on the health of clerics and bards, in that order. If you're still not finding anyone to heal, patch heal the main tank.<br />
<br />
Oh, search is good too :) <br />
