<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other night I was in a group in PoV...I noticed for the first time my Spear of Torment spell was hitting for anything from 635 to 770+, I dont recall seeing this happen before.<br />
<br />
I dont think I had any special buffs, and I am un-aware of any that increase damage (I dont play a lot these days)<br />
<br />
The only thing different about me that night was I was wearing Zlandicars Talisman (which I had never done before) I have now handed in the talisman for a key.<br />
<br />
Then last night I was doing my first venture into ST and noticed my dd was back to nomal...nothing any higher that 635.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what was happening?</div></div><hr />

It's stacking haste for melees and DD spell focus for casters, stacks with mage bracer too.  whee, it's an awesome song.</div></div><hr />
