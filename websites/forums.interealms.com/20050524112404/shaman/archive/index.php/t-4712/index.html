<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hobo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm considering buying my friend's 51 shammy account from him.  He was reassigned overseas and doesn't play anymore.  We've duo'd *forever* (my 52 monk and his shammy) and had a blast doing it.  He needs the money and I hate to lose my partner so I'm thinking of taking up the 2-box craze and using the shammy to duo with me.  <br />
<br />
Rather than just jumping right into the fire I thought I'd ask for a little advice here.  My friend's given me some of the basic info but I'd like some advice on where to go to read and learn a bit more.  I'd also appreciate any info and advice you guys might share.  Keep in mind he isn't my main and probably never will be (unless I ever grow tired of my monk).  He won't be soloing unless I just want to goof on occasion, so I mostly want to learn the basics of slowing, buffing and keeping two toons alive at the same time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First how close are your two computers together? Mine are on the same desk but Ive known people who have them in seprate rooms, jump on one to throw a few heals, basicly just PL'ing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, considering both keyboards are side by side here is what ya do.<br />
<br />
Go pull with your monk, singles are nice because with haveing to root adds it gets downright annoying. <br />
<br />
As soon as you get back to your pull spot turn on auto attack with your monk, switch over to the shaman.  Hit pet attack, cast a slow, switch back to your monk and try and pay attention to see if you see &quot;A mob Yawns&quot; if you dont see this message you it didnt stick and you will probibly have to re-cast, if  you got the mana cast a dot also. <br />
<br />
Switch back to your monk and start melleing. When the mob gets to about 60% (This is just me you might be able to do this sooner/later) reach over and sit, trying not to have your shaman get agro here.<br />
<br />
Keep melleing with your monk (Those kicks add up)  ocasinoly reaching over and hitting your cana dance key, (/stand, cast canabalize, /pause whenever, /sit)<br />
<br />
I suggest you make hotkeys for refreshing a few important buffs on your monk. Haste fading, reach over and hit whatever hotkey you have so he will stand cast and sit. Also I find its usefull to still have a group message so you know if you hit the wrong key. So if you hit the button to cast haste and see &quot;Attemting to slow, you&quot; you will know you screwed up and hopefully can inturupt him.<br />
<br />
Thats about it, buffs I suggest you keep hotkeyed so you can hit it and the shaman will stand cast and sit. Regen, slow, heal, haste, SoW, and Canabalize. <br />
<br />
An assist key is a must also. Basicly all the targeting keys your shaman will need is F1 and F2 with Assist. <br />
<br />
Don't know if this will help but my hotkeys are this.<br />
<br />
Assist<br />
Pet attack<br />
Slow message and cast the spell<br />
Sit/Stand<br />
Canabalize Sit/Stand<br />
Regen<br />
Haste<br />
SoW<br />
Heal<br />
Spell book (My shaman dosent use the new UI cause I keep him on the crappier of the computers, I guess you could save a few hotkeys if you did have it on)<br />
<br />
All of my heals and buffs are set up to be:<br />
/stand -  /cast # -  /message -  /pause -  /sit<br />
<br />
I keep these spells memmed and it is a rarity I need to cycle one out in a duoing situation.<br />
<br />
HoS<br />
Dot<br />
Haste<br />
Regen<br />
Slow<br />
Heal<br />
SoW<br />
Cana<br />
<br />
The rare instance is when I ditch HoS for root.<br />
<br />
If in a dungeon type type zone switch SoW for gate, very usefull, train inc to your position? Gate, FD!</div></div><hr />
