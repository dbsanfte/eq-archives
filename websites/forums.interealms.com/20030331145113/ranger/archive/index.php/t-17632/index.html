<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to solo the captain for belevolen quest with eq and am3 along with a twisted longbow and trueshot disc up and the eagle eye spell? I heard he has like 100k hp but not sure if it is true or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He would most likely summon you so you couldn't kite him around.  There is also not a lot of room to run him around in without risking adds.<br />
<br />
He can be taken down with less than a full group though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You would get owned fast.<br />
<br />
Get  a chanter(just for haste) a rogue and a cleric and go nuts.<br />
<br />
Yeldema is probably the top summoning mob I could ever see a ranger soloing...Captain has a lot more hps and hits a lot harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree, virtually no chance of you soloing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laliana Tucckerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah, try it anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try what? <br />
<br />
You want to kite him around? He will summon you and you are paste.<br />
<br />
You want to tank him and use /disc at the same time? Is his melee radius large enough that you can do it? Anyway, I don't think you can kill him fast enough, he is too mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A ranger can tank him well enough.  He only hits ~250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive tanked him before. But yes, he does summon and its a semi-long fight, so youll need a good mucho-mana cleric or an  average cleric and a backup healer like a druid or shaman. Then just go DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nightork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You couldnt bow kite him, but I have seen him soloed, very clever use of the mobs in WW, didnt see exactly how this druid did it, but they did, I was half annoyed because I was trying to get benev item for a friend and half impressed at the way it was done.<br />
<br />
I think the druid deliberately agroed a named dragon, getting the captain caught in the aoe so they agroed eachother and just finished off the captain when he was done with the dragon, no idea which dragon, and when questioned the druid said it was a specific one, but didnt say which :(<br />
<br />
-hol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't know if it still works or not, but there is an exploit charming classes can use to solo Bene.  As for simply aggroing a dragon to catch the captain in AE...I don't think that precise strategy would work, but AI and killrights in EQ are a dark and mysterious thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A ranger can tank him well enough. He only hits ~250 <br />
<br />
I said tank him and use archery at the same time, as in an attept to solo him this way, like other rangers have done with dragons before. <br />
<br />
I didn't say rangers can't tank him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Giants are not big enough to do this....only wurms/dragons/etc.<br />
<br />
If he was slowable you might have a chance(still probably wouldn't this guy has a TON of hps....way more than the wimpy dragons in this zone) but I've never seen a shammy slow him without disease slow.<br />
<br />
The most uber ranger in EQ with full raid buffs would not be able to solo him so stop even entertaining the idea.  An unslowable summoning mob that hits for almost 300 and has 70-80k hps is NOT getting solo'd by ANY non-charm class(maybe a necro I guess....one solo'd Lodi recently /boggle).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chromite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Giants are indeed big enough to shoot with bows while toe to toe.  I used to solo Lieutenants in Kael this way after Earthcaller procced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll have to check that but I've certainly never had any luck with it.  I haven't tried with anything more than plaza mobs, GD/WL/EW giants etc...maybe mobs outside of arena/KT area have smaller models/target areas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only Dragons I’ve seen solo’d by Rangers were slowed first via Earthcaller and then Shot down.  The Captain is not slowable by a Ranger so that option is out.  He also has quite a bit more HPs then Yeldema so you’d have to live much longer against an unslowed mob that, as I recall, hit’s harder then the Dragon in the first place and doesn’t take time out to cast spells.<br />
<br />
Besides, soloing a mob to say you solo’d him is fun, but I assume you are trying to actually complete the BoB quest?  Why take such a huge risk in failing your quest when you can take him with just a few friends there to help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you had Sean's gear (5500+ hp unbuffed, 240 innate raw atk), and Kraiven/Celt's AA (read: everything maxed), a Dark Cloak of Sky, and a +25% or +30% Improved Healing Item (the later of which has not been found yet), then you might have a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">IMHO, even the most uber ranger wouldnt be able to solo the general. He just has too many HP.</div></div><hr />
