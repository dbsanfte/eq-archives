<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever since Ldon has came out I've been haveing trouble with my dog.<br />
<br />
As soon as I target a mob my dog takes off after it, hes screwing up pulls and killing him self. Last night in PoV it was killing me.<br />
<br />
If I target someone in the group for buffs, I will get 4 or 5 messages in a row, saying &quot;sorry master this is not a legal target&quot;. <br />
<br />
Is there some kind of auto attack setting for pets?<br />
<br />
I've tried clicking guard, sit, follow and it makes no difference, select a target and dog wants go attack.<br />
<br />
Does my dog need obedience school or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd probably guess you've got a /pet attack hotkey that is overlapped on another key is my guess. If not then /pet scram until a GM can feex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sounds quite bizarre, and the only explanation I can come up with is that you could have a hardware problem with your keyboard. If you have a pet attack hotkey, and the keyboard thinks you're pressing that key. The key could be sticking, or some kind of short in the keyboard, maybe? <br />
<br />
It seems unlikely that this'd be going on, and you wouldn't notice problems otherwise. But I can't think of anything else offhand that could possibly cause it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm thinking that you have a hotkey defined that includes /pet attack in it somewhere.  Switch to an empty hotkey page and see you you still get the message when you target people.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  This most often happens when you bind a hotkey to a keyboard key (like sense heading training for example).  There was one time where I kept using Canni5 every time I turned right.  It was actually sort of convenient, so I left it that way for a few hours since the group wasnt moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Leebae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">junkilo where did you get the phrase /pet scram from?</div></div><hr />

Each time you are seeing this message, &quot;sorry master this is not a legal target&quot;, there has been a /pet attack command issued without a valid target.  You should get a, &quot;Attacking a rat master&quot;, after your pet has been told to attack a valid target.  Its just the invalid Target message tends to be more noticeable.  Now the question is why is this command being issued when your not attually wanting it to be.  <br />
<br />
Questions to ask yourself.<br />
<br />
1.  Does it happen to any selected target.<br />
2.  Does it only happen with one group member or all of them.<br />
3.  Does it happen as soon as you target a NPC/Group member.<br />
4.  Does it happen at some point after target a NPC/Group member.<br />
     (Example: Target mob [nothing] then start to cast/move pet attacts.)<br />
5.  What keys have you pressed up to 6 sec prior to you recieving the pet attack/unable to attack messages.<br />
6.  Are you using any macros for target selection / announcements.<br />
7.  Have you linked your left mouse button in windows to any keyboard keys? or have any windows accessibility options enabled?<br />
<br />
Macros have a max run time of like a min or so I forget the exact time.  Would be best to test this in a zone full green mobs with no GUARDS/HIGH Level NPCs near so you can detirmin exactly what is going on.  Then do some tests and see if you can answer those questions.  If its just happening with group members you might want to see if you can get a friend or two to join you for 10 mins or so.<br />
<br />
One thing to note pets can be given commands from normal conversaion if you happen to speak the key words in range of them.  So if you say, &quot;Joe, have you ever had your pet get lost in this zone before?&quot;.  Your wonderfull little pet is going for a nice dirt nap (You just told it to get lost).  <br />
<br />
Most likely though you have a couple of comands sharing a common key.  You'll mainly just need to watch and see exactly when your pet is acting up and figure out what key is causing him to attack.  I personally have a Hotbutton with assit and then pet attack on it.  I put a 3-4 second delay from the time I do the assist and the time my pet attacks so that I have time to then spam a pet back off hotbutton if I dont wish for my pet to attually attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My gess would be that your keyboard is messed up and what every button you have /pet attack on is stuck and doing an auto fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What the above posters said.<br />
<br />
Since LDoN (or a bit before?) SoE also messed around with the short key settings. So it's certainly a good idea to check your short key settings in the option menu for conflicts as well as your hotkey banks.<br />
<br />
Maybe drop some of the old ones, recreate or rearrange them would help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't had this problem myself.  Instead I've had the problem of not always being able to shrink my pet.</div></div><hr />
