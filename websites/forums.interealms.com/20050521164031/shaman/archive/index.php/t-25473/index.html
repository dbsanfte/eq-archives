<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kreft78</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
<br />
I go to Rs about once a week and everytime i go i always go to the statue up top cause its the easiest and only camp i know. I always go with people that dont know where to camp.<br />
<br />
So i would like some information about some other camps and there loots i would like to explore the zone to get some other loots besides the 90 hp aug and the 70 mana 70 end one.<br />
<br />
thanx</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On the way to the statue camp we passed a group fiighting at the first junction past the steps upstairs. They fought here to keep an eye out on wanderers.<br />
My map has a room with 'Taromani' marked a named pops in here<br />
Companion Prefect (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16602) drops plate BP<br />
Room directly west of here is <br />
Ruiner Isaka (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16708)<br />
Between these two rooms is turning south that opens up into a large room with this mob in<br />
Channeler Pyren  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16702) <br />
From this corridor head back to main corridor and head north as on way to statue camp take first turning North East the one before the named chimera, raid encounter, and you will end up in a large circular room.<br />
In here spawns<br />
Elite Aneuk Miseryfiend (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16862) drops chain BP<br />
Go back to main corridor past the named chimera room and take first turn north you will come to a fork north west opens into one the large circular rooms which has two named<br />
Pyrilen Riftseeker  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16763) and<br />
Balancer Relik (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16535)<br />
head south out of this room, the way you came, and take the other fork and in this room is<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it is to bad that most of the trash named drops are junk, outside of augs, for most of the people geared well enough to be frequenting this zone =/<br />
<br />
i haven't XPed as much on the ice side.  haven't seen any named pop there when i did, but i like the look of the zone better over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RS makes my eyes bleed, too bright (it looks nice, but perhaps tone it down a little).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well most of most of my buddies and I think the named drops in here are great upgrades but as we are not a raiding guild and this zone is a bloody good challenge for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ice side never really gets camped by groups because the MoBs there Mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">RS makes my eyes bleed, too bright (it looks nice, but perhaps tone it down a little).<br />
<br />
i had to adjust my gamma when i zoned in. it was like stairing at the sun for to long lol!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ice side is better exp , too, I've found, if your group is cool w/ killing em</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've done Queenie camp (top floor, south) (got my face there) and RS camp (top floor, northwest corner). I understand that the top of the stairs is a good place to pull too also, no pathing mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First time i went into RS was this past sundy just after i dinged 69.  I should have realized that  when I was lagging at the crystal looking thingy in MPG wher we needed to click onto it to get in that I was gonna have majpr lagg issues.  Solved the lagg issue when I got in ther after taking what seemed like forever by turning off teh pixel optionsin the advanceed part of the display  part of teh  ALT+O thingy.  The rest of course I kept seeing as that brought me back to normal.<br />
<br />
I've been there like 1 time since and am now looking forward to seeng what teh xp will be like now that I dinged last night  (in WoS of all places)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think I can safely say the exp will be insane compared to where you've been hunting :)  Be sure to hit up the appropriate named for a BP, you could really use the FT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the best part of RS is grinding all night so everyone gets at least 1 aug and 1 spell. then being so tired you give your glowing rune to the pet instead of Karsor the Mad!!!<br />
yes, halyburton is desparatly in need of the FT from that BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ouch on those glowing runes to pet.<br />
Personally, i would like RS a lot more if I did not seem to lag more than average there.<br />
Missing a slow there can be painful on a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If your tank is vulnerable to those mobs, like he's going to be ganked by 2-3 unslowed rounds, then have your snarer kite the mob until it's slowed.  'member, mobs don't summon until they're damaged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">GM gave my &quot;friend&quot; who gave the rune to his pet his rune back...<br />
<br />
btw, i have found king camp to be the best source of, at least, greater runes. xp there is suck comparied to the stairs or RS camp, the drops suck (ft3aug of rot,) but the runes are nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dude, ft3 aug of doggie chew toy.  Might keep his paws out of the spell runes.  Man OH man, my puppy must be up to ft33 by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hahah, at one point we had 4 of them rotting around us!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">and to think what people pay for boots of flowing slime....tsk tsk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got lucky last night  well night before last a fraind of mine who had urged me to gt to lvl 69  sent me a tell while I was LFG inthe Guild hall and  told me to get my arse over to  RS cuase there was a present forme waiting  at teh stairs =) check out my  gear now =)<br />
<br />
Now if only I could have that kind of luck geting the rest of my 66 and all of my 69/70 runes I'll almost be a happy camper =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yay grats you man! you should really hang out with a group at the king camp while you lfg...those ft 3 augs rot rot rot. i am sure they will let you loot one and named are fairly common! like i said, whenever i group down there there is ALWAYS at least 1 ft aug rotting on the ground lol... <br />
could also farm tipt augs with a guild group and pick up a Bauble of Rejuvenation for +2 mana/hp regen.<br />
<br />
those augs alone would push your overall FT up to 9.<br />
<br />
you can solo for you 66 spells slacker =p<br />
<br />
edit- Veil of Frozen Flame, http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31741<br />
drops random off RS mobs. i have seen a few drops and actually had 1 rot the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">OKies managed to get the last of my lvl 66 spells I think like 3 or 4 days ago.  I also managed ot get a new FT hat during a guild raid to one of the BoT Towers last night bringinmy FT items up to +6 and mc3(which I forget how much mana I get back).  I'll check out hanging out at teh King Camp if  I can find it without gettingmy arse beat down to it lol<br />
<br />
As for Tipt i actually do need ot finish my personal quest to get atht FT item.  Kinda let that go to teh back burner for for some reason and dotn know why =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tattered Cloak of the Fallen?  Also, there's the chain pants with ft2 from MPG.  The named for that is at the top of the vee by Projection of Body.<br />
<br />
btw, you need Spell Casting Mastery 3~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There is also a +2 FT aug from a low level version of the DS watering hole expedition...get someone level 58-62 to initiate it and go solo the named (Yellowfang).  45 mins of work tops.</div></div><hr />
