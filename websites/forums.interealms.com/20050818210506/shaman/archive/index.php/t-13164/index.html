<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mazuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the new server coming out soon, I figured I would go there and 2 box a Shaman and Warrior.  I'm not trying to be one of the first people to get a high level, join uberguild, etc. but I also don't want to take too long getting up in the levels, as I already have a 51 druid and 60 rogue (so I don't need to go through the whole boring newbie experience again).<br />
<br />
I have some experience two boxing, about 5 levels (22-27) with a shaman and a mage, and occasionally plvling myself with a druid.  My question, especially to any people who have two boxed from the start, is when is the earliest I should start grouping my chars together and fighting.  The early levels (1-24) go by very fast with Paludal now, and low levels are a lot slower two boxing since the fights are so short I wouldn't have time to really get both chars auto attacking the mob and such.<br />
<br />
So any suggestions on when to begin grouping the two would be helpful, was thinking froggy shammy and nome warrior (if that matters at all, with PoK books making it so easy to travel).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Warriors arent that great for two boxing as their main advantage is having more hps than other mellee, generally way more hp than you would need in a 2 boxable situation. For this reason rangers, paladins, and sks make very good mellee 2 boxing partners (with rangers and pallies &gt; sks cause they can heal/buff). BTW, I have yet to see a high lvl gnome paladin, whereas I have seen MANY high lvl gnome warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mazuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a few reasons why I want warrior.<br />
<br />
No spells.  Makes it a lot cheaper since it's a new server and I already have to pay for the shaman.<br />
<br />
If a Shaman can solo fine, the warrior will only help.  Sure it won't be as much dps, but someone who can take the hits longer would be easier for me to deal with.<br />
<br />
Plus I think that the warrior epic is the coolest looking epic and hope to eventually get it.  Pally and Ranger epics are ugly.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think I'll be changing the classes (maybe races, but I really want to make a frog shaman).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warrios are not cheap :)<br />
<br />
I was thinking about that as well... I was thinking about maybee opening my accounts and two boxing a frog couple on the new server and harass trolls.  Prolly would go Shaman, Palli if I did frog because shaman are more hybrid friendly when 2boxing.  Otherwise I would prolly go iksar monk|SK/Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mazuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Warrios are not cheap :)<br />
How so?  Early on all I have to do is worry about a couple good weapons (probably a couple swords and a two hander) and then enough armor to keep me from dying (note that slow will be on mobs).  Once I get higher I can farm stuff or join a guild and get better stuff.  I understand that the higher end items are really expensive but I'm more worried about the low end game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand a class with better dps, like a hybrid, may work better, but money is a factor and you have to consider that maybe I don't want to play one. :)<br />
<br />
I'm trying to stay non evil so no SKs.  Would a monk work better?  With the monk nerfs I've been hearing about (but not have read about since I don't play a monk) I've not really wanted to be a monk.  That and everyone and their mother plays a monk (but they all play warrior too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its just that warrior gear tends to be more expensive relative to the same type gear for the hybrids.  Never really understood why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excatly... if you can make it without having to buy something for your warrior more power too ya...but there is always that item that would add dps or agro that would make you much more efficient but cant farm or guild doesnt raid there or something of the sort... Cobalt for instance... that armor was still at least 2x as much as other classes Kunark armors when I stopped playing and was working on my warrior.  Why? well because they dont have spells to buy is my wager.  Pure equipment is what gives them thier efficiency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I two-box a monk and a shaman.  I have a 32 warrior I could level up instead, but there's no need.  A monk/shaman pair is pretty unbelievable.  <br />
<br />
2-boxing is really all about DPS in my opinion.  Tearing down mobs ASAP is best for XP and, starting in the 30s, monks have much better DPS than warriors of the same level.  Warriors have better AC on the whole, but with a shaman slowing, it's really not an issue.  I can get my monk to about 1k AC with buffs and mostly reinforced acrylia.<br />
<br />
The other reason I prefer having a monk is for splitting spawns.  It's pretty easy to break into an area with a group of 2 if you can tag-pull, instead of bringing back 3 or 4 mobs and trying to CC them.  That and mend/FD can save a lot of grief (and deaths) if you get into trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Melees will lag pretty far behind casters for some time on the new server, because they are so much more gear-dependent.  That mid-20's warrior wearing a hodgepodge of banded and rawhide isn't going to tank as well as most pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except monk, because when all else fails, they have their fists.  Plus with a shaman I won't have to worry about weighing down my monk with money, or staying poor.  Shammy can hold it all.<br />
<br />
If I go monk, I'll obviously go human.  I'm not gonna pick any slow exp races since Frogs are a normal exp gain so I'd rather not have 1 char lag behind, even if it is minor (exp penalty still affects the AA I'm told).  So, Qeynos or Freeport?  And going back to my first question, when should I start?  I was thinking around level 5 when the fights begin to create some downtime (for human monk anyways).<br />
<br />
Perhaps I will go monk, dunno if the new server will have many good monks.  Though I've never really played one, I bet I could learn to get good at FD pulling / splitting.  On my server (fennin ro), I never really get to see many good pullers.  But this is just based on tier 1 pop exp groups.  Yeah lvl 60 rogue guildless and no flags, I suck. :P<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: About the melees getting behind.  Remember, mages can summon weapons and armor.  Expect to see a lot of mages selling that stuff early on and making some pretty fine money.  Also expect to see the newbie areas for those lvl 5-10 armor + weapon quests filled.  I'm gonna outright skip them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think exp flattens out a bit after maybe 10ish and fights might last long enough to get both involved.     <br />
    <br />
    Thinking about it with pok books and if you can get to Sharval can go to pal caverns like lvl 5-9 or so from one zoneline and keep em grouped since exp goes so fast there. I two boxed before that place but did single play in there later on and went from hollowshade side (might have it mixed up ) zoned into pal and made killer exp right by the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly the way to go.  Shammy carries all the loot and all the extra weapons for the monk.  Plus at low levels, monks really don't need much equipment.  Just fix yourself up with some cloth or patchwork armor and go to work.  I'd use your fists or maybe a fist and a cracked staff to get started.<br />
<br />
So, Qeynos or Freeport?<br />
<br />
Qeynos.  Can be a barbarian shaman, my personal preference.  Also, at level 6 or so can hit the Aqueducts (zone in by the bank) and kill the froggies for netted armor.  Similar to cloth with one big exception: it's magic, meaning the gloves will let you hit magical creatures, like, say, willowisps. :cool: You can do the same thing with a FP monk in Upper Guk, but you need to be higher level, probably 10-12.  Plus I think Blackburrow is one of the best dungeons in the game.  <br />
<br />
 Though I've never really played one, I bet I could learn to get good at FD pulling / splitting.<br />
<br />
you'll pick it up fast, plus you'll learn so much about aggro, it'll make your head hurt.  all in all, monks are a fun class to play and perfectly complement a shaman.  (hence the creation of the beastlord class)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Except monk, because when all else fails, they have their fists.<br />
<br />
Well... I did the whole &quot;Almost naked Monk soloing with their fists and a Survival Staff until level 22&quot; thing back in late 2000 when I created Scalia, my first melee character. No twinking since I wanted to get a feel for the class. It was certainly doable and it will be vastly easier with a Shaman for backup, although Human Monks have no scales and are thefore weak and worthless, even if I say so myself :) :)<br />
<br />
But jokes aside, these days Monks are quite dependent on their equipment. Perhaps not as much as Warriors, but at higher levels it is very very noticeable. Last time we wiped on Vindi and had a messy CR, I was helping with the &quot;see invisible&quot; Giants before the Arena area and was quite shoked by my pitiful DPS. With Shamanic slows and haste, you will probably be OK, but only if you adjust your expectations accordingly.<br />
<br />
If you want to run a melee/shaman duo to 60 quickly and without having to rely on equipment too much, you may want to consider a Beastlord. They tank at least as well as Monks and their DPS comes mostly from the pet which, like all of their pre-61 spells, is store-bought - very important on a new server - which makes you relatively equipment independent. Having to control two pets in tight quarters may be a bit too much, though.<br />
<br />
Also, consider what kind of levelling path you have in mind. A Shaman/Monk duo can do dungeons in relative safety as long as the Monk knows how to FD split casters using corners. Almost any other combination needs to be either overpowered for the dungeon or hunt near the zone line or have some other means of CC/escape for the melee. I suppose the Thurgadin gate potion may work as long as you can Root all mobs with your Shamans and get out of the casters' line of sight, but the casting time is 10 seconds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mazuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm definitely going Froggy Shaman, no questions about it.  I guess I'll give monk a try, prolly a qeynos one.  I like their newbie area better, and qeynos hills is one of my fav zones in game.<br />
<br />
I dunno if I should do paludal though.  It's gonna be filled with ~200 people at any given time for at least a week or two from server opening, may be faster to level elsewhere rather than to fight for the spawns and kill maybe 1 mob an hour.</div></div><hr />
