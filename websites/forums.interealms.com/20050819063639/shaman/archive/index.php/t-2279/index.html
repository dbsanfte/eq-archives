The result is that equipment did not get anything.  I am withholding judgement until next patch but this may result in us getting screwed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My Shadel Bandit ring got a nice upgrade. Also, I'm currently thinking about pulling my old obulous death shroud back away from my alt and wearing it on my shaman again. That's 2 items that I just happened to have anyway that got pretty nice upgrades. I wouldn't say we were ignored.<br />
<br />
Besides, right now, we're in pretty good shape. Yes, I'd like to see our healing abilities improved a little bit, but at the same time, I'd really prefer VI not look at us too closely and decide to nerf something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shadel Bandit Ring, White Dragonscale Cloak, Enshroded Veil, Obulous Death Shroud, Frostreavers Embroidered Cloak.  Looks like upgrades to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">50% true I agree.<br />
<br />
Actually VI probably took into consideration the level 60 shaman that has the JBB and has Epic AND assumed all Shaman are 60 Troll Shaman with snare necklace, Epic , JBB, Fungi Tunic and 3000 unbuffed HP and 1200AC with Torpors and Malo in spell book.<br />
<br />
What they have not taken into account are the every day sluggers out there that are not able to raid every other day and those that can't use those key items (like JBB) that give the shaman the status of already being &quot;BALANCED&quot;. <br />
<br />
Only JBB Shaman are balanced !!!!!!!<br />

~25% of the casting cost is one cannibalize 4.<br />
<br />
yay?<br />
<br />
that was the only &quot;focus&quot; item i got with the new patch... i'm not ueber enough to have any good toys, i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Supposedly, they are still working to add focus effects to the &quot;higher&quot; level stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">definitely some nice upgrades.  but lets look at what is going on?<br />
<br />
Best new enhancements for shamans:<br />
<br />
Mana Preservation<br />
Spell Haste<br />
Afflication Haste<br />
Afflication Efficiency<br />
Extended Afflication<br />
Extended Enhancement (i guess)<br />
<br />
So lets look at the items with Lvl III versions of these items and see what we would have to give up to get these new powers.  Now if we compare to other classes under similar circumstances I think you will find we aren't benefiting as much.  In any case, I am withholding judgement until all item enhancement is in.<br />
<br />
Let me give you example of Afflication Haste III:<br />
<br />
Boots of Superiority<br />
Circle of Falinkan<br />
Gem Encrusted Ring<br />
Harla Dar Talisman<br />
<br />
are the items with this ability<br />
<br />
1) Boots of Superiority are pretty nice but you would have to give up either the vindi boots or PoG boots.  hmm not a good tradeoff<br />
<br />
2) Circle of Falinkan:  Not a bad item but not really up to the level of other head gear that you would wear at 60th.  ac 12 on head.  I think not<br />
<br />
3) Gem Encrusted Ring: HAR.  Not only does this item not at all useful to shamans, does it even drop anymore?<br />
<br />
4) Harla Dar Talisman: This item was fine in the low to mid 50's or on a twink.  But for end game, you are giving up a ton HP MANA AC etc to get this ability.  SIGH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And how many of those items are plate and an Iksar can't use ?<br />
<br />
Xhosa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This patch helped our preist classes alot in pvp. I ain't complaining.</div></div><hr />

- Quite a few shamans as myself still use WW talismans, this is a perfect upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And how many of those items are plate and an Iksar can't use ? <br />
<br />
None of them. Yeesh.<br />
<br />
If only druids could be iksar, then you'd have the ultimate whine/whine combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Celtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I must say that all this whining about 'my favorite item' not getting 'my favorite focus effect' is a little bit pathetic, although not unexpected (general rant, here, nothing personal).<br />
<br />
I for one think these changes just makes for a more interesting game, with pros and cons to your equipment choices. As opposed to today, where almost every class has several must-have items, that EVERYBODY wears! <br />
<br />
Now you will have the chance to review your play style and make a choice and compromise between the general stats of your usual equipment or lesser stats on another item that has a beneficial focus effect instead.<br />
<br />
And a lot of the focus effects may not be that great for everyday wear, but instead they could prove very useful in specific situation, like raids where people act according to their designated role.<br />
<br />
All very interesting and not (I think) a personal insult to the shaman class...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If only druids could be iksar, then you'd have the ultimate whine/whine combination. <br />

<br />
I resent that !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree, Celtor.  I'd love to get some Mana Preservation 3 &amp; Spell Haste 3 items - I'd swap them out &amp; wear them while doing raid buffing, for one.  Kinda sucks that the Shadel Bandit ring (Enhancement Extension 3) works with normal buffs, but not group versions.  I did a /feedback on that, by the way, you guys might think about it too.  Since most of my raid buffing involves group versions, I hope they simply missed that, instead of doing it on purpose.<br />
<br />
I also think they messed up on some of the focus levels vs the difficulty of getting them - Idol of the Underking, from Master Yael, is a level 2 focus, so 44th spells &amp; lower?  Heh, what 44th &amp; lower would be helping kill Yael?  Added that in the feedback, too.</div></div><hr />

:)  nice.<br />
<br />
Personally I am still wearing a Chipped Bone Bracelet and a Runed Mithril Bracer...so I know I got *something* new but I haven't even logged in to check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally at this point I'd say things are too half assed and unplanned to think that verant intentionally or otherwise left shaman out.<br />
<br />
They've already said this is only the first wave, there are some obviously strange things with both effects and effect lvls on some items. Give it a patch or 2 at least i'd say before any serious conclusions can be made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree with crashem. I think when they say &quot;caster&quot; balancing they really mean &quot;pure caster&quot; balancing.   Then again its only the first 150 items, so Taraddar you have a very good point.<br />
<br />
BTW -- This cracks me up<br />
&lt;B&gt;2) Circle of Falinkan: Not a bad item but not really up to the level of other head gear that you would wear at 60th. ac 12 on head. I think not <br />
&lt;/B&gt;<br />
<br />
A level 60 shaman in my guild was doing this quest and I was like wth?  Thats a totally lame item for a shaman!  Why is she wasting her time on that quest?  heh I guess the joke is on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah they changed it Janin. Yesterday it was spell haste 3. Reanimation Efficiency.....gee.....thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Mez not like da entire concept of focus items for caster balancing. <br />
<br />
Too mez it just kind of stinks to have to shove some lesser item into a slot to get the benifit.<br />
<br />
When they did mele balancing they did a lot of things like adjust damage tables,  adding triple attacks,  and improving damage ouptput for 2hs to help paladins / sks.<br />
<br />
For caster balancing you must look to balance power between caster clases and then loot to balance casters with mele classes.<br />
<br />
I think an easy and effective way of balancing casters v. caster would be to simply adjust the spells of the weker casters to be more effective.  The changes to caster pets are already helping pet dependant casters.  Shamans and Wizards are not likely to gain much out of this process because we are already on top of the heap in our own way.<br />
<br />
Once casters are balanced against each other then it is also fairly easy to balance them against the mele classes.  Joo could simple adjust the mana recovery rate from meditate.  This also does not do much for shamans with torpor,  but it would help casters from lvl 1 to lvl 60.  All they have to do is change how much mana joo get from meditating and casters become more powerfull overall.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Has not helped me at all. They can keep their silly focus items. I only want my damn spells. Maybe they should put in a focus item that acts like a divining rod and points you to a mob that has a spell you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Biggest complaint I have, is having seperate pet summonings between necros/sk's and the rest of pet casters.  It makes no sense.   Not that I whip out my pet often, but it makes my grotesque belt useless to me.  It causes necros having to search for more specific gear than the rest :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
I doubt focus items is the total answer to caster balancing.  Focus items either help or don't help, and it's hard to balance all casters if everyone gets the same opportunity; scales still stay tipped.   So I'm sure there's more stuff to come our (all casters) way soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">For Melee balancing they did indeed add Items as part of it; most pointedly lots of very very nice Hand-to-Hand and 1&amp;2 HB items for Monks.  <br />
<br />
Weapon and armor availabilty has always been part of 'Melee' balance.  We've (casters in general) whined about the lack of 'caster specific' Uber items that have significant impact on our ability as a class and player.  Now we have it.  Yes you have to carry alot of junk and do swaps in and out, but alot of the effects are situational anyways.  I already have Solo, Raid, and Resist gear.  I really won't mind carrying around a few other pieces to help me buff faster or to make my dots for soloing more effective.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this is a wonderful thing and makes some of the game more interesting again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The couple of mediocre focus 3 effects that were randomly on my gear yesterday got changed into useless effects today. Hopefully they patch again and put Something useful on higher level gear before I get back from vacation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i think that if you solo, the focus items are as close to a chanter in your pocket as you are going to get.<br />
<br />
to me, decreased use of mana is the same thing as faster mana regen.  sounds like clarity to me.<br />
<br />
on top of that we can increase our damage (direct or dot) decrease our casting time, increase the duration of buffs, i am pretty happy with what we got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">RE:Circlet of the Falinkan - 50 raw hps.<br />
<br />
I was originally MQ'ing the stuff for this to a wizard friend but the quest was bugged and I ended up with the required final item.<br />
<br />
At first I thought it was sucky because of the low ac, but I need the 50hps more than the 7ac from my wolfcallers helm.  <br />
<br />
The difference between 1875hps and 1925hps is more important than the difference between 1005ac and 1012ac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I solo the only mana I use is for Turgur's.  I cann that back while the mob tries to hit me.  Not really an issue for me, though I understand that not everyone has my equipment.<br />
<br />
I'm more interested in how this will affect my raid performance.  Reducing the cast time on Khura's Focusing would really help.  Increasing the duration of Avatar would be great also (no Sleeper's keys yet).  I have a couple of the focus items, trying to get my hands on a few more so I can try them out in a raid situation and see whether they make a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how many time you solo without cast any dot?  epic+JBB+melee will take you long to kill harder mob and mana recovery after fight isn't problem, look at what focus change to oyr bane of nife spell:<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency 3                 25% Mana Cost <br />
Affliction Haste 3                      33% Spell Haste dot<br />
Extended Affliction 3                20% Spell dot Duration !!!!!<br />
<br />
Bane of Nife &gt;&gt; 425 mana &gt;&gt; 5 seconds &gt;&gt; 1498 +150 dmg &gt;&gt; 42second will become<br />
Bane of Nife &gt;&gt; 320mana &gt;&gt; 3.3 seconds &gt;&gt; 1800+150dmg &gt;&gt;50second, <br />
that is..... 320mana for almost 2000dmg compare to 425 for 1650dmg which is huge improve</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I dont mind that I dont have a lot of items with focus effects. And I'm not going to go look for items with focus effects and downgrade just for an effect. <br />
<br />
I do, however, think some of the focus effect levels are still messed up. The two items I do have are Necklace of Superiority (Spell Haste 2 after the change, was Extended Affliction 1 before), and Enshrouded Veil (Summoning Efficiency 3). How is it an item off the boss of Charasis has a lower level effect than an item dropped from a lesser named in the same zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If Extended Affliction III extends Bane of Nife 20% I think the result will be this:<br />
<br />
Normal: 42 secs duration<br />
With EA III: 42 * 1.2 = 50.4 secs<br />
<br />
42 secs = 7 ticks of 6 secs<br />
50.4 secs = 8 ticks of 6 secs + 2.4 secs wasted ?<br />
<br />
Or do we get 9 ticks since the 9th tick started?<br />
<br />
If its only 8 ticks then BoN does 150 + 1712 = 1862<br />
<br />
1862 is &quot;only&quot; approximately 13 % more than the normal damage 1648.<br />
<br />
If EA III has a random effect on the duration its much worse. Lets say half the time it extends the duration more than 10% and half the time less than 10%.<br />
<br />
10% increase: 42 secs * 1.1 = 46.2 secs<br />
<br />
Thats not even enough for 1 tick so no increase at all ?<br />
<br />
You would have to increase 42 secs by almost 15% to get 1 extra tick. So wouldnt that mean that in close to 75% of the cases you wont get any benefit for a poison based DoT?<br />
<br />
I certainly hope this isnt how it actually works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Frankly that change they put thru sucked big time.  90% of my focus effects are junk now and most of my high level gear is w/o focus effects anyway.  However 1 item did change and that was my Sky Watcher's Monocle from Affliction Efficiency 3 to Mana Preservation 3.  That was nice.  <br />
<br />
Overall VI really screwed the pooch on this (not surprised...again the level of testing done is pathetic) and it is not over yet.   &lt;sigh&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The one day I had Affliction Enhancement III from the Dustscryer's Crystal Ball it did not affect Bane of Nife at all.  No glowing Crystal Ball. No Extra ticks of damage.  Nothing.<br />
<br />
Methinks, those highly skilled coders at Verant are off by one in calculatiing the duration of Bane, putting Bane below the minimum duration for Affliction Enhancement to work.<br />
<br />
I am,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I like the improvement but what you need to be able to do to accquire them is ludicrious (exception is the Obby Shroud).<br />
<br />
<br />
From a Wizard/shaman point of view:<br />
<br />
<br />
Implementing many of these abilities on items doesn't increase the classes abilities, it simply inflates a market on items that were useless before and now aren't so bad.  <br />
<br />
Not everyone has access to a LOT of these items.  Most of the good level 3 focuses are on items many wont accquire.<br />
<br />
HOpefully they address this in patch 2.  But that could be months away.</div></div><hr />
