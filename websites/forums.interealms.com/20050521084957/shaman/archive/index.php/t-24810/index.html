<br />
What's the graphic on it?<br />
<br />
&lt;lucy&gt; Item: Zun'Muram's Spear of Doom(A spear that seeks the heart of the target by its own will), MAGIC, LORE, NO DROP, Slot: PRIMARY, Skill: Piercing, DMG: 30, Delay: 22, AC: 20, STR: 20, DEX: 15, STA: 15, WIS: 20, AGI: 20, HP: 240, MANA: 250, SV DISEASE: 25, SV COLD: 25, SV<br />
&lt;lucy&gt; MAGIC: 25, SV POISON: 25, Required: L65, Effect: Tnarg's Mending (Must Equip, Casting Time: 2.0) @L0, WT: 2.9, Size: MEDIUM, Classes: SHM, Races: ALL, Type: Piercing, Submitter: Cosmodeous [Fury's Edge], Source: Live, URL: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/i/AQ3+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looks like a luggald spear, half-assed garbage.  I guess they figured no one ever went into LoY zones, so they could reuse the graphics from that expansion on end-zone class weapons.  I'd rather have had Zun'Muram's Broken Bottle of Doom (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52026).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This item should look like the Barxt lance, and have 1.5 sec cast time nihil with a 5 sec recast clicky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If it had a recast, it'd be junk(in a &quot;if it isn't an upgrade over the TA, it's junk&quot; kinda way).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Recast Delay: 900 seconds, Recast Type: 2<br />
<br />
it's way junk in a I hate insane recast items way <br />
<br />
if it was like a 30 or even 60 (that is a strech for me tho) second recast it would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

While 15 minutes is assininely long and undesirable, I think 30 or even 60 seconds is probably too quickly.  Somewhere in the 3'ish minute range would be on par with some usability, but not overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3 minutes and useable from inventory would make this incredibly useful and at the same time not overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">wow so more cheesed out graphics?  that's sad, a couple of LoY weapons looked cool but mostly junky esp. that trident =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bonkr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You'd need to pay a shaman to take that spear.</div></div><hr />
