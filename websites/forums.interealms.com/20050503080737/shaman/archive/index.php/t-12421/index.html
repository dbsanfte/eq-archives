<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was hangin' out, doin' my usual search in the bazaar last night for treasures, when I ran across this price listing. <br />

<br />
I had to see this for myself, so I took a stroll over to where this knucklehead was setting up shop.  Sure enough... <br />

So much for spell research lowering spell prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, some of the prices I see for shaman spells are laughable. I really hope there arent people paying these prices, because that's the only reason people will keep selling them that high.<br />
<br />
I recently got the components for group acumen and had it researched, so I took note of the price the next time I was browsing the bazaar. There was one copy for sale, at I believe 17K. I just wonder why anyone would think a group vision buff was worth 17K. I've never paid more than 500 plats for a spell, and that was for Focus of Spirit a while back, when level 60 was still the cap. That's about the most I'd ever pay for a spell, and even then it would have to be a fairly important spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just grind out some exp and get to 65 .. skip lvl 60 spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a chill dagger on my trader for 999,999p 9g, 9s, 9c....some people just make silly prices for the hell of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, wizmo's a nearly 60 shaman. He's actually using the spell, but just getting a kick out of puzzled Shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wizmo is the lil gnome in the picture</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gotta love the way that spell research has flooded the market with spells.  Yup, saw Malo (one copy) sitting for sell in bazaar on Xegony more than one day straight.  FOR 75K!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wasn't intended to flood the market with spells, nor are people hunting where all the parts drop.<br />
<br />
I have everything but the shard for malo(which I have) and most for topor, grp focus and grp acumen.<br />
<br />
I'm happy with it, now I just need a staff shard to drop and hunt ct some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A lot of guilds leave their spell mules in the bazaar with spells priced at a million pp so guild members can pop in and see whats available to them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Or possibly just a typo.  Some idiot was selling an ornate chain tunic for a million plat for a week and a half w/o it budging.  I sent him a few tells, eventually he noticed and changed to 100k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It is not a typo, lol.<br />
<br />
Wizmo is my brother IRL. That is his trade mule. He's just being a dork.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I figured as much, Stalkyr.  It was just funny to see it, and even more humorous to point it out in guildchat to the 3 shaman we have who have been looking for that spell for weeks and months, especially after I got my copy the week I hit 60  :D  <br />
<br />
Hey, if you can't torture the people you love, who can your torture?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hah, a guildmate of mine is making an alt shaman froggie.  He's at 57 now and asked me last night &quot;Where does Torpor drop at?&quot;.  The shaman mains that were on got a good laugh when I relayed his tell into /gu.  Lucky for him we have about 200 Glyphed Rune Words in the vault and he can just get Qui once he hits 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Had a gavel of justice on my mule for 10k for awhile.<br />
<br />
You know the gavel of justice right?<br />
