<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kitty_Lera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so your in a group you tell the group canni 5 inc NO HEAL! cause if your like me you Q then hit the canni 5 button.<br />
<br />
and so what do i ALWAYS read next in group chat that i have a heal inc /sigh<br />
so i talk to the cleric in tells or the druid who ever is the main healer and i get ok ok i didn't see message in group chat sorry i'll let you do your thing.<br />
so awhile later i say in group canni 5 inc NO HEAL PLEASE!!  and again i see in group chat that i have a heal inc. /sigh there goes another wasted 200m and it always seems to happen in LDoN groups(pick up groups that is) if i am with guild they let me Q but them pick up groups frustrate me as i don't like to waste 200m when i don't have to.<br />
anyway thats just my biggest pet peeve.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I almost have my guild healers trained to ignore my health bar unless I'm dropping really fast..but even they still sometimes heal me right after I have Q'ed myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have stoped trying to even try and make due with torpor/Q before i can 5. hack i dont even drop the message anymore ( I am running at or so close to my mana limit that I am hitting can5 EVERY time it pops and if have also notice that the butten will refreash 3 secs or so beofre the skill will. ) If thay want to heal me then fine if not then i torpor. if thay heal me that is 200 mana i get to use on something else if thay start getting in to a mana crunch then thay best start only worrying about someone else. I dont tell them how to play and i sure dont realy lisson to them most of the time when thay try and tell me how to play. yes i get hit, yes i am takeing aggro every once in a while ... why couse i plan it that away and i know i will be that is why i am close to the mob and dont move it. and that is why i torpor up after wards or before i get the aggro. <br />
<br />
But for the most part any half decnet healer that has played up in there lvles and is not part of the K generation ( a term i heard a little bit for the KEI freacks ) knows that shamans health is never stable and to largely ignore it unless it starts moveing down below in sevral large leaps ( not a single 50 percent drop in life that can5 does to me ). but then we all have to play with the lvl 65 newbies now dont we.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've gotten to the point where I won't torpor till about a minute after I Can5.  If he hasn't wasted his mana by that time it's safe to heal myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In many groups with shamans, the healers have nothing else to do with their mana.  I have told my clerics not to do it, but they usually retort with, &quot;FM anyway, gotta heal something :P.&quot;  It does not make a big enough difference in overall group efficiency to worry about.  Clerics are meleeing half the time these days anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's their mana, you warned them, enjoy the quick HP and Canni 4 while Q finishes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
My message is &quot;Canni5 no aggro&quot;.  That seems to work better than saying &quot;no heal&quot; for me for some reason.  Sometimes I get healed, sometimes I don't.  I prefer to receive no heals at all unless I'm pulling multiples, but it is tough to get well trained healers to ignore someone other than the MA at 50-60% (or lower) health.  After a few group sessions, most healers will eventually come around.  I try to train them not to heal me unless I /yell or say &quot;heal&quot; in group, but it doesn't always work.  :p  When they reply that  they are at FM, I tell them to nuke a bit more. :cool: <br />
<br />
What I really hate are the single target heal over time casts from the clerics.  I have taken to telling every cleric as soon as we group that if they feel they must heal me, that's fine, but do not EVER cast a Heal-over-Time spell on me.  Most can accept that.  Especially when you let them know you have SCRM &amp; get 50% extension on 200 mana Q's which are more efficient than their best HoT spells.<br />
<br />
If I hit Canni5 and get a direct heal right after, I can at least spam Canni4 a few times (or toss an extra Rain spell even if I'm a bit too close) to get some use out of my Q.  I've also started waiting to hit Canni5 as soon as the Cheal message begins, which usually prevents getting a quick heal.  :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I sometimes get healed, even though my Canni5 message says that I'm not in any danger and really do not need a heal.  So what do I do?  I say &quot;thanks for thinking of me&quot;, roll with the punches, and press my Canni4 button a few times.  Playing a cleric must be so incredibly boring -- let them have their fun if they want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, it's a pet peeve of mine too, but there are times when the pallys and cleric heal me and tell me they are FM so it's ok, then I live with it, because then it's just like a mana transfer. My hotbutton is &quot;Doing canni, don't heal unless I'm aggroed thanks.&quot; Usually, after a few of those they get the hint and leave me alone unless they are FM. I actually get more heals from pallys, sk and rangers than clerics now, and they're usually the ones saying they are FM and KEI is going to waste, so I smile and enjoy it  ;) <br />
<br />
What really bugs me tho...is when the clerics don't listen and my Torpor goes off and they cast Celestial Elixir which overwrites mine. I almost detest that spell. I actually had to finally make a &quot;Casting Torpor/healing myself&quot; hotbutton. LOL. I had a cleric yell at me once for his &quot;wasting&quot; mana on celestial elixir on me when he should have been told. <br />
<br />
/blink<br />
<br />
I must have been the first shammy he's grouped with and he musta been blind for the times at the beginning of group I hotbuttoned my canni message. /shrug oh well. I think most of us understand the pet peeve and have it ourselves. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't bother correcting people too much anymore.  I was in an LDoN adventure when the cleric kept healing me, so I just stopped using Q on myself, I just Canni 5'd, expecting to get healed, and I did. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This used to bug me, then i made a hotkey telling people that i was canni V-ing . This helped some healers with their mana, some other just keep insisting on healing me .. so they can go right ahead, i just use the extra mana to Canni IV a few times if i have to, or even mod-rod on occasion :) ... I never go looking for those .. but i always seem to end up with one one way or another .. so might as well use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't mind the heals too much but i will usually mention it to the healer a couple of times and I try to always call my cann v altho I don't have a hotkey for it. My only concern is if the healer is running low on mana.<br />
<br />
I do have to agree the Ce's can be annoying. I've got q 65% extended (50% + crown of ambi) and it lasts longer than 99% of the clerics out there.</div></div><hr />
