<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I just got home, and I made my shaman.<br />
<br />
In the span of like 30 minutes, just running through EC, I managed to pick up some Shaman stuff, like Flayed Turmoilskin and a Totemic Helm, and a Bone Mask of Jarsath... I think that's pretty much it. Everything you see in my profile that's real shaman gear is it, and pretty much burned my 3k. I could have saved up more, but I really wanted to make the shaman. :p<br />
<br />
I just wanted some tips on what to get. I have no idea what to put in the wrist slots, my wis seems a bit low at 120ish. I know I have alot of stupid equipment like the Cloak of Ry'Gorr Oracles, but it was all I could pick up at the moment. Alot of loaned gear, like the Sarnak Battleshield, I'll have to replace that with a Clay Guardian Shield soon. <br />
<br />
But could anyone just give me ideas of what to wear. I realize that I should have a heavy AC/HP loadout, but I don't want a temporary loadout, I really actually just need something that'll carry me through, that I can keep, like the belt. So I figured my wis would be a bit higher, but I really don't know what I should do. If anyone has any ideas, I'd be grateful. Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy full banded.  Go have fun.  You'll be better equiped than most of the people you're asking were at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say you are fine for some leveling... what I would look for if I was you is some of those new fangled caster mod items.  Preserve Mana and some Affliction moding items.  Do a search on this board for &quot;Preserve Mana&quot; and you should find the thread with a list of items and effects. <br />
<br />
Preserve Mana would be the big one for ya to aquire.<br />
Next would be the Affliction enhancers... other than that you are gravy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd suggest getting a FBSS or SCHW for haste, and a better spear..  for the lower levels that would be great for xping :)<br />
<br />
everybody here mentions bone mask of the jarsath when people ask about twink gear, I never got that.. I'd much rather have a crystalline spider eyes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, back when I was using a bone mask of the jarsath, there weren't crystal spider eyes.  That's probably why I can never remember to recommend them, I generally recommend gear I wore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldnt replace the SBS with a CGS, unless your friend needs the SBS back.<br />
<br />
SBS &gt; CGS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's an SBS, and what should I put in my wrist slot? Is there a better arm item than the one I have on now as well?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just realized what SBS was. I'm not tard lol, SBS is much better than CGS, but he needs the resists to raid ToV, and he'll be raiding alot, so yeah, I'll have to pick up a CGS. Anyone have any idea what it's worth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a Clay Guardian Shield you can get for like 400-500.<br />
<br />
a Charred Guardian Shield goes for a bit less.<br />
<br />
a shammy is usually better off with a clay guardian shield, but it drops from a far more difficult mob. 25 ac 50 hp compared to 10 ac 9 wis is far superior in my choice, for minimally more money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My personal favorite shield is Bladestopper, 25AC 15Sta 50hp 10charges runeIV. now it is arguably much harder to get a hold of but it also gives you more hps with out taking a hit on AC, i also have my SBS in my bag for those times that i need resists.<br />
<br />
Plus i love the graphic though if i remember right it is the same as a CGS :) <br />
<br />
Anywho that is just my 2 cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No you don't need to get AC/HP gear. That's just one way of looking at it. You're also fine using wisdom gear as rest of the priests. It all depends how _YOU_ yourself like to play, what is the balance for you. Not for someone else whos post you read.<br />
Explore the game and class, find your path and have fun, worry less about maxed twinkage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally when I twink I tend to avoid buying the BIG items such as the Flayed Belt. They're expensive and aren't really that much of an improvement. High levels tend to pay far too much for stuff that isn't that much better.<br />
<br />
The example I always use is Wisdom rings. For about 200pp a pop you can get Platinum rings (+6), but to get Velium Rings (+7) is another 100pp each. Is one wisdom really worth 100pp? Not if you're trying to stretch out your money it isn't. I understand the cost of components and stuff... but a 16% wisdom increase for a 50% price increase???<br />
<br />
Personally, using prices from Innoruuk server, I'd sell the belt. Only seen a few go and they were for around 2k if I remember right. With that I could pick up a Smiter's Girdle (~500pp), JB Boots (~600pp), JB Arms (~500pp) and a Slime Coated Harpoon (~300pp). That'll help you a LOT more than the wisdom on the belt (Smiter's Girdle is 10AC, +3 all stats too. So you're only losing 2wis/3dex). People don't like selling JB cheap though... but at the same time no one buys it. Give them your price and not a penny more then let them get frustrated. If they find a sucker that'll pay more... meh. Just play the waiting game. You could wear banded and level to 15 without breaking a sweat.<br />
<br />
Charred Guardian shields are worth diddly too. People killing CWGs in SolA practically give them away. It'll tide you over til you get 30-ish and can grab the Epic shield (FREE!). Stay away from stuff that looks like a &quot;book&quot; though.<br />
<br />
That's just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />
