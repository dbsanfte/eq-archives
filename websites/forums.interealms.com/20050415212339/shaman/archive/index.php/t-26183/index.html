<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, <br />
<br />
I have been doing alot of Evil DoN missions lately with a few guildies, <br />
The one mission i loved is the one where you have to open 15 Drake eggs and a named pops for you to get your reward.<br />
<br />
<br />
I liked it becouse its easy and no buggs.<br />
<br />
<br />
My question is, on the Good faction is there any other missions that require you running around opening eggs or chests?.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
<br />
