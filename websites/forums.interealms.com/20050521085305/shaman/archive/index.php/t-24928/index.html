<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone asked in the channel tonight what % increase was gained from the various levels of Healing Gift Mastery, our OoW crit heals upgrade AA.  The AA description only says that it adds and increase and doesn't say specifically how much.  I personally have level 1 so I thought I'd take some time and test it out to see what my crit rate was.  It should also be known that we should have 16% crit rate from maxing out GoD crit heals; 3/6/10/12/14/16 % rate as you go up the progression, this rate is specifically stated in the AA descriptions and thus easy to obtain.  I went into my test assuming probably a 2% increase per level so I should expect about an 18% rate with my level 1 in HGM.<br />
<br />
I used Minor Healing and made sure I was damaged at all times by using Canni 5 every time my health got too high.<br />
<br />
My results were as such, in sets of 50 casts:<br />
<br />
1-50 : 7 crits<br />
51-100 : 10 crits<br />
101-150 : 8 crits<br />
151-200 : 7 crits<br />
201-250 : 3 crits<br />
251-300 : 5 crits<br />
301-350 : 14 crits<br />
351-400 : 10 crits<br />
401-450 : 5 crits<br />
451-500 : 11 crits<br />
<br />
Totals:<br />
500 casts<br />
80 crits<br />
16% crit rate<br />
<br />
Definitely NOT what I was expecting to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">500 is sadly not enough of a sample size to judge anything by. Your best bet would be to leave your computer running overnight, and have a thumper or something set up to chaincast minor healing for a relatively large sample, say 10000 casts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
500 is more than enough data to calculate a decent confidence interval on a Bernoulli random variable.  You are estimating the crit rate on heals, which is p.hat here.  The maximum likelihood estimator (an unbiased estimator) of a Bernoulli random variable is the sum of the number of times the event occurs divided by the total number of events observed.<br />
<br />
n = 500<br />
X-bar = p.hat = 80/500 = 0.16<br />
1 - X-bar = q.hat = 0.84<br />
Standard error = se.hat = sqrt(p.hat * q.hat / n) = sqrt(0.16 * 0.84 / 500) = 0.016<br />
<br />
A 95% confidence interval would be p.hat +/- 2*se.hat = 0.16 +/- 0.032 = (0.128, 0.192).  18% is still within that confidence interval.<br />
<br />
If you want a confidence interval that differs by less than a percent from the center on each side, then you'll need n = (0.16 * 0.84) / 0.004999999^2 = 5379 samples for a suspected 16% crit rate.  n = (0.18 * 0.82) / (0.004999999^2) = 5904 samples for a suspected 18% crit rate.  If you want less than 0.1% difference on each side, you'll have to collect around 540000-600000 data points.  For each order of magnitude of precision you want, you'll have to collect 100 times more data (inverse square relationship).<br />
<br />
Using statistics you'll never get the exact answer, only an estimate of what you're looking for along with a measure of confidence of how good that estimate is.  Just looking at the data over the 50-sample sets, I see the same interval closing in around 16-17%.<br />
<br />
For real fun, you should have collected crit heal data before you got the OoW AA and then compared it to the data after and done some hypothesis testing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&lt;-- head explodes<br />
<br />
Or you could take the easy way out and simply ask a developer what the crit rate at each level of the AA is. ;)<br />
<br />
Just a thought though:  WoW appears to publish all modifier information on their weapons and skills, which is very responsible of them. EQ seldom publishes any comprehensive information on their AAs and modifiers at all.  You just have to take their word that each level is better than the last, and you can never be sure of the exact amount unless a trusted SoE source tells you.  Being open about skill modifiers and such is another area where WoW outshines EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it's all in the RNG. it would be like doing /rand 1 100 five hundred times and expecting to get 16% of your rolls 85% or higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got bored and did some samples of Healing Gift Mastery 3.<br />
<br />
I chain cast Minor Healing 1038 times. There were 211 crits.<br />
<br />
Estimate = 211/1038  = 0.203<br />
Standard error = 0.012<br />
95% confidence interval = (0.179, 0.227)<br />
<br />
I think the data is leading more to showing a 1.5% increase per level than 2%.  If it were 2% per level and assuming 16% is the crit rate before any OoW instant heal AAs, then I'd expect it to drift closer to 22% than it currently is.  22.7% is the top of the interval, and I don't like that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if anyone feels bored and has HGM3, cast Minor Healing on yourself a couple hundred times and post the results here.  I can incorporate them into the estimate.<br />
<br />
I also tested the hypothesis that HGM1 and HGM3 result in different crit rates.  It turns out I could not reject the hypothesis that they are equal rates, but that is most likely due to the fact there is little difference between them (3-4%) and you need more data to test that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should do that.  (P)RNGs are available and shouldn't be any problem, because over time the inconsistencies will smooth out.  BUT if the popular thought is that each of the OoW cit AAs is adding 2% to the chance of a crit heal and it's actually not, then sampling and statistics can give evidence of the validity of that belief.</div></div><hr />

I have up to the pop healing aa's done, haven't done the  oow ones yet.<br />

spammed 384 minor heals, I had 55 crits.<br />

thats 15.8%<br />

if i had a gamepad I would let it run all night or something to check, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

55/384 = 14.3%<br />
<br />
But 16% is still within reach given that sample, well within reach.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">4003 casts of Minor Healing.  827 crits.<br />
<br />
827/4003 = 20.7%<br />
<br />
Standard error = 0.6%<br />
<br />
95% confidence interval = (19.5%, 21.9%)<br />
<br />
22% is not even in that interval (unrounded it might have just made it, but I rouned to thousandths because I'm dealing with only 4003 points of data).  Right now I would say there is mildly strong evidence that the OoW crit heal AAs do not give 2% per level, but only 1.5%, with the maximum crit rate being 20.5%.  I'll collect another 2500 casts and give my final analysis in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">drib must be from that long lost clan of Erudite Shamans! <br />
<br />
Me INT 52! Me not tarted me just slow! Me hit 1 button, frends not die!! Me hit 2 button, monstor slow down!! Me hit 5 button, monstor go BOOM!<br />
<br />
Actually, I could do some testing, I have all the pre-OoW crit-heal AAs, none of the OoW ones. Finished off the healing % one, Channeling, Rez, AnAid 2, and have 3 of the 5 I need for my last buff slot. I had planned on hitting some pre-OoW ones I kinda glossed over next (RC3, Spirit Call 3, maybe some more Gates ones when they fix the quantities) so I wouldnt mind spending an hour or so casting Minor Heal and counting crits. Will post results here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">drib is doing real statistics analysis, not the 'x isn't a large enough sample size' malarky.<br />
<br />
I was wondering when someone would take the time to post something real. I was too lazy to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Final analysis: 7701 casts, 1668 crits<br />
<br />
Mean = 1668/7701 = 21.7%<br />
<br />
Standard error = 0.5%<br />
<br />
95% confidence interval = (20.7%, 22.7%)<br />
<br />
It finally crept into the 22% area after momentarily slipping out.  It seems the 1.5% per level hypothesis was edged out, but only slightly. Like I mentioned in the other post, if you want to get it down to tenths of a percent, you'll have to collect 600k data points.  It's not a crystal clear decision, but it looks like 2% per level has been confirmed, or at least 22% maximum crit rate with maxed out crit AAs.  If I get really bored this afternoon at work, I will plug in some of this data into my stats analysis package and do some non-parametric stuff where I can resample the data appropriately to simulate that I have 600000 points of data.</div></div><hr />
