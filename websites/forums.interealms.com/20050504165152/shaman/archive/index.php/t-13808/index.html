<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally finished QB2 last night, which along with Wicked Bone Atlatl took Torpor cast time down to 3.3 /cheer.<br />
<br />
Should I go ahead and finish QB or will it not make much of a difference? I've seen items that I'd rather have in my range slot for focus and HP, so my question is will QB3 take Torpor down to 3 seconds to where I no longer need the bone?<br />
<br />
Most of the Magelos I've looked at only have QB at 2/3, was wondering if people are in the same boat I am with Haste of Mithaniel or is there simply not enough to gain by finishing QB to warrant the spending of 9 AA points?<br />
<br />
I don't raid enough to make MGB top priority, but I would like to have it for when I do. Should I just go for MGB or finish QB? I hate not having an AA skill completed, it irritates me to no end but I don't want to blow 9 AAs if the return is trivial.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i would suggest MGB.. very usefull when ya need to buff a lot of groups... or just for the fun to cast it at POK or Nexus :D and see all zone at your feets  (works even better if some MGB KEI is called too :D :D :D<br />
<br />
If i understood your message, you already have maxed your haste spell with mithaniel. QB3 wouldn't be as &quot;interesting&quot; as MGB ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If i understood your message, you already have maxed your haste spell with mithaniel.<br />
<br />
According to everything I've read, QB2 and Haste of Mithaniel will max out the allowed spell haste, but I've seen a couple things that I'd like in my range slot more than the Wicked Bone Atlatl. If I get QB3 could I ditch the Bone but not loose any haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not quite, Haste of Mithaniel affects beneficial spells without a duration (IE tnargs mending, gate etc).  I've got quickbuff 3 though its utterly superb, 3 second torpor without the need for any items/BoR is worthwhile.  It all depends on how often you raid really.  Do you have Fo7 or Talisman of the Boar?  If yes then yeah, I'd probably get mgb first, if not, then I'd be more tempted to get qb3 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Forget both and work on scrm.  It'll be more useful than saving 1/3 of a second on torpor, and since you're only 61, raid situations are often going to have a higher level shaman doing fo7/boar.<br />
<br />
If you're set on one of those 2, I'd go with MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
I don't raid enough to make MGB top priority<br />
Well, we are talking about your next 9 points for investment purposes.<br />
IF you don't raid enough to make MGB your top priority, THEN I wouldn't waste the next 9 on Quick Buff3 SINCE you have a haste item that works with QB2.<br />
<br />
My recommendation:<br />
Radiant Cure1<br />
Virulent Paralysis1<br />
Spirit Call1<br />
<br />
If you raid at all, Radiant Cure is a must have in my opinion.  Much more so than QB3.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis is an underrated AA in my opinion as well.  It has saved me many times.  It isn't perfect, it can be resisted, but an AA that you can use every 2 minutes is worth investing in sooner rather than later.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call1 is FUN, it works as a great off-tanking tool &amp; for strategic mob placement (which VP serves to do as well w/ the knockback portion).  Twelve minute cycle time means it is adding roughly a free ~3k aggro-free DoT on a frequent basis.<br />
<br />
If you raid often enough, then MGB would be top priority.  But you said you don't, so bump this down a ways in your progression list imo.<br />
<br />
QB3 would be nice to have, but QB2 gets things done for you at the moment.  Especially with the bone in range, this shouldn't be a priority for you.  Remember, even if you find that nice range item  (I use a CT brain), it doesn't mean you can't swap out range items if speed in casting is going to be an issue for a specific situation.<br />
<br />
Good luck no matter your decision!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looking at your profile, I'd say SCRM all the way.  MGB won't save you at your level, because most people won't be happy with level 60 focus anymore.  I have over 130 AA and still haven't driven myself to put 9 points into QB3.... it just hurts too much, and has a marginal return, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree with Finaljustice, SCRM rocks, adds 20% longer buffs (very nice with torpor/quis)<br />
<br />
i have QB2 and the wiked bone atlatl, turns my quiscense into a 3.3 cast, the lowest possible cast time you can get it to is 3.0. (so losing .3 off cast time is not worth 9AA IMO).  If you find a range item that is better then the wiked bone, u have to spend 9aa to get the haste back (wiked bone also turns our quick heal from 3.8 to 3.0, which we all know QB has no effect on instant heal spells)<br />
<br />

65 shammy 144AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would agree with the other posters.  Essentially, QB3 offers very little benefit over QB2/Wicked Bone Atatl, and actually has 1 drawback (namely that it does not affect all beneficial spells, but rather only spells that are beneficial and have an icon). <br />
<br />
I would suggest CA1/CA2/Spirit Call 1 perhaps for that same 9 points.  That path might provide you with better results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would advise against training QB3 yet.  You should still train it, just not yet.  3.3 seconds is fast enough for torpor, since you only have to cast it on yourself and the occasional caster.  Once you get quiescence, though, you should drop your haste of mithaniel item, get something better in that slot, and train QB3 for a 3 second Q.  I have very nice items in both my shoulders and range slot, so haste of mithaniel was never a possibility for me.<br />
<br />
In the meantime,  I would advise forgetting about AA at going for 65.  You have canni5, which is more than enough to see you through.  If you absolutely have your heart set on AA, then try out SCM3.  If you were 65 and had quiescence, I would recommend SCRM, since SCRM, QB3, and Q turn you in to a god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">QB3 is a complete waste of aa points. You should also keep the wicked bone until you get a better item with similar effect since that focus &gt; some hp that you would gain in switching items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">QB3 is the last thing I would spend aa points on in your situation. As several people have already pointed out the haste of mithaniel focus effects heal and other spells in addition to just buffs. I wouldn't ditch your Wicked Bone Atlatl untill you got a better spell haste or benificial haste item. If you really want to get rid of it get http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=13646 to upgrade your shoulders and retain the effect.<br />
<br />
Ok so where to spend the aa's at instead.<br />
SCRM is great- 50% longer torpor is a wonderful thing expecially with cann v.<br />
<br />
SCM is great- Spend less mana on everything you cast.<br />
<br />
Those are the 2 I'd put at the top of your list.<br />
<br />
Others I'd definitely do before qb3 include combat agility/lightning reflex, MGB, Spirit call for at least one level, Radiant cure for at least 1 level, VP for at least 1 level and metabolism if you use stat foods and/or a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get 62...then 63...then 64...then 65.  Then get RC1.  Then think about what to spend 9 aa on. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree GB3 is waste <br />
<br />
with focus easy item + cleric BoR buff, you only need GB2, unless you have 100 or 200aa +</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree with Gwain once you have Can5 if your not already 65 I would concentrate on that, I think there is more postive in that than adding AAs.<br />
<br />
QB3 i agree with everyone is a complete waste, i had the wicked bone atatl myself and i recently upgraded it and I missed the extra haste on buffs.  Unless you had AAs to burn though I would wait on it.  The other suggestions are all very good though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">MGB, not question about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks for all of the replies, they will help me make a decision one way or another. The SCRM is a great idea, as I wasn't aware that it would effect Torpor.<br />
<br />
Regarding going to 65, I have no plan to go past 61 until the experience levels for 61+ are re-tooled and its actually worthwile to do so. As it stands now, I'm not PoV flagged so going much further in level is pointless for me until flags are removed.<br />
<br />
Still plenty of AAs I want anyways. ;)</div></div><hr />
