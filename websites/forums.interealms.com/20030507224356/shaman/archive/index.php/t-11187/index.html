<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Axon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My screen of my PC is not very advanced, therefor I am unable to play EQ in 1024 x 768 modus.  Is it possible to adjust my UI in 800 x 600 mode?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />

If you want to know about your specific UI and how to adjust it, well... might be easier if you told us which UI you use? Generally speaking, though, it's possible to adjust all UIs but if you like the result or not will wary since all things will take up bigger parts of the screen.<br />
<br />
If you wonder if it's possible to adjust a UI to 800x600 and use it without it cluttering up all of the screen, then yes. I use 800x600 and it works fine. Attaching my own as an example just so you see it can be done pretty clean.<br />
<br />
Go to EQ Interface (http://www.eqinterface.com/) and mix and match from what you find there. You'll find plenty of 800x600 solutions and smaller versions of buff windows etc. there. Not to mention their forum where people seem to be pretty helpful.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks again,<br />
