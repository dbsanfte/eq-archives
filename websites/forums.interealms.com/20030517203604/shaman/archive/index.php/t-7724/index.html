<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have accumulated a nice ammount of PP after doing some Bazaar'ing and was wondering what to use it for :)  I have 13k at the moment, but will have around 20k once I sell the last few items that I have remaining. <br />
<br />
 The problem is that I have no idea what to do with it! Well...actually, the problem seems to be that I have too many options for how to use the money and don't know what to do with it lol.<br />
<br />
Here was a few options that I was thinking I could do with the money...<br />
<br />
1.) Buy a cheap horse for Canni+med action :)<br />
2.) Buy the pieces for the PoTC earring quest and then use the left over money for another minny upgrade?<br />
3.) Save the money for working on getting my trade skills up to complete my Shawl quests. (Currently on the 5th Shawl and I almost have all the threads to make the combine. I have 136 Baking, 138 Pottery, 128 Tailoring, 60 Smithing, 20 Fletching and 20 Jewlery)<br />
4.) Skill up my Alchemy (Currently at 38.  I would almost only do this now for the sake of making some potions for my guild =\ )<br />
5.) Save my money for Malo and Torpor.<br />
6.) Buy numerous mediocore upgrades for my char.<br />
<br />
Also, if it helps, I'll mention that the guild I'm in barely raids at all.  We raid maybe twice a weekend and it's usually something just for fun. So I wont be getting any &quot;uber&quot; loots anytime soon I think =p Oh yeah, also forgot to mention that I already have a JBB so I'm set as far as that goes.<br />
<br />
By the way, check out my magelo (link in sig) to see my gear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you don't have one, get an Earring of the Solstice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can pull it off for 20k,  Ikky breastplate, earring of the solstice and cheap horse.  Take some horse trading but it's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you play in a outdoors a lot then get a horse it's  an excellent investment for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Just remember to turn off all the models if you want to still be able to sow yourself. Also you only get mana while you are not moving or meleeing. You get it when you cast when you sit stand etc. <br />
<br />
The one point to be aware of is that the mana bar doesn't refresh until you cast a spell or click an item. if you use all your mana and stand for a while and then click your boots you'll see your mana bar shoot up.<br />
<br />
I've had my horse for about 6 levels now and she was worth every pp I paid for her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends how fast you level. If you think you will be 60 in next month or so, save for Malo/Torpor.<br />
<br />
Horse is always a good investment, plus you can liquidate the cheap nag for about 1800pp loss if you need to raise cash fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm..the more I think about it the more I think I should save for my lvl 60 spells, like the above poster said =p  I might get 1 minor upgrade and save the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slayerfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get that PotC Earring. Easy to get and, considering the stats, an AWESOME upgrade to your worst earring and FT1 to boot.<br />
 This little gem cannot be beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i'd go horse, and save the rest for your 60 spells....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Take a poct and keep for your spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">POTC doesn't make that much of a difference though. You need your spells, but the reason I think you should get a horse is, as Grogbat said, you can liquidate it afterwards to fund your spells. Meanwhile, regardless of whether you like that POTC, it's there to stay, you can't even sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Double post, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As you have a JBB, I have to say get a horse. You can then cast JBB and still get mana as if you are sitting. If you need cash for a spell that pops up bargain basement cheap, you can sell the horse for a sufferable loss, the benefit you'll get in terms of faster xp will make it well worthwhile the lost of 1800pp or whatever it is.</div></div><hr />
