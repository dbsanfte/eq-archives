I was wondering if there is any shaman item that has gate or port effect.  Is there any item shaman can use to port or gate to certain area?  (not gate spell shaman has)  Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Peace<br />
<br />
Btw if there is any, can it be traded in bazaar?  price range?<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

Spiritstone of &lt;insert the newbie zone of your race here&gt;, player made with pottery.<br />
<br />
Port potions (Everfrost, Innothule, Field of Bone, etc..), created with Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Vial of Velium Vapors (Thurgadin Gate Potion), created with Pottery.<br />
<br />
Prices vary, 'cept for the Thurg potions...those're really cheap (aside from the cost of getting Pottery up to 122+ to trivial the combines).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is also a new potion that can be made via Alchemy to port you to your bind spot.  And get this!  With your gear!  :)  Potion will cost you about 252pp per dose and has a cast time of 10 seconds I believe.  There is a store bought version that is insta-cast, but costs somewhere in the neighborhood of 1kpp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Series of three PoP quests resulting in All/All necklaces with effect: Talisman Gate (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3046) which ports you to Plane of Knowledge. The final necklace has unlimited charges, but is hard to get.<br />
<br />
Easiest thing to do is get yourself a Spiritstone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see Spiritstone of Everfrost in the bazaar for 1500plat quite often. It teleports to Everfrost. Unlimited charges.<br />
<br />
Downside is 30 second cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Orball</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the replies.  I didn't expect this much help :)  It looks like spiritstone will do the job.  I just need extra port/gate spell near PoK book without binding myself.  One last question, do I have to be lvl 51 to get this effect on Spiritstone of Everfrost?   Im kinda new to this concept.  Lucy site says its effect lvl is 51...I guess I have to wait until lvl 51.  Thx in advance.<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes you must be level 51 to use the spirit stones.  And make sure you get the stone for your race/home city as that is the only one you will be able to use.  Though every home city I know of has a book near by.</div></div><hr />
