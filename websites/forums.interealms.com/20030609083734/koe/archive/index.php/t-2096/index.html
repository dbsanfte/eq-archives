<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I know this may be inappropriate since I am but a petitioner, and if so please  just let me know, but I would like to see if there is an interest in  working on some HS keys. Either for primaries that do not have them or secondaries. If so I would be more than happy to download maps and lead a raid to get fang's etc. Or if there are others who are more experienced in these area's I will be more than willing to pass the torch of leadership to them. I was thinking perhaps sunday afternoon July 29th we could take a few groups down and work on fangs if this does not conflict with any other planned events. <br />
<br />
Let me know your feelings,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll help out with fangs and prods...  i happen to know a particular phat Ogre that needs a fang :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know Kaesora pretty well by now, and would be happy to lead a group or two down th the church to get fangs.<br />
<br />
For the record, Xalgoz and his placeholder are on a 30 minute spawn timer, while the rest of the dungeon is on a 20 minute timer. He drops a fang every time, I believe, and sometimes drops two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aziz Al'Qadir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Count me in too...  I need to get both the fang and the prod.<br />
<br />
Post a day/time/etc and I will be sure to check back....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well it sounds like there is definatly an interest. The only real thing that I can see missing at this point besides more bodies is someone that can help out as a healer<br />
<br />
Traz if you are willing, since you know the area, I will be happy to make you the raid leader on this one. That way I can be more intuned with CC.<br />
<br />
Where would be a good staging point?<br />
<br />
What time would be good?<br />
<br />
My vote would be how about <br />
<br />
1pm est on sunday july 29</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and would love to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>erolz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think Arsecn means (/who) sexy ogre (all)<br />
<br />
well, if my original plan of going to Kings Dominion drops then i will gladly show up. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can go pretty much anytime during the weekend.  I need both the prod and the fang, too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am but a lowly petitioner as well, but would love to go. I have all my keys except charasis key, (except VP key, I'm just a ranger ok) :D<br />
<br />
so count me in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ferylit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you have room I'd love to tag along.  Besides never having been to Kaesora I will eventually need all the keys I can get and would love to meet with more of you.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Neverflee and I also need both parts of the key as well, but our main objective in coming is helping out everyone else. Sunday works great for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vetiria Mindmelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would love to show up to this, if you guys have any more room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Caladen Lifebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hiya!<br />
<br />
Thavian still needs his Fang and Prod and would love to go along..<br />
<br />
Send a tell to any of my three n we'll see..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, I'd be happy to lead it if you want me to. When I went down with Baracus we took the long way, stopping by the Straithbone Runelord and a few other places. It didn't take much longer, and we tore through them like nobody's business. Maybe we can hit the Library as well, if we have time.<br />
<br />
As for a date, I'm out of town this weekend, and will be out of town pretty much up until August 7th or so, as I will be at GenCon (going to participate the the tournament, though I expect to have my rear handed to me on a silver platter).<br />
<br />
If you don't mind waiting 'til then I will be happy to lead you doan, otherwise have fun, and be sure to whack Xalgox once for me. He killed me once about 10 levels ago, and I never got over it.<br />

(and later this week, Cheese country, Wisconsin),</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok Traz,<br />
<br />
I think we would be better to have an experienced leader than me with my downloaded maps. Though I will if asked I believe we would be smarter and have less of a body count if we waited. Just let us know when it works out best for you. <br />
<br />
Mish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree Mish that it would probably be best to wait for Traz. Do you think we should go do the Chancellor and get that part (or as many as we can anyhow) done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ferylit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am so sorry but I cannot make the raid today, impromptu D&amp;D session was called! I do hope to make a raid someday, and will be free ALL next weekend to play.  Hope you all have fun and get more loot than you can carry!<br />
<br />
Ferylit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kindonini,<br />
<br />
That would have been a good idea sorry I didn't respond earlier. I will have to research where the prod drops and how to get there. <br />
<br />
Mish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't know the Kaesora part of this mission so well, but I know the chancellor area well. Would be happy to help.<br />
<br />
Baracus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>XunilTlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't know if you guys already went to get the fangs off Xalgoz, but FYI I believe Xalgoz drops two fangs every time.  At least, when I raided there a month ago, we got two fangs every time, but didn't get any of his other rarer drops.  So, you can pretty much count on 4 keys an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Xunil and I have been fortunate enough to get our HS keys already but I will be MORE than happy to assist those that still need to get it or that need information on how to get it.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Fazzie needs his howling stone key too.  Set a time and date, and i'm there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok, I'm back. :) Let me know when and where and I'll be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">WOOT Traz is back,<br />
<br />
The weekends works best for me, This saturday morning however I am getting a cable modem and installing it on my system. With a tech coming to my place to run the wires to the room(what the heck they are doing it for free) I've never configured a system for cable so not sure what there is to it yet. Would hate to commit and not be able to be there because of a system down situation.<br />
<br />
I'll have to let you know when its up and running<br />
