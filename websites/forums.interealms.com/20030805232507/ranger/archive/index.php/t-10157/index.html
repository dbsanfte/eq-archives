We raid tonight<br />
Much to my delight <br />
Yeah, yeah... oh <br />
<br />
Stand up and cast aego <br />
Hit points we are about to receive <br />
You are the casters<br />
You'll buff us with everything we need <br />
Hail, hail, to the shadowknights <br />
Defensive has got the right of way <br />
We ain't no rangers, ain't no rogues <br />
We're tankin' to save the day<br />
<br />
For those about to tank, we salute you <br />
For those about to tank, we salute you <br />
<br />
We tank the gods on the front line <br />
Like a wall between them and you <br />
The zone's a-light with the uber fight <br />
Clerics chain complete heal tonight <br />
<br />
For those about to tank, we salute you <br />
For those about to tank, we salute you <br />
For those about to tank, we salute you <br />
Yes we do <br />
For those about to tank, we salute you <br />
<br />
Oooh, salute! <br />
Oooh, ooooh yeah <br />
<br />
I'm just a warrior for hire, and my health bar's a-fire <br />
Taking flurry hits for you <br />
Pick up your arrows, and load up your quiver <br />
For a twenty-one bow salute <br />
<br />
For those about to tank - fire <br />
We salute you <br />
For those about to tank, we salute you <br />
Those about to tank - fire <br />
We salute you <br />
Fire <br />
We salute you <br />
We salute you <br />
Come on, whooa <br />
For those about to tank, we salute you (x4) <br />
<br />
Shoot, shoot (x2) <br />
<br />
For those of you, for those who tank <br />
Yeah <br />
<br />
We salute you (x3) <br />
<br />
Fire</div></div><hr />
