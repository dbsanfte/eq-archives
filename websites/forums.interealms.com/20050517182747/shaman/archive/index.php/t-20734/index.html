<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I finally got my MM flag (yay), the last flag I was needing for Sol Ro/PoE/PoW/PoA access. My problem is that I can't seem to straighten out my flags properly.  More specifially, I can't straighten out my Tactics line of flags.  /say Guided Meditations at the Seer gives me the following errors:<br />
<br />
The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
<br />
The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
<br />
According to the information I'm using,  these two errors are supposed to be fixed by &quot;(disappears after you get MM/Saryrn/TZ/VZ and talk with Librarian)&quot;  By virtue of this :<br />
<br />
The Cipher of the Divine Language appears on your arms for a brief moment then fades.<br />
<br />
and also by having the above first two errors, I have my MM/Saryrn flag lines straight and have TZ/VZ PP hails and have talked with the Librarian....yet the scribbled notes won't disappear from my guided meditations.  I'm thourghly confused... went down the list over and over checking and rechecking hails and flags and preflags with no success. <br />
<br />
Can anybody shed some light on this?  I'm desperate to start my first ever CR in PoW and PoE and PoA</div></div><hr />

For me, it took several trips to the gnome in the library to get straightened out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Library and wherever the Medic guy is, cant even remember now. Was a pain though. Mine was such a mess I just gave my info to a friend who knew what was going on and let him run around, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Insight-Stromm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You didn't mention Agnar or Rallos Zek. You wouldn't have elemental flags without those.<br />
<br />
MM/Saryrn/TZ/VZ are for Sol Ro only. You have to hail Maelin at the top of the PoK library and say &quot;what lore&quot; and &quot;what information&quot; to get the Sol Ro flag. If you don't get it, you are missing an encounter. Post your entire seer list if you need help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have Agnarr.. I have all of the flags..  just those two aren't straightening out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You didn't mention Agnar or Rallos Zek. You wouldn't have elemental flags without those.<br />
<br />
MM/Saryrn/TZ/VZ are for Sol Ro only. <br />
<br />
He wouldnt need MM for access to PoE/PoW/PoA. the only 2 flags you need for them are Rallos Zek and Agnarr plus everything below. You only need MM for Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
Try running to the seer doing guided meditation then to maelin and first hail, then what lore what information then back to seer and do guided meditation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you thank you thank you... I have no idea how or why the flags got straightened by running back and forth from seer to maelin and back again 12 times... but it did.. so I'll promplty forget about that and whistle happily as I wait for my corpses in Water to show up.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
I can't straighten out my Tactics line of flags.  <br />
This section had me confounded for awhile after my MM kill.  Same thing with the scribbled notes.<br />
<br />
The spoiler site I was using mentioned &quot;What Lore&quot; to talk to the gnome in the library, but you ALSO have to (later on for me, my flags were a mess) go back and say &quot;What information&quot; to Maelin.  I didn't see that listed anywhere as a corrective action, though after the fact it was obvious when re-reading the Maelin text (though of course the text didn't employ brackets).<br />
<br />
&quot;What information&quot; to Maelin in the PoK library was the key for me to straighten out the Tactics line of PoP flags for Sol Ro access.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
