I'm flagged for everything but time and usually duo Sol Ro with a 65 SK, but only one ornate seems to drop every 3 hours or so. Anyway, anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I (65 shaman with pre-elemental gear and 40 aa's) and a 65 necro (same) both made about 1k cash in an hour farming lower dogs in Velks.  We also got a bunch of drops we can sell in the bazaar for more.  <br />
<br />
Not the best cash in the world, but kinda fun and got about half an AA from all the light blues and the odd dark blue. <br />
<br />
Brood Mother is a bitch though.  Have necro pet tank her till you can get her debuffed and slowed (if at all).  Turgur's wouldn't land with Malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">head to droga and start cleaning out named. Depending on whats camped and how many ph's you can reliably clear per cycle you can pull in some nice loot in a few hours. Its my favorite spot to loot farm, and you get 1% aa per kill, not great but not bad considering your there for the money anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tasbor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rad are u saying getting an ornate piece every 3 hours is not enough?<br />
<br />
So that u can sell them between 10 to 40k (or even more for the rares ones)/every 3 hours?<br />
<br />
Sure it seems to be crap loots !!!!<br />
<br />
Think many of us wish to make 10 to 40K in 3 hours, even if i had to share the loots with my friend...<br />
<br />
I wish it anyway !!!<br />
<br />
I like to duo droga and cant make such money for sure in same time !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">read the plane of fire thread.  I has some nice trade skill drops that you can sell or make into a nice item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/second Droga vote.  Can't speak on solro or fire as I'm not flagged, but I've pulled in 50k worth of items in a few hours in Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With the prices of ornate patterns on Xev I'd think that getting 1 pattern every few hours would be killer pp.  I'm not sure how you'd beat that.<br />
<br />
I can only dream of getting ornate pattern drops.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
If ornate is so trivial that you farm it for plats...err..what exactly are you buying?  I rarely see anything selling for more than ornate on Xev...and must really high end uber drops are no drop planar drops or quest rewards...what exactly do you need all those plats for?<br />
<br />
Just curious...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rad100</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm trying to make a really uber monk twink. I've got all his stuff picked out, but it's going to cost about 500kpp, so I was looking for some faster ways to farm some pp than Seb or something like that. I think i'll try soloing for the solidified magmas in Fire. Thanks for the help guys</div></div><hr />
