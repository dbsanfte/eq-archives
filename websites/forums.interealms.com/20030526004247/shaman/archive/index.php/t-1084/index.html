<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaviin Callendor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Partnering with a monk. I usually just walking sleep, and keep some buffs up on her and I. I keep sow, regen, spirit of ox, and inner fire on myself and sow,regen, spirit of ox, spirit str, inner fire, and protect on her. I have one buff slot, regen, canni, disempower or burst of str (kinda a waste both it seems), DoT, walking sleep, root, and heal. I usually stay around 40-50m and at 50h. if I ever get 60m I do DoT, and I rarely have to heal her. Am I not using a spell I should be, or am I using too many buffs? Should I DoT more to speed the fight up? And I must say, root is a joke, and has been a joke since I got it. If it lasts more than 15 secs I havent seen it. I've tried root parking the extra mob if we get an add and I waste too much mana trying to park one. Would Malo help root last longer? Also I get a lot of resists on the slow, would Malo help with that? I tried it a few times but it was resisted so much. Are all slows disease based and if so I should use umm infectious cloud to debuff? But anyway, thanks in advance for any advice. I am trying to learn the spells but its a bit much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You sound like you're doing well.  Keep your mana and health at a nice equilibrium.  If you start to get mana back faster than you're using it, throw on a dot to make the critter die faster so you can move on to the next one, but don't dot it every time or else you'll go oom and have to med, which means downtime and pisses monks off.<br />
<br />
As for root, I think it is because of levels.  At level 53, I still use the same root that you do, but I am using it on mobs that are 10 levels lower than me.  You're probably fighting mobs about 2-3 levels lower than you, so it gets resisted and breaks a lot more.<br />
<br />
And for using walking sleep, do you happen to know the slow percentage and mana cost?  At your level when mobs are quick easy fights and the slow isn't a very big slow, it might be more efficient to not slow at all and use the saved mana to throw the occasional heal on her.  I never used slow until my mid 30's, but then again I was a newbie =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spirit of Ox on yourself is probably a waste of mana unless you're just using it as a buff timer. If the Monk never gets dangerously low on health, isn't using heavy weapons, and is not swimming, it's probably unnecessary on her as well. You should give Spirit of the Cat (Agility) to the Monk if you aren't already. If she's using weapons that can proc, or just needs to raise some weapon skills, a Dexterity buff is good.<br />
<br />
I would recommend that you not bother with Disempower, as the effect is minimal for the mana cost. Burst of Strength is also not doing much for you considering its mana cost and duration. Walking Sleep and Envenomed Breath are probably your best bets for spells to use in your situation, while making sure you always have some mana to heal if necessary (let her work as much as possible on her Bind Wound skill between fights) and that you're not getting too low on mana that the Monk can't pull when she's at full health. If you're getting a lot of resists, you can open with Malise, which will increase the probability of landing both Walking Sleep (magic based, not disease based) and Envenomed Breath (poison based). However, Malise is a lot of mana so be sure it's necessary. Probably you're better off just recasting Walking Sleep a few times until it sticks. Also, especially if MOBs aren't lasting too long, you might want to experiment with (a) not slowing at all, and saving the mana for Envenomed Breath or heals, or (b) using Drowsy.<br />
<br />
For me, I don't think it was until at least around Level 40 that Root started to have a reasonable chance of holding. As Jinheim said, it's probably just that few, if any, levels separate you and the MOBs that you're fighting. Also, 30 mana every 15 seconds is a lot at your level. At Level 50, it seems like a bargain for its effect.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget about Inner Fire as a healing spell. At your level, it heals 20 points for 10 mana, which is a better ratio than the Level 19 healing spell. It can be cast between ticks as well (much easier now that spell book medding has been removed entirely), just as you cast Cannibalize between ticks. It may sound stupid, but it's possible that the best thing you can do with your mana is to keep buffs and regen on the Monk, forget about slow and DoTs, and just use Inner Fire during and between fights to heal. Try it out and see if it works for you.<br />
<br />
Also, for your own safety, I would reserve a gem slot for SoW or Gate, depending on whether or not you're indoors. In the event of trouble, the Monk can always Feign Death, but if you can't run away (because SoW just dropped) or gate out, you're probably going to die.</div></div><hr />
