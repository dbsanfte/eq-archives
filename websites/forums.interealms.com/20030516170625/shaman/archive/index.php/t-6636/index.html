<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've heard lots of stories about these two places, and I've actually levelled from 53-55 in HHK.  So far the experience has been great, but I'm looking for a change of scenery and figured Katta might be a good idea.   <br />
<br />
Basically, I'm looking at 860AC, ~1900hps with JBB/Epic (Thanks CS!)  and am wondering about the viability of doing Nathyn's guards in Katta.  Is it worth heading up there?  I like the idea of being closer to the bazaar and UP where my guild frequents as opposed to being out in the boonies in HHK.  Any suggestions?<br />

<br />
I'd move over to Katta, yes.  HHK stops being good exp at 55(at least, it stops being the best exp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have never done HHK Nobles sucessfully. I attempted once and just pissed off the vendors and got adds. is there a good way to pull singles?<br />

Maybe I am in the wrong room?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Until when are the bank guards/TS zoneline guards good until?  I duo with a monk so I'm just checking if the xp is still good for a while.<br />
<br />
Also, is it possible to fix faction... in case I ever feel like finishing the Bane Warding quest :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">all of 54 and 55 in one weekend (20 hours playtime) in hhk.<br />
<br />
Me thinks that is significantly better than katta at those levels.  Although thats when 54 was a hell level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Working on my next 'step-by-step' guide..this time to katta.<br />
<br />
Katta guards are much like the HHK nobles, with relatively low HP's and nice plat per kill if you include the armor they drop.<br />
<br />
The reason that Soupypoopy pointed out in favor of HHK was the elimination of the exp penalties for race/class in a city zone.  This means that trolls/iksar and other races that have a racial exp penalty can level at the same rate as their barbarian cousins here and still enjoy our racial advantages.<br />
<br />
So the answer is: if you have no exp penalty because you chose to be a smelly barbarian, then HHK has no real attraction to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I started Katta at 56, and have had zero problems.  55 should be fine - but you need to be careful to get singles.  guards in tunnels aggro on line of sight, so it is a short learning curve to get one at a time there.  the guards at the zone in from TS will always come in pairs on the very first pull, as you cannot get in sight of only one.  not a hard break, and the zone makes it safe.<br />
<br />
I have not had any problem pulling singles from a pair by pulling with turgur, once you are pulling from outside of proximity aggro range.  This works great in bank courtyard.<br />
<br />
WARNING:  I still don't know why it happened, but I had one courtyard guard path by bank and then either run into bank or despawn (despawn is not unusual here, the guards apparently work shifts!)  - then three centurions ran out of the bank and killed me before I could get off a root.  since I don't know why it happened, I am not sure how to prevent it.  I have made it a habit to get cloe enough so the guard I am pulling does not go around the courtyard to get to me.  I don't get a free shot at Bane that way, but I am more worried about those centurions.</div></div><hr />
