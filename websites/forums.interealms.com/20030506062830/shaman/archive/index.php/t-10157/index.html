<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was watching a guy rekey a bunch of locks at work and watched as he was doing things like pulling the handle and key core out of a door in 2 seconds. He could rekey a lock in like 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
I started asking him some questions about it when he said he had a book at Here (http://www.howtoopenlocks.com/). At first I thought, &quot;Does freeking everyone have a book on the net?&quot; But then decided to check it out on a chance. <br />
<br />
From what I have seen so far though, the book looks freeking cool, useful, and has sort of got me a bit more interested on the subject. <br />
<br />
Here is another link just in case anyone is interested....<br />
<br />
A lock picking guide. (http://www.blackmarket-press.com/info/lock/Guide_LockPicking.htm) <br />
<br />
Just some fun trivia.</div></div><hr />
