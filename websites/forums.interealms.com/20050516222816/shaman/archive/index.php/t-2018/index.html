<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Juventus said on the high level/wimpy hitters post:<br />
&quot;Make sure you buff Charisma to keep slows from being resisted while you are at it&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I've heard several different things from several different people as to wether a higher cha will give you less resists.<br />
<br />
I tested it in OT, but i couldnt decide either way(sometimes i could slow red guys, sometimes blues resisted, it was wierd -note, i tested slowing the same type of mob, because i know mobs like tigers have mas low MR).  <br />
<br />
What do you guys think?  Im going to test it more next week(exams are done after friday, woooo), but i just want to know what you guys expieriance w/ cha and slows is. <br />
<br />
thanks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh no, not this again :(.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure it's just rumor. I've never seen any accurate tests prove it one way or the other. Which leads me to believe charisma does nothing.<br />
<br />
*edit: I just read Juventus's post and it was clearly a joke when he said that.*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh lol i didnt read his post thouroughly enough it seems)<br />
i was jus skimmin through, didn even see the &quot;:rolleyes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ive never seen any accurate tests either, but im just wondering.  Ive had 55-60's tell me both yes and no =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's false. Enchanters use cha for mez/charm. Someone mistakenly thinks they use it for debuffs/slows as well...then makes another mistake and assumes the same applies to shaman. <br />
<br />
If it makes you feel better to look pretty, by all means cha buff yourself. Psychological effects and character confidence can help your game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, enchanters debate endlessly about whether charisma even affects _us_ at all. (Yes, we're pedantic even among our own kind.)<br />
<br />
The spell guy at Verant said it has some affect on charms, and on no other spells in the game. And plenty of us charm just fine with low charisma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrmm<br />
<br />
Well, even if it doesnt help slows, as Jhar said, atleast i can pick up more chicks :D ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">let me see if i can remember all the things cha has been suspected of doing.<br />
<br />
increasing faction hits<br />
negative cha effecting necro/sk fear<br />
slow's<br />
debuff's<br />
and probably just about everything else in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CHA also doubles JBB damage, and makes it instacast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe it's total horse****.<br />
<br />
But the number of times in say NtoV I've not been paying attention to my buff bar, and known that my cha buff has worn off just based on the sheer number of resists I start getting on slows leads me to believe there's something behind it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, it seemed to help me somtimes, and other times its not noticeable, which is wierd.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, going by popular response it doesnt, but there are always people such as you Kylt, who make me wonder, as i do in this post =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Xertt, if you do a search you will find some interesting &quot;opinions&quot; on this(unless they were lost when we got the new board).<br />
<br />
Just for fun i'll add my opinion, which hasn't changed since when this has been discussed the first time. <br />
As long as your &quot;Charisma&quot; is 75+ you will notice no difference in resists. If you fall below it however, you get resisted more, especially when the mob gets a resist bonus due to being higher level(which was lowered for direct damage spells in the &quot;resist change&quot; patch, but not for debuffs btw).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm sure others will chime in too but I've got a masive 60 cha and I still have no more problems slowing pretty much anything that is slowable. Sometimes me and everyone else gets resisted 10 times in a row, sometimes i land it on the first try. It's just random.<br />
<br />
I've also got a lvl 59 enchanter if by some freak chance cha did help out i sure as hell can't notice any difference between 60 and 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can't say I've noticed any difference whatsoever the few times I've tried. However in the &quot;who has over 3khp&quot; thread there is a guy with 15cha, maybe someone could ask him...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For me it's like wearing the same pair of socks for a softball game.<br />
It probably has no impact on my resists, but if I keep getting resisted alot, I'll toss on a Charisma buff as long as I have a buff slot avail.  What does it hurt anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Man thought this idea was long dead. lol  <br />

&quot;Charisma affects your ability to land the malise line....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charisma affects your ability to land slows...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lol  man I wish this rumour would just stay dead.  Simply put, it is your level + debuffs vs mob level on landing a spell.</div></div><hr />

But ask yourself this.<br />

if you had the resources as a shaman to have 1452ac, and 3161hps unbuffed why would your charisma be 45?<br />

or perhaps 1270ac and 2929hps unbuffed with 55cha?<br />

Not really saying Charisma helps slowing better, but...<br />
Why would a shaman with 3161 HPs and 1452 AC know how charisma affects slows any better than a shaman with worse equipment ?<br />
<br />
Maybe some people don't remember it, but one of the most vocal warriors ever(Furor) was one of the firmest believers and advocate of AC over HPs less than a year ago. Look at how he changed his mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Verant's ineffective stat system + misinformation spread over several years by them + people's preconception that stats should boost a character's power = confusion and rumour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">But OK, it's fun. Just skip this post, when tired :D<br />
<br />
For the few, that are still interested in the topic (some around?), might check the older shaman or enchanter boards, here and on castersrealm, most following points are shameless copied from enchanter threads.<br />
<br />
Yes, i am in 'keep CHA buff up, doesn't hurt, seems to help sometimes'. If nothing else, it's a talisman for good luck :p <br />
<br />
Some facts or rumours till now:<br />
- Level is affecting resists most (surprising, isn't it)<br />
- At least for slows there is MR  check done (weight against lvl check? no clue)<br />
<br />
Here is, where it becomes myths and legends, what does CHA?<br />
<br />
My favorite theory (granted, not my own) is, that its additional third factor, only affecting resists when everything else is calculated, so after lvl and mr.<br />
This would fit the (not fully proofed) 5 or 10 percent resist decrease, some guys tested.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, that following the theory 'lvl and mr first, then cha', cha influence highly depends on the mobs you are fighting, so when you fight mobs in a range within several lvls, don't expect to get some valid test results.<br />
<br />
If some statements are wrong, just flame away ;) <br />
<br />
Is it worth your mana? Really doesn't matter. Decide yourself and don't die :)<br />
<br />
God, i love this discussion. Keep it up.<br />
<br />
Hm, another point (really should go back to work ...): Would it make sense to check this on a PvP-server? Someone tried?<br />
Even if PC-fights maybe calculated different, you should get some idea of the influences, while fighting with known stats.</div></div><hr />

You are wasting your time and a buff slot if you cast it for any other reason than buying or selling.  Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">of course the only real way to test it is with the same encounter documented over and over.  Which of course is extremely time consuming since the theory is based on mob levels and how they are flagged.<br />
<br />
Of course if we picked one target, and started keeping track we could support or rebuttle the arguement better.  That in mind, why not run a test over the next couple months and check the results?   Could pick Roy as a target.  Note your cha unbuffed and how many resists you get, note your cha buffed and how many resists you get, and track your race as well.  After a few months of collecting data, compile it and see what the results are.<br />
<br />
Just an idea so we can put this topic to rest ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use them as an example only because if you have gear that good, then that means you are putting in massive amounts of time doing the hardest things in the game.   It certainly is no proof, but it stands to reason that if you could have your pick of the best of the best gear in the game you would choose the items with stats that would help you do your job.  <br />
<br />
It also stands to reason that someone doing the very hardest stuff over and over and over would be looking for any ways to make things easier for themselves and their guild.   Just like Furor came to realize the value of maximizing HP, even at the cost of AC.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Whatever.   Like I said, I would love to see some tests on the effects of charisma on Turgurs in particular.  If the tests show a positive result, you can bet I would be the first to eat my words and try it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Ok here is the plan.  The best test will be against high level mobs, dragons in particular.  Lets focus on Roy.  I will create a seperate thread and if Thantu would sticky it for a couple months so we can collect data and evaluate that would be great. <br />
