The desire to come here is also lessening greatly to me as well too. It has nothing to do with this forum or my shaman cause i find myself looking at othe parts of the board now intead of coming here to general. this is a issue that keeps coming up over and over with each expansion and more beyond that. If it went away you could just weather the storm, but its not going away anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please, i humbly ask the mods and admins to atleast consider this solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree - I hardly read anything in this section any longer, it's very discouraging to even read the topic titles.<br />

This used to be a place where people came to learn and help others to become better Shamans, not a place to rant on how lousy life is, or how great other classes have it. There is a need for that, I understand, but it is like a runaway train now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i like how the necs do it myself... have a forum for Dev Discussion which is very heavily moderated... no flames, no cursing, etc.  And in General anything goes...</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much Ronax for providing a great example of why there should be a separate forum for class balancing and ranting.<br />
<br />
It would also centralize and organize it so the developers won't have to filter through all this crap.<br />
<br />
I 100% agree.  I think there are easily enough posts to merit a new forum heading.  It's just lame here now.</div></div><hr />

Whether or not that matters to the masses is not my concern. IMO, consistently reading the flaming, cursing, rudeness, and general immature whining on a daily basis is old. So don't read the posts or come to the board, you say. I don't have to read the posts, and generally don't waste the time ... I have only to read the subject line. Even that is old. Don't come to the board? Might as well ask me to quit breathing ... there is an absolute WEALTH of good information here, posted by some very well-respected and knowledgeable shaman. I've learned a hell of a lot about my class since I began coming here, and I continue to do so. My point, like those who have already posted here, is that sifting through the whining crap to get to that good information is tiring, discouraging, and old.<br />
<br />
Mods, Sunmoon, whoever does this sort of thing ... start another category in the forumss for class balancing issues. Moderate it heavily, as someone has already suggested. Leave the General category for *other* class discussions. As someone has already said ... this is not going away. There are expansions on the horizon for as far as the eye can see, same thing for patches. Since it's not going away ... adapt to it.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
Anyway, I don't see a reason to create a new forum for &quot;Class Balance&quot;.  Eventually, we'll either suck it up and accept what we have (or quit EQ) or we'll get fixed up and 'class balance' won't be a major concern anymore. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But dont you think its risen to a new level?<br />
<br />
I know what your saying, its the topic of th moment, but this is beyond just a topic of the moment, its a entity of its own. Personaly i dont see it ever stoping, just maybe easing down a lil bit. Its a new part of the mentality of the crucible or i guess not new, but it has grown beyond whats its been in the past and with so many requests and desires at this point, i dont see it shrinking too much.<br />
<br />
If there was a forum of its own i think it would be deviod of lack of focus and would grow into something good. This suggestion on my part is not just to tone down the bitching and over all bad attitude,  but it would allow this topic ot have a forum of its own where stricter focus could be brought to it. It would have a better chance to finalize its self and grow into more solid ideas cause everything around it would be focused on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I stand by my request. I think this is good on many levels.</div></div><hr />

It is getting old, we could have a new forum called class balance and let us get back to our regularly scheduled drivel about what race is best, what's the best dou partner etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Litgruv, it hasn't grown to an entity on its own. That requires fuel in the form of frustration, passion, debate, disagreement, convincing etc. <br />
<br />
Call me lazy, call me an old bugger, but I still ONLY read the general forum. I am sure I am not the only one. The day you start moving all the important discussions to their own forums is the day they die out from lack of fuel.<br />
<br />
The current bout with SOE will blow over once it is resolved. If it isn't resolved I'm not going to let it blow over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Another problem I see is there are tons of great balance posts getting pushed into the bit bucket (off the first page of the general forum) that won't be seen by a dev.</div></div><hr />

/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Then I think the solution is for the mods to merge all the threads that are basically the same thing repeated over again, or lock them up before they get started with a nice little &quot;Refer to this thread instead&quot;-message.<br />
There is a truckload of posts that are no more than paraphrases of others and could just be done away with.<br />
<br />
Our General forum should reflect what the shaman class puts priority on at the moment. If a subject is interesting and valuable enough it will float by its own merit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And thats my point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read through all the threads ont he first 2 pages and look at the in depth and detailed requests that are going to be coming up after healing. Some are going to be just as heated as healing and with our new found &quot; if we bitch enough we get it&quot; mentality. There is plenty of fuel and will be for a long long time. Hence why i feel its grown into its own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Or we could do a medicine bag type thing where we nominate the good balance threads into the separate forum.  I just think that there are so many good ideas that need to be channeled into one area so if/when a dev does come here he/she/it will have only the best to skim though and its all in one place.</div></div><hr />

Actually in his 1st reply Ronax makes a very good point to the original poster of this thread.<br />
Basically he want new sections etc added but makes no mention of what he wants in the General section etc.<br />
<br />
The big problem is if you start a class balancing etc forum then youre going to drastically cut down on a lot of the intelligent ideas etc that came of the &quot;Shaman Uprising&quot; :).<br />
<br />
Plus youve also got to look at where this whining got Shaman as in new heals on test.<br />
<br />
Sometimes people who are at the end of their tether need to blow off steam and often very good ideas arise from that but if theyre posted in a rants forum then who reads it or gives a ****.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">there is no need for a new forum atm. We need to get our issues through. If after that we feel the need for a balance discussion forum, fine. Right now we need the frontpage or nothing will happen again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hooray for voting for our own lack of freedom and encouraging a lack of expression.  <br />
<br />
Way to go, guys.<br />
<br />
I always knew America would never last.<br />
<br />
Of all places to go to see people openly speaking their minds, why would anyone go to an internet forum?  Should we continue to let people think there is a place to speak?<br />
<br />
What we need is an Ayatollah immediately!  One glorious day, maybe we'll all learn to accept our inner Ayatollahs and then everything will be just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Once the Dev sightings slow down I think people will stop posting every latest greatest idea that pops into their heads and General will probably get back to normal.  It might get worse before it gets better, though.  Being listened to is heady stuff, especially if you're used to being ignored.  <br />
<br />
On the topic, I'm with Blarg, regimentation is not where it's at.  Adding forums to encourage the free exchange of ideas on a specific topic is fine.  Adding a forum to limit the free exchange of ideas on a specific topic defeats the whole purpose of having a public forum in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus I'm lazy as hell, 1 forum to read is plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Another problem I see is there are tons of great balance posts getting pushed into the bit bucket (off the first page of the general forum) that won't be seen by a dev.<br />
So bump them.<br />
<br />
As to a separate &quot;class balance&quot; forum - no. As much as I do not like to see the first couple of pages overrun with depressing titles I do think it is needed.<br />
Everyone expects those titles in a class balance forum. The very amount of negative posts in the general forum shows how much we care and how many of us think we need some help.<br />
<br />
By the way, you might want to try not refering to that new forum as a &quot;whining forum&quot;, not if you want people to agree.<br />
<br />
We are not whining - we are trying to get the same amount of improvements every other class got because currently high end shaman just do not contribute their share. Not in a group, not on raids. If you are not at this level of the game it might not affect you yet, but the effect is rippling down to some semi-casual players already and sooner or later we will all feel it.<br />
If that does not concern you, feel free to ignore us, feel free to start your own &quot;happy&quot; threads but do not whine about us whining. At least we have numbers to back up our whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Many other class forums and sites have Balance sections, that would not be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Sciek is right however that this current balance issue is The Topic for Shaman currently and should be on the main/general/current board.  The mods could have moved all the posts about spells to the Spell Forum by our own rules but while that would fit the letter it would not fit the spirit of The Crucible.  The hottest topics should stay on the main board and it is the job (thankless as it is- but thank you guys) to know when a post is hot and should stay in the main and when it is not and should be moved to the proper sub-form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">While i agree that shaman class could use major tweaks ( I would like to be more powerful relative to other classes),  it's is sad to see crucible so dominated by bitches and rants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">at the moment there are way to many threads stating the same thing, even multiple posts about the new changes on test.<br />
<br />
it looks like we got our heals, (maybe?) and if thats the case then I am fairly sure things will even out, I have been through this with the rogue comunity before, people are all pissed off atm but once things show evidence to working out it will slow down.<br />
<br />
a class balancing forum seems kinda extreme for something that will probably end up being worse for the class rather than better since many wont bother to read the new forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">it looks like we got our heals, (maybe?) and if thats the case then I am fairly sure things will even out, I have been through this with the rogue comunity before, people are all pissed off atm but once things show evidence to working out it will slow down.<br />
I sure hope things do not slow down - we currently have on test a small part of what is needed to rebalance shaman.<br />
If it takes cluttering up the front page with tons of similar posts that is unfortunate but I would rather have to load page 3 a couple of times then continue to be underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">One guy's whine is another guy's point, and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
That's why chaos is so productive.  A &quot;heavily moderated&quot; separate forum for class balance would be beyond useless.  Selecting and pruning out individual ideas according to any individual bias, no matter how well-intended, would be crippling the not only the particular dialogue but the whole point and power of discussion itself.  Tucking away the dialogue, &quot;helpfully&quot; sliced up and degutted or not, into a place away from where many people would  even see it would render a diluted and de facto censored (and therefore self-censored too) discussion even less likely to communicate anything of value whatever.<br />
<br />
Censorship and shuffling ideas off to a place to be forgotten are ways to make absolutely sure topics have the least chance possible to be addressed and addressed honestly and with balance.  Communication doesn't come from telling or forcing people to shut up; or banishing their discussions to a ghetto.  Any discussion (and forum) loses infinitely more than it gains when heavy handed so-called do-gooders come in and try to make sure everyone else knows what to say and where, and then tries to misrepresent the butchered leftovers to each other and to guests as if they were a gourmet meal instead of the poop sandwich it really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The whinning is way out of hand IMHO. A couple threads here and there are fine but it's too large. I think a class balancing forum is perfect.</div></div><hr />
