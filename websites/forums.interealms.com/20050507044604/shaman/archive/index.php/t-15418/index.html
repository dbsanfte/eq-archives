It was wearing a siblisian berserk cloak!!! Horray!!!<br />
<br />
I moved to the bazaar and 20K richer I searched for quies or torp and BINGO! Torpor for only 22K<br />
<br />
Now I am a very proud member of the shaman community.<br />
 :cool:</div></div><hr />

Btw, I've noticed Torpor is down to 25 to 30k on Emarr now (from 60k)...<br />

(BTW Can I move to your server)Move to mine, I've seen it as low as 15k on Terris-Thule.  Everything on TT has been dropping in prices lately.  Got Khura's Focusing this morning for 1.7k.  The only thing that sucks is any 60 spells are hard to find in the bazaar, I don't think as many people are hitting Velious anymore.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I have seen Quiescence for only 20K in the bazaar<br />

Torpor/Malo are dropping quite often in ChardokB. The prices for both are way down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've been down there for a long time now and have yet to see either spell drop. VoB dropped the 2nd or 3rd day but that's the only shaman spell so far. I could wallpaper my house with banishment. winds of tash and a variety of other non shaman spells.... <br />
<br />
Is there a particular area you're seeing them drop? We've been in every part of the zone with the exception of Korucust's room (except to help on CR's). The best spell drop area seems to be at the exit behind the castle where the golem quest originates. The rabids there are still yellow at 62 so I'm hoping it's just been bad luck so far. <br />
<br />
Anyway, any help on the area would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I was told this was what was happening in serverwide chat when I commented that the prices had dropped a lot. Maybe try posting in the 60-65 forum if you want to find out which mobs are dropping them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Damnit! HoB is pretty much empty on BB, I have been there quite a bit (As is apperent by my Magelo) and havent seen Topor, Did get Malo and Pox while down there though.<br />
<br />
I have NEVER seen Topor in the bazaar on BB, guildies have seen it though for 45k at the lowest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Malo - Xev - less than 15k<br />
<br />
Had mine for ages, but still.... IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME!  Kudos, Sony.  If they do nothing but fix malo/torpor drops... that's enough.<br />
<br />
(malo MUST be dropping like candy, or else that rat bastard may he burn in hell Stilgar would've bought all copies and maked them back up to 80k again.  I hope that guy gets leprosy IRL)</div></div><hr />
