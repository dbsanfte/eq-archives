<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have the updated Shissar Ring and Quickbuff 3 and the cast time is for Regen is 3 sec from 6 sec normal.  Seems to me that they are not stacking which is kinda lame considering the amount of AA points ppl put into Quickbuff considering the ludicrious casting time of some of our buffs.<br />
<br />
Also I have a Spell Haste 3 Item but with QB3 and it Torpor is only 3 sec cast time from 6 sec.  With the summoned Mage ring it was 2.1 sec whats the deal with that?<br />
<br />
Making us spend 18 AA points to get our insame casting time spells have reasonalbe casting times is bad enuff now they dont stack with the new focus items??  Just another slap in the face by Verant as bad as avatar on melee weapons.  I really hope this is an oversight and not intentional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Max spell haste has been capped at 50%. <br />
In other words, if you have Quickbuff 3, there's no way you will be able to lower the cast time on spells which are affected by this ability through any kind of focus item any further, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Before yesterday's patch I was starting to cast spells with over half the cast time gone, I don't know if it was a bug or not. I lost the spell haste 3 effect so I cant tell today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">also, all the info i have seen from casters realm says that while they reduce casting time, nothing reduces it below 3 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Talisman of the Brute goes from 5 sec normal ti 2.5 sec and the Shissar ring glows but again seems as if ring not having any effect.<br />
<br />
If they gunna leave this as is, they really need to change QuickBuff to cost less AA points since Lvs 1 and 2 are totally worthless with Torpor being the only exception.  And while we cast Torpor a whole lot 9 pontis to imporve the casting time on a single spell is a bit gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Enhancement Haste &gt;&gt;+ 30% Spell Haste&gt;&gt; Beneficial Spells Only &gt;&gt;Min Cast Time: 3 sec &gt;&gt; Min Duration: 72 sec <br />
<br />
so it don't work on topor,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mage ring used to bring Torpor down to 2.1 seconds(wuth QBIII). It doesn't anymore. Spell haste is capped at 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow....I wanted to work on quickbuff for the 3.0 second torpor...but that is a LOT of points for just one spell! (I have the quickbuff III focus item).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">its all nerfed .. torpors at 2.1 was so nice .. but now its gone ... <br />
<br />
/cry <br />
<br />
almost as bad as when then nerfed JBB crits ... <br />
<br />
on a good note ... to keep myself sain im going for &quot;Innate Metabolism&quot;  ... if they find a way to nerf this ... ill be truely impressed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think its hefty, but still worth it to upgrade torpor only to 3.0. we cast that so much on ourselves, and its great to be able to fire off a bunch at once and torp up a group in trouble (being slowed better than dying)</div></div><hr />
