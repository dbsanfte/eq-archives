<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PaabloEscobar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to say lvl 66 Barb Shaman Paablo Escobar ( yeah the eq name nazis haven't got me yet) Saryrn Server<br />
<br />
I have been grinding aa b/c of high aa requirements of most of the guilds on my server.  Currently I have about 100 aa and was wondering if anyone had some suggestions on what to spend my next 50 on.<br />
<br />
Currently I have<br />
<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
Canni V<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
Mental Clairty 3<br />
MGB<br />
Spirit Call 1<br />
Planar Power 1<br />
any help suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also I'm a group player rarely ever solo and also don't pvp much.  Looking for most beneficial group aa / raid aa or ones that just save my butt when shiat goes down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're trying to apply to a guild with strict AA requirements, go healing AAs next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14626 has the opinions of the community.<br />
<br />
Also see what the requirements of the guild that you wish to join are. They probably desire MGB, (skip this one), maybe Ancestral Aid. They'll probably want you to have Blood of Nadox, Remove Greater Curse and Malos in your spellbook as well.<br />
<br />
ps, personally, I recommend that you get Lightning Reflexes 5 and Virulent Paralysis 3, regardless of how/where you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Finish up your defensive AAs first, especially Lightning Reflexes.  <br />
<br />
If you are def. joining one of the higher end guilds, you will want to finishup planar power soon rather than later too since it will increase your hps slightly cause of higher stamima cap.<br />
<br />
I would prob get Spell Casting Subltety 1 - 3 next.  It's still debatable on the effect of this but it's something that I think that I still notice a huge difference when slowing mobs.  Maybe not always on dots, but at least on slows.<br />
<br />
Oh.. don't forget the healing AAs and Quick Buff as soon as possible too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PaabloEscobar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also got the healing boon 1 and plan on getting healing boon 3 when I get the appropriate lvl.  Are the healing adept etc. really worth it w/ our junky direct heals? and why quick buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quick buff (i think most people woudl say QB2 with a buff haste item) is your your torpor/Q and just to speed up casting of buffs in genral. Get the LR5 becouse even gewtting one or 2 more misses out of 10 agains 1k hittiers might save you from a dirt nap. also dependign on your guild thay may require (or give bonus points in there loot system) that you have the resist AA's maxed (for a total of 30 to each resist or equal to a nice peice of gear). planer power is also something to look in to. if you get in a higher end guild you will be hitting caps on stats fairly soon. also with omens almost all the higher end guild have basicly stated that thay want there members to be 70 asap even some put time limits on it.<br />
<br />
So iinecess what i am saying is look at your guild you want to app to or look at 3 or 4 of them and try and find common ground to work twoards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unless you plan to raid exclusively, get VP3 befor anything else. ... it really is that good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would say do the healing AA's next.  Having Healing Adepts w/ Advanced Healing Adept and Healing Gift w/ Advanced Healing gift makes a huge difference in your ability to move from a group slower to a slower and healer.  I have Daluda's Mending and routinely land heals for 2100ish+ w/ just Marr's Gift effect.  Once you get 68 and have Yoppa's, you will be able to land crit heals for 5k+.  That makes a big difference in a group as primary healer.<br />
<br />
Sammana, I have to disagree with RC6.  Honestly I have yet to find a reason to train them.  Just about any encounter you need a better grp cure then RC1 can provide, you will end up using Blood of Nadox.  RC6 only removes 25 counters and during encounters where the AE has a excessive amount of counters to be removed, it is normally 30+, so RC6 is useless.  As to actual spells, Malos is cheap and BoNadox is a simple quest, just takes time.  RGC though, well, find a a few friends and plant a spotter alt in Ssra outside Rhag1's room and camp him for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I respect that; my current guild has no requirements at all (and, unfortunately, no targets at all... but anyway) but I think that you're right; RC3 won't cure a damn AE that RC1 won't cure, and RC4 will take care of the rest of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definetly get LR5, RC3, AHA3 and AHG3, PP5. I've HAM/HAG1 and I'll occasionally crit daluda's for 5k+. Off the top of my head dosen't RC3 refresh faster than RC1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">disease root, get it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Off the top of my head dosen't RC3 refresh faster than RC1?<br />
<br />
Nah, refresh time is the same unless you get the GoD AA Hastened Curing (ton of AAs to shave off like 20 seconds, I got the first level while dealing with the hell that was the Rathe Council event).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I also got the healing boon 1 and plan on getting healing boon 3 when I get the appropriate lvl.  Are the healing adept etc. really worth it w/ our junky direct heals? and why quick buff?<br />
<br />
I currently have AHA2 &amp; IH4 (Ornate Sleeves) . . . my Tnargs ranges from 1550-1750 HP.<br />
<br />
Yea, I think AHA &amp; AHAM will be worth it.<br />
<br />
QB reduces casting time on our HoT spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are looking into a raiding guild, the AAs I would recommend you work on are as follows:<br />
<br />
This list is in no particular order.<br />
<br />
1. Healing:  Healing Adept, Advanced Healing Adept, Healing Gift, and Advanced Healing Gift.  I tend to work on the Adept line first because you see the return on your investment immediately.<br />
<br />
Reason:  On raids, do not be surprised if you are required to patch heal.  Once debuffs are done, I usually go into healer mode.  A lot of times I am the main healer in my raid group, and it helps to have these AAs to extend or enhance our weak  fast heals.<br />
<br />
2. RC:  I would work towards purchasing RC3<br />
<br />
Reason:  RC3 is a handy tool to have.  I use it constantly in a raid or xp setting.<br />
<br />
3. Defense:  Lightning Reflexes, Innate Defense<br />
<br />
Reason: Survivability.  LR line will help your avoidance.  In the early stages, you will not see a huge return if you primarily xp in PoP zones, but once you have LR 5, wow, like night and day - my opinion of course.  ID line helps with melee damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
4. Planer Power: Depending on how your attributes are, you might want to finish this.  As you earn better gear, you will most likely want to re-visit this AA.<br />
<br />
5.  Resists:  I think a lot of people overlook resists.  Higher resists mean higher survivability.  Work on these once your core ( defense and healing ) aa's are completed.<br />
<br />
6.  VP:  VP is nice for crunch cc'ing or soloing.  I tend to use this AA a lot.<br />
<br />
7.  Quick Buff:  Depending if you have spell haste, some people only get 2 ranks of this. (I got all three ranks eventhough I had a spell haste item )  This AA helps reduce the cast time our Torpor line of spells as well as other benefical spells.  Max rank is 50% spell haste for benefical spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">7.  Quick Buff:  Depending if you have spell haste, some people only get 2 ranks of this.

Max rank is 50% spell haste for benefical spells.<br />
Clarification: Quick Buff only works on 'buffs', not all beneficial spells. Any spell that doesn't grant a buff icon (spot heal, gate) will not benefit - but they will benefit from a Spell Haste effect. This is why most people shoot for at least Spell Haste IV (15% to all beneficial spells) and QuickBuff 2 (25% to all buffs), for a combined effect of 45% to buffs and 15% to non-buff beneficial. <br />
<br />
And spell haste is capped at 50% for any spells, and only applies to spells with base cast time of 3 seconds or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Duration is the key to QB.  If the spell has a duration, QB kicks in.  No duration, no QB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PaabloEscobar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">VP question is it really that good that I should train it immediatly or should I go w/ the LR 5?  Also before I had SCRM my quies lasted 30 seconds w/ just SCM 3 now it lasts 30 seconds w/ SCRM /shrug thought it was supposed to add another tick, how long does everyone elses last w/ scrm and scm 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Virulent paralysis is very nice. Get it asap. Get at least level 2, and ideally level 3 (with insid decay it will almost always last longer than the refresh time).<br />
<br />
Then get Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

What does RC3 cure that RC1 wont though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What does RC3 cure that RC1 wont though.<br />
Not much, if anything. RC4, on the other hand, will clear up some PoFire AEs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">max your CHA ~~~<br />
<br />
there is more opinions here then people hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">With RC 3, you have 6 chances to remove detrimental effects ( effects that do not have counters ) compared to only 1 chance with RC 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would also agree with the Virulent Paralysis suggestion.  This is an extremely handy AA to have.  I think the next thing I would get is Quick Buff 2.  Then its a toss up between the healing and defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
-G</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">VP is my absolute favorite AA after canni5.  Now that I have it, I feel crippled anywhere that it's not reliably useful.  (disease resist means not very good versus undead.)</div></div><hr />
