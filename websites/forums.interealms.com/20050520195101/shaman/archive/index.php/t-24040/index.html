<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Either by glitch or Sony Suprise, I as a 66 shaman was able to slow an archaic Model in Plane of Innovation tonight. Previously unslowable, and unslowable to the chanter in the group, it went off without a hitch. If I hadn't been half asleep in the first place, I would have never attempted to slow it anyway.<br />
<br />
Did Sony unNerf some slow immune mobs, or is it a perk of being 66?<br />
<br />
My guess is it's a glitch. Likely I shouldn't have posted it publicly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that last patch did something to resists and immunitites/mitigations.  A lot more mobs in OoW were fully slowable that were not previously.  I've had resist problems though in xp/raid mobs in PoE and PoF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, just about every normal mob and most non raid named mobs in Ruined City of Dranik are fully slowable now. Don't think they changed anything in GoD, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've noticed several mobs could be slowed that I though, or others thought, were previously immune. For example the final mite in the first sewer trial. They seemed to change it on several one group mobs a little while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">on 9/19/04  my guild did the Bertoxx event for backflagging.  Every King and Bert himself were slowable.  I don't even think they mitigated (maybe 'mostly').  Used to be only 5 of the 13 were slowable.<br />
<br />
Appears that SOE went through PoP and removed a lot of 'slow immune' flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pretty nice if they did... Not to be a pessimist though I'd be surprised if this wasn't like the monk fd bug that let them clear aggro on fd for about 3 days.... <br />
<br />
They'll probably emergency patch it as soon as they figured out what happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brihanna Iceravyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was doing minis in Water with my guild the other day on the way to Coirnav and Mighty was slowable...I always try to slow things cuz I personally never remember what's immune and what isn't but I knew 1 water mini wasn't.  All of them were this time.  Wonder if they removed the immune flag from the one in Fire too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, this worries me. To have so much sunndely not immune from slow and so much not mitigating slow, it makes me think that the either did it on accident or over did it. Either way, i think i hear the tweak bat whistling in the air already :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mobs in MPG went from all being partial to about 50-60% not mitigating slow at all. I'm pretty sure they upped the attack/dps of mobs at the same time to nearer KT trash levels.<br />
<br />
I think this was because groups were just taking a cleric and ditching slowers in favour of dps as mobs had relatively low unslowed DPS compared to say KT/ikk mobs, but 50-100% more hp.<br />
<br />
So I wouldn't worry Lit, just roll with it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guild raided PoF tonight so tried slow on magmaton came back as mostly slowed.  Hope this isn't a mistake and they leave it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i kinda bet thats a mistake and will be fixed soon.<br />
<br />
there is imo no real reason to do that, so don't shout nerf once they return it again pls  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I actually noticed this a while back. I believe it was the day oow went live, but in the Fire trial in PoTime there are adds that were previously flagged immune and every single one can be slowed now. I was shocked and I can't believe so many of these others can be slowed now too. Good for us :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A shaman in the crucible channel mentioned last night, that the mobs on the way to TT were slowable (although I think they said they mitigated). Everytime I remember going on that raid with my shaman, I remember sticking to Malosing and nuking, maybe casting FA on a rogue here and there. Felt kinda worthless not being able to slow (although the mobs do go down pretty quick).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeh its SOE way of fixing the shaman<br />
<br />
---&gt; migration in these mobs is hurting the shaman's<br />
---&gt; Brainstorming session how are we going to stop this<br />
<br />
---&gt;Idea lets remove migration from various mobs<br />
<br />
In reality this was a bone thrown in our direction so don't complain about it they will prob change it back again soon</div></div><hr />

You bet... your opinion... so no one disagreee?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If they only removed slow immunities or mitigation, it will only make PoP more trivial. Mitigation was a good way to fix the slow issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Are these slow changes across all shaman levels, or are they only happening once we hit 66+? it could be that they have set things so that level is once again making things easier to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I slowed an archaic model yesterday at 65, so it's more than likely an across the board thing.  <br />
<br />
Think I'll try and slow Vindi tonight and see if I can 2-Box him now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I slowed an archaic model yesterday at 65, so it's more than likely an across the board thing.  <br />

<br />
<br />
haha, definetly. That would be worth re-installing to do that. I always wanted a vindi for my SK lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They still tunning this probably if its not just a flat out mistake. I coulds sword that Monday night I was able to fully slow everything in the dranik scar hive instance. Last night the rats and bats were partial though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i find it interesting the enchanter wasn't able to slow it <br />
<br />
could this be a shaman specific resistance to slow mitigation or immunity ?<br />
<br />
come on you BSTs and enchanters and bards .. what say you ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I slowed an archaic model yesterday at 65, so it's more than likely an across the board thing.  <br />

<br />
Vindi was still unslowable last 2 times we fought him...both after 9/18/04 (when I noticed Bert and friends were slowable).</div></div><hr />
