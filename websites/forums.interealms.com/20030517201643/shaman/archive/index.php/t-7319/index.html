<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will ding 57 this weekend.  I really dont' understand how the Aa system works.  I undersatnd there are some for lv 50, 55, and 59.  But can someone explain the points?  At lv 50 AA how many points can I put in to regen.  And do I get 1 point per AA  ding?  And can I still do regen even though im 57?   One last thing.  What do u recomend?  Regen, calrity, and Cana seem the most obviouse root to take.  Thanks for the help!<br />

<br />
You can put a percentage - or all - of your xp into AA xp. This is a seperate pool from regular xp, and has a yellow bar just like regular xp which must be filled. I've been told AA is like level 45, but it always seems a bit higher than that to me. So to get a single AA point you have to &quot;redo&quot; level 45 in essence.<br />
<br />
Each time you fill it, you get a &quot;ding&quot;, only it's an AA ding and you're informed that you have a new AA point to spend. Like leveling, the yellow bar resets to 0, and it's time to grind again.<br />
<br />
You store AA points, until you choose to spend them. There are 4 tiers to AA points - General, which you can start spending in at 51, Priest, which starts at 56 I believe, and Shaman which you do at 59, and then Planar AA which I think is 60? I don't really know much about that. In addition to the level requirement, you must have 6 points in General to buy any Priest, 12 points in Priest to buy any Shaman specific aaxp, and then 24 shaman points to buy Planar. Or so I believe.<br />
<br />
There are different abilities at each level. For instance, natural regen is a general ability, so you can buy all 5 points in it as soon as you reach 51, provided you have the aaxp points. But in order to buy mental clarity, which is a priest archetype, you need 56 and 6 points anywhere in general.<br />
<br />
Does this make sense? :)<br />
<br />
Just think of it as buying ala-carte, with certain tiers, and you'll see how it works. I hope :)</div></div><hr />
