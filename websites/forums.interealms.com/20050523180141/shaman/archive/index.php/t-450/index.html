<br />
I got 200 votes:  Thanks everyone I think this has been really interesting to see where Shaman are in their lives.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW there is no way I can fit in every possibility:  I was going to add martian/space alien but I thought it would get way to many votes<br />
<br />
Soupy: You are just a Dink which is a lot closer to bachelor than family man (ask anyone with kids)<br />
<br />
Engaged:  Well thats closer to family man than bachelor cause you have to act good all the time so you won't get your but dumped.<br />
<br />
House:  Dang which prison lets you play computer games?  Never mind can you imagine how many junkies might start commiting crime just so they have free room and board and get to play EQ all the time?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, thanks everyone for responding to the poll.  I have also enjoyed the comments :).</div></div><hr />

I was a DINK for 13 years.  Berserker is so on target.  The last few years before we had children I spent most of my time at my favorite bar (two blocks from my house) The Empty Glass.  http://www.emptyglass.com/  drinking and playing music.  I was in the Tuesday night house band 1995-96.<br />
<br />
Now with two small children, if it was not for EQ and online gaming I would have no social contact at all other than talking to the folks (English professors, like they understand online gaming) at work.<br />
<br />
Fun poll<br />

Faern, i have the MCSE, A+, and N+... MCSE lotta people have, and A+ and N+ are simply foundation information.  at some point i want to learn Unix VERY well.  unix and linux administrators make a TON of money.  end users and a lot of corporations use microsoft, so thats probably worth it if you have the time and or money, but i would say cisco and unix are the way to go for the current IT atmosphere.</div></div><hr />
