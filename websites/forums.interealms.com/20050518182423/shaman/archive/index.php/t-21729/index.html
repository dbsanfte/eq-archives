<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I took a look at the shaman parse a few weeks ago and found it interesting but frankly thought it was not representative of how I play my shaman.  So I downloaded the EQLS program and it works like a charm, I highly recommend it to everyone.  The following is an edited spell parse taking out buffing and utility spells like invis, etc.  Playing was normal and hard LDON, Vxed in GOD and probably 20% raiding.  I'm posting just as a FYI in case some might find this interesting.<br />
<br />
Results of note are 2.5 times the casting of canny4 compared to turgur's which I thought was about right compared to the post a few weeks ago that had it 1/1  (I am a lizzy with max regen and max ft).  I was also surprised that spear of torment stuck so well with only a 2.4% resist rate. With a 14.8% crit rate, improved damage IV item and the mana savings from my ornate gloves I continue to believe that this is a good spell. I do wish, though, that there was a poison focus item similar to the cold one to punch up the damage. I was also surprised that I channeled as much as I got interrupted so those aa's really do work I guess (I have the first 3 pre GOD). <br />
<br />
The turgur's resist rate of 19.6% is better than I expected overall and most of the resists come in normal LDON where I dont malos. I got very few resists in hard LDON or GOD after casting malos (I'm guessing less than 5% which I am very pleased with).<br />
  <br />
Lastly, I cast Quiescence as much as turgur's and 4.45 times as much as Tnarg's.  I find shaman quick healing so light and mana inefficient (and I have all healing aa's) that it is truely situational and I really only use it on raids for my group melee, to spam heal the tank on GOD named or for emergencies.  As all shaman know there is no way on god's green earth that we could heal in GOD or even suppliment a druid which I think is the real crux of the situation (clerics are manditory again).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not seeing any &quot;Immune&quot; here . . . was that thrown in with Resisted ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, the parser calls it couldn't take hold and it's 123 but that # is too high because my guild tried some new mobs and didn't know if they were slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for the clarification, I was really not trying to harass you, just trying to put some sort of idea in my mind as to what was happening.<br />
<br />
So . . . in 1323 casts of Slow . . . 491 were either mitigated to some extent or immune.  That to me is a scary number.<br />
<br />
37% of the mobs faced either mitigate or are immune to slow in this seemingly balanced look at mobs of different zones / encounter types.<br />
<br />
Ouch.</div></div><hr />
