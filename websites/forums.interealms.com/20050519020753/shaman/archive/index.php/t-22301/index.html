<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I remeber hearing about a new policy where bodies no longer rot if you dont get them within 7 day's, a friend has lost his body, can anybody tell me if this is true and if so where do the bodies go so we cna get his back?  Thank you all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its true<br />
<br />
rotted corpses go to a zone called shadowrest<br />
<br />
there is an npc in pok near the bank that will port you there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a few others as well.  I know there is also a female DE NCP in the EC tunnel that will assist you to Shadowrest (shes a surly tart though).  I thought that there were aslo about 3 more; if I get motivated I'll dig through some patch messages and find more.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
<br />
Well, the coffee is good today, so Im feeling motivated.<br />
Shadowrest assistants may be found in the following zones:<br />
<br />
East Commonlands<br />
The Plane of Knowledge<br />
Toxxulia Forest<br />
Qeynos Hills<br />
The Feerrott<br />
Butcherblock Mountains<br />
The Field of Bone<br />
Shadeweavers Thicket<br />
Misty Thicket<br />
<br />
Many more than I had originally thought.  Im kinda wanting to let a corpse rot just so I can have a chance to check it out.  Will take a week though...bleh.  I hate waiting.</div></div><hr />

Make a new character and let him get killed in a humerous manner, and then play your main for a week and check out your new character in Shadow haven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't need to die to go to ShadowRest.  Right after it went to live servers, I made a visit with the chick in PoK thattakes ya there and se took me there to explore some. You hafta hail a guy in there fer yer body though. Butyah, dont need todie to look aroun dthe zone, unless that got changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you all for the information</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sad in a way when you actually look at Shadowrest its a very atmospheric zone and looks exactly like i would think a place where you would claim a corpse.<br />
Even the little bit of chat when hailing the man with the scythe seems to fit.<br />
Shame SoE didnt put this much effort and thought into designing some of the exp zones.<br />
