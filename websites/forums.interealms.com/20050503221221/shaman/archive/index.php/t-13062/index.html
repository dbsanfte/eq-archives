<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have somehow gotten my hands on enough money to purchase one of the following spells. This is based on prices on my server so please dont try and argue that the spells are not close in price, because they are on my server. Keep in mind I am a level 61 shaman with Khuras Focus being the only useful 60 spell in my posession.<br />
<br />
I can buy:<br />
<br />
Malo<br />
Malos<br />
Quiescence<br />
Avatar/Primal Av<br />
Ferine Ava<br />
<br />
I cannot purchase Torpor, it is still far far more expensive than the others. I do equal amounts of exping, soloing, and raiding. I have been flagged for BoT just recently, so getting Runes is NOT out of the question, as my guild does do nameds in BoT from time to time, although not commonly enough to say I would get my grubby fingers on a rune any time soon.<br />
<br />
So my dilemma is this. 65 is really not that far away considering my flags, so I have no idea what spell to get, or if I should hoard the money and count on runes for the spells. I need advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Knee-jerk reaction?<br />
<br />
Malo.  It is useful NOW, and will continue to be worth it until you get Malos at 65.  Don't wait 4 levels (and a bunch of AA) to get an unresistable debuff.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Left some words out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buy whichever spell you want!<br />
<br />
It's all about your situation.  Are you the &quot;main shaman&quot; in your guild?  Then you might wanna go with Malo/Malos to help on raids.  Are you a mana-munching machine who barely survives on Stoicism, or perhaps you're depended on for heals more than the typical shaman?  Maybe you want Quint.  Do you 2-box a melee type a good majority of the time?  Perhaps Ferine Avatar would be a good choice.  <br />
<br />
Whatever suits your play style the most.  I myself went straight after Malo and Torpor when I hit 60.  Sold everything of value that I had to get the cash for them (got lucky and got an emp-drop of torpor, though).  Why?  Because I wanted to step up into a bigger role on raids.  I pretty much gave away a lot of solo-ability by passing on Pox, and selling my JBB and Fungi to go after what I believed would be the 2 spells that would make the most impact in the 60+ game for a defensive-style shaman.  <br />
<br />
It's your choice, but good luck on your endevours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you 2-box a melee type a good majority of the time?  Perhaps Ferine Avatar would be a good choice.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If he runs around duo with a melee a lot, Quies &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ferine<br />
<br />
I'd grab Q myself, it's my favorite at the moment, though if you're in a guild that raids and other shm don't have malo/s either I recommend grabbing one of those</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay, thank you all for your input but there's kind of been a change of plans.<br />
<br />
from what I have heard there is only one single place in all of norrath where level 60 spells drop consistantly... Veeshans Peak. My guild and my ex guild (which I left on good relations with so I still raid with them) both either raid VP habitually or plan to soon as soon as more people get keyed. So, my plan is to get my VP key, raid it and get Malo (possibly torpor although from what I've heard Malo drops fairly often while Torpor has yet to drop in their raids so its probably rare as hell in there too). Then I'll take my money and either purchase Quiesce when I reach 65, or just blow it on equip uprades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would take Quiescence. It is by far the best spell of them. Malos are great but Q makes you live longer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VP?  You interested in a 6-month quest for that key?  It's even worse than VT....   Don't go there, it's boring past the first raid and the armor drops aren't worth the time it took you to get that key.  That plus the fact that you won't GET there without Malo.....  :)<br />
<br />
On that list, Forget Avatar (Emerald is too expensive) and PA (it's nodrop from ST).<br />
Also, forget Malos (the little extra debuff isn't worth waiting 4 levels)<br />
<br />
Buy Malo<br />
<br />
And if you want your spells, spend your time on level 60 guardian wurms in SF, Sebilis Emp and Juggs (near Trak only) and ST Key dragons...  We've gotten SO MANY Torpor's out of Sonta and Malo's out of Klandi (supplied almost all the Shammy's that are/were in our guild with both)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of the 65 spells, Quiescence is definitely the best.  But, you don't have malo, and I find it's really necessary for exp'ing in bot/tactics/etc.  Too many resists and slow and you're toast.  If you can get malo in a guild raid soon, save for Q.  If not, you may just want to buy malos and level to 65 quickly.  No sense buying malo and then being level 65 in a few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since getting Torpor I cast it almost as much as canni.  I use it to recover mana, to tank PoP mobs when I solo or in groups, I use it to heal casters and melee's between pulls, I even use it on my pet.<br />
<br />
My vote is for 'Q'..or torpor if you can find it.   If your guild does VP and other high-end content so often, perhaps you can pick up the research parts for it easier.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You interested in a 6-month quest for that key?<br />
<br />
LOL. Try a week if you know what you are doing. Think it took me 2 weeks to get my key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Malo/Malos would be damn handy (I dont know what I'd do without malo) but if I had a choice I would pick Torpor/Quiescence over it and would rate it the most valuable spell we can acquire.  <br />
<br />
Although I dont think you could go wrong buying Malos either, dont buy malo if you are already close to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If the guild raids a lot, and rarely has a shaman with malo on the raid, then I would buy malo, then Quiesence. For places like HoT, malo is a massive boost. Since I got malo, my guild hardly ever wipes there, 4 adds is not a problem if they are all slowed.<br />
<br />
If you don't raid a lot, or there's normally a shaman with malo on the raids anyway, then I would buy Quiesence for when you hit 65, and then malos as its useful for XP groups too. Feral Avatar would be a close third, it really adds to the DPS hugely.<br />
<br />
The level 60 spells are not reliable enough drops to count on getting them, and the keys to the high-end places like VP, ST, VT etc. are hard enough in their own right. However, if you really want those spells, and the guild needs you to get them, get trackers set up for the Kunark dragons and kill them, they drop the level 60 spells all the time<br />
<br />
I wouldn't bother much with avatar, the recast time is too long for it to be of everyday use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use malo a lot more than I ever thought I would, and a lot more than I did a month ago.  PARTICULARLY around certain candy-assed enchanters who refuse to tash normal tier 2 exp mobs until they're down to 90% health, or lower.<br />
<br />
I find that I can either stand around waiting for tash, watching the rest of the group wondering why this group kills so friggin slowly - or I can land malo before the mob gets to camp, and have it slowed after the first couple of hits.  WELL before tash finally lands.<br />
<br />
What spells will benefit you the most has a lot to do with who you're hunting with (malo is a lot more important in pickup groups than with guildies that you know and trust) and where, than anything else.<br />
<br />
I don't use avatar, and Q is a long way from 61, unless you're a leveling fiend.  If that's the case, I'd say wait and buy Q.  I don't think the price on that spell is going to go UP before you ding 4 times.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Was surprised as hell when Torpor dropped off of Harla Dar this weekend also dropped Voice of the Beserker. This must have been snuck in with one of the recent patches, because I dont recall Kunark era spells dropping from WW dragons in the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kamorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Definately Quinn, then level your ass off to 65.  If not quinn, then malos.  Don't spend all your money on a level 60 spell like malo that you will be replacing in a month or two.  Buy a spell that you will use forever.  Also, you listed primal avatar in your list of spells available to you.  The PA scroll is no-drop from sleeper's tomb, so you can't buy it.  And the normal level 60 avatar is worthless.  Ferine is a good spell but nowhere near as good as quinn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd go malo all the way, in BoT or similar pre-slow malo is a must if you don't want to find out how long it takes an unslowed giant, who doubles 500's, to convert you into shaman mush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hard call between malo and quin.  Once you get Malo, it's really not necessary to get Malos at all.  But having one or the other is a big deal.  <br />
<br />
I'd be inclined to get Quin and wait if I were you.  <br />
<br />
It's a no-lose scenario really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There are two spells that are pivotal to post 60 shaman work, Malo and Torpor.  Malos and Quiescence are better than these two, with Q being MUCH better than Torpor in terms of utility.  For instance, you would never drop Torpor on a melee or a tank, it's basically a self heal.  But You can feel free to drop a Q on a melee ANY TIME you want to!  And it makes a big difference in their tanking abilities.  With a good tank in a place like BoT, if I keep him in a state of Quiescence, he doesn't need more healing than that, or not much more healing.  This is a MAJOR upgrade from our mini-CH spam we used to have to do.  Q is a lot cheaper, affected by AA and focus effects, and heals over time rather than at one shot.  I use Q and Tnargs Mending when I am healing tanks.  Before, when I just had Torpor, I had to use Khura's Mending but now I almost never mem that spell.  <br />
Malo/Malos is also very vital.  If you can get Malo, you can probably do ok.  I only have Malo and I've been 65 for like 4 months now.  I do just fine with it really.  But if you think you might get it from VP raid or whatever, try to get it that way and buy Q.  <br />
Don't bother with Torpor, once you get Q it's completely obsolete.  I have my copy of Torpor on page 29, with spirit of the snake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There are two spells that are pivotal to post 60 shaman work, Malo and Torpor.  <br />
<br />
<br />
DAMN it!  Land told ME that the two pivotal spells were True North and Charm Animals (I haven't killed too many gods with those two yet, but I'm trying!)    ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">VP?  You interested in a 6-month quest for that key?  It's even worse than VT....

<br />
<br />
all but two steps of the VP key are easily soloable (KC Kylong, and Trakanon). My guild regularly raids for Trak Teeth. I do not have one, but they are awarded based on progression through quest. So if I start the quest, I can easily finish it. THe only thing that frightens me really is the Pained Soul camp, but even that doesn't sound too bad...<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you want your spells, spend your time on level 60 guardian wurms in SF, Sebilis Emp and Juggs (near Trak only) and ST Key dragons...  We've gotten SO MANY Torpor's out of Sonta and Malo's out of Klandi (supplied almost all the Shammy's that are/were in our guild with both)<br />
<br />
Believe me, I've killed tons of those things, and nothing has ever dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Believe me, I've killed tons of those things, and nothing has ever dropped.<br />
<br />
Something's not making sense here...  If you've killed tons of Sonta's and Klandi's, then why are you looking for PA (you should be getting tons of those from ST).  And the problem with the spell drops off those two dragons is, you need the spell.  If you don't, they drop like candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gwurms and Emp Chottal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Firstly, another big vote for Quiescence here. Just buy it. In the time it would take to do your VP key, you could buy Q and gimp your way to 65 killing trash in PoV.<br />
<br />
Also, i solo'ed all of my VP key except for Trak, and the niblik rat in chardok (a monk faction pulled him for me and a friend). <br />
<br />
The KC skelly is a fun solo (I did it at 60 with no malo/torpor but had JBB/epic/fungi), and pops fairly often. I saved this camp to last as it gives ok xp at 60. <br />
Pained soul isnt too bad; just kill PH, then kill frogs in seb for 20mins, then zone/gate back and check.<br />
<br />
The kylong thing in FV is a pain, I just left my druid camped on the hill near the drovlag cave, and swept the zone now and then.<br />
<br />
The worst one was the bloody skeleton in DL. took all afternoon one rainy sunday ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I started my VP mainly to get malo/torpor from VP; by the time I did Trak part i had malo and Torpor scribed, and never went there in the end ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The reason I bring up ST, is that you need at least 90% of your melees to have primals to succeed in VP.  It may be easier now if you have AM3 Rangers and level 65 monks/rogues, but I wouldn't count on it.  VP is all about dedication...  The key quest is about long boring camps that EVERYONE must complete and then you start a crawl that lasts 8 - 14 hours, without a break.  That's a lot for slightly better armor and good level 60 spell drops.  Without Malo, you'll have serious problems in there anyway...<br />
<br />
ST is your key.  By the time you have enough keys for your guild to take down the bosses in there, you'll probably have your level 60 spells.  Problem solved.<br />
<br />
P.S. Save your strength for the VT key.  Verant is slowly nerfing it and slowing us down (I.E. the AC nerf).  Who knows what's next, making the items summoned by the Emp's Scepter Norent?  If that were the case, you'd not dare kill him until you had 20 people ready to hit combine on your VT key...  And I'm surprised it hasn't happened already...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heck, the few times I've been in VP, no melee had primals.<br />
<br />
You just need nukers in VP.  The dragons have 32k hp and it's just a matter of blasting them down.  Nowadays, VP encounters should be fairly trivial for PoP guilds - but it's still a PITA zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The reason I bring up ST, is that you need at least 90% of your melees to have primals to succeed in VP.

<br />
<br />
Not at all.  We do VP fairly regularly, and have never been to ST.  The last time we only had about 25 people.  It took us about 4 hours to kill all the named dragons, and the longest wait was at the start, waiting for Silver &amp; Hosh to path right.<br />
<br />
Also, Torpor has dropped a good half dozen times for us in there.  Don't forget, Veksar will be going in sometime, and should (hopefully) be dropping high level Kunark spells.<br />
<br />
I'd toss my vote in for Quiescence, then go full xp until you can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Malo is a common drop it seems on TT server. We had a Scar Dragon raid the other day and Harla Dar is who you should have your guild killed. This little beast dropped Malo, Torpor, and Pox in one kill. Easy fight, also just get a groupo and go do Juggs, or Gaurdian Wurms near VP ent and you should get what you need. Also with the spells being able to be researched I would check the bazaar for the components to get some. I had a friend research Malo for me after the Harla kill and it only cost me about 1.5k for all the items. Research and hit Seb..  IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Uh vp was around long before anyone had ever heard of primal weapons.  I am pretty sure you need 0% of your melle to have primals if you want to be successful in VP.  The key is a pita, but not a 6 month quest by any stretch of the imagination.</div></div><hr />
