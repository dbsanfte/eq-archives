<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Fungi, along with JBB, dino, and Stocism. Should I sell my fungi and get some Tae Ew?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm normally once you are Level 60 and have Torpor you can safely sell the Fungi to upgrade other slots.<br />
And once you get level 61 you can buy the 25/hp tick regen spell from a vendor anyway....<br />
<br />
I guess you could use Stoicism though its not as efficient as Torpor (probably 1/2 as efficient once you faction in the reduced hp to mana ratio for the earlier cana's).<br />
<br />
Also once you do get closer to 60 you might have to sell the Fungi to get Torpor and Malo, etc... though new spell research copies may have filtered into circulation by then.<br />
<br />
Levels &gt; worrying about gear. Sounds like you are twinked out to the max anyway /lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Minkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply, Zhom. Any second opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It all depends on what you want to do.  I kept my fungi, JBB, and horse through my 50's because I still solo'd some here and there, and they were invaluable tools.  <br />
<br />
Then, I hit 60, and after getting Malo and Torpor, I decided to dedicate myself to being more of a &quot;defensive specialist&quot; shaman for a while.  So I got rid of the JBB, Fungi, and Horse, and focused on grouping for experience.  <br />
<br />
I don't regret it one bit now, but that's because I've put the solo game on hold for a while.  If you plan on soloing through your 50's, keep them around until you upgrade your heals, debuffs, and DoT's.</div></div><hr />
