<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a repost of a repost from my guild boards. Two of the paladins in my guild claim that this works. The others were not on last night to ask.<br />
<br />
There is a &quot;fix&quot; for the borked Paladin DPS. This was found and tested by friends in my guild on Warsong.<br />
<br />
Remove all of your gear (ie strip nekkid) and logout.<br />
Log back in and re-dress yourself.<br />
<br />
The level 49 Paladin that tested the &quot;fix&quot; last night, had a totally borked DPS with sub-300 dmg crits, thanks to that Paladin &quot;adjustment&quot; patch. Last night, after doing this &quot;fix&quot;, his DPS was back up to previous levels and crits were landing for up to 1200 dmg.<br />
<br />
I know a few of you play paladins. I thought I'd offer this up and see if it helps. With apologies to Mill - hey if it works at least they might fight back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A better fix is to roll a dps class.  When priests do 3-4x your dps, you know you picked the wrong class in a dps &gt; all game.</div></div><hr />

Did I miss the post where I stated that I care at all about PVP? I'm still waiting for them to release a no PVP server so I can switch to it.</div></div><hr />

TRANSLATION: Priest class is perfectly balanced because I can easily kill it with my two-button two-step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The DPS stealth nerf is very real. I suffer from it, and the &quot;fix&quot; didn't work for me. Average hit for me (lvl 57) against lvl 53-52 mobs is 120-170, crits are abit over 300. Considering that I'm swinging a 2hander that tooltips for 240-300 without buffs, I'm working as intended.<br />
<br />
The misconceptions, misrepresentations and blatant slander over the Paladin class is amazing. Ironically I decided to try something different as my main then a Shaman in WoW to get away from this. <br />
<br />
Paladins carry the EQ Shaman curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paladins are the EQ shaman of WoW... at least the class most like EQ Shaman in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Forget most people are carebears, sorry.<br />
