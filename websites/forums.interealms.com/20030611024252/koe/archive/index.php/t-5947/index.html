<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious as to if anyone out there plays the games Warhammer Fantasy or Warhammer 40k?  The ones with the miniatures you paint.<br />
<br />
I used to play Fantasy and just bought a small 40k Ork Boyz army and am thinking about getting a Fantasy army again.  Thought if anyone else played maybe there were some tips or ideas we could exchange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably one of the very few games I have not at least tried and probably never will.. <br />
<br />
It looks like a bit of fun, but it is very, very expensive (too expensive IMHO) and most of the battles I have observed come down to pushing stuff into the middle and hoping for the best. I am afraid I would spend too much time tweaking the rules trying to fix some of the problems I see (biggest of which the field of play rules compared to the size of the army, with their being too many units in too small of a space and thus not much of a chance to manuver much). <br />
<br />
Depending on your budget, the piece of advice I would offer is if you are on a tighter budget, go with a higher point density/higher skill army. This should give you better troops than what the other guy has and you should be able to bring greater pressure to bear at a given point. This also has the added benefit in that since you have fewer pieces, it is cheaper on the pocket book. Part of this is dependant on what you feel comfortable with.. some like to try to swarm the other person under while others feel more comfortable dealing with those swarms with quality. <br />
<br />
Now if you got into Battletech, that would be another matter.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play 40k :).  You can find some really good deals on Ebay.  I paid $100 for $250 worth of models that were sealed.  So you just have to look for the deals.  Yes it can be expensive.  But it is a good hobby for me.  It allows me to really let my sculpting and painting ideas run wild.  I have friends that I play with at least once a month.  We play at Rogue Trader Tourneys.  I got into Warhammer because of the artistry of it and do like it but don't LOVE it if you know what I mean.  Some people forget it is a game at some tourneys.  I have only been in 3 and even though I did get awards at 2 it was fun of playing with some really cool people and seeing cool armies that was the fun part.  To save on money find friends who play and ask them for any unwanted or extra bitz they have.  My new army I've started I saved probably 150 bucks by taking unwanted models off of friends' hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes I played both....I have Chaos and DarkElf Armies for Fantasy, and Eldar and Almost the Whole Dark Angels Chapter for 40K.<br />
<br />
Yes building an army can put a hurting on your pocket book.  Best advice I can give is before you even start building your army, find the one that you feel will be best for your playing style.  Read up on the game and different armies....then build your army on paper, then take that piece of paper down and price your army....I think you will be suprised.:eek: <br />
<br />
Good luck, and if you have any questions ask someone....;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want I can shoot you a copy of Army Builder which will tell you exactly what you can have/need.  Standard is 1500pts Armybuilder cuts a lot of work out of figuring up things.  Only thing is some items it does not equate out as wargear that actually is like gifts of chaos and other items.  The latest patch for it got rid of a lot of errors.  Shoot me a PM or email and I can send you the basic tutorial AB.  Also I see you live in Kansas as do I.  We play a lot in the Overland Park area.  You can check out local Rogue Trader info at www.kcrtt.com Where in Kansas do you live? If it isn't too far from Overland Park or Lenexa I have a group of friends I play with that we would love to have another person to play against/with using 40k.  The Battlezone here has 25% off on all miniatures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play warhammer and 40K.  I have tons of Fantasy armies, but my favorite is my Greater Daemon of Korn Fantasy army and my Goff Orc 40K army.  I love the shock attack gun and how spontanious and hillarious the orcs can be.  It's all luck with the orcs, they either rule the day or die pathetically, makes for enteraining warfaire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Willow:  I've got the 500 pt limit AB you can download from the web right now.  I don't mind printing out 3 sheets to get to 1500 pts.  I am near Wichita so not too close - but once I get into it again and don't play like a moron it might be fun to hit the road and come visit once in a while.<br />
<br />
I played Fantasy last night with a borrowed dark elf army (who can go wrong with topless witches?).  I beat a dwarf army by 600 pts when the game was all over.  Had 3/4 of the table as mine muahaha. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the orcs too -- they are unpredictable, can beat anyone if the day is right and have just as much chance as backfiring and killing your own team as someone else's.  One word - Snotlings!<br />
<br />
Also bought 25 tubes of acrylic paint last night, some primer, and even some glow in the dark paint as my 40k orc army is going to have some unfortunate radioactive accidents happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to play Fantasy back when I lived in Albany (this is some years ago) and I had a pretty impressive Chaos army built up.  (I could easily field 10,000 pts. worth of troops if I needed to.)  I believe they've once again rewritten the rules for a new edition of the game, and it's one of the things I've grown increasingly bothered with by GamesWorkshop -- they typically put a lot of the higher priced models into the obsolence box to force you to buy more with each new edition.<br />
<br />
If you're looking to keep expenses down, I'd suggest Chaos, since the standard foot soldier is about 34 points and the standard chaos cavalry soldier is about 66 points.  Their character models can run from 150 to 500+.  It doesn't take long to get to 1500 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive played 40k for years, I own a moderately sized Chaos and Space Marine force, but my main collection is a huge Eldar Army.  I can pretty much field about anything I want, but for tournements I field mostly Ghost World (Iyaeden) Craftworld and for casual play I field Swordwind (Beil-Tan) army.<br />
<br />
If you want an idea of my force, I can post an army list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Windi and Willow.. any other games you tinker around with? Being relatively new to KC area and smoked with work and the time I devote to EQ, I have not had a chance to scope the local game scene..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm about 250 miles from KC so I don't know what the local gaming scene is there.  Here I sometimes get in on a Vampire or D&amp;D game, maybe some Axis and Allies.  At one time I tried to get to know some of the Wichita gaming people but they seemed to be happy not to really welcome new folks, so now I just play with people I know.  I do know there are tournaments and such around me but I'm not good enough at anything yet to feel comfortable about putting down an entry fee so I can lose :)</div></div><hr />
