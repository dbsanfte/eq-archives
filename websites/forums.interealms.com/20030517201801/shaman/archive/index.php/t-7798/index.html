<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was the main slower for a raid on hate. It was my first time in that position as there are usually older shaman there to do it. Everything was going well until we got the maestro on an over pull and he rampaged and wiped most of the raid party. Then later once we'd take the maestro down we attacked a very unpleasent hand I tried to slow it but ended up getting rampaged on and I bit the dust :eek: <br />
<br />
Now I've just done a search on rampage and found this interesting info from Gresgoth explaining how rampage works<br />
<br />
Rampage is a single target based attack in ADDITION to the normal single target attack of a mob. How does one get Rampaged you ask? Well, it's very simple. The second person to aggro Rampaging_mob01 gets added to the &quot;Rampage List&quot;. Rampaging mobs have 2 aggro type lists. One is normal &quot;aggro list&quot;, and the second is the &quot;rampage list&quot;. If you are the second person to aggro the rampaging mob, your name gets added to the &quot;Rampage list&quot; forever (unless the mob dies). <br />
<br />
Let's give an example: High Priest of Ssraeshza is a rampaging mob. The first person to attack (or cast on) the high priest is immediately added to the aggro list. Now, the next person that aggros him will be put on the &quot;rampage list&quot;. When in melee range, the high priest will attack the first person on his &quot;aggro list&quot;. In addition to the single target attack, when you see the message &quot;High Priest of Ssraeshza goes on a RAMPAGE!&quot;, the first person on the &quot;rampage list&quot; is being attacked. *Note: if the person on the &quot;Rampage list&quot; is out of melee range, the high priest will attack the next person who is in range on the &quot;rampage list&quot;.<br />

<br />
Now having read this I'm not sure what I should do if I get rampaged on? Stand and take it like a man (and die! ;) ) or should i try and back up out of melee range? so that he turns his attention to someone else? <br />
<br />
The last thing I want do is to cause the raid to get wiped by pulling him from the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't remember the Maestro ever rampaging. I've fought him maybe 5 or 6 times. <br />
Only issue I can remember from fighting him (both as a shaman and MT warrior)  is to keep everyone at his back except the MT because of his lifetap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back out of melee range.  If this isn't possible due to mob having a huge melee range (ie you can't get away at all, or can't get away without aggroing adds), then you either live through it, or you don't... lol.  If a really heavy-hitting rampage mob is what you're fighting and can't afford the damage, then you should be having &quot;rampage tanks&quot; engage after the MT engages in order to fill up the rampage list with people who can stand the hits, BEFORE you start debuffing.<br />
<br />
Edit: in my memory, Maestro has always Rampaged... due to his size and range, and the relatively small size of the safe spot you probably pulled him to, this is one of the cases where you should either wait for some other melee to engage, or just take your lumps. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make sure a tank is the 2nd person to aggro him.  We usually nominate a &quot;Rampage Tank&quot; to do just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The rampage list goes according to the linear order in which people engaged the mob.  It is independent of aggro which is why when your rampage tank goes down, if its a big mob, he will usually rampage clerics (as they are the ones who have healed the MT before other melees have engaged).<br />
<br />
If you are taking rampage hits theres no way to &quot;derampage&quot; yourself basically.  Just try and live, or die :)<br />
<br />
As for melee range affecting rampage, I am unsure as some people say that some mobs rampage differently.  Perhaps some will not summon players who they are rampaging on, but I do know that others will summon when they rampage.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you are taking rampage hits then you cast on the mob a little too early or the rampage tank(s) have fallen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the advice guys. Next time I'll try backing out of melee range if there is space.<br />
<br />
The first time we fought him was near the SW corner and we weren't expecting him. The second time we fought him in the organ room near the throne. We got the MT to stand at the front and everyone else at the back, and he went down without any problems.<br />
<br />
With the hand I thought I had waited long enough before attempting to slow it. The MT had already called assist by then and there were plenty of melee's pounding on it. I must have been quicker than I thought! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be aware that rampage does not follow normal &quot;in melee range&quot; rules, some have quite a large rampage range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whoever is rampaged on will be hit anywhere within the zone. If you're the one being rampaged on, you cannot escape the rampaging, unless you drop down on the list. Luckily, rampage lists jump up and down often. Unless the second attacker is a good tank, aka monk pre-nerf, pally, sk, etc. rampage hits alot of different people. Thus, it sometimes appears rampage hits more than one person when it doesn't.</div></div><hr />
