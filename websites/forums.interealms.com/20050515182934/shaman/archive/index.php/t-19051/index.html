<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 11 AA and I am doing MC so I can get Canni 5.<br />
<br />
Now I am thinking maybe I should just head straight to MGB.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
My plan was canni then MGB but now I am thinking MGB then canni (they are gonna be #1 and #2 for sure after MC3).<br />
<br />
Dunno, I think canni 5 is the &quot;right&quot; choice but mgb is very tempting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Canni5 all the way<br />
<br />
Having to Fo7 down the list will suck for the 4 days it takes you to get those 9 AAs for MGB, the agony induced from that every hour and 20 minutes will be more than offset by the orgasmic goodness of Canni5 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Casting MGB F07 will suck all your mana away, so how u going to get it back?<br />
<br />
hehe<br />
<br />
Get canni 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definately canni5 first.  Having to do Fo7 group by group does suck, but 9AA will only take a few days, and those few days will be much nicer with canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get Canni5 first.<br />
<br />
Canni5 will help you get MGB, MGB won't help you get canni5.  Canni5 will allow you to do buffs faster than MGB alone (unless you only have to buff Fo7 and nothing else).  Canni5 is game altering, MGB saves you a couple minutes of time every hour or so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">are you in a raiding guild? If not, MGB wont be of much use to you...<br />
<br />
In either case, Canni5 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got Canni 5 ASAP. My next AA was MGB, primarily because, generally speaking, I am the only shaman on most of our guild raids, and buffing falls nearly entirely on my shoulders. I beg you, get Canni 5 first ... it will change your life, and I'm not kidding. MGB ... that was a convenience-AA for me. Buffing a full raid group-by-group just sucked rocks. Boulders.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get Canni 5, otherwise if you are the only shaman with the 60+ buffs that was regularly on raids buffing would be like passing Earth through Uranus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lets just say that if you're not getting canni as 23rd aa then you cheated yourself out of the best possible aa progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As everyone else here has said, Canni 5 all the way.  The only time you need MGB is for raids, otherwise it's just to impress your friends with your uberness on the POK.  Canni 5 you will use in every encounter.  This is your power as a shaman -- fast mana regen.  It's what allows you to cast all those mana intensive spells and stilll have a full mana bar while the druids and wizards are sitting to med.  All my shaman friends said that Canni 5 would change my experience of the game, and they were all right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless you are raiding EVERY day i would hold out on the mgb, for sure ALWAYS canni first then i would take CF, and LR5 before i would do mgb, but thats is only if you dont raid alot, sure MGB is fine and dandy but with the reuse time of a million, its only ok i think, when we raid and have 2+ wipes in a short time we (we are only 2 main shamans in the guild atm) still do the Fo7 group by group, i really dont mind doing 6 groups, its about the same mana ok a little more hehe.<br />
but CF3 and LR5 saves my life EVERYDAY....<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes i buff wrulan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shazgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can't help but ask, how on earth did you get Fo7 so fast? I'm now 65 with 57 AA's, played from level 1 and I've never even seen Fo7 being sold anywhere, ever. Very few shamans have it on Stromm, and they got it from guild. (And yes I'm in an elemental guild, we just killed Solusek Ro again tonight.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im assuming you guild hasnt done much elemental farming or you would have already gotten more runes then you would know what to do with.</div></div><hr />

For real...on The Tribunal its hard to get a group as a shaman if you don't have Fo7.  I had all my 65 spells with in a week of dinging.  I have even gone as far as given 2 copies of Fo7 to a friend and a guildie.  All the runes have come from XP grp named and tower named in BoT.  Guess we are lucky.  Plus all of our 65 spells are going for 30 to 45k in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Even if you're going to raid a lot, get Canni5 first.  It's MORE helpful on raids than MGB has ever been.  Plus, it will speed you up to the point where getting those 9 AA for MGB will be much easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably a Stromm thing although if you're in Sol Rol it would seem that you should have plenty of access to runes.<br />
<br />
On Xev Fo7 sells often enough in the bazaar...usually for around 75-100k, which I certainly can't afford right now.  It's a good thing that nobody gets upset when I have to FoS my groups one at a time - since the only 65th spell I have is Q, which I paid 50k for and it isn't always available for sale.<br />
<br />
It irks me because I'm not in a guild and even when I do go to BoT I rarely get into groups that are gonna see a rune drop (hasn't happened yet) and even if a rune did drop everyone would want to greed roll it.  So, I'd have to get incredibly lucky to even get a rune via conquest...then would have to get lucky to get Fo7 on turn in.<br />
<br />
Shaman spell acquisition blows chunks.  All these threads about what shaman need...bleh.  The only thing I want is easier access to the core of my class...my spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Fo7 is easy.  <br />
<br />
1. Kill Gaukr sandstorm(or any other mini) in BoT.<br />
2. Pray they drop the rune.<br />
3. Pray you win the rune.<br />
4. Pray the otter gives you the spell.<br />
<br />
Worked for me, though I wanted Q :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm. I'm on Trib also and I guess I find this statement a little strange. I've yet to be asked by any group what spells I have. Honestly, I'd probably turn the group down if they did ask (perhaps with the exception of Q if I was going to be the only healer).<br />
<br />
I don't have Fo7. It is next on my purchase list, but only after buying Q, Malos and FA. Having to single focus even a group heavy in melee's is not that much of hassle with Canni5/Q. It's rare (very rare) that I'm the last one FM after buffing.<br />
<br />
Raiding would be a different story. I don't raid much anymore but if I did MGB/Fo7 would obviously be a godsend. Single groups however can easily be done with Focus. <br />
<br />
my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL.<br />
<br />
That's how I got Fo7.  EXACTLY how I got it.<br />
<br />
Killed Gaukr.  He dropped the rune.  I won the roll and turned it in, got Fo7.<br />
<br />
I was so certain that I was going to get something cheesy like Blood of Saryrn or a dup spell (I had Quiescence already) that I didn't even look at the scroll until I was out of the library and at the main bank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ferine before Focus? I almost never ferine, because the refresh sucks.  Fo7 every hour and the melees love you (chances are if they don't they won't appreciate FA either).<br />
<br />
Q, absolutely.  Malos? I don't use it a lot, but I'd get if before Ferine. (that was actually my order - Q and 7 the day I dinged, then malos, then Ferine, suck ass disease dot when I had some money and was bored)<br />
<br />
Canni 5 before MGB.  You can buff 3 groups with canni 5 faster than you can with MGB. And you use canni 5 every time if pops (at least I do unless I'm AFK somewhere).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you dont raid that much or your raids arent that big when you do..i.e 3 or 4 groups, you might even put MGB off even longer and go with SCR, ND, QB.  Other than that I agree with previous posters, Can5 is the most important abilty you can have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Can 5 &gt; all.  Unless as people said you are raiding lots and primary shaman on buffing I would avoid MGB for a bit.  SCR3/Mastery, SCM3 by far better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I got so lucky on Fo7. The night I dinged 65 was in BoT, killed mini, rune dropped, won roll, and turned in for Fo7 as my first 65 spell. As far as luck goes though, I hardly ever win rolls, and get crappy spells on turn ins, so this really was a lucky night for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shazgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Got 57 AA's now, mostly in BoT, and only have gotten 2 runes so far. Neither of them got me Fo7, so there is no point in having MGB. I'll continue to spend AA's on things like Can5, QB2, SCR3, VP1 and RC2. MGB is a complete waste of 9 points without Fo7. Not anywhere close to the usefulness of Can5.</div></div><hr />
