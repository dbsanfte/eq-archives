<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else notice this getting to a point of ridiculousness?  These new shockwave/flash ads that just take over your browser window and you have to wait for (some have x's hidden in the mass that you can close, not all) are horrid.  Banners I can live with.  Popups I don't go too crazy over if it's kept to a sane level.  But these flash ones are horrid.  Stratics does it, gamedev.net does it, and a number of other sites I bounce around to.<br />
<br />
And now, worst of all, Castersrealm has some new thing in where it steals the url, sends you to a full page ad saying &quot;Castersrealm is brought to you by ... &lt;some ad here&gt;&quot;, and 5 seconds later forwards you back to the news site.  I've officially deleted castersrealm from my bookmarks now, it was always a pretty good news site, but there are limits on how much horrid advertisements I can take.<br />
<br />
Sorry, just had to rant about this somewhere (and this is the only good forum that doesnt spam me with the same ads!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Internet advertising is the suck.  Maybe I'm being naive, but I've yet to meet anyone who actually purchased a product via internet ads.  The fact alone that I can come here and not be bothered with 10,000 freakin pop up ads is worth my donation. <br />
I also use POW from Analog X (http://www.analogx.com) to kill some of them.  It's simplistic, but it works and has very low overhead.  If anyone wants I can post my database file for it to so you don't have to add to many sites manually (I've got about two years worth of pop up names stored in it now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Odull3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A friend of mine worked in a boiler room phone sale operation.  Called people at dinner time to sell em a stupid service no one needed.<br />
<br />
I was shocked to hear their sales rate was 4% of the solicitations.<br />
Amazing how many really stupid people are out there.  Im sure they get sales from these ads.  If they didn't, they wouldn't be running them.  Its all about the almighty dollar.<br />
<br />
Odull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i use pop-up stopper from panicware.com its shareware and works well for pop browser ads.now if i could just find something for that windows message pop up that keeps dumping me out of EQ to tell me about low phone rates and untraceable porn sites.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alt + F4 will close your active window, something I found handy for those ads with &quot;hidden&quot; x's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Popupdummy solved most of my issues with pop-up ads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh good, your name change is working Squidly :)</div></div><hr />

Oh good, your name change is working Squidly :) <br />
<br />
Yah thanks fer changing it.  That was a stupid name I came up with late one night when I figured I'd post once and leave, hehe.<br />
<br />
Not that &quot;Meener&quot; makes any more sense to anyone that hasn't known me since I was, like, 5 years old or anything :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just turn off javascript in your browser, pop ups and flash can't work without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Popup stopper is better than turning off javascript.  You can temporarily disable PUS (yuck, what an acronym) by double-clicking its icon in the task bar, or just hold down SHIFT for some popups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have Adaware. It's free &amp; so far has blocked all the pop ups. You can find a number of free popup blockers on the net.</div></div><hr />
