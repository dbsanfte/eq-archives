<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LilGnomeLovin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, maybe I am being a bit of a newb here but I have heard people mention that they can set up spell sets for different scenarios, IE raiding, buffs, solo, PL that sort of thing.  Question is, are they actually an organized set of spells that you can eme faster or something?  Or are they just what each of us personally use for those scenarios mentioned above?<br />
<br />
I know I missed the way you can right click on an empty spell gem for awhile so I thought I better ask now.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16852 has instructions, and if you scroll down a bit, you can see two recommended setups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well in short, a spell set is a snapshot of whatever spells you have memmed when you create the set<br />
<br />
for example i have a damage spell set .. includes ice nuke and bane .. and nothing else .. while my MGB set has fo7 and group sta .. and nothing else .. it just lets me unmem 2 spells and get 2 others up without all the clicking and though the chat box. <br />
<br />
if you leave spell slots blank in a spell set, the spells you have in those slots aren't affected when you mem a set.<br />
<br />
I have 10 spell sets i use and just for convenience sake. I've found them to cover just about everything.<br />
<br />
1 - group - this has my normal group setup .. includes a root, a nuke, FA, and the regular staple of malos, slow, quiessence, heal, canni<br />
2 - raid - this one only has focus of soul, single sta and FA on it<br />
3 - shrink - just shrink<br />
4 - mgb - i have fo7, group sta and tribunal in this one, replacing root, nuke and FA  .. i use it for mgbing .. and random single group buffing<br />
5 - debuff - i keep malosinia, and cripple on this one<br />
6 - disease - this one replaces malos and slow with incidious decay and grummus .. for those times where disease will do<br />
7 - haste - loads up single and group haste<br />
8 - ranger - i keep this one for the odd requests (usually by rangers) .. bih-li, diaku, and probably PE if/when i get it finally<br />
9 - damage - replace root with bane and FA with BoS<br />
10 - solo - i keep this one up for the very few solo times i have, includes bane, BoS, Ulthor, a root, malos and no slow (more for fire than anything else)<br />
<br />
and that's my spell list layout .. the max you can have is 10 .. if there wre more, i'd probably use more :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I keep about 6 spell sets saved for fast memorization.<br />
<br />
GoD--utility spells, usually for CR (tells you something about GoD, doesn't it?  :p).  Includes, Breath, slow, daluda, lev, SoW, invis, canna, and malos.<br />
<br />
Others are pretty self-explanatory<br />
Raid Damage<br />
Raid Buff<br />
Pure DPS (mostly for GoD trials 7-9)<br />
Rathe<br />
Group<br />
<br />
I think there is one other, but it escapes me at the moment.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I read that you can save the file with the spellsets, create 10 more, and edit the files so you have 20, but that you have to access them through /mem &lt;name&gt; only, because the mem/load/erase interface is limited to  10. But I haven't tried it, and I can't locate the post now.<br />
<br />
EDIT - they are actually supposed to pop up when you right-click the spellbook, just can't save more than 10 through that method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LilGnomeLovin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Friggin awesome!!!!  Thanks alot...cant wait to get outta work to go play around with them.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a small suggestion if you are setting up spell sets where they are all the same except 3 spells...keep everything in the same spot...ie<br />
<br />
i have 2 LDoN spell sets one is LDoN-pet i enter the dungeon with that one...it has <br />
<br />
q<br />
canni<br />
bear form<br />
focus<br />
FA<br />
Pet<br />
slow<br />
malos<br />
<br />
then my LDoN spell set is<br />
<br />
q<br />
canni<br />
bane<br />
tnargs<br />
FA<br />
Nadox (utility slot)<br />
slow<br />
malos<br />
<br />
You always want to keep spells in the same spot so when you switch sets, only the new spells have to be refreshed...all my 8 spell except 1 have FA in the same gem so it is alway ready &amp; does nto have to refresh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spell sets are a god sent for shaman. If you are not using them i would highly recommend it. <br />
<br />
The best advice i can give about what sets you should create would be to check here and see what sets other shaman are currently using and then go from there.<br />
<br />
Like Aaellyn, I currently use 10 sets. (I would have more if i could) The ones I currently have are:<br />
<br />
1. Adventures - Group buffs for pre-buffing LDoN groups<br />
2. Pet - for casting a pet and the buffs I put on him<br />
3. CR - spells i use when doing a cr from different zones<br />
4. PL - spells i use when i power level my war<br />
5. Solo - mostly dots and root<br />
6. Raid Buffs - all raid buffs for the start of a raid<br />
7. DD - DD spells when grouping<br />
8. Dot - same as above only with dots<br />
9. Raid Hunt - The spell set i have up when raiding, has a dd, dot, and buffs.<br />
10. Uqua CR - All the buffs needed to buff someone on a Uqua raid (those who have been there know what i mean)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I find them extremely useful.<br />
<br />
I have one set for when I die and/or am buffing only myself, another for when I'm buffing a full group.  Saves a LOT of clicking and paging through the book.  I also have one for &quot;rescues&quot; after I die, that includes gate, levitate(the componentless version) and SOW(since when I'm dead I don't have my SOW boots) and invis, so with just one click I'm ready to SOW, lev, and invis myself to get back to my death spot pronto.<br />
<br />
I also have two that are lifesavers for dot soloing/duo'ing, as these are often borderline panicky situations where I don't need to be messing up or taking an instant longer than I have to -- because if root breaks while I'm memming spells, I might be paste.<br />
<br />
One has malos/malosinia/slow/malicious decay/root.  I cast all those or sometimes skip slow, then mem up a set that keeps the root, dumps teh debuffs, and adds in only my DOTS that don't break root -- ulthor, saryrn, bane.  <br />
<br />
I actually have a third one for when I'm with either my SK or someone with a snare, that includes pox, but takes out any heal but Q, so I can just go pretty full bore on my dotting.  I still like to add in pox when the situation lets me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this really saves time and eliminates some of the fudge factor and danger factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you save a set that has blank (unloaded) spell gems in it, when you mem the set it will leave whatever's in that spell slot alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a small suggestion if you are setting up spell sets where they are all the same except 3 spells...keep everything in the same spot<br />
<br />
Nah. Much better:<br />
<br />
If you save a set that has blank (unloaded) spell gems in it, when you mem the set it will leave whatever's in that spell slot alone.<br />
<br />
Why? Say I replaced one of my 'regulars' with a special-needs spell, like RGC. When I switch from 'group buffs' to 'combat' or whatever, I don't want RGC overwritten</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I use that blank gem feature heavily.  I have a &quot;Base Set&quot; which almost never changes, uses up 4 of my spell gems with Tnarg's - Root - Canni - Quiescence.  Then I have several different sets that fill up the other 4 gems<br />
<br />
   Single buffs<br />
   Group buffs<br />
   Raid<br />
   Solo dots<br />
   Solo debuffs<br />
<br />
So after I die I mem Base Set + Single Buffs.  During raid buffing I mem Group Buffs.  When soloing I pull with the Solo Debuff set up, then Solo Dots to do the damage.</div></div><hr />

Samanna, this is the link (http://www.eqdiva.com/EQ/Guide.aspx?id=83&amp;ForumID=132) you are probably looking for. I found it on the Bard forums, and posted it to another thread over here, but can't recall what it was about.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ah, thanks - that's the one. Added it to my page. Not that I find I need more than 10, really. I'll play with it when I get time.</div></div><hr />
