<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was asked by izmalis  and jdthomas  in another thread to elaborate on how my exp group does this, hitting all four of the BoT tower bosses in about an hour, hence this thread. It's not rocket science, and many of you reading this will have either done it or are very familiar with the common techniques that we're using to get it done.<br />
<br />
Group composition:<br />
<br />
Tank (ours is a pally, I'm guessing he's over 9k buffed)<br />
Druid<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter 1 (TD3, max CHA)<br />
Enchanter 2 (same)<br />
Shaman (&lt;---- that's me)<br />
<br />
All 65's, none time-geared or significantly e-geared, most of us are making our way through the planar progression (I explained last night to the tank how to finish his BoT key quest and I myself am not yet flagged for any elemental zones). Although I was just accepted into a Time-flagged guild last week, this isn't something I've done with any of my guildmates, it's just a group of friends who started off as a pickup group and eventually got into a nice little groove doing these together. But we are a tight team, having done most of the GoD trials together and now Kod'Taz. We know each other well and we know our roles and we often come to do this after our respective raiding is done within our guilds.<br />
<br />
Druid's role is to Harmony our safe passage past most trash mobs, to snare pets, and of course heal. My role is to keep the pets MaloSINIA'd, Slow and heal. That's it, in this configuration I have zero DPS. Chanters are responsible for getting a pet each with one given the additional role of CC.<br />
<br />
We meet in the safe room and buff up. Then we invis up, run up the Fire steps, run up some stairs, around a corner, and to the portal taking it up into the upstairs stormriders area. Once you're in the upstairs stormriders area you simply choose a direction. SE takes you to Air; NE to Fire; SW to Water, and NW to Earth. Run invis past all the stormriders and come to some wide steps leading up to a false door, with zone portals on the left and the right. The left returns you to BoT zone in, the right takes you into the relevant elemental wing (btw, someone in the group needs to have Enchanted Ring of Torden). This works for all 4 directions, they are basically symmetrical.<br />
<br />
We usually start NE to Fire. We enter the zone in start running up. Druid leads us in, using Harmony on all giants along the way, running constantly, taking all the appropriate ports until we get to Thunderclap's room. We rush in and survey the situation. We charm two pets, eliminate any other giants in the room and set up in our positions. I stand immediately below the boss facing his platform, giving myself maximum distance but close enough to hit him with a spell. My job is to pull Thunderclap with Malos, hit him with Malicious Decay while he's running on the upper platform for my ass, and have him Grummus'd before he hits the ground. Pally then aggros him and moves to the left bottom corner of Thunderclap's platform where he engages him into the corner. Pets move in, (making sure that the any non-summoning variant hits the boss first to take ramp), CLR, DRU and SHM spam heal the tank. About 50% I re-slow. Takes maybe 10-15 minutes for total encounter. Loot and run to portal out.<br />
<br />
SW to Water. Important to invis up here and keep it up at all times. DRU Harm's any see-invis and we run, run, run till we hit the portal going into the final boss room. When we enter this portal, Chanter 1's job will be to take the kriger on the left as pet, Chanter 2 will take the right, tank pulls any others and engages. We eliminate all mobs between us and Icestorm, except possibly the ones on the right as you face him, since we'll be out of their range. We get into position with the tank moving into the cubbyhole on the left nearest the boss, and me positioned at the wall space between that cubbyhole and the one next to it further away from the boss. Tank pulls boss, I Malos, MD, and Grummus. Pets are sent in, CLR, DRU, SHM spam heal. Reslow at 50%. Kill, loot and portal out. 10 to 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
SE to Air. No invis needed here, just Harm all the way up the stairs, taking each portal till we hit Chaoswind's room. Pet up two nearest mobs, kill the rest and prepare for fight. Chaoswind is unslowable, so my job is to keep the pets healed, SINIAd and spam heal the hank. Chaoswind has an AE stun so it's critical that the healers stay beyond the fourth tile from the center and all be equipped with ER IV items. Kill, loot and portal out. 10 minutes tops, this one is easy.<br />
<br />
NW to Earth. The trickiest one. Again, invis up and harm our way to the the room just below the stairs with the sky's. We'll invis to a corner and prep for some fights (kind of like moving in to Tables) and take 2 pets and clear the rest. Tank runs ahead and starts clearing the skys and eventually brings Hailstorm to us. He is unslowable so again, I heal tank and pets. Kill, loot and portal out. This one seems to be the hardest and if we ever wipe, it's here. 15-20 minutes.<br />
<br />
All told, we're out in and out in about an hour usually with 2-3 pieces of Ornate (Tunics, Greaves) and many other nice loots (I got my Cap of Drowned Souls and Glowing Orb of the Stormwatcher here, both off Thunderclap). Other drops are Great Blade of Storms, Greatstaff of Thunder, Wicked Shank, and always a few Glyphed Rune Words and SPs.<br />
<br />
For those who are familiar with pet management this is probably stating the obvious but it's worth pointing out some simple concepts that may be news to folks that are new to charming. First, enchanter needs to have a hotkey that announces when pet breaks. I'm pretty familar with the aggro spam associated with each of the usual pets so I'll know when they break but it's still good to have the hotkey announce msg. Soon as it breaks, DRU snares and announces, I MaloSINIA and announce success (when I see the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; message), chanter tashes and THEN charms. If charm occurs before sinia or snare attaches we break and re-do pet. Also, whenever we're heading into critical situations we'll break and re-do pets. Chanter keeps a distance from pet and as long as it's snared they're pretty safe. Important to NDT pets in this situation so as to avoid ambiguity while they are fighting their kind.<br />
<br />
Needless to say we can only hit whichever bosses are actually up, and if we encounter any groups working their way up we disengage and leave. In all the time that I've been doing this I've never run across another group, although there have been times when one of the bosses wasn't up.<br />
<br />
It's a hugely fun encounter and I always look forward to taking on these bosses with our group. The loot is nice, but the real reward comes from the incredible rush associated with knocking these guys down on their own turf. Although we're all good players with decent gear, there's nothing really uber about this team or their gear, it's just a matter of knowing the terrain, knowing the enemy, and knowing each other. Fun as hell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Great info, I suspected charmed pets but I had no idea you used two.  I think my group of friends is out of luck as we only have one chanter w/ TD3/max cha.  I also don't think my bazaar sk at 6.7k hps raid buffed is going to cut it as a tank. :) It's ironic and oh so apropos that I need the very gear I'd get off BoT tower named in order to tank BoT tower named. I love SOE! (haha)<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, great info- it gives my friends and I something to shoot for before WoW comes out.<br />
<br />
Kudos!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I don't know who Iri, Lester and Hrani are, are these named guys near Hailstorm? I don't believe I've ever seen them. The thing about Earth (and the reason I don't have more details about the pull or the location) is that I've never actually been to where Hailstorm spawns. Unlike the other encounters, for Earth we position ourselves in a room and then the tank brings Hailstorm to us. The DRU accompanies him and positions himself on the big wide stairs between the two rooms so I've assumed that there is Harmony'ing going on to get the big ugly out of his lair and over to where we are fighting. <br />
<br />
I'll ask our PAL or DRU next time I see them. In Earth especially we are usually very much in a hurry because the repops are deadly. If we feel we've taken too much time prepping, we wait for repops and clear them to make sure that we don't have lethal distractions during the boss fight. Because of this, I haven't followed the tank and dru to the pull spot. My position requires that I stay anchored to the pets for break and sinia. The DRU stays right on the dividing steps and is available for snares too. If you're familiar with the location (I realize my description is not very informative), are these nameds and Hailstorm spawn location near?<br />

I've killed both of them, without a charm pet, several times with a pre-elemental group of guildmates (months ago).<br />
<br />
I'd be careful with your charm pets on Brynju, his proc has a very small range AE with a big DD and a dispell and rampages.  Dispells are bad for charm pets.</div></div><hr />

Might be, but I sure don't feel like it. Perhaps to a time-geared crew it might be. In these fights we usually find ourselves barely keeping the tank up and think about the fact that I'm reslowing at 50% on the 2 slowable battles to give you some idea of the length of each battle, like 10-15 mins. We're not the most uber group around so I honestly don't think we could get this done in this time frame without the charmed mobs. And remember, if you don't act fast, repops will annihilate you. <br />

2 + 2 isn't equaling 4 here.<br />
<br />
You said you grummus on the pull and then refresh, no mention of landing turgurs on them. Grummus has a duration of ~3 minutes so it thats what your refreshing at 50% then the most you could be going would be 6 minutes max. More likely it's going to be 4-5 minutes. Even turgurs is only 6.5 minutes base. Even with max extension it would barely be possible to go 15 minutes with out refreshing it more than once. I also find it unlikely the you could spamm heal the tank for even 10 minutes, let alone 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Lets assume you have a 6k mana pool, and we'll say you've got buffs from outside the group and call it 75 mana a tick regen, we'll also give you an obligitory 10% mana pres item and maxed aa's and assume spec in alteration. To make the math simple we'll assume base cast time on tnargs which means with recast your getting 1 cast a tick(3.75 + 2.25). Assuming 25% mana pres (20% from spec and Spell casting mastery and average of 5 from MP item) and tnargs costs 334 mana. Minus the 75 mana a tick you regening you loose ~260 mana a tick chain healing. With a 6k mana pool chain healing like that you could keep it up for ~23 ticks or about 2 and a half minutes. Even adding in a cann v there and your only looking at about 2 3/4 minutes. I'd assume I was generous on the mana regen, focus's and mana pool for you and haste focus and buff from cleric would me faster casting and using up mana faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The harm really doesn't get resisted very often but when it does, depends where it is. Mez, memblur, ignore, keep running to the next portal, fight and kill, lots of options. If resist at a critical point and we get in trouble, we could wipe. I think that's happened maybe twice in all the time we've done this. This doesn't always go flawlessly, there are plenty of times when someone dies, we rez, rebuff and get back on track. This is BoT, worst case, even in a total wipe, the bodies pop back in a few minutes to the GY at zi. Don't need a rogue for that. And we've got 2 rezzers for the druid or the chanters. In any case, it really hasn't been a significant risk and I've come to the point of expecting to succeed virtually every time, barring unusual circumstances.<br />
<br />
It's not surprising to me this could be done without charmed pets. Maybe that'll be our next challenge. The thing I would worry about is that without that dps it might take longer and you run the risk of repops. We're constantly moving very fast to avoid them, and the times where we've stumbled and lost folks was often when repops came up because we were taking too long on something or other.<br />
<br />
Right now we've supplemented the BoT routine to add Tactics and we easily take out Glykus and the Overseer. Our current challenge is to see if we can single-group TZ. We've failed our first two attempts and wiped both times, but we'll keep working at it. I'd appreciate any insights from anyone who's tried this.<br />

<br />
My mana pool isn't 6k btw (I wish it was!), it's more like 4k. I've got FT10, VoQ, Potions of Greater Concentration, lots of AAs and focus effects to help, but ... as all of my Shaman brethren are sure to understand, my crappy little spam healing with Daluda's Mending doesn't amount to hardly anything in the scheme of things, I'm just adding what I can when I can. We have both a CLR and a DRU providing the main healing to the tank, they are the ones responsible for keeping him up (and they do just fine), my spam healing is just additional insurance. <br />
<br />
First few times I tried this I loaded up disease dots since I was MD and Grummus'ing anyway, and added those. Overall, it didn't seem to make much difference whether I was taking hp or restoring HP, but I honestly haven't done the analysis. Might be better to be dps instead of my spam healing. The only thing preventing the analysis has been the inertia resulting from repeated successes using existing technique. I may experiment here to see if we'd go faster or more reliably with me in dps mode.<br />
<br />
Yes, on both Thunderclap and Icestorm I use Grummus and don't ever cast Turgurs. The actual battles with these guys don't last 10-15 minutes, they only last a few minutes, the entire battle from time we enter wing to exiting with loot from the boss is 10-15. Remember, I'm talking about taking about an hour total for all four encounters and that includes a lot of things besides the final boss battles themselves. Example, we have to charm 2 pets and clear anything immediately in the vicinity of the fight. For Icestorm this always involves killing at least 5 or 6 mobs surrounding him and for Thunderclap usually 2-3. With both these guys if I were to go without any refresh (which is what I used to do when I first started doing this) my Grummus would run out somewhere between 10-25% hp, something like that. If Grummus's durations is ~3 minutes (taking your word here, didnt' check) then this suggests that actual fight with the boss is no more than like 5 minutes, which sounds about right. Rather than take the chance, however, of running out earlier than expected and letting a few accelerated attacks land while I'm re-slowing (and associated risk of then fizzling, resisting, etc), I've gotten into the habit of re-slowing at 50% as a precaution and we avoid the problem altogether.<br />

Okay, now my interest is seriously piqued.  My group of friends just got hammered trying Glykus for the first time, though I thought we had a decent strat.  We charmed a war boar and had a monk/ranger to kite the pigs.  We tried to engage Glykus in center of room next to pig pens, didn't realize AE hits most ppl in the room, which snared our kiters and ended up getting everyone aggro'd and quickly killed.<br />
<br />
Could you please elaborate on the tactics you used to do this guy? We're planning on engaging him next time somewhere in the pens w/ the charmed pet while the kiters use the main room to kite the pigs.  I also want to try a dual-wielding zek initiate instead of a war boar, should be higher dps.<br />
<br />
These fights are the equivalent of raids to us, but the upside is that all loot results in massive upgrades to my friends and I and there's no politics on loot distribution.  Any and all advice welcome- these fights are the only reason we have left for hanging out in Norrath as non-raiders. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail,Okay, now my interest is seriously piqued.  My group of friends just got hammered trying Glykus for the first time, though I thought we had a decent strat.  <br />
I've been whacking Glykus intermittently as a trio with a druid and enchanter.  None of us are in the EP, &amp; I don't think any of us have any pieces from VT.<br />
<br />
Enchanter charms a zek (any) and we clear pit trash until a frenzied initiate pops.  Then we switch pets to the frenzied, and transfer mage weapons (swords, mask, belt) to the frenzied initiate.  Frenzied's flurry and have more hp than standard zeks.  You can take out Glykus with a normal initiate, but a frenzied makes it easier.<br />
<br />
Whack the back hall wanderer (respawns about 27 min I think) and then the 2 corner spawns outside the pigpens.  Clear ALL of the stables as fast as you can once that's done.  When you have cleared the stables completely (minus Glykus of course), move the pet to just outside the stables, a few steps beyond the border.  Break mez, reapply Malosinia, Tash, and Snare, let pet get to 100% and have druid at full mana.  Recharm frenzied, refresh FA (ench charm pet also has Focus, Strength of Diaku, and Pot9).  I generally take over all healing duties during the last half of the pigpen clearing so druid can be near full when we're ready to pull Glykus.<br />
<br />
Enchanter pulls Glykus (with Tash I think, not really sure) to the pet.  The boar pets don't spawn right away, so walking Glykus to the frenzied isn't too dangerous.  Frenzied engages Glykus and enchanter runs back to the area near where Glykus spawns.  Enchanter then kites the boar pets around the back of the stables (he's in imp or air elemental form so he's floating with FoE on for faster movement rate) while frenzied pet is killing Glykus.<br />
<br />
I Malos as soon as pet has engaged, and cast Turgur's at about 95% Glykus health.  Cripple goes in about 90%.  From there I assist heal only when Glykus rampages on the frenzied pet.  Druid covers at least 80% of the pet heals.  The important thing is to make sure the frenzied is at near full health before Glykus enrages, because the pet can drop 30-40% health extremely quick, and the enchanter doesn't always have time to back his pet off during the enrage.<br />
<br />
This method takes a very skilled (not to mention gutsy) enchanter and a well-heeled druid (in terms of manapool).  I feel relatively useless except for my buff contributions and some assist spam heals.  I think pretty much any 65 shaman could be used as the third person.  My almost 400 aa's don't do much, a 65 shaman with Canni5 and not much else could probably fill the shaman role just as well.  I could easily be replaced by a cleric honestly as you can manage Glykus even unslowed with a Chealer in my opinion.  (Maybe I shouldn't say that here, but it is true.)<br />
<br />
Overseer can be done using a similar strategy with 4 people, merely adding a cleric to the mix.  Shaman does NOTHING to get on the aggro list however unless someone dies to keep the hate list on Overseer limited to 4 people (to prevent him from switching off the frenzied pet).  I feel REALLY useless for this kill most of the time, as all I'm really contributing to are marginal buffs and some help in clearing the trash beforehand :p <br />
<br />
We've been trying to do Tagrin with 4, but haven't managed it yet due to some unfortunately timed charm breaks.<br />
<br />
Oh, if charm breaks during Glykus or Overseer, druid immediately casts Exodus.  The ench can recover using refresh mana AA (puts him back to FM) as soon as he/she loots all but bridle off corpse.  Second attempt can happen if you don't delay without needing to reclear the stables.<br />
<br />
Sadly, none of us really need these drops, so they are pretty much randomed among us.  I've bought a manastone and a fungi tunic as toys with the proceeds from my winnings recently, and still been able to give away some very generous gifts to guildmates.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just got through reading Frekkels's account of the Glykus encounter and it's very similar to what we do, except for a few things that I think he's doing better than us. I think we just used one of the normal warrior diakus, using the frenzied initiate sounds like a nice improvement. We haven't done this one as often as the bot tower boss runs so we've got plenty of room for improvement on tactics. I will suggest this to the group.<br />
<br />
Once we have the pet and rest of the team in place (at the very spot Frekkels mentions) I then position myself around the corner in the pigpens near G. When the word comes to pull, I cast Malos on him and then start running back to join the rest of the team. Pally and pet engage, I debuff and we're off to the races. <br />

Other differences, our Druid does the kiting and we have a full group of six so we've got a little more flexibility in roles. I can identify with Frekkel's basic sense of somewhat minimal contribution (although I get to do the pull and am somewhat better equipped to handle mishaps at that point than our chanter), but that's often the case when dealing with charmed mobs as the principal source of DPS, isn't it. I mean, in a tipt trial where a charmed pooka is eating up a flint cragbeast in 4 seconds, Slow doesn't really make a lot of difference does it? ;-)<br />

I wonder what your pally is doing to shake the bees on Hailstorm.  From what I remember they're like pets, I've done the pull I with my bard and I had to highsun them back...<br />
<br />
Don't know what the pally is doing on the pull. I know that the Druid positions himself up by the stairs during the clearing of the upper room and then disappears during the fight kiting adds that I can't see while we fight in the main room below. Those might be the bees you mean. But to be honest, I'm not sure since I haven't actually seen that part of the fight. I will ask him next time I see him. <br />
<br />
Earth is the definitely the hardest of the four. When things go wrong in the cycle, it's often here.<br />

 I have one clarification- you kite inside the spawned pigs inside the pens (stables, whatever), not outside in the room w/ the 2 statics spawns and the wanderer? <br />
Yes, the enchanter kites the spawned pigs inside the pigpen stables.  Runs them around in a circle - they despawn when Glykus dies.<br />
I did this again today  with my guildleader (enchanter) and a good cleric friend (guildmate also).  The usual ench/druid (unguilded farmers) I've been grouping with to do this (they were the experts) weren't online.  Neither of my guildmates had ever done Glykus successfully before today.<br />
<br />
Enchanter's Magelo:  Giah (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355235)   Cleric's Magelo: Stephania (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=638811)   Mine. (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=642761)   :D <br />
While the 3 of us aren't EP equipped, our stuff isn't that bad either. :p <br />
<br />
We slaughtered pit mobs for awhile this afternoon and had no luck in getting a frenzied to spawn.  With IRL events looming, we went ahead and just used a normal zek initiate (albeit equipped w/ 2 mage fists, belt, and mask).  First attempt our enchanter didn't understand exactly where the spawned boars would pop, and they ended up dropping her before she could set up her kite properly.  We all died. :eek: <br />
<br />
Second attempt was slightly delayed by a pathing tortured soul and our own former pet that now saw invis that wreaked havoc on us mid-CR, so we had to reclear the pens to be safe once things were straightened out.<br />
<br />
Everything worked pretty flawlessly though on take #2. :cool:   It is much easier with a druid for snare on the charmed pet, but we managed without it just fine.  The enchanter got clipped a few times (losing both runes &amp; eventually dropping to 50% health - she clicked Eldritch Rune on the fly) on the kite until she had her route perfected, but it went very smooth.  Giah will be using the Blood Runed Battle Wand that Glykus gave us as a replacement for her very well used Staff of the Serpent. ;)  <br />
<br />
Please toss me a bump if this strat works for you. :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
