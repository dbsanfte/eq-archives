<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Herald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Below is the tale fortold by Herald as a forcaster of the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Clouds are rolling in, the sky darkens, and flashes of lightning can be seen on the horizon.  Oh, what are the gods about to say?<br />
<br />
The winds whisper quietly, “Listen to the Herald for the words are but visions for the future.  Listen, stand ready to act for destiny is but a day, a fortnight away.”<br />
<br />
Herald grows quiet, the air no longer moves and even the birds have stopped their singing.<br />
<br />
Herald looks up, eyes closed and words first garbled begin to slip from the lips…<br />
<br />
“The land of the wood elves, high elves, gnomes and dwarfs is about to erupt in a horrid war.”  Moans Herald.<br />
<br />
“There are two mighty guilds at war lead by war councils determined to smite the other guild into dust.” Herald trembled and continued, “Plans will be made and voices will be heard in victory and in pain.”<br />
<br />
The room suddenly grows still as Herald’s eyes open.  No more will be told of the future yet in store for those glorious champions of KOE.<br />
<br />

Knaves!!!! Do not taunt Herald.  I come only with words of warning so you can prepare.  The wind blows again for thee so I come to deliver the messages.<br />
<br />
Herald grows very still, the rising and falling of the chest can be barely seen.  The color drains from the face and it appears that death has taken yet another to visit the lands of darkness, yet a small twitch belies life in the still form.<br />
<br />
“Achaborar dea maksura dimala will fight til only one legion survives.” Mumbles Herald.  Then with a start, the muse jolts upright, “The Dark Elves have again woven lies to liken the most aliened races to war!!”  <br />
<br />
The stillness in Herald is now broken.  The voice rises as each word becomes smoldering in hatred, “You are all the weaker races and with our plans you will destroy your own kind and in turn we will then slip from the darkness to rule all of Norrath.  The magic potions of our alchemists have slipped into your waters will make you now fall under the spell and not know of this as you battle.”  The dark form laughs wickedly then smiles showing gleaming teeth dripping with salvia.     <br />
<br />
Then Herald takes on another tone, one bright and hopeful as the Mother of All would sound, “Oh wicked ones, those who you have now possessed will at one time see the light, as I will join with Brell to defeat you.  I can do little now but watch as you have set friend against friend, race against race.  But I do know that the victors will emerge even stronger and seek you out to destroy you sending you back to your underground world and darkness.”<br />
<br />
Herald grows quiet again as the breathing gently returns to its natural rhythm.  Sleep slips in as Herald rests. <br />
<br />

Herald stands shaking fists at the sky, “Bah, I know not why I am wasting my time.” spews Herald.  “Oh Gods you have given me these gifts listen unto me your humble servant, these poor mortal beings jest at your warnings.  They joust about like little boys mashing ants.”  “How ol immortal ones can your messenger deliver your words so that they finally understand that each one of them is now affected!”  <br />
<br />
“Each one of them, no matter what race they be in this dimension known as Veeshan is spared.” The Herald drops to the knees and lifts up the tear stained face to the sky, “I beg of thee, how can I be the one to tell these valiant and noble ones that they are all infected.  As they have supped from a dwarven ale, eaten a loaf of elven bread, or kissed a fair gnomish lass, that they will all drift off into a deep slumber only to be awakened in another dimension in a form implanted in their being.”<br />
<br />
Herald begins to sob, “Oh Gods who haft given me these gifts, how do I tell them that on the eve of November 30th of the year of the earth 2001 that the battle will begin?  That as they rest, they will all be transpired to a wood elf, high elf, dwarf or gnome upon their entry to this world and begin the quest to reach the age of 6 leagues.  That they will be able to use the natural resources around them to armor themselves, provide equipment to do battle and to purchase spells for their casters.” <br />
<br />
Silence fills the room as Herald falls into a trance like state where only movement is the constant dripping of tears onto the floor.  Slowly a life force enters the wracked body.  A voice echoes within the weakened form whispering, “you will do only your best Herald, soon they will believe.”  Herald crumples into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />

Herald arises stiff from sleeping on the floor, a layer of grime has filtered down giving the skin a gritty feel, yet stretching relieves the stiffness and the cool water in the basin refreshes the skin.  Herald begins to nibble on a crust of bread, breaking off a portion that looks slightly suspicious as to having been shared with a mouse.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps I am done here muses Herald, perhaps these knaves are prepared enough for the quest ahead.  Herald opens a dusty bottle of wine and pours a draught and begins to mindlessly dip the crust of bread into heavy red liquid.  The soggy bread, very tasty now, nourishes Herald’s frail body.  A battle begins to take form in Herald’s mind, one of great fury raging endlessly.  Bodies bludgeoned, burnt and torn covered the landscapes of the lands of Lesser Faye between the lands of the gnomes and of the elves.  <br />
<br />
Shouts from the bearers of the red flag borne by the dwarves and gnomes as they clash with the bearers of the green flag borne by the elven troops begin to ring in Herald’s mind.  A whisper slips into Herald’s mind, experience has taught Herald not to struggle for it is the voice of the Mother of All.  <br />
<br />
“Aye Herald, it tis a horrid scene that you bear witness to yet I have discovered that as the darken ones have set this poison in action we can counter it with a time agent.  We cannot stop this war but we can have it last but an hour of their lives.  They will have time before to prep and plot, this we cannot control, but the battle will abruptly end.  There is a powder that will erase the hatred and restore the bonds of brotherly and sisterly love once again but Herald, you must be there.  You must sprinkle it generously.  Think of a way that you will have contact with each one so that the evil is counter acted.”<br />
<br />
“Oh goddess of the natural forces, you bestow upon this poor mortal sole such a task.  I will ponder this and devise a plan to make it happen.  Perhaps if I had a skill that they would all need, Ah yes, I will learn the art of binding so that each of them can be bound close to the bloody war site then each will get a sprinkle of your magical powder that will ease them back to reality.” Herald offered hopefully.<br />
<br />
“Herald what a wonderful plan!” exclaimed the Goddess.  “I knew bestowing the gift of sight upon you was most wise.”   “Be well Herald, my forces have much to do to prepare the powder.” <br />
<br />
The voices grew quiet and Herald knew that the visit was over.  A smile crept upon the fragile features as Herald knew that the evil would have its way yet be thwarted at the same time.  “Good always wins,” thought Herald.<br />

Herald stiffens, body suddenly erect and tense, a presence surrounds Herald and the skin gets cold and clammy. A voice resounds in Herald’s mind, “ See I knew they would loose interest in you, pansy of goodness,” seethed the dark voice.  “You are not real to them so they no longer care and all the better for my plan.  You will do my bidding weak one. You are my tool.”<br />
<br />
Herald knew better than to resist, the voice was too strong.  Herald knew it was the voice of Innourk.  All Herald could do now was to listen.  “Take this to your Keepers you waste of breath, look now Herald and see what lies before you.” <br />
<br />
The room got even colder yet Herald did not feel, an eerie mist settled before Herald and revealed a forest where on one side was a legion of forces with a red flag for Dwarfs and Gnomes and on the other side was a legion of forces with a green flag for High Elves and Wood Elves.  A leader commanded the troops and all followed the well laid out plans.  “See Herald,” the wicked voice pointed out, “they are all to eager to plot to kill their brethren.  There is nothing you can do to stop it.”  A wicked laugh settled about the room.<br />
<br />
Herald thought inwardly, “aye savage one tis nothing I can do to stop this vile act but I can do something to twart you from destroying them all.”<br />
<br />
“GO HERALD” the voice commanded, “tell the legions of KOE that there is a battle to be won, tell them to make their plans, and to arm their forces.”  “AHAHAH” the vile one laughed, “I have not had this much fun in a long time Herald, perhaps when this is done you can join me in my chambers. I have grown quite fond of your pale form.”  An icy finger stroked the finely made cheek sending shivers down the young one’s spine.  “Your light against my dark would be quite amusing.” He chuckled enjoying the moment. “Go now, tell your Keeper friends what they must do.”  Innourk commanded. <br />
<br />
The room was suddenly quite; warmth from the fire was all that could stir the feeling of life back into Herald’s bones.  Papers were snatched from the worn desk and the quill dipped into the ink, as Herald wrote the thought crept forward, “I will post these on the afternoon for the Keepers of the Elements to see.  They will prepare for the onslaught ahead.”<br />

Post for the event:<br />
<br />
Great Race WAR <br />
Come ye oh come ye.. <br />
<br />
Hear the words of Herald <br />
<br />
There will be a great Race WAR on a server yet to be announced: <br />
<br />
Date: Nov 30 <br />
<br />

<br />
We will have 2 teams, one the bearer of the red flag for dwarves and gnomes and another one the bearer of the green flag for the high elves and wood elves. <br />
<br />
Each team will be given at least 15 pp after a guild has been established for your team. Any armor or equipment will also be split equally. <br />
<br />
A thread will be started for each team so that you can sign up as either for the Red Flag or for the Green Flag. The War leaders can plot strategies for victory. Each player can be from level 1 to level 6. Each guild can use the resources of the land to supply, arm and equip their guilds. The battle will ensue in the Lesser Faye zone between the Steamfront zone and the Greater Faye zones. Bindings will begin by Herald at 8 p.m. est on the day of battle. <br />
<br />
