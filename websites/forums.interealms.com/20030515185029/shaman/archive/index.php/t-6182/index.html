<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slowinjoo Downfoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where is a good map of Paludal?  I've leveled two-three characters there with friends and power leveling but I always stayed on the main side to shadowhaven.  WHere is shadweaver / hollowshade.  I know one side I can get to by evacing, forget which one it is.<br />
<br />
Last night I pled from 2-9 at one of the zone lines in 30-40 minutes.  Was working at my skills to keep them up but anywho, which side is which?  Because Soon I'll stopped getting PLed and need to know which side I should be heading too and sadly I don't know the differences between the sides or my way around Paludal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Evaci'ng got my wiz to the hollowshade end.  EQAtlas has the best map that I know of for this zone.  Shadeweaver's is basically take all of your right hand turns that you get to, except one that leads to a dead end room.  So if you still took that right you would be fine as long as you continues to do so.  Not an easy run for a young one, make sure he's sow'd and invised.  The phlergs add up real quick!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Winno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hello all,<br />
I am a lvl 17 Vah Shir shaman and yesterday I visited Paludal Caverns the first time.<br />
The mobs in the entrance conned yellow to me and ready to attack, also the bandits at the camp.<br />
My question: How should I even get through, for grouping or soloing. We all know shamans get inivs very late, so this is no option.<br />
As it seems I wouldn t even get near a group or a good solo place without dying. <br />
So how did you all survive there?<br />
And what would be a good tactic for soloing, especially where should I solo if no group is avaiable?<br />
And my second question is: Is sneak capped at 50 for Vah Shir? I seem to be unable to raise my skill.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I didn't use the moon to level my Shaman, but I did hit this zone with my lvl 14 warrior and a 14 cleric partner. Went in from Shadowhaven side. On Povar, this zone is pretty busy, and the bandit camp at the zone was well camped and killed, so we were able to just run right through no problems.  We crawled along the ledge trail, killing all the fiends (red/yellow con to 14, now at 17 even dk blue) They don't flee, so didn't have a problem with adds until we got a bit in and finally hit some that roved. As we moved in, we just left the shrooms alone, since they didn't agro us, and there was no shortage of fiends to kill.<br />
<br />
I get the creeping crud (3pt/tick disease, not sure if there was initial damage, never got a message saying there was) 80% of fights, even with the disease buff from cleric. Don't bother curing till fight is over, 1/2 the time you'll just get it again. Takes three low level cure disease to cure it.<br />
<br />
Haven't done anything but duo Fiends. Last time we ran back to Shadowhaven, agro'd a couple of bandits. red and yellow at 17, and backstab. barely made it to zone with no SoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sinistor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm Lvl 14 Shaman and would like to know if it's possible to solo in this area.  I've seen several posts where people at lower levels then me visit Paudal but they don't confirm whether its grouping or soloing.  Feedback would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Solo in Paludal at lvl 14 is great. IF you are in the right part of the dungeon. I would say that the Shadowhaven part is way to hard solo (as in probably imposible). I don't remember if you should be at the lake next to the Shadeweaver entrance or if it is the corridor at the Hallowshade entrance though. One of them is good at this level. Read the guide for Vah Shire Shaman on this board.<br />
<br />
/Merry who basically did lvl 9 - 26 in Paludal. Solo and in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The bandits are great xp!  You can usually get a group  there and just keep killing them.  Oooo, Yelloweyes!  I killed her more times than I could count.<br />
<br />
Really, the XP is great there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>chos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Decided to visit Padual with my 5th character in a row, and I'm rather pissed off at what I saw. Thanks to posts like these, there was 46 (FOURTY SIX) people in the zone in a monday night. That is totally insane, PC is being asked for a nerf IMO. Thanks for trying to help with the info, but all it's managed to do was continue to invite more and more people into an already over-crowded zone. 40 people between 2 bandit camps (which is what 90% of them are there for) is totally ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to bash on any one person, but the combination of people posting how godly PC is to every EQ player plain sucks. The end result is yet to come, but I fear the worst.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bammboozle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm going to throw in my 2 cents for this zone. First off, I came here as a twinked troll shammy at 15. After a couple rough starts I found a pattern that got me to 21 in 8 hours. I am twinked, which bumps my AC and mana pool, but it can be used the same for just about anyone, just at a slower pace. <br />
 Anyway, I am zoned in the Nexus so the first thing I do is buff myself with everything I got. If you can get KEI, great, if not, last buff is SoW.(you cant SoW in SH or Paladul). Go to Paladul from the SH side and take the right hand trail past the bandit camps that heads upwards. On this trail up to the peak will spawn a mushroom, a wandering fiend, and a stationary fiend at the bend/peak itself. I usually concentrated on the fiends. <br />
Root, Tainted Breath, then Spirit Strike to death. Re-root and med as needed. The trick is that your SoW'd, and you have a kite path consisting of the top of the peak(where the stationary spawn is) all the way down to the bandit camps if needed. The path literally follows the lake. If you get in trouble, zone out through SH side. the bandit camps are primarily camped 24/7, so you should rarely aggro them, and if you do, your SoW'd. Make sure to bind in the Nexus, so when SoW is going, just gate back, re-SoW, then run back to Paludal. The only times I died is when I was doing something stuiped cause I was in a hurry. At 15, I would get between 1/4 to 1/3 a yellow per yellow con. Easy experience, and pretty fun too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What's the result of posts like this? Well for one thing, all weekend I was one of anywhere from 2 to 15 people in Kurns Tower.  Took a baby Necro from 8 to 16 playing my usual an hour here, hour there pattern.  Then I decided to go to PC, like I did my last few charactors for the high teens.  Exp was lower in PC on shroons, phiends, and shroons than in Kurns ; I gave it 10 minutes (yeah, I'm a bit impatient) and gated to PoK, clicked on Cablis stone, ran 4 minutes to Kurns, and happily dinged 20 about 2 hours later.<br />
<br />
Unrest had similiarly low numbers.  Perma had no one but me and the friend I brought.<br />
<br />
Let everyone fight over the bandit spawns.  Kurn's just went to the top of my PL zone list.  But shhhh, don't tell anyone.  Don't want to find 45 people there next time I get an itch to try a different class for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mydammi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love Kurns. I never went there pre PoP, because getting there was too much hassle(never realized how good the exp was). I recently came back to everquest, and did 10-18 in Kurns with my troll shaman. The zone is simply amazing. Tons of skeletons, and they usually drop 1-3 bone chips per kill, along with research words. <br />
<br />
<br />
      The bonechips sell on torv for 5pp per stack or so, and casters always appreciate free research items. It used to be nobody was *ever* in Kurns, but i usually see 5-11 people there now. There is no &quot;mob rush&quot; and there are mobs everywhere, with *ALOT* of areas to camp. I found people here to be very polite, unlike Paludal.<br />
<br />
 Anyways, i forgot what the point of the topic was. I just love Kurns ^_^</div></div><hr />
