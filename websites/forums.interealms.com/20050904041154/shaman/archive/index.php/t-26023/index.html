<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am miserable - I don't have Balance, I never even saw the rune drop. <br />
<br />
I spent plenty of time in GoD zones, made it through the trials, did Rondo half a dozen times, practically lived in KT (I have nearly all the fun little augment drops, +3 mana, +3 health, 50 hitpoint aug, +20 AC...) did all 3 single group trials and I'm Qvic flagged. Let me just repeat this again - I saw jelki runes drop like rain and I NEVER ONCE saw the rune for Balance drop. Do Uqua - see 3 jelki runes, every twink in the guild has that one!<br />
<br />
Now my guild is finally doing the higher level GoD content - chaos runes are dropping. The same spell that any shaman with 15K can buy in the bazaar is now dropping as end game loot in the GoD expansion. Drops that the shaman in my guild rightly stay out of contention for - since we have the upgrade already.<br />
<br />
I feel like I've been playing spell catch up the last 2 expansions. OoW was the first expansion where I didn't have all my spells before the expansion launched, DoN is the second. The only GoD spell I ever got was Breath of Trushar (which I did enjoy). Everyone is always interested in the new and exciting, it is very difficult to get people to redo old content (especially content that was as unpopular as GoD). There is very little chance I will ever see this spell and after waiting 3 years and 5 expansions for an upgrade, I'm not holding my breath for the next version.<br />
<br />
Let me be perfectly clear, I could give a damn about the rune for Daluda's Mending - that spell is updated with an easy to get OoW 68 rune. I realize that Breath of Trushar is still very valuable since Spiritual Serenity is a hard to get 70 Glowing Rune - there is still an upgrade for it though!<br />
<br />
Balance is it - there is no upgrade, it is a necessity and who in their right mind wants to go back to GoD for the remote and rare chance of actually seeing it?<br />
<br />
Are there any options?? <br />
<br />
When Kunark 59-60 spells were so difficult to get, the designers did the unthinkable - they actually put the spells as drops on Velious era mobs. Sontalak and Klandicar dropped Kunark spells - an enormous boon. The additional drops in a new expansion, coupled with the fact the spells were buyable allowed more shaman access to rare spells. <br />
<br />
How about those chaos runes from GoD that shaman can't use? How about when shaman turn in Chaos runes, they get Balance?<br />
<br />
I'm also in favor of making more spells droppable. I'm a level 70 shaman, I have tons of money and NOTHING to spend it on. I would gladly buy every missing spell in my spellbook.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'm alone in my frustration, I started this poll to find out who is in my situation and I started this thread to see if we could come up with valid, fair suggestions to present to the developers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't get my Balance till a couple month ago, when a group in KT had one drop and called it out in guild.  Never have continents been transversed faster :).  The only please where I have seen the Y stone drop is KT, mainly of the mini named.  Supposedly there is a chance for it in trial 5, but I've never seen it there either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got 1 spell from LDON, 0 spells from Gates, 3 from OOW then ran out of money for runes, and hopefully 1 from the new DoN camp.<br />
<br />
Ya, spell distribution sucks IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PS - if you're one of those lucky SOBs who has the spell and wants to post about how EASY it is to get and anyone with half a brain and an ounce of effort can waltz over to GoD and pick it up - I will tell you to STUFF it and start your own thread about how this spell is easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Without making any suggestions, I'd strongly recommend to ask them to put it on a soloable mob. That way, the expansion wouldn't matter and you wouldn't have to drag people to old content. I mean, how hard is it to put a mob into the game that drops GoD runes and just the NO-DROP ones?(Were any droppable at all? It's been too long :o )<br />
The other option would be to put in on a DoN merchant so you could buy it with shards or something or make GoD runes randomly drop from the solo missions in DoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Those are good options, Giac. I'm hoping to collect some good options from posters and then create another poll where we can vote on what seems the most feasible -  present the top 3 choices to the devs. What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How about make the runes dropable?<br />
<br />
Not sure how much it will help now days but its just a idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why SOE decided to ONLY stick one type of rune on GoD raid mobs still kicks dirt in the face of common sense.  Some type of situation where you could trade in one rune for another type would be ideal.  That way instead of pleading over and over for people to repeatedly help kill yet another NamedX in KT, it should only take a week or so.<br />
<br />
The only way I got my rune for Nihil was scoping out KT for named when the zone was evacuated a month or so after OoW released.  I still consider myself damn lucky.<br />
<br />
They might as well make OoW 69/70 runes tradeable if they are looking to make some changes.  I understand SOE wanting people to spend even more time chasing runes in hopes that they will keep subscribing to EQ, but not having access to spells because of guild level, buggered drop rates, and the fact that many runes are not tradeable/researchable is just annoying and does nothing to deepen the game experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Balance is it - there is no upgrade, it is a necessity and who in their right mind wants to go back to GoD for the remote and rare chance of actually seeing it?<br />
<br />
Are there any options?? <br />
<br />
<br />
I believe I got the spell off the named Stonemite in one of the sewer progression tasks, or from a named in that instance. However, I think this was before they started making all sorts of changes to the zones as far as when named spawn and so on.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't go as far as to call Balance of Nihil a necessity... but it is a very nice spell.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen many mobs in GoD or OoW that require this spell TBH. There are a few raid level mobs in OoW that it is somewhat useful on for initial slow, but after that I use Turgur's.<br />
<br />
As far as making it more easily obtainable... Hard to say what they could do other than modify the drop rates of a particular rune type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The rune for Nihil dropped off the first named spawn we fought in the first group I had in KT, pulling stuff out of the first building from the zonein.  The named dropped the rune for Nihil, the rune for Trushar, and a +mana aug.  The group let me choose which rune I wanted and I picked the one for Trushar.  An SK friend got the other one.<br />
<br />
Then about a week later, a guildie who was with me the first time and knew I still needed Nihil logged me in to loot the rune for Nihil.<br />
<br />
My limited time in KT would have led me to suspect that the rune for Nihil wasn't all that rare, but it sounds like I was just lucky when I read everyone else's posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm preternaturally unlucky when it comes to spells (and leg upgrades).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've spent a modest amount of time in Gates content; I'm KT flagged, and have worked to get others flagged.  Been in on probably 40 kills of named mobs that are supposed to drop Gates spells.  The actual number of spells that I have seen drop is:  zero.<br />
<br />
I have the heal spell because my guildmates killed a mob in KT that dropped it, and I ran the length of the world to get it.  But of course it is obsolete; I have the upgraded heal from Omens.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, as noted, it is very very hard to get people interested in farming spells in KT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't have this spell, but I spent very little time in GoD where the rune drops<br />
<br />
Not even KT flagged (yes, STILL), but trying (yes, STILL). Have seen the boss mob of Vxed like twice, and never up close - or up close, but not for long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This spell is the pits to get ....<br />
<br />
I took 2 weeks off work to 'farm' for this spell ....<br />
<br />
Here are the confirmed places it drops:<br />
- Ferubi nameds (the same ones Rondo parts drop off, so if your guild does Rondo instead of sewers for KT flags, try to volunteer for these farming groups) ....<br />
- One only sewer trial (not worth the effort imho, Ferubi easier).<br />
- KT nameds (personally saw it from Hexxt guy, and named Hynid)<br />
<br />
I am guessing the reason the Developers keep this stone as rare is because for most classes this spell has no upgrade (although, I LOST a roll to a random enchanter that asked me if I had room in the group for XP ... and to top it off, it was a level 70 enchanter and the spell they get is an AE mez up to level 58 mobs .... I was seeing red !!!! -  lesson learnt, if farming for this spell, take some good freinds that are there for the laughs and to help you get it, don't invite somebody that is going to wanna roll !!!)<br />
<br />
To farm KT, setup near the south Temple, clear everything, then move to north temple, clear everything, rinse repeat ....<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">info: Yiktu (balance of the nihil) drops a LOT in vxed. Have rarely seen it drop in kt.  Probably more common in sewers than in kt.  So if you want it, go to vxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've spent what I'd say is a &quot;moderate&quot; amount of time looking for this one. Probably 20-30 runs through sewer trials and vxed, and I've seen 3 rune drops total. One of those was for Balance and I lost the roll to a wizzy (black ice?) If I remember right, it was the named fly in Lair that dropped it.<br />
<br />
While it would certainly be nice to have, I don't see it as anything approaching a necessity. I'm not languishing groupless in PoK because I don't have this spell, which didn't even exist a year ago.<br />
<br />
WARNING- UNPOPULAR OPINION BELOW!!!<br />
<br />
I don't think we're entitled to any spell that can't be bought off of a vendor. If they chose to make some of them disgustingly rare, then they obviously didn't intend for anybody except the unusually lucky/determined to have it. I look at spells like this much the same way as I do equipment upgrades. Time's Antithesis would be nice to have, but I don't consider it a necessity, and I'd never consider asking for them to increase the drop rate or make it drop from additional/soloable mobs. (extreme example, I know, but I'm making a point)<br />
<br />
We can either persevere and maybe get the drop one day, or forget about it and move on. Personally, I've put too many hours into it to give up now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How about an option for &quot;this spell was one of the reasons I was frustrated enough to quit the game for a year&quot;.  Whatever your views on entitlement are, this still frustrates me.  I have tried so hard to get trials groups etc but being unguilded I have 0% chance esp now.  I did a couple Vxed runs and that was as close as I ever got but I did TRY hard to place myself with groups to work thru trials and get flagged etc.  Just thinking about this d*mn thing frustrates me.  I wish there were ANY alternate way to get GoD spells at this point.  I'm willing to work for it, but please make it not requiring huge raids, months of progression and painfully rare drops.  1-groupable quests or solo quests or even just droppable expensive would be such a relief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">WARNING ~ Unpopular opinion below.<br />
<br />
Ok first off just to get this off my chest.<br />
<br />
Just because you pay your $12.95 a month does not ENTITLE you to everything the game has to offer. You are not OWED the best gear, all your spells and all the fun toys the game has to offer simply because you pay the same monthly fee as everyone else.<br />
<br />
That said, onto the topic.<br />
<br />
EQ has been and always will be a game where you have to earn your way. To an extent I agree with that princicle, however what I do not agree with is how it has been implemented. There are somethings out there that would be considered &quot;core&quot; or &quot;essential&quot; to any shaman regaurdless if that Shaman is a hardcore raider, or a casual player. IMOHO things of this type should be attainable by all.<br />
<br />
Sadly simply because of poor itemization some things that every shaman should have is as rare as hell. On the other side of the spectrum other things are pathetically easy to get for thier powerlevel.<br />
<br />
Just off the top of my head, Balance of Nihil, and the Ancient Canni from GoD were essentials!. I find it kind of ironic that people are bitching about how hard Balance is to get these days. When GoD was new the whole shaman community was up in arms becuase our new upgraded Canni, a &quot;core&quot; ability was made an Ancient spell of all things! With the release of OoW and the wide availibilty of Pained Memory SoE managed to head off a mutiny.<br />
<br />
Also please keep in mind the original skewed vision that SoE had in mind for GoD when it was released. GoD was an expansion that catered to the elite and was designed directly to give the upper tier guilds a serious challenge. The casual player was not even an afterthought.<br />
<br />
A quote from a developer at the players summit.<br />
<br />
Q: The Sewer Trials are relitively easy, yet in comparison Vexed and Tipit are brutally hard. Why is that?<br />
<br />
A: To keep the unskilled out of KT.<br />
<br />
Hell 5 levels later and several DOWNWARD adjustments to the overall difficulty of GoD, people are still bitching about how hard the content there is. Pair this with the fact that GoD runes drops are rare as hell.<br />
  <br />
I'm not surprised many are having trouble getting thier GoD spells.<br />
<br />
Balance of Nihil is a very useful spell, some would argue that it is a vital spell. I can honestly say that having it makes alot of content easier and increases our survivablity. However the fact of the matter is that it is a hard spell to aquire, and I do not think that SoE should make it any easier to get. To do so would be unfair to those who put in the time an effort to earn the spell in it's current form.<br />
<br />
Why should you be handed on a silver platter what I had to toil for? If you want the spell put in the time and effort to earn it like everyone who has scribed this spell from GoD release to today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Who's asking for anything on a silver platter? I probably made 200 AA exping in GoD - I know WHERE the damn thing drops, I NEVER saw it.<br />
<br />
50% of poll respondents (with the expansion and the appropriate level) DO NOT have this spell, 1 year after the expansion was released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I personally don't have the spell yet. its not that I haven't spent any time in these zones, I could/should probably spend more. but I spent alot of time EXPing in the sewers, and killing whatever in the non-locked zones.<br />
<br />
after I got flagged for KT, first named mob we killed (Cragbeast Rager) dropped Trushar rune for us, I won the rune and thats the only kind of rune I've ever seen drop. and that was the only one I've seen drop from one-group kill as well. others have come from raid names in ikkinz.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to have the spell for a while longer. I wouldn't complain if the spell were made easier to get. but there is already a dividing line between KT and the Barindu sewers. it doesn't need to be any wider.<br />
<br />
I don't know what rune drops are like in raid zones beyond ikkinz, I'll find out when I get there.<br />
<br />
and while we may not be entitled to spells that are dropped, I think there's something to be said about it when there is content that makes such spells nearly a requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have seem them all drop a lot.  Then again, I got my balance back in the days when the Lair named could be spawned when getting the instance and he could spawn right next to the zone in, so I farmed the hell out of that trying to get that spell and others for my guild.  For the record, I prob killed that fly 200 times and saw balance (this was in the days before they changed it to runes, back when you hoped that it dropped your spell) about 4 total times.  I usually had to kill 5 named before I saw a spell.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the point is that one day we ended up having about three shaman recruits that were missing nihil, and as such, I wasthe only one with it.  This was fine for me hehe, but not for them (i also had the only TA.. poor them).  Well, a month later, we had gotten all three of them nihil.  Your best bet I'd say glori is to run to KT after the server comes back up, and trio a few named there.  They really aren't that hard now with the new levels/gear/AAs that i know you have.  The mob that I've seen drop it a bunch of times happens to be the Cragbeast Rager or the Hynid Howler.  I can't honestly remember which one it was, but they both spawn all the time (and you can easily solo both of their phs).  That would be my suggestion to anyone wanting this spell.. go and solo them until he spawns and then find some friends.  With the new piggying rule, it's even easier to get the spells that you are missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">These you can count:<br />
<br />
7 people eliminated for not really spending much time where the rune drops<br />
<br />
17 people spent a moderate to a large amount of time in places where it drops<br />
<br />
26 people have the spell<br />
<br />
<br />
So, of the people that have responded so far and spent appropriate amounts of time to try to get the spell:<br />
<br />
~40% don't have the spell<br />
<br />
~60% have the spell<br />
<br />
Moderate to large amounts of time is subjective also. Gloriana certainly spent a significant amount of time trying to get the spell. I would question if you were in the right place to get it myself. 200 hours... you should have seen the rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I didn't get the spell until just a month ago or so.  I could never seem to get a KT group going.  By the time I got into KT, the guild I joined had moved beyond it.  <br />
<br />
It was only when the need for meldstones arose with us going into Qvic+ content that KT groups started up again.  I think it took me 3-4 trips into KT to get the stone.  At about 2-3 hours per trip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just a suggestion.  Go to the sewers in GoD, grab a plant exp.  Take a tank - almost any tank, and a tracker if possible.  Get to the hail mob for the start of the event.  Most times you can invis to her.<br />
<br />
Safe camp.  Start to kill.  When Grimy Tupelo spawns, kill him.  He will spawn at the broken wall at the end of that hall or at the entrance to that hall at the other end.  Give it a couple of rounds.  If he doesn't drop the rune, or spawn - quit the exp.  Then get a new plant, and start again.  This is how I got the spell.  At level 70 this trial is a joke.<br />
<br />
Now on the other hand, if you would like to tell me how to get all my level 70 runes without getting an RS group and losing the roll each and every time, please do.  I am at a point where I will try anything.  <br />
<br />
Honest to gawd, I have all level 66, 67, 68 and 69 spells and 1 level 70.<br />
I even have the new leopard spell.  But level 70's elude me.<br />
<br />
And I agree with the suggestion ... make the runes droppable.  I would sell my front teeth for Group Wunshi.<br />
<br />
Best of luck Glori.  On either getting Soe to change or getting the spell.  For the record, I can't remember what it was like without Nihil ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I spent a moderate amount of time in KT, have seen a decent amount of runes drop. However, the only time I seen the Nihil rune drop was off the Hynid Howler in KT (which was after I had obtained the spell). Being on FV, the runes are droppable, so I was luckily able to obtain it as soon as they started showing up in our Bazaar a few months after GoD came out.<br />
<br />
My advice, like other have said, is to camp the nameds that have been verified to drop it. From xp groups in KT, I have seen the howler pop a lot, so that might be your best bet.</div></div><hr />

I have been doing a few tipt runs to flag recruits and have been very surprised to find nameds up in KT with nobody in zone. the last three times i went there, there was 2, 4 (patch day) and 7 (patch day) nameds. one of our chanter recruit got all her spells, mana regen 3 augment and some ring 40 minutes after  finishing her first tipt run. <br />

<br />
Umm, I can accept that people are having a hard time getting the spell, but making it one of our Top 10 issues seems a bit too much.<br />
<br />
They have yet to adress half the issues and I wouldn't like to waste one on this, honestly.</div></div><hr />

Try the Vxed nameds. Set up a group to farm them, for mains or alts outside or whatever, and keep clearing them for a few hours. I got my Balance and Daladua's mending on the same run, back-to-back nameds after over 200 hours logged in GoD (mostly spent in the sewers, I used to keep track), of Umbiki and Chavroor. I used to *live* in GoD doing those trials and helping people through, and after they changed it so the runes dropped instead of the spells I still see them there, just not as often. A great Bard puller makes farming the nameds easier than a sorority girl after four shots of tequila and an 'i love you'. I've had the rune drop and brought friends in to loot it not too long ago, when gearing up some alts with friends.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want I'll find a map of Vxed, post up where some of the nameds are, and which to focus on for Nihil :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">This rune dropped quite often on our clearings of Yxxta otw to Uqua.  If you can find the named spawn points there on the West side of Yxtta, I bet you'll have more luck than in KT.  I actually got my copy in Vxed when we were working on trials but it seemed far more common in Yxxta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">rarity of spells is really an annoyance, but not really a class issue.<br />
<br />
every class would have the same problem with this, so its not a class specific issue, just a game issue.<br />
<br />
I see many of the listed issues being addressed over the last couple of expansions, there is still room for improvement of each.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The balance rune is rarest by far, I spent a fair amount of time in KT and have seen the trushar/daluda rune drop in both groups/ikk raids enough to fill the spellbooks of many mains/alts/bots and in all that time I have seen 2 more runes drop for nihli.<br />
<br />
I feel lucky to have this spell, it really is totally game-altering in the same way torpor was in kunark (esp. when you have TA). I agree the drop rate sucks and should be looked at, you have obviously done the work for it Gloriana, I feel the pain :/<br />
<br />
I found the best area for it was the large temple in KT, of the 3 I saw drop they were all from various nameds that spawn around/in the temple (been a while  - forget the names)</div></div><hr />

My Nihil came from a sewer run (seems like it was a named gnat that dropped it), and my Daluda's and Trushar came from the named hynid in KT. I ended up getting both of those on the same mob. In the time since I've had my runes, I have seen four Nihil runes. Two were in sewer expeditions, one in Vxed and one in KT. I've seen two each of the other two runes, both in KT. <br />

If you are unguilded or your guild is pre-elemental there is little chance you have Nihil.  Even shaman in high end guilds often don't have Nihil and there seem to be very few new acquisitions of it since OoW came out.<br />
<br />
I would like to see 2 polls:<br />
<br />
1.  I HAVE Nihil and was (when I acquired it):  pre-VT, VT level, Elemental, Time, Ikki+<br />
<br />
or, I do NOT have Nihil and am:  pre-VT, VT, Elemental, Time, Ikki+<br />

2.  I acquired Nihil:  when it dropped as a spell, when it dropped as a rune, after OoW was released.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, so much has changed since I stop playing EQ, I don't know whether my experiences are even valid any more, but I saw probably 4 Yiktu runes drop in KT, and probably twice as many in Vxed, but I either lived in KT for xp, or else I was helping guildmates and friends through Vxed/Tipt.

Was a real pain to get during the era that sewers had a 5 min lock out but potentially had named spawning with the instance. Read that as 80 hours of virtually no exp, getting instance after instance, checking the front part of the zone with assiduous vision, no named, get next instance.  Farmed plenty of other class spells, cracked gems of quickness and such but it was extremely frustrating.<br />
<br />
After getting Balanace of Nihil then seeking to get Breath of Trushar and Daluda's Mending was one of the factors that drove me from the game for 10 months.  But hey I came back and there was another 26 OoW spells I was missing.<br />
<br />
But as the subject says, when I am two boxing, Nihil is always loaded.  My paper tank can't survive too long toe to toe with an unslowed mob.  I malos on inc and if slow gets resisted then I immediatedly hit Nihil.  It's part of my survival plan when. <br />

It does, but not quite the way you're putting it.  If you're in a high end raiding guild you got past KT fast.  And for whatever reason they never changed the rune drop in Ikkinz/Uqua from all Jelki.  So, despite the fact that you're raiding that expansion on a nearly daily basis you do not get that spell from it.  Qvic and beyond seems to drop only ancients (which are obsolete for shaman).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Generally a newer expansion will obsolete older spells.  Hand of Vitue made it unecessary to get Blessing of Aegolism, for example.  Focus of the Seventh made it unecessary to get Khura's Focusing.  Doing current content will get you the best spell of the line and you can generally make do with the more easily attainable versions of the spell line (e.g. Aegolism or Focus of Spirit) until you get to the point were you can just concentrate on one hard to obtain spell.<br />
<br />
There have been a few spells that are not upgraded in new expansions and are hard to get.  Remove Greater Curse in the Luclin era was next to impossible for the average priest to get (at least it was tradeable).  With LDoN, they introduced a method for the masses to get the spell.  Balance of the Nihil is a similar situation to RGC.  It's a spell that has not been obsoleted by newer spells.  It's hard to get in it's original form even after allowing for mudflation from increased levels and gear.  There needs to be an updated way for Shamans to get this spell in the context of current content.  Just like it made no sense to drag a group away from LDoN to get RGC when LDoN was current, it makes no sense to drag a group away from OoW or DoN now that GoD is not current.<br />
<br />
If Beastlords are getting a -MR slow, it better not be any easier to get than Nihil unless there is an equally available Shaman equivilant introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I got mine during the &quot;save 30 aa&quot; push just before OoW went live.

I lost the roll on the first, then was given the 2nd since no one needed. <br />
<br />
My take on the spell is not too differnt from others. It needs to be put in a more applicable spot for the content. KT is not a great grouping zone anymore. People dont care for sewer runs either. Vxed is reasonable, but a couple more locations would be nice. I dunno about &quot;buyable&quot; in any form though.</div></div><hr />

Clear the large room at zone in.  The first hallway going north has three wanderers in it; pulling them single takes some attentiveness.  Clear that hallway as it goes north, west, and then north.<br />
<br />
Before you get to the next room, you will have killed about 15 mobs, which triggers the names to spawn.  Two spawn spots are easily accessible.  One will be behind you at this point, in the middle of the north-south hallway connecting to the zone-in room.  Another will be just ahead of you, in the northeast corner of the room down the stairs.  If you get a named, kill it; if both spots spawn as ordinary mobs, zone out and request a new version of the instance to try again with.<br />

I tried this probably 20 times in all, and never saw the rune drop.  I guess there is some indication that rune drops have been increased?  Maybe, maybe not.  At any rate, that's two named spots you can reach and kill with your duo.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">you can get 69 runes in MPG, WoS, RCoD and RSS, you can get 70 runes in MPG, RCoD, and RSS, and while I do raid rune droppers in OoW, I see greater/glowing rune drops in RSS consistently from one-group named mobs. no raiding required.<br />

Ancients, on the other hand....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">When they said they upped the drop rate in the last patch did it have a major effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Chethak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Assumed you'd know I was talking about ancients, but even the glowing, 75% of the drop mobs are technically &quot;Raid Encounters&quot; according to EQBestiary... &amp; I don't personally enjoy pulling what's technically a raid encounter with a group... if I'm exping that kind of mob takes too bloody long to kill, when you kill it at all &amp; it doesn't wipe your group, &amp; every time a mob like that wipes a group I'm in they spend 30 minutes recovering, 15 minutes deciding what to do, &amp; then inevitably they wander off somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Just saying, most of these spells are a pain unless you have a pocket tank with 12k HP or more... I'm sure every shaman has one of those tucked in his or her pocket though... *rolls his eyes*<br />
<br />
anyone *nobody* addressed my true question last time so I guess I'll ask again...<br />
<br />
I know there's some zones that you have to be flagged for in GoD just to get to... anyone know if the spells drop more commonly there? that would be nice.<br />
<br />
when someone asks a question like that &amp; the only response is that they're &quot;talking out their azz about OoW rune drops&quot; you know the people you are talking to are obsessed with omens... geez get a clue I have questions about more than omens content... which, at this point I actually consider boring, you practically have to DRAG me out there for a group...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I keep losing rolls for group focus - it taunts me so. I'm doing pretty well with the 69s though, only Ice Age left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So who, exaclty, do you want to have answer your Omens questions? Toons who have never been there?</div></div><hr />

Our guild is doing Yxxta raids every week at this point, plus a couple times a week killing three to five Kod'Taz names as we happen to spot them.  In the last three weeks I suppose I've seen ... hmmm ... 30 or 40 named mobs die.  And I've seen I think five spell stones.  Two of which were the one for Nihil.<br />
<br />
That's not a big enough sample to do statistics on, but if that's an improved drop rate, it still isn't common.</div></div><hr />
