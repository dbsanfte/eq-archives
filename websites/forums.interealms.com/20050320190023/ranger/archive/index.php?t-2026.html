<br />
The producers know this movie will make money but only from kids who will see anything with horror and action, an purist of the genre.  Why waste the money past getting the word out?<br />

I met Kane Hodder (Jason) several years ago, and  according to him they were working on a script to join Jason and Freddy. <br />

Jasons brawn, Freddy's brains? Awesome combo there</div></div><hr />
