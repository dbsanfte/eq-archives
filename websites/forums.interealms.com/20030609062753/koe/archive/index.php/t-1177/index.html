<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a two group raid in Icewell Keep below Thurg. (Your Dorf faction will not be changed). Petitioners and KoE welcome.<br />
<br />
We plan to crawl the zone and wack the baddies down there for xp and quest gems. (Gems will go to the guild gem bank). I don't know if we will have enough to take a shot at the bear, but will see how the groups shake out. The mobs here hit reasonably hard and have a lot of hps. Spells are known to drop here as well. <br />
<br />
Levels for the raid are 53 and up. (Many mobs here are level 51-53). <br />
<br />
Meeting place to start the raid is on the bridge as you enter Thurg. Once you join the raid force, it will be hard to leave and to get others in (depends on what we get for a raid force), so I am asking for a 4 hour commitment, although the raid may not go that long. (I might have to make adjustments, depending on critical classes)<br />
<br />
I ask that each participant bring some dots for the cleric/chanter. If we get a CoH mage, I will take care of the pearls.<br />
<br />
Raid force listed below: I will update as we get people to sign up..<br />
<br />
Raid force: *NEW UPDATE*<br />

<br />
What a response!<br />
<br />
Well, I might have an idea on how to work this out.. We currently have 5 druids that would like to come, but no enchanter to start with Moe being the earliest at 8:30 CST..<br />
<br />
If the force does not mind, I would like to run Eisherz. If you have a concern, please feel free to voice it (or send me a PM); I won't take offense and would totally understand. <br />
<br />
Did an update at the top with this plan in mind.. :)<br />
<br />
With such interest and the fact that there is now a standby list, I might explore the possibility of bringing in a 3rd group specificially to kill the Grizzly down there later in the evening. Last time we did him, I believe we had 3 groups (might have been a bit more) and 4 clerics were on the raid. He killed 3 or 4 melee and ran 3 clerics down to oom. He can't be slowed and basically is very MR.. The second time we tried him in the night, we did not have as strong of a force and round 2 went to the Grizzly. Very nasty. Problem is the zone is not big enough to support more than a couple of groups; except more is need to wack him. <br />
<br />
One other thing to mention.. you should be non-KoS to the dwarves for this raid. The reason for this is to prevent unwanted agro from the dwarfs above to down below. I was informed this has happened to some people that were KOS to the dwarves and they got to a certain part of the dungeon and agroed the court from above. I know that there have been agro problems down below up to the court in the past, so was wanting to avoid this problem. If there is a problem, you have over a week to fix it.. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the interest and I am looking forward to this even more now.. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Looks good so far. I have been back through here the other night and some memories came back. Respawn rate is fast in here and it promises to be a fast paced night. <br />
<br />
There are 4 basic mobs in Icewell Keep for those of you who have never been. All will summon, so it can be nasty on healers/casters.<br />
<br />
Ice Spikes are tentacles as your standard caster type mob that likes to hurl you away and then summon you back. These are not messable, but can be charmed. They will be the first target of choice when confronted with more than one mob. If we have two, will probably go with an add tank, given our force mix. <br />
<br />
Frosty Cubes are a melee mob that can be mezzed. <br />
<br />
Skeletons are also down there and are standard melee undead. Also mezzable<br />
<br />
Golems are standard golems found elsewhere. Resistant to magic (but you can get it to stick) hard to mez. These will be the second mob of choice behind the tentacles. <br />
<br />
All have typical velious type hps.. (a lot). <br />
<br />
Gem drops have been good down here and also there are some good spells that drop here as well (including improved camo/invis). <br />
<br />
To Confirm: This is on Tuesday, 12 June and starts at 7 CST. Please be on time.. :)<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing everyone there and rocking the house!</div></div><hr />

We might be done celebrating by 8 PM *wink* but better for me to step aside for whoever’s next up on the standby list.<br />
<br />
I'll check in if possible, but I may be buzzed on bubbly or otherwise distracted...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Math, as much as I would love to have you, the raid force is full with a standby list. I also posted this to be a level 53+ raid and while I can perhaps see a bit of leeway, 4 levels is a lot in this case.. :(<br />
<br />
You are a good cleric who has made a lot of headway in leveling herself up.. keep plugging away at it and you will be there and I can't wait for the chance to play with you.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Just wanted to say thanks to the raid attendies last night for both being promptly on time and also for a great raid and revisit to Icewell Keep. <br />
<br />
The raid netted several gems and spells for the guild and while it was not really a stated objective of the raid, the big nasty bear got nailed last night. <br />
<br />
For those of you who do not remember, the last time we did the bear, we had at least 20 people and that included 4 clerics and casualties were somewhat heavy the first time and the raid force got wiped the second time we tried him. The bear is level 60 and is very nasty. <br />
<br />
Last night, Cshae joined the raid force to help us take this big nasty down and we took it down with 14 people (2 clerics) and while it was a wild fight, the only casualty was Waran when the enrage got him. Congrats to Luda on the claws.. :)<br />
<br />
Also good to see Nindalf who joined us as a Sorcerer! (level 60). Nin, I know this has been a long time goal for you and congrats are in order.. :)<br />
<br />
As posted elsewhere, we were able to help a KoE petitiioner who had fallen into the pit (Noggulbok). <br />
<br />
All in all, a fun night and I again appreciate the interest in this raid.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">It was a vey good night Kly. Lots of fun, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As I remember it Kly we had over 30 people the first time we fought the bear and killed it...barely. The second fight we were down several people and got wiped. Now last night I gave Kly a 75% chance that we would get wiped. I must say I was most amazed when we killed it. The only one who could nuke it was Nin with her lure of lightning (I think). We had made 12 mod rods before the fight and I kept making them during the fight. Nin said she nuked it about 15 times with the help of the mod rods. I also saw others using them during so it looks like that helped a lot.<br />
<br />
I continue to be amazed at how higher level characters make such a huge difference but nonetheless it does. Goodie for us :)</div></div><hr />
