<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading through the suggestions as they stand and some are good some are way off track.  As a shaman for the last four years I know that I started the class because I liked to help people and offering my services to them was my ability to move the group forward.     <br />
<br />
The reason I started the class was because I was helping out my community and others xp faster.  It was a good feeling to log in and contribute something to all the differant classes.  It was a defining ability that made the class so enjoyable.  The versatility of being a jack of all trades.  We could crowd control somewhat, slow, heal just enough to make things work.  <br />
<br />
If a group couldn't find the right class for the make up you throw a shaman into the mix and you could always get the job done.  We didn't take on the role of another character, we just seemed to fill in the blanks if that one class was not be available. <br />
<br />
I can't really say that I know what it is I personally want besides that feeling of walking into a group and knowing that I could fill a useful role.  I think all classes want that and should ultimately get it. <br />
<br />
One thing I do know though, is that I didn't start this class for the following reasons. <br />
<br />
If I wanted great nukes I would have been a wizard. If I wanted great heals I would have been a cleric.  If I wanted to be a pet class I would have been a magician. <br />
<br />
I do like to melee, I do like to cast, I like to solo and group.  I like the versatility of the shaman cause you can do many things given differant circumstances.  <br />
<br />
I liked the class because of the subtle underlying aspects in the game.  A shaman could make or break a group.  By this I mean we were the fuel enjection for an already well oiled engine.  Sure a group could get it done, but with a shaman you optimized the group. <br />
<br />
By optimizing I mean we made up for the other class short comings or we highly polished them.  For example if you had a cleric with a crappy mana pool and you were in a chain pulling xp group.  The shaman could add slows and spot heals into the mix to compensate.  Shaman could also keep crowd control somewhat with roots and slow if an enchanter wasn't available.  We had decent buffs and a haste that could make things work out. <br />
<br />
I see the shaman class as a sublte change that would give the adventurers the advantage to win.  With slow, buffs, and debuffs it was an advantage to have them around.  It made things more streamline and unltimately faster and easier.  <br />
<br />
That being said I guess what I am looking for is clarification now.  The subtle changes that made me wanted, have now been taken away.  There was no definition what I do in a group.  I have to now ask what it is I exactly need to do.  I try to fit into the group, rather than making them streamline.  Half the spells I used to mem don't make a differance.  With maxed this and that who needs buffs.  With mitigated slows and resists, who has mana left to heal.  When a heal is cast and it doesn't make a diffferance why cast it. <br />
<br />
These are the things that are making this proposal so frustrating for me.  The shaman was a subtle advantage to make things better.  We really didn't do a big bang, but a little of everything thing to make an overall differance.  That is why I find this proposal so difficult to answer.  We did to many things to put done just a couple of changes to really make things worth changing.  Now that other classes can take care of those sublte things we really aren't needed.  I don't know what the answers are, but from my personal experience and opinion we need to address some things.  The current state of the game leaves people asking exactly why is it I started this class again?  <br />
<br />
This was a frustrating class to play before, but it was enjoyable to see the differances we made.  We have to change out gem slots more than any other class.  We were given three differant spell line ups.  Debuffs, Buffs, and utility spells.  This means we had to switch out spells more than all other classes.  When you get to a group you buffed, than you had to transition to debuffs and other common offensive spells.  Keep crowd control utlity spells going, all while hitting a canna button.  We had definately worked for the subtle differance and made the differance in the outcome.  <br />
<br />
Now we have buffs that aren't worth meming.  Spells we have, other classes have too.  We can regen mana, but have nothing worthwhile to cast.  <br />
<br />
I personally feel SOE has taken us for fools.  We were out in the gray before and now there just isn't a clear vision why this class exists.  I feel that I pretty much just wasted four years.  I don't know what is more embarrasing, dying for the first time using cannabilization in a group or playing this class this long and getting this after four years. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rascalan, there is no way that we will all agree on anything. Personally, I think our slow is just fine and I think shaman melee in the elemental planes is just suicide.<br />
<br />
We had a poll, people voted. I took the top 5 issues to focus on. The great strength of our class is our versatility, the fact that we can all play our shaman different ways makes it really hard to come to any sort of consensus.<br />
<br />
This lack of consensus has HURT us. The last time we united, we got those lousy group str/dex spells removed. <br />
<br />
When we randomly ask for nukes or heals or better pets or dots or slows or improved cripple or group FA, we accomplish nothing.<br />
<br />
Besides polling the Crucible shaman, finding out the issues which most of us identify with...what is your suggestion for proposing some solutions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gloriana, <br />
<br />
Sorry I am not trying to knock what it is you are doing. The hard work you have done is greatly appreciated.  <br />
<br />
The only thing I would like SOE to realize, is that giving us a raise without taking into account the cost of living increase, really isn't a raise.<br />
<br />
We keep getting these new upgrades that are worthless. <br />
<br />
I for one feel that giving us buffs that matter, debuffs that are useful, and the ability to manipulate our slows would change things.  <br />
<br />
Having to cast malos and than slow and still getting resists is straight up retarded. When other classes out there can land slows in one shot for less mana. <br />
<br />
How this should be handled is up to the developers.  I play this game for entertainment, let them figure out how the nuts and bolts work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I had my way, it would be all mana regen and bigger nukes because that would make the game more fun for me. :)<br />
<br />
I had to be fair, I went with the top issues. <br />
<br />
This doesn't have to be the only feedback SOE gets from shaman. If you have your own issues, use the feedback command! Submit comments to the developer's forum. Get on with your bad melee shaman self :)<br />
<br />
If it's okay with you, I'd like to lock this thread since the front page is getting kind of filled up with suggestion threads. Please feel free to repost your comment in the new Proposal thread stickied to the top of the forums.<br />
<br />
If you'd like me to re-open this thread, PM me and I'd be happy to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Re-opened per poster's request.<br />
<br />
I did change the title though. Rascalan says he wants to talk about our class as a jack of all trades, but I don't want this thread to subvert the proposal thread.</div></div><hr />
