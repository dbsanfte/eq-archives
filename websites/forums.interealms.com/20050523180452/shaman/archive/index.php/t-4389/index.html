<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hubu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or has anyone else noticed a lack of decent arms between JB and PoG/SS/Thurg/Kael? I havn't found any that have a decent AC yet some wisdom on them... any suggestions? I'm still using JB and it's kind of embarassing at 55 ::eek:<br />
<br />
And to answer a  previous question I forgot to answer on my introduction thread, I picked that &quot;angry face&quot; that's on this post also just because for some reason it looks... funny  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. - Have any Cazic Thule Troll shamans turned in enough bone chips to the iksars to start the Cudgel quests? I've turned in 660 so far and not even changed to threateningly. (Yeah yeah, I know it'll take more than that to change my faction, I was just hopeful since I'm CT.. and Iksars are CT.. eh, you get the picture.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no, I haven't noticed the lack of good shaman arms.   <br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin, Barbed Ringmail, Hardened Grey Flesh all seem to be good arms that are buyable and in some cases better than Thurg/SS/Kael.  <br />
<br />
There is also WW dragon arms, Gladiator Chain Sleeves, the new player crafted chain sleeves.   <br />
<br />
Personally, I am skipping SS sleeves and gonna wear Crystal Chitin or Hardened Grey Flesh until I get the Spirit Wracked Cord.<br />
<br />
If you are a wisdom shaman and has to have wisdom on every armor item, I would look at barbed ringmail sleeves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hubu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahh, thanks. I generally go for high ac but also want wisdom on it, considering my wisdom is roughly 205 now without bear form, and everyone else seems to have higher at this level. I'll look into the barbed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My wisdom is currently 193 without bearform or other buffs, and wearing my JBB (hunting setup, I wear wolfcallers bracer for raids).  I have no problems and I have some NToV gear as well.  Why do you think that 205 unbuffed is doing poorly?  Stick with the ac, or get some ac/hp arms.  Or just break down and join a raid to get upgrades.  JB arms are respectable, nothing to be embarrassed about.  I like CC arms a bit better myself since they have some stamina as well.  Currently I'm wearing Wolfcallers vambraces and saving guild points for a shot at Oynx vambraces (insert godly stats/ac here).</div></div><hr />
