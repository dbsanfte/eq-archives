<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Terabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like to invite you all to my webpage of UI Mods and Packages, also Forum's were added yesterday :) Enjoy<br />
<br />
Terabar's UI Project Website (http://terabar.robhines.com)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Great UI! Except how do you open your spellbook besides /book? You took off the open spell book icon from the spell gem strip /Bonk. Other than that I love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Terabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well i took it out because i use control B to open the book up.. im sure there are other mods with spell book icon or i can add it back just goto the website and post a request :) thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there anyway i can get you to e-mail me a spell gem strip with the open spell book icon on it? Also, i really like the built in pet command window that you have replaced with a game timer. Is there a way to replace the timer with the old pet window? Also I'd like to get rid of the /pet go away command and replace it with /pet report health. So it would have these commands...<br />
<br />
/pet guard here<br />
/pet report health<br />
/pet follow me<br />
/pet attack<br />
/pet back off<br />
<br />
I love your UI so much and those 2 additions would be uber cool. I can't see myself using any other one because yours has everything Ive been looking for excpet of course 2 little changes. <br />
<br />
Thanks Alot!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Terabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First of all if you dont want the timer and you want the old pet window up, go into the directory where you placed My UI Pak and delet the file EQUI_PETINFOWINDOW.XML.. then next time you loadup the TeraSkin it will have the original pet window... as for your 2nd request ill try to work something up and email to you but not sure when i can have it done as im working on other projects at the moment.  And if you want a new spellbook box i suggest going to EQInterface and checking their downloads, if i can get time ill work something up for that and will link it on my webpage :) thanks..</div></div><hr />
