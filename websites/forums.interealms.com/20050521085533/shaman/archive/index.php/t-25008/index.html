<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at level 13, and can't seem to find any quests to do for decent gear or experience.  Anyone in a similar position?<br />
<br />
(I'm in Qeynos, level 13 shaman.  About 400 HP with self-buffage.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Run through almost any town inside Qeynos and look at those people that are talking your ear off as you walk by.<br />
<br />
If you spend 30 minutes running through Nettleville Hovel, Castleview Hamlet, Oakmyst Forest, Baubleshire, Graystone Yard and even South/North Qeynos you will have more quests than you know what to do with. (You can either plough your way through them or delete the greens and move on to the white/orange/reds)<br />
<br />
Another thing is, a lot of those green quests flag you to get a higher level quest from the same person. (So when you do your turn ins for quests, be sure and hail the person again to see if there's another quest available.)<br />
<br />
Hailing the guards and NPC's roaming around Antonica is a great way to get quests from 13-20 too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The green quests do give a good amount of xp and good loot too.  At level 16 I upgraded my belt when I completed an Oakmyst quest while running around mining/foresting/etc.  The quest gave about 4% xp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Qeynos Harbor has great quests too.  Don't judge a quest by the con in your journal unless its obviously just a &quot;courier&quot; style quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once you get to 15-16, you can do the &quot;Amulet of the Prime Healer&quot; quest in Vermins Snye...decent item and the xp from the quest (and esp the killing for the quest) was excellent at 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should be checking alla's for every zone you're in.  Almost all my equip has been quested.  Sorry to plug another site, but they kick butt in this regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where does this one start?  I have spent a while in Vermins Snye and haven't seen this one yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is my favorite quest spoiler site (forgive me if I've posted this elsewhere here, I've been cross-pollinating a few other EQ2 shm boards lol)...Nice thing about this site is it can be sorted by level, starting city, etc, and there are also maps with coordinating points to show where the quest NPCs and mobs are.<br />

<br />
I did the Balance of Life (Qeynos) quest last night at level 15 with a mage friend, but it could have easily been soloed.  Reward was 3sp+, a fairly nice 2H great hammer I can use soon, and approximately 30% exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Prime Healer quest starts at zone-in to Vermin's.  There's a &quot;Brother&quot; gnome who gives the quest.  You kill 20 scorpions and 10 snakes (crypt lech, and something burrowers).  Nice neck piece.  Mobs are basically the first ones you come to when you go down the halls.  Careful not to aggro the skellies in the alcoves.  Shillers (bats) will also sometimes aggro.  <br />
<br />
BTW, don't try to solo it.  These mobs are &quot;group&quot; mobs.  I thought since they were blue I might be able to pull it off @ lvl 15...nope.  You will need a tank, and possibly one other person to do it successfully/quickly. <br />
<br />
There's also another quest killing the cubes down the hall from the mobs in this quest.  It's just coin (silver/cp), but the xp is pretty good killing them.  Inspect the box on the table as you go down the hall.  This will give you the quest.  I also received another drop for a quest while doing this, killing bloodsabres, that I didn't do because of time.  You also will get a shot at some adept spells and advanced tradeskill volumes as drops, so this area is worth going to, and usually doesn't have the crowd that BB does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the info about that quest site and the quest itself! :)  Turns out I had already completed a lot of the healer quest but I had forgotten  the name of it.<br />
<br />
I think I solo'd one of the lech's at level 17, barely (green^^) but very easily duo'd with my brawler partner.  Beware of EQ2 poisons though, wow, they work right quick!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I find the number of quests I can do that are orange or white or even blue decreases as I gain in levels. I'm now level 21.<br />
<br />
I've done 186 quests so far. Trying to catch up to my friend who has 198. I've even done the courier ones.... anyhoo. Once you get higher in level, the quests that give real rewards tend to come from chests off of mobs (for example, a foul wind, freedom), or from saving distressed merchants and buying books... and the level 20 armour quests, which are a REAL pain in the rear, but will probably take all of my time until level 30.<br />
<br />
I miss the days when you could gather 50 quests just by running through a zone. These days, they are further and further between and some of them involve either a) gathering 100 ores and lumber (These boots are made for walking) or b) finding a rare double up mob and killing it (the windstalker rumbler) or c) go farm these mobs until a rare version pops and then kill that (armour quest #1, outside qeynos creature quest).<br />
<br />
I miss the &quot;go kill lots of even cons and run around&quot; style quests, those are quicker to do and less of a pain and frustration.</div></div><hr />
