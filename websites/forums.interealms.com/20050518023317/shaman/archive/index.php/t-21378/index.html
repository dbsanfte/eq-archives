<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a quick question....I know what the answer will be but I am gonna ask )<br />
<br />
I'm edging toward MC3 and once I have that, standard policy dictates that canni5 is the next AA to get.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering if that is the best investment? I rarely seem to have mana problems. Yes I am busy clicking canni4 much of the time, but unless I am in a chain pulling BoT grp, and am nuking heavily I rarely get below 25 mana. Even after a wipe I am the first back up to FM even without kei. <br />
<br />
I am not in a raiding guild, and mostly am grping in BoT for xp, trying to wring out some AAs since I recently dinged 65......<br />
<br />
When exactly do you guys find canni5 to be indispensible? I imagine for buffing raids it would be useful, but if thats the only place, then maybe I should get something else first?<br />
<br />
Advice much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm in a similar position, not in a raiding guild, dont have MGB, and yet I do find it a great boon.<br />
<br />
I always try to stay above 80% mana, for that &quot;just in case&quot; factor, except when I'm solo grinding and I know how much mana I'll be using per mob.<br />
<br />
I find it really handy to be able to buff the group, summon and buff dogdog, and then canni 5 to start reclaiming that mana. it also means that I'm not constantly canning like I used to, so I can chat with people without having one word replys.<br />
<br />
Also it great for scaring the crap out of your group when you head into a dungeon and cast it for the first time! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ashkani <br />
<br />
Canni V is a funny aa when you don't have it. It seems like a waste when you are doing ok on mana in groups. It is the best aa you will get though. Buy it as soon as you can and learn to use it when it pops.<br />
<br />
Pretty soon it will become instinctive and it will help mold you into a better shaman. Where you are doing ok now with canni 4 and nuking etc. you will find you are able to do more, and perform better with the extra mana.<br />
<br />
It's really useful, it just takes a little time to see its worth. If you ever solo it is invaluable.<br />
<br />
The best example I can give you is not to focus on when things are going well, but when things go badly and you usually wipe. Is that because you go oom? I really love Canni V for when things are going badly and I am chain healing on overpulls, its so easy to just pop Canni V and get more mana.<br />
<br />
I am not really explaining this very well. I would recommend you get it and figure out what it means. While I might disagree with some of the posters on this board they were the ones who told me it is a class defining aa and you should get it. They were right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Canni5 is like a corner stone of the shaman, i use canni5 every time it pops, the extra mana can be used for a few heals or some extra dots yes it will be the best AA you ever get, well atleast until you get MGB so you can MGB talisman of the serpent  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">25m won't do you much on an over pull. Get Canni 5, go straight to it and get it ASAP. It's &quot;standard policy&quot; because it is our BEST AA ability. When the rest of the group is OOM and out of breath,  you can calmly stand there, click a button, and gain ~1k mana. Slap on Q (if you have it) and you're off to the races. Canni 5 will change the way you play your shaman. I mash it every time it pops, heh. My life is now lived in 3 minute increments.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im like Haleice; I like to keep my mana as close to 60% as possible.  If something goes wrong, thats usually enough mana to be able to get things back under control.  It shouldnt be that way, but our spells are so damn mana expensive and thats usually what it takes.  <br />
<br />
You'll be amazed at how Cannibalize AA will change your play style.  Its tantamount to getting Canni at level 24 and the changes that brought to your playing.  Get it and learn to use it.  You wont be sorry that you got it.  Well, untill you kill yourself with it.  I havent killed myself with it yet, but I have knocked myself unconcious with it once.  That was pretty funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought the same thing about canni 5 when I was working my first AA, but I forged ahead figuring every shaman who had it saying it was the best AA we have, they can't all be wrong.<br />
<br />
They're not.<br />
<br />
You won't understand until you actually do it, so I won't try to explain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Canni5 &gt; all other aa's<br />
<br />
No coment necessery</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'll echo what all the others have said.  Right now you may have no problems with mana, but when you have more mana (via cann5) you can do so much more.  Worst case scenario is you don't use your extra mana and you get a break from mashing the cann4 key ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I personally dont waist my time chain clicking Canni4 anymore.  Canni5 Is great, just click it, Quiesence and keep doing whatever it is you do.  <br />
Its like a cell phone, once you have it, you cant seem to live without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can5 is THE AA for a shaman. Shaman have a tendency to balance themselves to the amount of mana they need vs the mana they have. Its a unconcious equalibrium achieved through a need to balance your ability so you dont go OOM at a bad time. However, when you get can5 and are able to increase your mana, you will see you can be more then a buff machine. You can add DPS, you can add FA and higher haste to your spell cycle. Nukes,rains, DoT's all start to be easier to add to the mix and stacking DoT's on bigger fights is a serious plus to your group. Not to mention that part 1 of a 2 part reason as to why shaman are so hard to kill, is cause of the Ca5 AA. Add this with Topor or Quiscence or BoT and you can just keep going and going. We cant kill well no, but we can sure be a pain in the arse to kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trust us. Its not a dictation of shaman etique, its simply logical. You will not regret can5... Ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Let me put it to you this way. In the groups that I get myself into, I am casting...ALWAYS casting. Debuffs, Slows, Dots, Nuke, FA, Haste, Heals. I don't have the time to hit Cann 4 all day long. But, Cann 5 is quick easy and gets you lots of mana quickly. <br />
<br />
I too thought as you did, even put it off for a couple other thing thinking, &quot;It's the same ratio as Cann 4!&quot; Don't make the same mistake I did!<br />
<br />
Besides, used in conjunction with Cann 4 you are a mana making machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">erm, aside the fact (yes, its really a fact :)) that cani-aa is the very best one we get, make sure you have enough HPs to be able to use it without getting low hp aggro  :D <br />
<br />
and yes, nothing is better than being in a tight situation, hitting THE button and being able to contribute a bit more to solving the issue :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another point people didnt mention is the absolutely LESSENED amount you will need to Canni 4. In todays EQ, fast fights, move around a lot (LDoN, Gates trials, even lower ones) it can be a PAIN in the buttocks to stop, canni 4, run a bit while it refreshes, repeat ad nauseum. I only use Canni 4 now if I am under 80 and C5 isnt gonna light up soon. When it does light up, if I am over 80 m, I find somehting useful to cast (maybe FA on someone, or a nuke, or a buff I tend to ignore like regen) then Canni 5 it ALL back. Honestly, its just amazing. You will never be able to live without it.<br />
<br />
As a funny side note, I recently started helping a RL friend on another server, I use her 55 shaman to PL her rogue, and I am CONSTANTLY looking for my Canni 5 button, LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have seen several people ask if Canni 5 was all that good and some said they were going some other route first. Every single one of them when they got canni 5 eventually came back here and said I was wrong, you were right, canni 5 really is the best AA, bar none. If that doesn't convince you I don;t know what will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">canna5 allows you to actually socialize with your friends while playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I remember when can V almost killed me if I didnt have any buffs on. Of course that's different now.</div></div><hr />

Its a horrible grind to get that many AAs, especially having just ground ordinary xp straight up to 65 ;)<br />

Its a great feeling not having to chain cast can4 anymore, I still have it memmed for an emergency, but I just hit Canni 5 every 3 mins and i'm good to go. I'm only 62 atm, so I don't have Q but torpor works just fine. I'm at a little over 3.2k self buffed, or with Virtue (which is another great thing) i'm at about 4800 So I have plenty of hp for Canni 5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Cannibalisation is:<br />
- an extra 1000 mana item that does not take up a slot<br />
- a spell haste item - every time you use it you basically save about 40 seconds of canna time<br />
- a FT 30 item that does not take up s lot<br />

I never thought I needed it too much either, heck I hardly ever got kei, after it makes a nice difference, especially when soloing you can crank out more dps with less downtime later. My favorite use for it though is after awipe and cleric is oom from all of the rezzes you can heal everyone, buff them all back up and still be back at FM before anyone else is near 50m.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Insight-Stromm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Best AA ever. Doesn't matter how you play EverQuest, assuming you spend mana anyway.

Your LDoN groups move from waiting on you to waiting on the Cleric to mana up before starting.  You get to DoT and FA regularly.  Life is better.<br />

Oh, MC 2 and 3 are certainly among our worst archtype AAs but just look at the whole package. Is Cannibalisation worth 17 AAs? For me it certainly was and is. I would gladly pay 50 more AAs to get the delay on it halved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Group, Faster manna with canni 5 and 4 i find i can drop more dots and nukes , causing more damage and meaning more xp from faster kills, Also if the err poop hits the fan and everyone is 00m a quick canni 5 may give you that manna for a few heals that may keep the group alive.<br />
<br />
       Solo, When soloing time can be a huge factor, casting canni 4 , over and over and over can work but its so much easier to back of hit canni 5 quiesence and back in, for example when i solo Blobs in CT and need the manna (rarely) its a case of root, canni quies , i still canni 4 too but after 65 lvls i cant say i miss spamming it.<br />
<br />
        Not the best info and my first post here hehe, But yes to the point go for canni  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm going to take a stab and say that three times now the situation has been critical, last tank is barely standing, patch healers are oom or otherwise disabled, CH chain has been temporarily derailed: Pop CanV with less than full health not even healing myself though I'm down to like 30% (the next AE might kill me), spam patch heals with the little bit of extra mana I now have, and see the mob lose it's remaining 3% health because the CHeal chain is now recovered and the tank is still in play.  Of course, we're on things like Vindi, Grieg, Dozer, RC, and DS, but it's raids like that where a single patcher can make the difference.  What a rush.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sonechka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Ok, so my indecisiveness is this... I see here all the reasons why CanniV is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm also aware, this is our greatest AA. Now that i've done my required Archtype AA's, and i'm moving into class, my dilemma is this: <br />
<br />
I've found myself in more situations where MGB would be a greater asset. I raid heavily and i've found that trying to group buff a full raid force is 1) time consuming and 2) a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
So i find myself in the position on trying to decide between the holy canniV and MGB. At this point i'm at, i'm seeing MGB as a greater assest. Arguments to this decision? I'd love to hear them. I'd really rather do what's best for my group/raid at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The previous 48 posts pretty much argue the decision nicely.<br />
<br />
Can 5 helps you with everything you do, including buffing large raid groups. Get Can 5, then get MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Sonechka, I was in that exact position when it came down to it ... for a LONG time, I was the only shaman on 90% of our raids (and we raid 4-5 days a week most weeks), where we'd have 5-8 groups turn out for whatever we decided to go kill. Buffing group-by-group was PAINFUL ... but canni 5 made it easier. So I grabbed Canni 5, and ground out those 9 AA's as quick as I could instead of going for other AA that I wanted. Yes, it would be best for your guild to get MGB, but it would not be best for your guild to have a shaman that couldn't regen mana quickly. Get Canni 5, and then get MGB. That way, once you have MGB, you can MGB FO7, hit Canni, and finish the rest of the groups off with support buffs.<br />
<br />
Course, now, I have so many shaman come to guild raids I don't know what to do with them all. :) It's great to tell the channel, &quot;OK guys buff up&quot; and 30 seconds later your raid has the works and there are still two shaman saying they have fresh MGB in case we get debuffed. :p (BTW they all got Canni 5 first).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Ok, so my indecisiveness is this... I see here all the reasons why CanniV is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm also aware, this is our greatest AA. Now that i've done my required Archtype AA's, and i'm moving into class, my dilemma is this: <br />
<br />
I've found myself in more situations where MGB would be a greater asset. I raid heavily and i've found that trying to group buff a full raid force is 1) time consuming and 2) a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
So i find myself in the position on trying to decide between the holy canniV and MGB. At this point i'm at, i'm seeing MGB as a greater assest. Arguments to this decision? I'd love to hear them. I'd really rather do what's best for my group/raid at this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
MGB - quick single buff, useful on raids and when sitting around PoK.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 - Mana, Group Mana, Solo Mana, Buffing Mana, Raiding Mana, Avoid the TPW Mana, Mana to Waste for no good reason, Mana to waste for a good reason, Scaring Clerics and Druids while getting extra Mana, Having Mana while the cleric gripes about OOM and no KEI. <br />
<br />
The biggest reason of all, Canni 5 will turn you into a mana machine which makes grinding the AAs for MGB much easier. While MGB doesn't do anything to help get the AAs for Canni 5.<br />
<br />
A normal risk ldon, with no mind buffs, or FT gear is not a problem. Canni 4 a couple times between pulls to recoop the slow, and Canni 5 when you drop below 60% mana. No med break needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Sonechka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Thanks guys again for your input. Will definitely grind for canniV then MGB. Thanks for the little bit more insite and convincing i needed. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">2250 HP is my cutoff.  That's enough so I don't get low-health aggro, with a small buffer in case the server and client are not in synch for updates.<br />
<br />
The problem is you can't just mem a % because it depends on whether you are unbuffed (just dead), buffed but no gear (on a CR), fully self-buffed with gear, fully raid-buffed, or somewhere in between.</div></div><hr />

I've even stopped working on my epic and prayer shawl to get it now. Kills me everytime my guild leader smashes his hotkey: Leviticas tells the group, &quot;CanniV Inc&quot; and I'm still waiting for the Canni IV gem to refresh.<br />

Grrrr!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll repeat what I said earlier in this same thread.  Let me say it carefully, since obviously comparing it to sex didn't even get your attention LOL  :confused: <br />
<br />
I got MGB first, because I am BY FAR mostly a raiding shaman, as in 90 percent of my game time is spent raiding.  I REGRET THAT DECISION TO THIS DAY.  GET CANNI V FIRST.  It enables you to be so much more effective in all situations.  MGB helps in exactly one situation, once every hour or so.  Canni 5 helps you every three minutes in every situation in the game.<br />
<br />
I can't make it any more simple.</div></div><hr />
