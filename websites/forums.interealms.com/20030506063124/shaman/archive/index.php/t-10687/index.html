<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently noticed that there is some new smithed armor which uses blood dropped off of lizzies in CT......... Tae Ew Blood to be specific.  The stats on the Tae Ew chain armor are pretty darn good and the sheild is sweet too.  I'm kind of surprised that I have only seen a single piece of this armor sold in the bazaar so far.... that being the sheild, guy was asking 37k.  Also, I have never seen any vials of Tae Ew Blood being sold in Bazaar.  Other than the blood the other components are very easy to obtain and/or inexpensive.<br />
<br />
I read that the 4C area in CT is the best place to get the blood drops.  Any shammys here have any info to confirm this?  Also, do you think a single group would be sufficient to get to and fight in the 4C area?<br />
<br />
As usual ....thanks for any info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can get Tae Ew blood anywhere in CT that has lizards.  I seem to get plenty in the throne room area.  4c is a very hard camp due to the amount of adds you get (I think some unmezzable) and you better have a very strong group if you want to break it.<br />
<br />
You don't see much armor because people don't go there.  Experience in CT is about 25% of that in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild has been farming CT for this blood for our smith to make tunics and shields. The blood will drop off any lizzy mob in the zone and is pretty random. Some nights we have gotten great numbers just from the zone in area and sometimes not. The same goes for 4c and other areas. Sometimes we leave with 10+ in a few hours work and sometimes only a few.<br />
<br />
Keep working at it. I have the tunic and shield and they are both very sweet smithed gear. The tunic will probably stay on until I can get a vindi bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DandainMandragoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tae Ew Blood can drop from any of the lizards.  I spent about 3 hours duoing the entrance and courtyard and got 6 blood vials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Could a trio, a 57 shammy (me) , a 55 pally and a 56 cleric do the CY? It sounds like we can but I'm just checking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Someone that snares would be nice, but if you have root up should be no problem.  GL on the drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's been years since I've been to CT, so I don't really remember the layout.  But, I seem to recall that there were only one or two mobs (lizards back then) at  the ZI area.  Would a 55 SK and 55 shaman (once I get there) be able to handle those spawns?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did last night 2 hours in 4C with me (63 shammy) 65 monk 65 cleric and a 62 rogue.<br />
Got 13 vials and 2 scales and a fleshgrinder hehe<br />
<br />
I'm betting it's random.<br />
<br />
It was also fun to revisit and /pwn the lizards that used to scare us out of our wits.<br />
<br />
Only drawback was calling 4C in a camp check and getting tells spammed at you &quot;I am buying blood for 2k and scales for 500&quot;<br />
<br />
Dude...did I say I was selling?<br />
<br />
Anyway :p  I have all the stuff made for 2 attempts, I'm hoping it's enough, I dun wanna buy any more sapphires hehe.<br />
<br />
GL in your endeavors :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pretty sure nothing in CT runs so no snare needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">been doing entrance and courtyard solo lately .. granted i dont have malo or torpor, but using old school tactics that arent used to much anymore to split mobs.  <br />
<br />
First fight, both the door mobs .... Para earth one ... slow other .. use doggie and epic on that one ..... slow the other one who is rooted , so when it breaks he doesnt surprise you.  use Pox, and Epic on one dog dog is chewing on .... Take aggro from him ... (note the mobs summon)  so healing yourself i find is more mana efficient than healing your gimp dog, so In TEH face is a decent choice.  20 minutes i believe is timer on the spawns.. <br />
<br />
2 casters and 2 dinos,  this is the tough part .... or easy my way. <br />
Root one causing aggro , sometimes 2 come, sometimes 3.  Root one by Entrance, zone out.. buff up, PR and DR, there dots are nasty.  Zone back in, slow mob .. raise pet.. kill , rinse repeat. <br />
<br />
Once you get the hang of it, it goes alot smoother. Took me 3 or 4 times to get down the break in and rotating spawns and timers on all mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Very impressive Razco.  I've tried soloing the entrance lizards after they were broken at 59 w/epic, kei, aego and I cannot do it, my dps just isn't high enough and they hit very hard.  The 61 pet and Pox must make a huge difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, I began making the tunics on drinal, sold my first 4 for near 50k before people caught on they were player made. Ahh, it was nice while it lasted. Anyways, no, a small group pre level 60, with no 59 plus chanter would die horribly at 4c. The courtyard is a bit better, but the spiritcallers, lifedrinkers etc are mean. Perhaps with chain stunning you would do ok, but the spellcasters do ae rains, ae dot/slows, lifetaps, comp heals and all sorts of other annoying crap. And of course every melee all feel the need to spam &quot;I'm slowed&quot;. Yeah, I happened to catch that 8 lines of spam &quot;so and so is slowed by the bane of thul&quot;, I'm workin on it chief. Ahh, for group cure disease....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm going to be heading down there in the next few days to farm some blood.  Any idea how a ranger/shaman hydra would do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got a guildie who dual boxes a 62 bl and a 59 shammy said he couldn't handle the zone in mobs. Guess his dps wasn't enough or he just didn't know what he was doing. Got a pretty steady group that always has a 56 druid, 55 warrior, 59 shammy, 59 chanter that does zone in with 2 other people we can find and we have very little problems except for the casters. The word nasty is an understatement, ae and slow really make em tough to bring down. <br />
Had one somehow port the warrior out of the zone one time when we had added a mage and a cleric to our group, was very annoying as we tryed to zone out and the cleric got summoned. The sewers camp is easier than CY once its broke. Cy can get you alot of adds as some of the casters seem to summon every mob in sight to help them fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Duo'd entrance 3 days ago for 4 hours, me(59shm) and a 61 sk, sk split entrance and single pulled all mobs.. we just killed anything we could at zi before repops, got 6 vials in 4 hours.. went to my smith friend that is 250smithing + ironfrost hammer + geerlok and had him do the combines.. got a shield and a bp and the sk and mage the other shield and split money, no fails at all.<br />
so you dont need to get a all 65 group and camp 4C for blood.. any place with lizzies will bring u blood in a couple of hours.. if you are looking for mass quantities then 4C would probably be the place to go through.   good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Took a group to CT and hunted ZI for about 2 maybe 2 1/2 hours........ got 6 vials of blood.  Group consisted of me, 57 shammy, 56 cleric, 56 pally, 55 ranger, 59 mage, and 55 enchanter.  Those fights with the lizards were harder than a lot of PoP tier 1 mobs. <br />
<br />
My smithy friend made the shield on the first attempt, failed the tunic on the first but made the tunic on the secind....woot.<br />
<br />
Thank god she succeeded on the shield cauz I only had 1 lizard blood.<br />
<br />
So if anyone needs blood, CT zone in and courtyard mobs have plenty.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Temuchin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">about the tae ew shield,<br />
<br />
the recipe on eqtraders for lizard blood temper calls for &quot;scale temper, 1 tae ew blood&quot;<br />
<br />
what's scale temper?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The distilled lizard blood is the scale temper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">to get the scale temper you combine:<br />
<br />
1 un-stacked iksar blood - uber rare drop off all kunark iksars, this was hardest to get for me, the best choices is to kill iksar necromancers in seb jail or go to bazaar and buy them, sell for around 100pp on my server.<br />
<br />
1 un-stacked froglok blood - got it in 10min of killing frogs at upper guk, any frog there will do, doesnt need to be named or higher lvl.<br />
<br />
1 un-stacked sarnak blood - off sarnaks in kunark.. best place to camp for those is at the sarnak fort in LOIO, got them fairly fast, around 20min, theres lots of sarnak at the fort.<br />
<br />
1 un-stacked bloodwater - bought at various merchants in cabilis.. if you are a goodie race like i am, pay some noob around field of bone 5pp to pick a couple up for you, he will be more then happy is my guess :)<br />
<br />
combine that and you get scale temper, trivial at 135 brewing.<br />
<br />
then take the scale temper and combine it with tae ew blood vial and you get lizard-blood temper trivial at around 150 brewing i think.<br />
<br />
hope this helps and good luck all on your farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As for iksar blood I'm sure it drops off the coerced iksars in dalnir :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>DandainMandragoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It does drop in Dalnir, but very very rare.  Necro camp in Seb is best place to get it.  I also Duo entrance and Courtyard.  Very easy with 64 Pally and 62 Shambot.  I have made 15 tunics and like 5 shields so far.<br />
