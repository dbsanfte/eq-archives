<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes QB shortens Q, down to a minimum cast of 3 sec. I did Canni5, MGB, SCRM, and QB1. I recently got QB2 but I doubt I will go ahead with 3 becuase with the wicked bone range, Q is almost at minimum anyway. SCRM is really nice, especially if you raid, so you don't have to buff as often. That would be my advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would go for spell casting mastery. Out of a PVP point of view i could also go for dogburn and AAroot. Quickbuff is also very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My order is:<br />
Canni<br />
SCRM<br />
MGB<br />
QB1 (I'll go back and pick up 2 later).  I've got SCR3 now and I'm halfway through SCRM.  While I noticed the change in Quiescence fairly soon, I just realized with SCR3 I'm noticing the difference in regular old buff duration.  Especially on stuff like SLTW where 21 mins is a welcome benefit over 16</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My plan after hitting 65 is<br />
   Get MC3 because I hafta<br />
   Cann V<br />
   MGB<br />
   VP1 (for crowd control)<br />
   QB1+QB2 (have wicked bone already)<br />
   RC2 (I love RC1)<br />
   Dogburn<br />
<br />
...and then I'll have to stop and think for a bit.  Am I missing any good ones, or have 'em in a bad order?<br />
<br />
BTW MGB is non-negotiable, I really need that for raids.  I know some people can do fine without it, I can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about SCR/M, Weiss?  It doubles as a Healing bump for us on Q/Torpor as well as its &quot;normal&quot; effect?<br />
<br />
I've considered getting MGB before SCRM since I'm up to 4 saved right now, but we have 3 or 4 other shamans in my guild with MGB, to the point where I've seen them MGB stuff like Talisman of the Diaku or Blessing of Replenishment, and I don't have Fo7 yet, so that can drop down a slot for me.<br />
<br />
You know who MGB is nuts for though?  Druids.  MGB Spirit of the Wood is obscene if you have enough Druids to chain it for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm... SCR/SCRM has definite possibilities.  Perhaps even before QB, since longer-lasting buffage is probaby better than quick-casting buffage.<br />
<br />
How much SCR/SCRM do you have to have before Torpor goes an extra tick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's percentage based, so it's iffy.<br />
<br />
At SCR1 you have 5%, so (.05)(4) = 20% chance of an extra tick.<br />
<br />
SCR2 = (.15)(4) = 60% of an extra tick<br />
<br />
SCR3 = (.30)(4) = always one extra tick, 20% chance of a second.<br />
<br />
SCRM is 50%, so it always goes the 2 extra ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SCRM and QB are the winners hands down.  3 second Q (without gear) and the extra two ticks.  Not to mention the very nice cast time on all of our buffs.  I don't even have time to tell people to gather around when I MGB focus with QB3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SCRM (Spellcasting reinforcement Mastery) is essential to the shaman. I would not put off this AA ability or skip it altogether. I am in a guild that raids heavily, and I would rank it as MORE important than MGB.<br />
<br />
I'm also suprised that nobody has mentioned Spellcasting Mastery (SCM). I bought all 3 levels of this AA and I have to say I was very impressed. The discription in the AA window is misleading and confusing. Maxing SCM basically results in a larger theoretic mana pool by further reducing the mana cost of your spells. If I had to put a number to it, I would say my mana pool had its theoretical max increased by 20-25% by this AA alone. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would get SCM and SCRM before quickbuff and certainly before you worry about getting your elder title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SCM is a flat 10% savings on mana, to my understanding.  <br />
<br />
Frankly, I think it's vastly overated, if you plot out casting and your mana consumption as you go.  If you do a full out mana burn, then great, it's useful.  If you don't do a mana burn, it's not so useful.  But your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SCM is a flat 10% savings on mana, to my understanding.  <br />

<br />
SCM is great even if you aren't doing a mana burn as you put it. When you don't it's still very useful because it effectively increases your mana regen since it reduces the mana you use.<br />
<br />
Lets play with some fake numbers.<br />
Lets say we've got a shaman with 4000 mana casting a 400 mana spell.<br />
Obviously he can cast it 10 times and then he's compleately oom.<br />
Lets say this shaman regens 80 mana a tick so it takes him 50 ticks to regen that 4000 mana.<br />
Lets now give him SCM. That 400 mana spell now cast 360 mana to cast.<br />
He can now cast it 11 times and still have a little bit of mana left over.<br />
It still only takes him the same 50 ticks to med back up.<br />
<br />
Now lets compair that shaman to a shaman that just added 400 more mana.<br />
He now as 4400 mana and can cast the spell 11 times exactly but not it takes them 55 ticks to med up.<br />
<br />
So the shaman with scm not only can cast as many spells and even have a little mana left over but he's back to fm sooner.<br />
<br />
Same holds true if you just cast spells as soon as you have mana to or just cast when you get near full mana. Since the spell it's self costs you less mana it takes you less time to be ready to cast again.<br />
<br />
SCM is a great aa for any caster. I may not do a mana burn and I can't remember the last time I went oom but this still allows me to cast more spells over a given period of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather save 10% mana on all my spells than have buffs last 30% longer, so I went for SCM3 before SCR. <br />
<br />
To answer the original queston, my aa was:<br />
<br />
SC1<br />
MC3<br />
Cann5<br />
RC1<br />
VP1<br />
SCM3<br />
SCR1<br />
QB1<br />
<br />
and now I'm working on SCR3. In hindsight, only thing I'd do differently is that I might well get Virulent Paralysis right after Spirit Call. I spend most of my time grouped and VP is proving pretty useful for 3(?) AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SCM saves you 10% mana. Now get a mana preservation 4 item (Ornate Chain Boots) and save another 10%. Suddenly your saving 20% mana on every cast.<br />
<br />
Then factor in SCRM. A 50% increase in duration for all buffs. Quie goes from 4 ticks to 6 ticks. <br />
<br />
Now get QB3.  Casting time on almost all buffs is cut in half.<br />
<br />
Now combine all those. 3 sec Quie cast for an 1800 (or more) HP heal for 160 mana. Talk about extreamly efficient.<br />
<br />
Now add a Ceramic Shield of Valor (or another Extended Enhancement 4 item). Focus lasts 2 hours, 12 mins. Talisman of Alacrity and SoW last 59 mins. Boar and Wrulan last 1 hour 23 mins. Talk about saving on rebuffing.<br />
<br />
Individually, none of these are big. But when you start stacking them all up, they become HUGE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh, I am exactly the opposite, mana is almost never an issue and I hate buffing with a passion, especially haste/FA, not to mention extended Q &gt; any mana savings, so I got SCR3/SCRM first, then QB1 to finish title (and speed up Q), then SCM3.</div></div><hr />

This is all true, and I think your numbers are right and fair.  <br />
<br />
But they are abstract and mean little in application, because it doesn't reflect normal usage - absent a manaburn situation.  And this is a mana burn scenario you've illustrated.  <br />
<br />
In normal use, if I dip down to 53% mana as opposed to 58% mana, it makes no real functional difference.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying SCM doesn't do anything, or that it's not beneficial.  But I do think that for shaman, it's a bit overemphasized by some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've had my elder title for a goodly while now, but I went:   Rabid, MGB, Canni5, took a pause here for when pop came out and did some of those, then QB1, and Alchemy mastery.  All in that order.<br />
<br />
As to SCM, I have one rank, and do plan to eventually get the other two ranks, but it really doesn't mean much to me.  Its a struggle to run oom anymore unless I'm chain tnarging someone, so its not high on my list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Closing in on 260 AA Now.<br />
<br />
The biggest change in Any aa I got was Spell casting reinforcment mastery. (Besides Canna 5)<br />
<br />
1800 torpor. (2100 lots for me)<br />
Much longer laster Replenishment By far the best heal in the game for an xp group that actually pushes.<br />
Longer lasting buffs that actually do things. Like Avatar and Stamina and focus. So that means less down time buffing and rebuffing. And more time playing. Also when a buff is going to last like two hours. there is alot less worry about it.<br />
<br />
Quickbuff 2 with a Spell haste item is also godly. For torpor. Primarily. But I belive it is faster invis as well. (Cant remember I am tired)<br />
<br />
By far the most fun AA I have gotten has been VP3. The blow back is so damn useful Something on a wall or getting close to an edge. Blow back. Something resisted Slow.. Blowback. Arena fight getting you down. Target self and go for a ride.. ACHOO!<br />
<br />
I need to finish up Quickbuff three and MGB at some point. (9 aa in a chunk sucks!) But there will be enough time to get them in another 15 or so AA when the Pop Skills bar is filled like the archtype bar is already<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ways your milage may vary, but Combined the aa are truly sick.<br />

<br />
As I said in the part you didn't bother to quote even if you aren't burning your mana it still effectively increases your mana regen and lets you cast more spells. You look around on the site and some shaman act like it's a mortal sin if they aren't casting something, either canning for more mana or doing something to use it. SCM lets you spend more time using mana and less time trying to regen it. I will agree that SCM is probably more important for a wizzard or a cleric who has really high spikes of mana usage and little or no way to add a quick hit of mana to thier pool. It is still a useful ability for shaman IMO.</div></div><hr />

It all depends on what you are doing really.. if you are xping mostly then most suggestions are on the ball and you can do anything really w/o much difference.. but if you are raiding then there is other precedence.. <br />
<br />
Like SCM because on raids all the mana in the world is not enough..<br />
Like RC2 because once you get it, you'll start noticing how damn good it is :)<br />
Like LR5 because when he's swinging for 1100 a pop, mitigated his slow and seems like he's flurrying compared to most mobs you've seen, that'll help you live.. <br />
ND is also since I guess you are asking for class specific, QB2 is amazing (not 3 because eventually you'll get a haste item and make 9aa useless) the reason of course because malos/turgurs go a lot faster and so does your heal and q..<br />
<br />
I'm a bit biased because I don't like scrm that much :) quiescence healing an extra 300-600 is nice, but that's 20AA for 600 extra hot and the minor convenience of having to rebuff later than normal..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">QB does Malos/Turgors? I thought was beneficial only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">QB does Malos/Turgors? I thought was beneficial only.<br />
<br />
QB is benificial only and doesn't do anything for malo/turgur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">After CannV:<br />
<br />
*Spell casting mastery 3 that's like mana preservation IV effect by itself =)<br />
<br />
*Natural Durability 3, 10percent more HP would put most ppl close to 3k HP, for me it put me at 3500. Making CannV much more usable, cause no low HP aggro.<br />
<br />
From there I did Spell cast reinforcement 3 then SCRM. But Combat Agility 3 would be very nice to keep you alive alot longer, especially w/ lightning reflex 5. <br />
<br />
Other useful stuff, aa root ( this kicks ass ) especially positioning mobs. Radiant Cure. Healing Gift and Advance healing gift combined will let you crit heal almost 1/5 to 1/6 heals. Great for saving ppl on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Who cares about the numbers, and who cares if you think its overrated for shamans? I put the points into it over a period less than a week, and I saw and felt the difference. It was immense. Anything that does that is worth your AA's</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did the same thing shortly after PoP came out. Got the 12 aa's for SCM in a short period of time and it was a noticable effect for me. I'd have to say it's at least as good as scrm or qb 2. Which one to do first is hard to say. If you've got Q i'd lean it towards scrm first otherwise i'd say it's a toss up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">PennyAntics, numbers do matter, since you were laboring under the impression this saved 20-25% of your mana consumption.  It doesn't.  And Taraddar's numbers show how it can be helpful.  <br />
<br />
This AA is mostly about the placebo effect, which you basically demonstrate, and has limited functional impact on daily mana use.  <br />
<br />
It has some good, and I'm not taking the radical position that it's not worth getting.  However, I got it over a short period too, and I didn't really notice jack from it. <br />
<br />
What made that interesting for me was that I was farming in PoM at the time.  I was fighting the same mobs in the same way as I got each step of SCM.  The difference is barely discernible.  <br />
<br />
In a raiding scenario the mana usage is different, and I think SCM probably has more impact because it's closer to the scenario illustrated by Taraddar.</div></div><hr />
