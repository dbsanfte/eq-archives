<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My girlfriend has told me she is going to buy a video card for me for my birthday tomorrow. She has asked that I tell her which one to get. I have narrowed it down to 2, but can't make up my mind. So I thought I'd put them in front of all the knowlegable people here to help me decide. <br />
<br />
I can either get the ATI Radeon 9200 128mb AGP<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
I can get the BFG Technologies GeForce 5200 256mb DDR AGP<br />
<br />
Obviously, the Geforce has more ram, but aside from that, which one does everyone feel would give me the best EQ experience?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have an opinion but its not the one you want.<br />
<br />
I just built a new computer and put a generic(sapphire) ati radeon 9600XT card into it, at www.newegg.com it was around $150, $160 and its great, I think its the best price/performance card to get right now.  It playes UT2004 at high graphics settings like a dream, and I run 2 eq instances with it constantly, and that's about all I do with it.  It also supports dual monitors, and comes with the dvi-to-analog adapter that you need for it, and a couple games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">9600's are the best bang for your buck on the ati side of things. If you can find old 9500's or 9700's you can flash the firmware and make em pro's too just a fyi :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What is the general feel of Radeon Technology verses the nVidia GeForce technology? I have heard that the Radeons have trouble with 2d. I have an all purpose box that gets used for more than just gaming so 2d is an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Beware any card with 256 ram. Likely you could get a faster card for the same price with less mem on it and get better performance all round.<br />
<br />
If the 256 ram card and the 128 ram card cost about the same, the 256 one is using cheaper and slower ram</div></div><hr />

Depends.  The two are comperable in most tests when compared to the competing product and are usually within 1 FPS of each other.  I think right now though, ATI has the edge in 3d.  I am not aware of any issues modern ATIs have with 2d.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd have to advise going with the radeon.<br />
<br />
got a question for you guys running multiple instances of EQ on one comp. Do you display the game window on just the main monitor or do you put one on each monitor? If I try putting any game that requires the graphics card working at all my system will start to chunk and I go down to about 1 frame every few seconds. Anyone know how to work around this or make the second monitor function more normally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not aware of any downsides to either make of card really.  I used to buy Nvidia all the time, and happened to start buying ATI more recently.  I think they have kind of traded the 'fastest card out' crown a couple times the past 6 months, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well that kind of muddies the waters then. I know these two cards aren't the latests and greatest from either company. So back when they were released, who had the crown? and are they both flashable? the ATI seems to have that going for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from what I'm guessing you know about computers, you probably wouldn't have anything to do with flashing them.<br />
<br />
When I wanted to know how good a particular card stood up I'd look for benchmarks on video/game enthusiast websites.  Maybe seeing both cards' performance for a particular game would be an easy reasonable indicator which you should buy and be happy with.  They could be so close its not even an important question he he.<br />
<br />
I would look myself but I am kind of lazy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That is what i am seeing. They are so close performance wise on the listed benchmarks, that I just can't decide. I'll probably go with the nVidia as its overall support is greater and it has a lifetime warranty as opposed to the ATI 3 month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a radeon 8500DV and I still can't see the target rings :\ Other than that it works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I usually go with nVidia cards but I'm a techno feeb.  Even so, I can state that either one of those cards will crush EverQuest.  EQ isn't that technically demanding, it just has a crappy engine that results in video lag in places like the bazaar regardless of your card.  I have a nice card and lots of system RAM and if I don't set my clipping to zero in the bazaar I'm in slide-show mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im running a 5200 now, a 128m one though.  I can't speak to the Radeon card, never used one, but the Nvidia lets me run 3 instances of EQ on one archaic PC with an acceptable framerate.  That is, however, with old models on.  If I turn on all the graphics, spells, new models, etc, I can run 1 EQ np.  It starts to bog down when I try to run 2 like that though.  <br />
<br />
I don't think you'd be dissapointed if you got the Nvidia card, but then, I think you'd be happy with the Radeon also.  HTH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I myself got a new system a few weeks ago. For a vid card I got the Geforce 5200 256mb..... DO NOT GET IT. I have had nothing but issues with it. The retailer even replaced it with a new one right out of the box befor the comp  was a week old. After tinkering with it for 2 weeks I got it to work well enugh to play with but the performances is very sub par. It dose grate for anything but gameing. To give you an idea it even lags in UO.<br />
<br />
Oddly the 128 cards do run fine. So it's problly a hard wear issue with the 256's. The problems I have read about from the 128 cards are useally fixed with a clean driver instal. Or at worse a clean winXP install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have the Radeon 9200 128mb card and it's decent. I didnt see the targetting circles at first, but it was something to do with my custom UI, not the card. I see them fine now. I have a 2.53 ghz, with 512 ram and that card, and EQ runs fine with all settings at max. But I run less than that by choice. It gets a little choppy in the bazaar, but since they raised the trader limit to 550, I dont think any card doesnt get lagged there. When I first got the card before they raised that limit, not even the bazaar slowed me down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Get a Radeon 9600 pro (or XT even better).  It's well worth it.  All the benchmarks I have seen put ati a little bit ahead of nVidia.  EQ has some optimizations for nVidia cards though, I've heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The 9200 and 5200 are really crappy cards. I use both nvidia's and ATI's and I like the ATI's better myself. As many have said a 9600 is really nice, or a 9800pro running abotu $215 now and you won't need a new video card for a long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">EQ hardly pushes a video card.  I run an MX400 64MB on my bot machine and have little to no problems (except the Bazaar of course).  Hopefully with the upcoming rendering upgrade, it will make the video card and system RAM even less of a factor for the gaming experience.  I usually run NVIDIA's on my puters, but they just happen to be the cheapest when I am buying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, she got the nVidia card. I just had time to throw it in the pc before work this morning. I got a whopping 3 minutes of play time to see the difference. <br />
<br />
I am happy to report my new 5200 is a big improvment from my old mx400 64mb... I always had issues with games being to dark on the old card, this new card is much better. The textures are much nicer as well. I was able to finally get my hertz setting off of 60, its up to 75 now, I was able to do 80, but it didn't fit the screen properly. <br />
<br />
I'm going to try to hit the bazaar when I get home tonight to truely see how much better it will be. I am hoping I can get away without sliding the clip plane to nothing.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who put in their 2 copper. <br />
<br />
Snuggleguts, I hope I don't experience the frustration you have. Best of luck to you in getting that fixed. <br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe I'll get enough jack today to go get the ATI as well and test it out too.<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone!</div></div><hr />
