<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dashel</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Left EQ right before Luclin, yes for DAoC =)<br />
<br />
I'm not necessarily comming back to EQ, but I am at least interested in whats going on with my 1st and still favorite MMORPG character... my Ranger, Callorin =)<br />
<br />
When I left (level 57)<br />
<br />
The mainstream good armor was in ToV.  Uber guilds were farming NToV.  I have some ToV stuff and I am dorf alligned (i.e. Goldenleaf BP)<br />
<br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin stuff was very good (gloves, arms) I have the gloves<br />
<br />
Lupine/Lammy + Swiftblade was considered very good (thats what I have now)<br />
<br />
Range slot I have a Idol of the Thorned.<br />
<br />
I made velium vapors for insta ports to Thurg.<br />
<br />
Trueshot + a good bow + a quiver + raid buffs was pretty good damage, but not rogue/monk .. heck sometimes even warrior damage depending on gear.  I have a Drangon Necropolis bow (30/39? I think?).<br />
<br />
We just got more defense.. woot!  <br />
<br />
So can anyone bring me up to speed?  Or maybe point me to a thread or two to help?<br />
<br />
Just curious what some of the new mid/high level game staple items are (i.e. used to be Lupine/Lammy/Swiftblade, ToV armor, Spider Fur items etc)  <br />
<br />
Also curious what the role of a Ranger is on raids now, if any.  Damage? Utility/Buffs/Damage?  Look cool?  Die horribly?  Archery?<br />
<br />
AC Cap?  I've seen that mentioned.  Was this a discovery or did VI implement this?  Whats the ranger cap?  <br />
<br />
Seems to be more focus on stats that previously.  I always liked a balance myself...<br />
<br />
OK I'll stop now =)<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />
