<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I realize many people might not want to give up their secrets, but I was hoping to find out where people go these days to make money.  I'm interested because I want to buy quiesance when I hit 65, and it currently sells for 39k on my server.  I've tried soloing in Cazic Thule to farm Tae Ew Blood, but I only get like one an hour, which is means 1.5k an hour (not counting bazaar time).  I'm considering trying to solo PoJ basement (lots of gems, but I don't know if I can do it), or maybe going to some lowbie zone with mobs who drop fine steel, and just killing en masse.  But I'd really like some other suggestions.  Oh, and I know everyone is going to say PoG, but I want to keep my elf faction (I'm weird like that).  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humorff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Going to HHK and killing the guards there. You will loose FP, Queynos, HHK, HHP Faction. But all the guards drop FS short swords. Just kill all the ones in HHK and once they are dead go to HHP and kill all the guards there. I have made over 1k in one day in a group there, but if you are soloing you could make lots more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW atm I have torpor (got it researched after i got 107 left from ldon, w00t!).</div></div><hr />

I can make 3k an hour easy farming certain 'essences'. I'll let you figure out which ones tho. They are used for cultural smithing, depending on your server / GM's smith, you may not make that much. But on average, doing 2 different camps with 2 different toons, its about 20 essences an hour (150pp each, which is 3k per stack of 20 in the bazaar). They usually sell out by morning if not...I hit my friends list and see if any smiths are on and want a reduced price :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I haven't played EQ in five+ months, but at one time the Tae Ew blood was not flagged as magic (it still may not be) so it can be picked by SoS rogues.  If you notice that you aren't getting any bloods on the first set of mobs, ever, it could be because a rogue has cleaned them out before you arrived.<br />
<br />
Best bet?  Find a SoS rogue, explain the scheme to him, and see if he'll split the take with you.  Esp. right after a patch if you can get the rogue to run through before anyone else has a chance, you might find he's able to get 12-20 bloods.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

You need to get your skill to roughly 100 or so for most of the easy ones.   Some more, some less.  You want to be a good amount (50+ above the trivial + gearlok)<br />
<br />
Smithing:<br />
Medium Quality Folded Sheet Metal<br />
Pottery:<br />
Ceramic Linings<br />
Tailoring:<br />
Sacred Tunare Silks<br />
Generic<br />
Celestial Essences<br />
<br />
Farm for the drops:<br />
silks, pelts, acrylla, etc<br />
<br />
Lots of old world stuff like Cobalt Scar can be very good cash when you figure cash drops, quest gems ((even if sold to merchant)), crusty armor ((even if sold to merchant)), and pelts ((never sell to merchant))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A no-brainer low-yield moneymaker is Celestial Essences.  Requires no skill to make, profit is about 2-3 pp per two-item combine you can sell in the bazaar.  A newb friend of mine outfitted himself quite well just by combining a LOT of CEs during med time.</div></div><hr />
