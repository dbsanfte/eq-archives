<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sendaor^VallonZek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought i was gonna bring this up hehe..<br />
<br />
Would be fun to know how the bluebie server shammies pvp in duels and stuff hehe..<br />
<br />
tell me all your tips and tricks! maybe I can learn something new hehe ^^<br />
<br />
can say  a few things about how i pvp... the 8 spells i have up is mainly Chloroplast, Torpor, Malo, Bane of nife, Ice strike, Anull magic, Root and Canna4<br />
<br />
Yes i do kind of defensive pvp, i trust my oponents to have low enuff PR after malo to get bane to land, torpor myself and just stand in a corner try to channel epic dot and stuffs like that..<br />
<br />
If i fight a warrior or someone else with very high hps and high PR i fast mem disease buffs (dont have pox so i do insidious decay and then plague+ scorge! )<br />
<br />
Always carry some stalwart potions!<br />
<br />
Always carry some DoT potions so chanters cant keep ya raptured (no chanter will ever be able to kill you if you are dotted and if you got 130mr or somethin unbuffed)<br />
<br />
Oh well how do you pvp? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot one thing, a tash stick can help ALOT when fighting ppl with high end gear and lots of MR.. There are not many ppl with so high MR that they can resist root after tash+malo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 52, I have just become every level 60's punchbag....And my gear is pretty ghetto (If I put my resist gear on, my MR is still only 109). Since I turned 52 I have been attacked about 10 times by level 60 and I have onl died once - and that was a couple of zones away from where the fight started. Ok, I havent won any, but survival is an achievement against some uber level 60!<br />
<br />
Offensively I use Insidious Decay (or whatever the level 52 disease debuffer), Plague &amp; Scrouge - Ok, that is not exactly uber, but it is really all I can realistically hope to stick. Defensively I use annul magic. I try to carry a Damage Shield potion, and cure disease/poisons, and calimony if i can afford the plat to make. If I get the chance, and can see the PvP coming, levitate is good PvP against melees, and Dogdog never did any harm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I melee people to death. Casting is a waste of mana unless it is to heal yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like using disease based spells. I know either way, I can cast that and drop my opponents health down substantialy. With most casters, when you stack on ID, pox will take them out, and I can out heal most of the dd's they inflict.Melees I can pox and usually make enough space between them and I to try for bane. With melees, if i feel really nasty, I try to go for cripple. They hate that. I am sure I prolly look funny when pvp'ing a melee, because i spend most of my time running.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not on a PvP server, so I tend to come up against shoddy MR.   I use Blind like mad.  Once blind, I will debuff everything I can on them, then start DoTs, Nukes (bracer) and sending in the pet.    If I don't wanna play with the pet, I take advantage of the lack of see invis on blue servers and use it to run and hide while they rot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shamans used to own pre kunark in pvp.  These days we have a heck of a time against uber opponents.  Hard to kill a shaman, hard to kill as a shaman.<br />
<br />
I am assuming you are 60th:<br />
<br />
1) Against non uber opponents, shamans will own them from malo.  After malo, you can have your way with your opponents.  Keep them perma blinded/rooted/etc.<br />
<br />
2) Against uber opponents, you got problems.  My main suggestion is to use disease line.  Use ID to debuff disease and use the resistable one to see how their DR is.  If resistable disease debuff lands, then go to town on them.  Also, get some melee going.  Works pretty well.  Finally, uber cast blind until it lands to give you some time to cast other stuff.<br />
<br />
Against casters, torpor &gt; DD.  Just play the mana game, and usually they will run out of mana before you :).</div></div><hr />
