<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to know if this par for the course.  been /petitioning every time i sign in and have submitted two online &quot;contact your GM&quot; messages from the eqlive website.  Havn't heard from a GM yet and wonder if this is normal.  Anybody got any other ideas?  kinda losing hope and its more then a little frustrating be left out in the cold so to speak.  I am really supprised their customer service is so bad and thats disheartening.  If i knew one way or another if they'll help me i can continue my in game goals.  As it is, not knowing anything, the fun is slowly being drained from the game for me making more then 6 months of work seem trivial and wasted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been told by a Guide that petitions that have been escalated to GM level fall off the GM list after 12 hours of real time. (Had my Jade Chokadai disappear from inventory before turn-in for HS key -- re-appeared the next day magically)<br />
<br />
I beleive there is a /viewpetition command, as well as a /deletepetition to deal with queue management of your own petitions -- check the help for the exact command</div></div><hr />

You waste your time if you petition when no GM or Guides are on. Although they can be stealth they usually only do it when they are alone and backlogged, so I recommend only Petitioning when you see them and Have 3-4 hours minimum on. If you log you petition goes to bottom of list if they answer and you are not on. I petitioned a ton of times to fix that problem with loot. Just be patient and it come through for you, hopefully!</div></div><hr />

Be patient, my friend.  You are doing all you can do right now.  There are lots of people that are having problems as well and very few to deal with the masses.  They will get to you as soon as they can.  It does help that you petition whenever you log in.  Also post every few days or so on the eq website.  We had a wizard and a rogue that had the same problem with losing items due to bugs on their epics.  With the rogue it took 6 weeks for them to get back.  Amazingly enough,  the wizard  took less the a week.  Its just a matter of how backlogged they are.  They both had done constant petitions as well as leaving messages on talk to gm section on eq board.  Unfortunately this time of year seems to be more troublesome.   <br />

Just hang in there.  My advice is continue with your other goals this will be taken care of soon.</div></div><hr />

When I have written to the GM via Sony's boards they have been close to week in responding to my queries. Keep petitioning when you get on. Eventually you'll get some response :)</div></div><hr />
