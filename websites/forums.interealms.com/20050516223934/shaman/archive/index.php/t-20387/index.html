<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings:<br />
<br />
I would like to see some new content and abilities for shaman.  The new stuff does not have to be &quot;unbalancing&quot;, but the changes should help shaman cope with the new content of Gates.<br />
<br />
It seems like many of the current ideas being tossed around are staying too close to the parameters of the spells we already have - just adding a few hps to a heal, a bit of mana there, etc.  There are new ideas being proposed in the subsequent discussions, but they may be being lost in the &quot;noise.&quot; Let's get some ideas out on the front page for consideration.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
1.  Slow AA - If SOE is set on the proposed heal change, what can be done in another area to alleviate our concern?<br />
<br />
What about an AA slow ability with a 3 minute recast (like our virulent paralysis) that is highly unlikely to be resisted and slows a target 50%?<br />
<br />
This would give us some way to gain instant control over the fight - albeit at a reduced level.  This slow AA, combined with the new heal ratio, would allow our heals to work to a meaningful degree at the time of the initial arrival of the mob.  The AA should have a significant chance of landing without a malos.  Maybe it should even be unresistable.  <br />
 <br />
<br />
2.  HP Swap AA - This was suggested by a cleric on another thread - appologies for not recalling your name. =) <br />
<br />
This AA ability, with a 3 minute recast time, would bring the target's hps to 50%, draining the shaman of 50% of thier current hps.  (So if you hit this AA while at 80% health, you go down to 40%.)  If it's too much to bring the target to 50%, bring them to 40%.  Attach Cheal size aggro to the HP Swap AA to balance the ability with reasonable risk.<br />
<br />
3.  AA Line to Reduce Slow Mitigation --  Each level would reduce the mitigation factor by a given percentage.<br />
<br />
4.  Beat the Shammy Instead AA Buff -- (This one could also be a spell).  Idea is that you could cast it on another player, and a percentage of the hits they get would be transferred to you.  <br />
<br />
5. Shaman Rez AA -- But like all good shaman spells, it involves the shaman bleeding all over the place.  The shaman rezes at a cost of their own health and mana.  One possible twist is that the shaman risks death with this rez.  Perhaps even xp loss that cannot be replaced with a subsequent rez.  Another possible twist is that if the shaman lacks sufficient hps to bring the patient to 50%, the shaman dies.  <br />
<br />
6.  Slow Enhancements AA line -- AA's that make slows less likely to be resisted or mitigated less.  Idea is to maintain our position as the optimal slowers.  <br />
<br />
<br />
7.  GoD aa Tregars Insects (3 levels : cost 5 / 10 / 15 aa points) required level 65. Casting time: 3 seconds. Reuse time: 1 hour.<br />
<br />
Level 1. Slow mob 25 %, cannot be mitigated, resist mod -150, reduce shaman hp to 100.<br />
<br />
Level 2. Slow mob 50 %, cannot be mitigated, resist mod -150, reduce shaman hp to 100.<br />
<br />
Level 3. Slow mob 75 %, cannot be mitigated, resist mod -150, reduce shaman hp to 100.<br />
<br />
If the shaman casts this on a mob that is immune to slow, the mob remains immune, the refresh timer counts down again from one hour, and the shaman's health is reduced to 100 hp.<br />
<br />
If the shaman dies as a result of using this aa, it is like a sacrifice. The shaman can be rezzed, but the experience loss from dying is not recovered.<br />
<br />
Discussion. This aa is quite likely to overcome the resistance of highly-resistant mobs, but it still is not a sure thing. It will create high aggro from the slow and from the shaman's very low health, so probably the shaman is toast: but possibly the tank can hold aggro at just the right moment, possibly the healer can time landing a heal to keep the shaman alive. Most often, using this aa will make the shaman a sacrifice, like deciding who is going to take the death touch.<br />
<br />
Using this aa will have no effect on the mob's single target or aoe spell damage. It will have no effect on the mob's resistance to other forms of magical attack. It will affect only the rate of the mob's melee damage.<br />
<br />
It will not make it possible for a shaman to solo otherwise unsoloable content: one hit from the fully-slowed mob will still kill the solo shaman reduced to 100 hp, long before he can possibly heal himself.<br />
<br />
The one hour reuse time means that it cannot be used to trivialize raid content with multiple severe mobs. Nor will it make much change in ordinary experience groupings.<br />
<br />
Its chief benefit will be in providing a strategy option in a raid setting for a guild that is trying to take on a melee-heavy boss mob that they cannot quite overcome. Their current option is, get stronger healing and tanking. This aa would give that guild a second option: one of their shamans can channel almost all of his/her health into a slow that is very likely (still not guaranteed) to land, usually at the cost of his / her life, with no exp recovery from resurrection.<br />
<br />
8.  Canni 4 as an AA - The idea being to give shaman back a spell gem<br />
<br />
9.  OR FA as an AA - Again, give the shaman back a spell gem.<br />
<br />
10.  Dodge Bear AA -- Some short duration AA that allows the shaman to dodge all damage.  Something akin to Bard's Nimble, or Riposte, or Weaponshield, or DA.  24 seconds to not die basically.<br />
<br />
If you don't like these ideas, suggest others and  I'll add them to a list.  This list is not meant to be a final list of demands, it is just a list of possibilities to get us thinking - so almost anything suggested will go on the list.  Even if you do like 'em, suggest more!  Feel free to re-suggest ideas found on other posts.  Try to be better then me though, and actually atribute the idea to the writer by name.<br />
<br />
I'd like to keep the tone of this discussion positive please.  The point is to generate a list of ideas -- a mass brainstorming opportunity.  Please Do feel free to discuss the merits or problems with proposed solutions, but keep the tone of your discussion constructive.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

While powerful this ability would not help us where we need the help most - the unslowable or heavy mitigating MOBs of GoD. I would rather have abilities that help me where I am too weak then abilities that help me where I do not need the help.<br />
<br />
Maybe it should even be unresistable.  <br />
While I do not mind trivializing old content this sounds like a bad idea. I wonder how many MOBs are more or less magic immune but still slowable . . <br />
 <br />
2.  HP Swap AA - This was suggested by a cleric on another thread - appologies for not recalling your name. =) <br />
I think it was Jaffo - I too stole this idea for my proposal (Murtak's overly lengthy post (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20192) ) although I remember his idea somewhat differently<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='SisterLi']This AA ability, with a 3 minute recast time, would bring the target's hps to 50%, draining the shaman of 50% of thier current hps.  (So if you hit this AA while at 80% health, you go down to 40%.)  If it's too much to bring the target to 50%, bring them to 40%.  Attach Cheal size aggro to the HP Swap AA to balance the ability with reasonable risk.<br />
I think damaging for the shaman's HPs and healing for the tanks HPs is not a good idea - though I would not mind healing 4K for 1K damage to myself. I think the ability would be better damaging the shaman for a certain percentage of either his current or his max HPs and healing for an equal amount (not percentage).<br />
Healing up to 50% will not bring us out of the chain-Tnarg's-or-the-tank-dies-lock, which was one of the main reasons for proposing this and similar AA ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think AAs to reduce the amount of potential slow mitigation would not be unreasonable, and would make the existing slow more useful against mitigating mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been reading about people wanting a rez.... well id rather not, leave the old tin cans to do that... but if ppl do want this, allow me to make a suggestion (if its been said im sorry and things) <br />
along the lines of canni... what it does is yu rez the target using yur own HP's (bye bye all mana too) but yu rez them HP for HP on a one 2 one basis (the HP loss is just like canni 5) <br />
so if yur a shaman  with 2k hps rezzing a tank with 8k hps yu are gunna die.. as yu 'rez' them to full hps using yur own... <br />
however if yu rez that dainty Chanter wth only 1k hps (i know the figures are all out but its an example) she'll come back to life with full HP's and yu'll only of lost 50% of yur health and all yur mana.... make it as an AA only... like the Clerics 100% rez. <br />
and make it, so that if yu die while rezzing. the target getting rezz'd isnt rezzed and yu lose permi xp (no rezzing for that corpse)<br />
<br />
But like i said, id rather not<br />
<br />
However what i would like to see is (spell or AA... dunno which i'll just say the idea) <br />
dunno call it spirit bind,<br />
What it does is that yur hps Become a targets Ablative hps, so when they get hurt, yu take the damage for them instead, yu could make it a spell line (ditch one of the other crappy lines we got... and god knows we got a few ****e lines) so say at lvl 15 yu take 10% of the damage delt to the target off of yur own HP's, all the way to 95%/100% at 65.<br />
(hope my intentions are made clear,  im a little tired) <br />
My main reason for suggesting this is because personally i'd have this perma cast on my local chanter.... cos i hate it when they get hit/die, and i hate it when i cant save them as aoe slow takes to long to cast and i just cant get the damn agro off of them - Oppionions? suggestions?<br />
<br />
Also what i would love is aa's that enhance our abilities e.g. Enchanters get mezmiration mastery, Dire charm, etc, SK's get soul abrastion and increasements to their harm touch/DS's i would love to see AA's that make our Slows/debuffs land easier... last longer and have a greater effect on mobs.. rather than rabid bear and the like (e.g most of our GoD aa's) - <br />
<br />
sorry if its hard to follow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Veeshan - while the slow 50% AA wouldn't help against immune to slow mobs, it would help with another frequent complaint that shaman have - we don't have time to do anything against the mob because we're so busy casting malos and slow that by the time we get to dot, the mobs more than half dead and dropping fast.  <br />
<br />
It may trade off with a better than 1550 fast cast heal though, so it's worth thinking about.  <br />
<br />
The 50% AA slow is better than clouds of grummus because it doesn't take a spell gem slot, and hopefully would not require a debuff to make it stick.  It's not a panacea, but still worth considering.<br />
<br />
Were you thinking about Black Reavers in response to the unresistable idea?  <br />
<br />
Samanna - Added your idea to the list.  Does your idea affect immune mobs?  I'm presuming at the moment that the AA would not render them slowable.  Let me know if I'm wrong, and I'll clarify in the description.<br />
<br />
Jeychee -- Added your ideas to the list.  Let me know if you want me to change the descriptions.  Thanks for tossing them out!<br />

The shaman bleeds all over the mob, hampering it's movements.  And you thought bleeding the patient was bad!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, ***. That would be 1 aa I wouldn't bother with. My idea of contributing to an encounter is not to die at the beginning of it and wait to re-join the party when it's safe.<br />
<br />
How about just tweaking slow so that it is class defining once again and give us the ability to heal with some chance of keeping a group alive. While you are at it make our buffs have some impact. Clearly at one time buffs were meant to provide an enhancement to a group such that a shaman would be useful. Now they are fairly useless.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, stop asking for abilities that will kill us. It's not the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Karshak, we are not asking for abilities at the moment.  We are brainstorming.  The theory behind brainstorming is that all ideas go up on the board with the intent that they will spark more ideas from folks.  It is an attempt to break us out of the current set of options into some possible new ground.<br />
<br />
No one is yet advocating these ideas, we're just putting them out for a discussion.  <br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see some new whacky AA's to liven the game up a bit.  Virulent Paralysis is a lot of fun. <br />
<br />
Keep those ideas rolling!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SisterLi,<br />
I understand what brainstorming is, and I advocate it to an extent. What I don't understand is why we have a sudden influx of suicidal shaman. As part of the brainstorming I felt it necessary to request that people don't start thinking of ideas that will kill us. <br />
<br />
My point is, if we are in a group and we feel obligated to use the suicidal aa what have we achieved? Well, we have slowed the mob, and died. Our group has most likely killed the mob, and we are faced with a loss of xp. Great. I'd like to use that aa a lot!<br />
<br />
VP is a lot of fun, but would you find equal enjoyment if each time you used it you died?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
not only have we slowed the mob and died (losing exp), but the mob that you slowed, gave xp to the group, and not you....</div></div><hr />

<br />
An aa to reduce slow mitigation is another thing, but dont expect huge numbers, or it to work on boss encounters. <br />
<br />
I frequently see Rabid Bear knocked around as a sore spot for upgrade. Doing extra melee damage thats inferior to what I could do just nuking isnt really what the shaman class needs. What would be cool with rabid bear is a riposte/dodge thing, like weaponshield. Clerics have DA, druids have a few safety measures. Id kind of like one as well.<br />
<br />
FA or Canni as a an AA clicky. Please.. for the love of god. Gimme one of those 2 spell gems back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Flabbo! added your ideas to the list.<br />
<br />
Karshak, I can definately see the huge down sides to the various abuse the shaman for the benefit of the group AA suggestions.  I feel that I need to repeat that folks should not stop making suggestions just because your initial idea is not perfect, or continues a theme that others react strongly too.<br />
<br />
The theory behind brainstorming is that we are not evaluating the ideas for adoption, we are using them to spark more ideas.  The suicidal shaman idea might just be shocking enough to someone that it sparks an idea that goes down a completely different road.  And maybe that new idea sparks another, which in turn sparks another.  And before you know it we've got several viable options up on the board.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input folks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Veeshan - while the slow 50% AA wouldn't help against immune to slow mobs, it would help with another frequent complaint that shaman have - we don't have time to do anything against the mob because we're so busy casting malos and slow that by the time we get to dot, the mobs more than half dead and dropping fast.  <br />
Unless that AA has a reuse time of like one minute it will not help us though - getting to DoT one MOB every 30 minutes will not help our damage output.<br />
<br />
The 50% AA slow is better than clouds of grummus because it doesn't take a spell gem slot, and hopefully would not require a debuff to make it stick.  It's not a panacea, but still worth considering.<br />
I just cannot see a 50% slow helping much on slow mitigating MOBs - which is where we need the most help.<br />
<br />
Were you thinking about Black Reavers in response to the unresistable idea?  <br />
No, I was thinking things like the Emperor in Ssra, every highly magic resistant boss in Vex Thal and PoP and of course anything new that might show up in GoD.<br />
<br />
GoD aa Tregars Insects (3 levels : cost 5 / 10 / 15 aa points) required level 65.  Casting time:  3 seconds.  Reuse time:  1 hour.<br />
<br />
Level 3.  Slow mob 75 %, cannot be mitigated, resist mod -150, reduce shaman hp to 100.<br />
<br />
The problem with (hypothetical) abilities like these is that they are either completely worthless or absolutely overpowering.<br />
<br />
Put that on MOB that was designed to be doable when slowed by 10% and suddenly you go from &quot;requires a CH chain on a defensive warrior&quot; to &quot;requires a single druid and a paladin&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the other end of the spectrum it is utterly useless in groups - slowing one MOB and getting killed for your trouble is not worth it, especially on a one hour timer.<br />
<br />
As Flabbo already said:<br />
Am I the only person who understand that FULLY unmitigated 75% slows on mobs designed to be like 17% is very unreasonable? They'll give you a DA that lasts 2 minutes and you can cast through before you'll see that.<br />
<br />
An aa to reduce slow mitigation is another thing, but dont expect huge numbers, or it to work on boss encounters.<br />
We will not ever get an ability that will let us fully slowable previously mitigating raid encounters - they all were designed to do this much damage. Usually even slowing them slightly is already a decent contribution to the raid anways.<br />
<br />
Do not look for ways to fully slow raid encounters - we might get a passive AA that lessens slow mitigation on non-raid bosses but we will never get something to better slow PoP gods, and rightly so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My ideas to give the shaman more ways to reduce the melee DPS of a mob.<br />
<br />
a) either a new spell line or add it to our slows:<br />
when you cast the spell on a mob you reduce the base damage (like shielding of some items) and / or damage intervall of a mob by [X]% but limit this to a value [Y] maximum to. For example our new slow: 60% slow, -20% to base damage (max -75), -3%(max -25) to damage intervall. If a mob is immune to slow the slow part is ignored and only the -20% BD and -3% DI kick in. This way we could reduce the DPS of a slow immune melee mob somewhat. The weaker slow and the % to BD / DI would keep the spell balanced to older content. If you limit the % to a max value the spell would only scale 100% with mobs melee till this limit is reached. After that point it wouldn't scale any further.<br />
<br />
b) A spell / AA similar to the suggested veeshanMurtak  : Cast it on a mob and you get some % of the melee damage the mob does (like the shielding disc of a warrior). If more then one shaman cast this spell on the same mob the % of the damage taken away from the melee hits stay the same but the reduced damage gets splitted by the 2 shamans. Example: shaman_01 casts Besual's shielding on mob_01. Mob would hit tank_01 for 3000. Besual's shielding gives now 10% of it to shaman_01. Tank_01 gets hit by 2700 and shaman_01 by 300. Few seconds later shaman_02 casts Besual's shielding too. Tank_01 would take 3000 damage again but Besual's shielding safes his ass and tank_01 gets smacked for 2700, shaman_01 takes 150 damage and shaman_02 takes 150 damage too. This spell could be modified to affect (only) single targets procs too. Either transfering the complete proc to the shaman or only some % of it.<br />
<br />
c) a debuff to reduce the chance that a proc fires.<br />
<br />
d) Some kind of DI: cast it on a tank. If the tank would die the &quot;DI&quot; fires. The shaman lose 50% of his max HP and the tank would get 50% of his max HP.<br />
<br />
e) &quot;melee mirror&quot;: The buff reflects some % of the melee damage back. Example: tank_01 gets hit from mob_01 for 2000, &quot;melee mirror&quot; does 200 damage back to mob_01.<br />
<br />
f) &quot;famous last word&quot;: Buff someone with it. If he dies he does unresistable 1/4-2/3 of his max HP to the one who killed him. May be more damage or make it AE (and break mezz ;)) but you can't get XP back from this death.<br />
<br />
If you think some of this (or other spells / AA skills) would be to powerfull on low level mobs just make it &quot;Can only affect level [X] mobs or HIGHER&quot; (the reverse limit you have on mezz / charm spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">New AA / Spell ideas:<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
<br />
First off - Ferine Avatar / Avatar / Ancient: Primal Avatar, etc.<br />
<br />
How about giving us a faster refresh time, and 2 hour duration, and putting a reagent back into it.  I don't really think a group/MGB'able option is necessarily a good thing, but I don't think making it a &quot;real&quot; buff would be a bad idea either, and in theory, you could have everyone with it anyway as it is now, it's just a lot harder to implement and sustain on a big raid.  So even with an MGB'able group version duration I don't think it's unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Failing that - how about some actual effects or more HP on our focus line apart from, or in addition to, raw stats. Strikethrough, Evade, Absorb, etc. would all be nice and put us up-front as buffers, or maybe bump it up to +750 hp and/or +END Regen or something as well ... just some ideas.<br />
<br />
Change Balance or add a new slow to be a solid, viable upgrade to Turgurs and give us the clear edge in slows.  75% slow, 1.5 second cast, 6 minute duration, and -55 built in resist check modifier.<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
AAs - <br />
<br />
Double Attack:<br />
I'd like to see a double attack AA with say, 5 different levels. It's not anything really critical I agree, but it would be something to just give us a different option as the more melee-heavy and warlike races and 3 priest classes ... make the AA 5 levels and basically be equivalent to 40 points skill for double attack each level.<br />
<br />
Spiritual Barrier (3 levels, 90 minute reuse timer):<br />
Any damage dealt to the shaman from any spells or melee is instead dealt back to the source.  The shaman takes no damage during this time, and cannot cast or attack.  Fall damage, death touches, etc. are as normal.<br />
Level 1 - 5 seconds<br />
Level 2 - 10 seconds<br />
Level 3 - 15 seconds<br />
<br />
Whisper of Spirits (3 levels): Rez AA. There are 3 primary priest classes in the game, I think all 3 should have some form of rez, even if only tertiary, and definately not something we can cast anytime.  As an AA would be an ideal way to set it up for emergency situations only... especially if we're talking 50AAs to have a 75% rez once every 90 minutes.<br />
Level 1 - 120 minute reuse timer, 25% rez. Cost 10 AAs.<br />
Level 2 - 100 minute reuse timer, 50% rez. Cost 15 AAs.<br />
Level 3 - 90 minute reuse timer, 75% rez.  Cost 25 AAs.</div></div><hr />

either instant or on a few ticks, droping everybody's HPs in roup by 900-1000 and adding 300-400 mana. tune that with refresh time and I think it could be interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with some of the comments above regarding changes to slow mitigation - it aint going to happen with raid mobs. Given the power of changes of that sort, and the current way of thinking at sony regarding aa cost, a 5-10-15 point cost is likely too cheap. A more likely approach would be a  step progression altering mitigation by 2-4-6-8-10%, with a cost of 4-8-12-16-20, similar to the GoD warrior's hp aa. Or something like that anyway. It wouldn't be cheap and the effects would likely be modest and very incremental. I would think that they would likely also place level restrictions on such an ability as well, ie it would only work on mobs up to 60 or 65 or whatever. That would take care of the unbalancing raid content issue.<br />
<br />
One idea that i'm fond of at the moment is to have a spell line that allowed shaman to cast mini defensive/evasive abilities on players (spirit of the elephant and spirit of the gazelle). Probably something along the lines of 20% mitigation. The effects would last 30 seconds, with a recast time as long to ensure that it could only be cast on one player at a time. The spells would have the same negatives as defensive/evasive, but in proportion to their lowered mitigation. A high mana cost could be put in place to ensure that it was a &quot;special play&quot; spell, and not used routinely. It would not stack with warrior's discs if they are active. The purpose of this sort of thing would be to increase the utility of secondary tanks such as pallies and sks in groups, particularly in GoD, while at the same time making shaman very desirable in groups, particularly in groups with those classes as main tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">.My point is, if we are in a group and we feel obligated to use the suicidal aa what have we achieved? Well, we have slowed the mob, and died. Our group has most likely killed the mob, and we are faced with a loss of xp. Great. I'd like to use that aa a lot!Hmmm I said it would be something you could consider as an option in a raid, and you scorn it because it won't work well in an exp setting.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">shrug away macnair, but my post was a rhetorical question and didn't need a response. I could care less if this was a free aa given out to all shaman. I wouldn't use it. I am not interested in a qwerky ability that I then need to go and grind to make the xp back on. We, as a class, have nothing to deserve such a gift.<br />
<br />
EDIT: btw I spend probably 80 percent of my online time raiding these days, so to be honest my first thought was a raid setting. I still don't like it..... even if we were given an essence emerald every time we cast it. lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm pretty sure that a Shaman Rez that killed me or an un-resistable slow that killed me would get used about as often as Paladins use their Act of Valor AA(Die to CH target). Like, Never.<br />
<br />
How bout an AA for a pet miniCanni V? Drains 1100hp from dogdog and gives 600 manna to the shaman. If dogdog doesn't have 1100hp he dies, and no manna for you. Re-use time set appropriately, maybe 30min and only once per casted pet. I can see many uses for that and appears difficult to abuse (like the mage's pet canni). Would simply give a shaman who planned ahead a means of obtaining the manna cost of casting his pet back at useful time. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The problem with (hypothetical) abilities like these is that they are either completely worthless or absolutely overpowering.<br />
<br />
Put that on MOB that was designed to be doable when slowed by 10% and suddenly you go from &quot;requires a CH chain on a defensive warrior&quot; to &quot;requires a single druid and a paladin&quot;.My point is to brainstorm an aa ability that gives a shaman a very powerful but costly option, with strong probability of success yet significant risk of failure.  <br />
<br />
Did I get the numbers right?  Probably not.  But I'm after an idea for us to discuss, rather than supposing I can fine tune it all inside my own head.<br />
<br />
Your example of a mob 10% slowed (Grummus lands, slightly effective) means that a guild must produce enough dps to kill the mob while enduring 90% of the mob's full dps.  If a guild has the tanking and healing power to endure 60% or 70% of the mob's full dps, it doesn't matter.  Even if they can endure 88%, they cannot defeat that mob.  <br />
<br />
The shaman's role in your example encounter makes a difference just at the spot where the guild can endure 92%.  The shaman casts Grummus and it lands, and the healing and tanking is just barely adequate to keep the tanks alive while the dps people burn the mob down.<br />
<br />
Most likely, though, the guild eventually progresses to where they can endure 100% of the mob's dps.  If the shaman succeeds in getting a slow to stick, that's fine, but they have the tanking, healing, and dps to defeat the mob even if the shaman cannot slow it.<br />
<br />
Where does the shaman, the master of slows, make a difference in your example?  Sigh.  He or she doesn't.  Except in the very rare instance where the guild has just progressed from having the skill, equipment, and teamwork to endure 88% of the mob's full dps to having the skill, equipment, and teamwork to endure 92% of the mob's full dps.  Then -- and only then -- does having a shaman on the team make a difference.<br />
<br />
But if they have progressed to the point where they can endure 30%, or 60%, of the mob's full dps, if they have a shaman with the ability and the willingness to pay the price, they would have an option for an alternate strategy.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that being able to slow a mob like this makes the encounter easily doable by a trio of paladin, druid, and shaman.  But what if it did?  Think of all the very hard Velious raid encounters that are now one group, trio, or even solo material, for people with high end equipment.  <br />
<br />
I think what your trio actually would get, though, would include this:<br />
<br />
Best case scenario:  paladin, druid, shaman vs hard boss mob.  Shaman casts proposed aa slow, succeeds, goes to 100 hp.  Paladin does immediate LoH, shaman is full health.  Paladin tanks mob successfully, shaman and druid do heals and some nukes, and the trio wins -- if the three of them can produce enough dps to kill the mob before the slow wears off.  <br />
<br />
Worst case scenario:  paladin, druid, shaman vs hard boss mob.  Shaman casts proposed aa slow, it is resisted, shaman goes to 100 hp.  Paladin does LoH but is a fraction of a second too late:  the shaman is dead, and the paladin has used LoH on a corpse.  The mob crushes the paladin in a few seconds more.  The druid is already casting evac, but gets stomped before the spell completes.  The trio is wiped.<br />
<br />
Well.  <br />
<br />
You still don't have to like my idea.  I'm not sure that I myself like it.  I'm just brainstorming here.  So here's my proposal.  Rather than pointing out that my suggestion is hopelessly lame or hopelessly overpowering, come up with a better one.  <br />
<br />
Specifically:  brainstorm an aa ability that gives a shaman a very powerful but costly option, with strong probability of success yet significant risk of failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I could care less if this was a free aa given out to all shaman. I wouldn't use it. I am not interested in a qwerky ability that I then need to go and grind to make the xp back on. I've been in lots of situations where I have burned my mana bar trying to get the boss mob slowed, and gotten killed for my efforts, and the raid got wiped in the end.  I would not willingly use this aa on just any encounter like that; but there have been times where I would have gladly paid that cost, to enable the raid to prevail.<br />
<br />
But not everyone's play style is the same, you're right about that.  So propose a thoughtful aa that you like better.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">a) either a new spell line or add it to our slows:<br />
when you cast the spell on a mob you reduce the base damage (like shielding of some items) and / or damage intervall of a mob by [X]% but limit this to a value [Y] maximum to. For example our new slow: 60% slow, -20% to base damage (max -75), -3%(max -25) to damage intervall. If a mob is immune to slow the slow part is ignored and only the -20% BD and -3% DI kick in. This way we could reduce the DPS of a slow immune melee mob somewhat. The weaker slow and the % to BD / DI would keep the spell balanced to older content. If you limit the % to a max value the spell would only scale 100% with mobs melee till this limit is reached. After that point it wouldn't scale any further.<br />
That sounds like a promising (if complicated) idea. I can already see the math threads coming in. Numbers would have to be fiddled with of course but the base idea looks sound to me.<br />
<br />
b) A spell / AA similar to the suggested veeshanMurtak  : Cast it on a mob and you get some % of the melee damage the mob does (like the shielding disc of a warrior). If more then one shaman cast this spell on the same mob the % of the damage taken away from the melee hits stay the same but the reduced damage gets splitted by the 2 shamans. Example: shaman_01 casts Besual's shielding on mob_01. Mob would hit tank_01 for 3000. Besual's shielding gives now 10% of it to shaman_01. Tank_01 gets hit by 2700 and shaman_01 by 300. Few seconds later shaman_02 casts Besual's shielding too. Tank_01 would take 3000 damage again but Besual's shielding safes his ass and tank_01 gets smacked for 2700, shaman_01 takes 150 damage and shaman_02 takes 150 damage too. This spell could be modified to affect (only) single targets procs too. Either transfering the complete proc to the shaman or only some % of it.<br />
I am not sure where I suggested anything like this but this too seems like a decent spell.<br />
<br />
c) a debuff to reduce the chance that a proc fires.<br />
Cripple does that pretty decently. How about an unresistable, low aggro, low mana version of cripple that does nothing but debuff Dex? Of course this would only be useful if there actually is single group content with procs (no, a 650 DD does not count).<br />
<br />
d) Some kind of DI: cast it on a tank. If the tank would die the &quot;DI&quot; fires. The shaman lose 50% of his max HP and the tank would get 50% of his max HP.<br />
If it stacks with cleric DI it would be very very powerful on raids. If it doesn't it is pretty useless. Bleh.<br />
<br />
e) &quot;melee mirror&quot;: The buff reflects some % of the melee damage back. Example: tank_01 gets hit from mob_01 for 2000, &quot;melee mirror&quot; does 200 damage back to mob_01.<br />
I thought we were looking for healing ideas? :D Apart from that it would be tough to make this useful for single group content without it being overpowering on raids.<br />
<br />
f) &quot;famous last word&quot;: Buff someone with it. If he dies he does unresistable 1/4-2/3 of his max HP to the one who killed him. May be more damage or make it AE (and break mezz ;)) but you can't get XP back from this death.<br />
Apart from being cool (which has value in itself) I do not see much use in dying to do damage equal to a single wizard nuke to a MOB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">First off - Ferine Avatar / Avatar / Ancient: Primal Avatar, etc.<br />
How about giving us a faster refresh time, and 2 hour duration, and putting a reagent back into it.  I don't really think a group/MGB'able option is necessarily a good thing, but I don't think making it a &quot;real&quot; buff would be a bad idea either, and in theory, you could have everyone with it anyway as it is now, it's just a lot harder to implement and sustain on a big raid.  So even with an MGB'able group version duration I don't think it's unreasonable.<br />
I still don't understand why it is acceptable for haste to affect an entire raid and Avatar ties up a spell gem and is single target. A group version, MGBable or not, does not seem that bad to me.<br />
A MGB version would also give the second shaman on the raid something to do. Unless we fight something where I need to buff resists and a lot of people die I can easily keep a raid buffed by myself.<br />
<br />
Failing that - how about some actual effects or more HP on our focus line apart from, or in addition to, raw stats. Strikethrough, Evade, Absorb, etc. would all be nice and put us up-front as buffers, or maybe bump it up to +750 hp and/or +END Regen or something as well ... just some ideas.<br />
Strikethrough, combat effects or the like should be on Avatar, as that is the offensive buff. Endurance regen, shielding, stun resist and the like all make sense on Focus.<br />
<br />
Change Balance or add a new slow to be a solid, viable upgrade to Turgurs and give us the clear edge in slows.  75% slow, 1.5 second cast, 6 minute duration, and -55 built in resist check modifier.<br />
I would be happy with it being a Turgur's clone with a -40 resist adjustment myself.<br />
<br />
Double Attack:<br />
I'd like to see a double attack AA with say, 5 different levels. It's not anything really critical I agree, but it would be something to just give us a different option as the more melee-heavy and warlike races and 3 priest classes ... make the AA 5 levels and basically be equivalent to 40 points skill for double attack each level.<br />
I do not want double attack. We have more pressing concerns at the moment.<br />

Spiritual Barrier (3 levels, 90 minute reuse timer):<br />
Any damage dealt to the shaman from any spells or melee is instead dealt back to the source.  The shaman takes no damage during this time, and cannot cast or attack.  Fall damage, death touches, etc. are as normal.<br />
Level 1 - 5 seconds<br />
Level 2 - 10 seconds<br />
Level 3 - 15 seconds<br />
No - I do not need to be able to duo GoD bosses with another shaman.<br />
<br />
Whisper of Spirits (3 levels): Rez AA. There are 3 primary priest classes in the game, I think all 3 should have some form of rez, even if only tertiary, and definately not something we can cast anytime.  As an AA would be an ideal way to set it up for emergency situations only... especially if we're talking 50AAs to have a 75% rez once every 90 minutes.<br />
Level 1 - 120 minute reuse timer, 25% rez. Cost 10 AAs.<br />
Level 2 - 100 minute reuse timer, 50% rez. Cost 15 AAs.<br />
Level 3 - 90 minute reuse timer, 75% rez.  Cost 25 AAs.<br />
That does look like a decent cost for rez - although the person most likely to get the exp loss will be clerics :( .</div></div><hr />

an upgrade to sow, one with a long ass duration. and a speed increase.<br />

upgrade rabid bear to be worth the 5 aa's.<br />

the pet cani aa would rock, it would give you a reason to cast a pet and invest in that waste of an aa pet hold. useful in groups and raids...I dont know why you would restrict it to one cast per pet though?<br />
<br />
a cleric/paly only res for 96% reuse once every 24hours. forget about all the other stuff really all you want to do is get a live reser back in action and shaman usually die before the healers if something goes wrong early. <br />

Depending on what your religion is, we can get some semi decent right clickers. Inny worshippers get snare, CT get fear undead and animal effects. Not sure what other other shaman religions get.

<br />
I have been kicking around an ability like that in my head for a while since both knights and shamans seem to be having trouble further into GoD.  Would have to include some riposte discipline to be very useful for where we need it.  They could just have GoD mobs hit through or heavily mitigate all defensive/riposte disciplines, but that rebalancing is not going to happen.</div></div><hr />

But not everyone's play style is the same, you're right about that.  So propose a thoughtful aa that you like better.  :)<br />
<br />
I don't mean to knock your idea macnair, I just can't see any raid where I *should* have to lose xp to contribute... I mean, lose xp more than the amount of rezzed deaths.<br />
<br />
I don't really have an aa in mind that I want as a class defining one. I did come up with the idea a bunch of posts ago along the lines of having a canni aa that would take a percentage of hp and return mana in the ratio the same as the other canni spells do. (This would mean that it would scale to every shaman because the more hp you had the more you could convert to mana. I figured 3 levels, each taking a higher percent of health for conversion. No one seemed to like that particularly, but I am over it).<br />
<br />
I would like to see an aa given to all caster classes that would have two levels. Level 1 would allow spell gem #9 to be activated, and you can guess what level 2 would give.<br />
<br />
Both ideas are ok, but neither gives the &quot;Oh look we are being fixed&quot; feeling we are looking for. I don't think rezzes are the answer. I want either a trademark slow, a decent nuke, or a reputable and usable heal. Knock the new Q up to 500 a tick and put an aa against it so that you can at level 1 make it a group heal for one cast (re-use 25 minutes), and level 2 mgb'able.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, I dont want more abilities with these ridiculous, massive negative side effects. Yeah, let's have a slow that knocks us down to less than 3% health - guaranteeing us low health aggro and a swift death every time. That's real fun. I guess then I wouldnt even have to worry about my heals sucking balls, because I'd be dead anyway.<br />
<br />
I dont want dual wield, double attack, riposte, parry, or any of that crap. I'm not a tank - I'm a priest. I got a 59 warrior if I want to tank stuff. There isnt going to be any multi-classing in Everquest. Everquest's idea of multi-classing = the hybrids.<br />
<br />
An avatar AA would be a good one. I dont have FA yet, but I know how much of a PITA that one will be if I ever do get it, because Avatar was the first Kunark spell I ever got. I'm not looking forward to it because it's another spell gem I'll lose, and I dont have enough as it is.<br />
<br />
The upgrade for slow I want to see is one that combines Malo and slow into one spell, such as this which I posted in another thread:<br />
<br />
'Will of the Tribunal'<br />
Effect: Decrease attack speed by 75%<br />
          Add 24 disease counters<br />
Modifier: -50 (magic)<br />
Mana: 300<br />
Cast: 1.5<br />
Recast: 2.25<br />
Duration: 6 minutes<br />
<br />
Soandso is shackled by the will of the Tribunal<br />
<br />
That way I free up the slot that FA is going to take, and if we had the avatar AA, I get a second spell gem for something else. Now I might actually be able to alternate a rain and a nuke to do some kind of dps. Not to mention, with the fast-cast and no malo factor of this slow, I'm slowing everything a hell of a lot faster giving me more time to do other things.<br />
<br />
Make Focus of Soul/Seventh 800 hps, so it's second-best again. While you're at it, make Protection/Blessing of Nine stack with Focus and Virtue. Why does our buff stack with both cleric and druid's, but the druid's gets trumped by the cleric's? If it's because of the AC on Nine, then take that off and add melee damage mitigation instead. I'm sure druids wouldnt mind that change.<br />
<br />
Give us a mana-burn heal AA, not affected by focus or other AAs. A single target fast cast AA that heals equal to our existing mana pool, drains all our mana, and has semi-long reuse. The better equipped you are, the better your burn heal would be. Not sure exactly how long the reuse timer would have to be, but that would be how you would tweak the AA to keep it from being overpowered. Probably something like the reuse time on Lay Hands for paladins (90 mins), since it'd be a very similiar ability, although it could be less considering ours would burn our entire mana pool. Now, you have a reason to have multiple shamans on a raid - one or two to slow and Malo, the rest to be in a burn-heal rotation to help keep the tank alive until the CH rotation is going. With CannV, you'd still be able to get something else done after you burned your heal.</div></div><hr />

And these kind of abilities do not work. On a raid the payoff is too great and the cost negligible.<br />

<br />

So you change the number down to 25% - and now a guild with 24% of the reuiqired healing cannot do it.<br />
What has changed is that a single shaman's contribution went from a 10% slow to a 75% slow, probably out-&quot;healing&quot; all other healers combined and trivializing the encounter.<br />
<br />
The shaman's role in your example encounter makes a difference just at the spot where the guild can endure 92%.  The shaman casts Grummus and it lands, and the healing and tanking is just barely adequate to keep the tanks alive while the dps people burn the mob down.<br />
And where is the problem with that?<br />
<br />
Most likely, though, the guild eventually progresses to where they can endure 100% of the mob's dps.  If the shaman succeeds in getting a slow to stick, that's fine, but they have the tanking, healing, and dps to defeat the mob even if the shaman cannot slow it.<br />
And I do not have an issue with that - why should I be required for content that my guild has outgrown?<br />
<br />
Where does the shaman, the master of slows, make a difference in your example?  Sigh.  He or she doesn't.  Except in the very rare instance where the guild has just progressed from having the skill, equipment, and teamwork to endure 88% of the mob's full dps to having the skill, equipment, and teamwork to endure 92% of the mob's full dps.  Then -- and only then -- does having a shaman on the team make a difference.<br />
How is reducing the damage output of a MOB that takes half a dozen clerics to heal by 10% not making a difference?<br />
<br />
But if they have progressed to the point where they can endure 30%, or 60%, of the mob's full dps, if they have a shaman with the ability and the willingness to pay the price, they would have an option for an alternate strategy.<br />
Let me put it like that - Imagine your ability slowed a MOB of up to lvl 65 by 99%. Now, there will not be many bosses you can use that on but I am sure you can find something to abuse it on - is this fair to everyone else?<br />
Let me repeat - slowing a raid MOB by 10% or 20% is fine - you just contributed more then your share. Asking for more is unreasonable.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that being able to slow a mob like this makes the encounter easily doable by a trio of paladin, druid, and shaman.  But what if it did?  Think of all the very hard Velious raid encounters that are now one group, trio, or even solo material, for people with high end equipment.  <br />
And you cannot see the difference between trivializing Velious and trivializing GoD?<br />
<br />
I think what your trio actually would get, though, would include this:<br />
<br />
Best case scenario:  paladin, druid, shaman vs hard boss mob.  Shaman casts proposed aa slow, succeeds, goes to 100 hp.  Paladin does immediate LoH, shaman is full health.  Paladin tanks mob successfully, shaman and druid do heals and some nukes, and the trio wins -- if the three of them can produce enough dps to kill the mob before the slow wears off.  <br />
Now get away from that hypothetical trio doing an expedition and think of a 50 man GoD raid. They tend to have bosses. Some of these may well be slowable, if only slightly. They have been designed to take a certain number of clerics, say 6, healing a defensive warrior. Suddenly that drops to 2 clerics healing a paladin. Welcome to pre-debuffing, engaging only after slow is in and other fun things. Reducing a single group MObs damage output by 75% is fine. Reducing a raid boss's DPS by 75% is not.<br />
<br />
You still don't have to like my idea.  I'm not sure that I myself like it.  I'm just brainstorming here.  So here's my proposal.  Rather than pointing out that my suggestion is hopelessly lame or hopelessly overpowering, come up with a better one.  <br />
I am saying that the general idea does not work. Imagine an ability that gives you a 99% chance of failing and draining a full level worth of experience - but the 1% that it does work it instantly kills any MOB. The cost is high, the risk is high but the ability is not balanced. On a raid you are expected to do a small part - heal 10% of the bosses damage, deal 5% of the damage needed to kill it,these sort of things.</div></div><hr />

A cool AA would be a super AC buff for a short period of time.<br />
Maybe +1000 to AC for 3 ticks (could go into the Songs buff box).<br />
It would need to be insta cast, and with maybe a 5min reuse.<br />
I know there are all sorts of AC caps, so adding 1000 to your current AC would likely hit it.<br />

Mental Capacity.<br />

It has 3 levels. (maybe 2)<br />
<br />
First level, gives you one additional gem to mem spells in, each additional level gives one more for a total of 11 gems total.<br />
<br />
Having 10 or 11 gems to mem spells in would make life MUCH easier and would do away with the need to have some more AA's. Why have a canni AA and FA AA if you can still keep them memmed and have other stuff memmed as well....<br />
<br />
I think with so many spells being added that aren't in a 'spell line', so you can't just remove the old spell, we need more spell gems....<br />

If it's because of the AC on Nine, then take that off and add melee damage mitigation instead. I'm sure druids wouldnt mind that change.<br />

Druid AC/HP buffs have traditionally never stacked with cleric AC/HP buffs. If you make Focus 800hps, and 9+Virtue stack then you overnight add nearly 1k hp to everyone's buffed HP total.<br />

As has already been said, this would be way overpowered on boss mobs. It would not help shamans out at all in exp groups.<br />
<br />
1. Slow AA - If SOE is set on the proposed heal change, what can be done in another area to alleviate our concern?<br />
<br />
What about an AA slow ability with a 3 minute recast (like our virulent paralysis) that is highly unlikely to be resisted and slows a target 50%?<br />
<br />
This would give us some way to gain instant control over the fight - albeit at a reduced level. This slow AA, combined with the new heal ratio, would allow our heals to work to a meaningful degree at the time of the initial arrival of the mob. The AA should have a significant chance of landing without a malos. Maybe it should even be unresistable.<br />
<br />
This sounds a bit like our GoD slow. I'd rather have Balance of the Nihil tuned up a bit, myself. Maybe an AA with a 3 minute reuse and having the combined effect of malos+turgurs (-55 resist, 75% slow) would not be overpowered, though.<br />
<br />
An AA group FA would be nice, and would free up that spell gem. Even if that makes it MGBable, you can only MGB once an hour anyway, though that will give a fair DPS increase on some boss fights, so I imagine it'll never happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much the only AA I would be for would be one for all casting classes...<br />
<br />
More damn spell slots.  8 was fine when all classes had maybe 3 lines of spells or something, but with as many lines as there are now, we need more slots.  Even 2 more slots would help TONS.  Instead of complaining for an FA AA, how about just another slot so I would keep it memmed and the other stuff.  They give us a new slow that has situational uses..but do we REALLY want/need to have 2 slows memmed at the same time with our current 8 slots?  Canni/FA are some of the AA's I'm seeing now..but if they would just give us 2 more slots..I would be more than happy without an AA that would probably cost 50AA's and give me the same as 2 spots with less flexibility<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I got 2 more ideas but pushing our current healing skills a little bit for a short period without making us always better:<br />
<br />
a) AA_01: makes all your direct heals critt and no fizzle for the next 30sec (aka 5-6sec TMs). Reuse time about 30min. This aa could be balanced that no MP works on this heals or we use double mana like MGB (with MP working). This should give us a nice short burst in healing.<br />
<br />
b) AA_02 a little bit weaker then AA_01: the next HoT casted heals double the amount per tick then usual. Reuse time about 15-20min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Additional AA Ipmrovements:<br />
<br />
1) Base DD Upgrade: 10%/15%/20% - attempt to balance burst dps.<br />
<br />
2) MemSpells While Standing - we were made part bard with spells like can4/fa/etc. Most shams have only 4 free spell gems to rotate spells into during raids and groups. This would end some of the mob beating you while toon001 spams, &quot;Can I get a shrink yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
3) AE Malo - Our ae spells have been overlooked for a long time. When was the last time you got an invite to an AE group? I have to admit when we do raids that are AE its sorta fun to drop some rains but rather disappointing the amount of resists you receive. Also this would address some of the issues about mobs being 50% dead before slow lands on mass pulls, have one shm drop the AE Malo bomb while the others slow. Reuse time should be like VP.<br />
<br />
4) AE Upgrade - Remove the rain limit, make our ae spells true ae. It would be nice if Tigirs was equal to what a bard can do on slowing numbers. Also would be nice if our AE Poison would deliver more damage across an area rather than just 4 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ok, I've seen a lot of suggestions i really like, and many that i really don't get, but there are a few ideas that I've had for a while now that would put us back to where we were in luclin.  A few simple changes would bring us up to par for healing.  Sylvan infusion with a slightly inferior hp/mana ratio.  That, imo, would allow us to be secondary healer in any of the trials on an even field with druids in that role.  <br />
<br />
For buffing, we've had many ideas, and here's mine.  Mudflation has diminished the importance of the STR and DEX components of our focus line.  With low enough strenght and dexterity, focus will give about 60-70 atk and a decent boost to proc rate (not huge, but definitely noticeable).  What I would like to see done with Fo7/Soul, as i've seen suggested several times before, is giving the the same utility for melee as casters get from P/Bo9 (8 mana/tick regen), and replacing the STR and DEX with appropriate boosts to characters with capped strenght and dexterity, since we are the &quot;kings of melee buffing,&quot; after all.  <br />
<br />
What I'd suggest is some end regen, say 8/tick (in line with 9 for druids...maybe lower or raise this number based on what end regen is like unbuffed.  Not overly useful, but eh, once they finish implementing end it might be), +atk (minor, effectively the +atk a pure melee would be getting from the STR if under the cap) and +combat effects (also minor, the effect the DEX would provide to a character under the cap) and take OUT the STR and DEX components (leave in diaku for lower end people that want the stat boosts).  This would be a very minor upgrade, but it would make Fo7 a MUCH better buff in the high end.  Upgrade to the high end, where its needed, leave things the same at the low end, since diaku and focus stack anyway, so for lower end characters we've been able to add double value of the str and dex components for a while.<br />
<br />
For numbers, i haven't really done much parsing, but discussing with a few melee friends, I came up with say 30atk, 5 combat effects, very rough numbers, but i can't fiddle with it on test server, unlike soe hehe..well, i guess i *could* but i know 0 about eqemu hehe.    Leave diaku in as is to boost up the lower end raids' STR/DEX if they want while eating a buff slot<br />
<br />
That, i feel, would give us a worthwhile buff, with a noticeable upgrade at the high end, without wreaking havoc on class balance, pve balance, or anything of the sort....group FA would be nice too, or longer duration FA so i could have that spell gem back, but that's already been covered.  I think these changes would bring ONE of our traditional roles (buffing) up to par.  <br />
<br />
Our other key role has been debuffing.  I don't see us getting any completely new debuff lines, as they'd have too drastic a change on raid encounters/other old content, or be useless.  Also, i don't WANT to be eating another slot on the mob, because raids with a decent number of necros are already strapped for spell slots on the mob.  Necros need the slots to do their job.  Same thing for a &quot;piggyback&quot; type slow that is XX low number, but stackable by many shaman.  Necros WILL hate us if we get something like that ^_^ (we should all know how annoying it is to see some stupid boil blood proc prevent bane, blood of saryrn, or something, from sticking on the mob..I HATE YOU GENERAL DRUAV SWORD).  <br />
<br />
What I'd suggest is an AA that effects slow mitigation.  Once again, nothing MAJOR, just something to cement us as the big daddy of slowers.  I'm not sure on the actual %'s of the different slow mitigation levels, but something to make us break through partially, so our slows are LESS mitigated than bst and enc slows.  So my slightly successful turgurs is a bigger improvement over an enc than the current .75 x (mitigation%) vs .70 x (mitigation%).  Make it % based, so slightly slowable mobs (raid mobs in general) don't get much of a change, but mostly slowable mobs have something a lot closer to 75% for us.  <br />
<br />
Give us back our lead over enchanters for slowing, and with the mez/charm issues in higher up GoD, there will be a legit reason to take a good shaman over a good enchanter as your slower, but not an overwhelming one, and also reason to take both (a skilled enchanter has plenty of utility outside of charm, mez, slow, just takes some creativity with their spell set).  I know people stuck in the mountain trials might not believe it, but beyond those trials, enchanters are NOT the godly characters they are in tipt and below, and it would be a huge blow to them if we completely outclassed them for slows, but maintaining the balance we had before mitigation was implemented for relative mob dps differential would give us the boost we need.  <br />
<br />
Maybe boost balance of nihil to be a resist modded turgurs clone with a higher mana cost and we're RIGHT BACK to the role we've been playing forever, minus tanking, of course...i miss being able to offtank xp mobs while i positioned them for root and using torpor to heal myself up, but i think those days are completely gone.</div></div><hr />

A valid point with which I agree, but nonetheless I will propose ONE new debuff AA.  How about an AA which increases the recast time for a mob's AE???

Muram's Insects - Acts as an upgrade to our Balance type slows.  Slows mob up to 75% (minus mitigation) with a -65 MR check to the mob.  This spell/ability would be combined with Cripple to add in the extra debuff without taking up another spell gem<br />
<br />
This'll allow us to further debuff the mob without adding any particularly overpowering effect.  It'll raise our efficentcy.  To keep it relatively balanced, the cripple effect should be the same debuff as our lvl 53 Cripple (-75 Dex, -85 Agi, -85 Str, -36 AC) vice our level 66 Cripple.<br />

Also, I like the idea stated earlier of cripple or its level 66 equivalent to be added to our slows.  <br />
<br />
Another issue I have is that we will never be able to be main healer at an equal efficiency level as the other two classes because we have to take time to debuff a mob.. too much time.  I see a few possible solutions to this problem.  First, would be to lower the casting time on malos to 3.0ish before aa's/effects.  Secondly, is to realize that having new slows with a good check that doesn't require malos is a step in the right direction but still, its casting time + downtime + time we have to wait until tank has sufficient agro still means that we cannot heal in higher tier content effectively.  What we need is a clickable or aa version (with short enough downtime so we can use it on one mob per average 30-45 seconds between pulls) of the slow so that we can heal without the additional downtime.  <br />
<br />
Some of the other ideas I have read seem good also, but these are the issues that are currently in debate I think and would make me happy for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Crit canni would freakin suck.  I use canni from low hp all the time, since I know my limits.  Making it occasionally take out double the hp would cut it's usability by a huge degree.  It would suck exactly like Berserker snare sucks.  You want to update Canni, just put in a 5/5/5 aa that chops 20sec off the cooldown with each rank.<br />

The whole point of the spell is so that you can't cast it on the entire raid.  It is meant to only be on the tank.  If you could cast it on anyone, then you might as well just add it to the slow in the first place which they are not willing to do or otherwise enchanters wouldn't have a slow 5 percent less than ours and our slows wouldn't be mitigated in the first place.  <br />
<br />
I listed two ways to implement this, since a lot of people think we don't have enough spell icons.  In the case of it being an aa, shorter recast is better... so what the hell are you talking about?  In the case of it being a spell, it would eat up another space since it would have to be memmed constantly pretty much.  I realize that this implementation would be tedious, so I suggested an alternative.  A bonus to this spell is to increase shaman stackability on raids.  Since they could ONLY keep it up on one person, having additional shamans becomes more attractive to do something other than mgb a different buff or chain blast heal.  <br />
<br />
If it was instant recast, you would end up having to cast it on an entire raid.  Now tell me, which is more tedious... ?<br />
<br />
1.  casting one spell (or aa) on one target every 15 min.<br />
2.  casting one long term spell on an entire raid or at the very least every tank.<br />
<br />
You are right though, I should propose it to last four hours so that after the tank dies and you are ready to engage the next named you get to wait for three and a half more hours.  If you don't want to keep a spell up, then your solution is simple - don't.

I'll quote the whole thing so you don't cry. This is ****ing stupid. Firstly, if you want to sell an idea by saying &quot;having additional shamans becomes more attractive to do something other than mgb a different buff or chain blast heal.&quot; then you probably went to the Tugela school of shaman effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Secondly, once again this is a way of making a shaman more effective through other people. We shouldn't need to rely on other people playing just to be needed, or more importantly to be able to utilize our best skills.<br />
<br />

It was just an idea.  Besides, adding 5 percent to our slow, although helpful, would still be subject to mitigation which would lessen its effect.

Casting a buff like that on yourself means you would need to be tanking to get it to go off? Or on rampage? You did say you could cast it on yourself? Perhaps you didn't mean in a raid environment.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">The reverse proc buff principle itself is not all that bad really.<br />
<br />
The 5% slow add-on however is potentially useless, game-breaking, annoying or any combination thereof. And it would not in any way, shape or form make multiple shaman desirable on a raid where there were useless before and I can not fathom why anyone would think that a precastable buff would make shaman more stackable.<br />
<br />
The effect itself could be<br />
 - stackable with itself. In that case it is game-breakingly overpowered.<br />
 - subject to mitigation. In that case it is useless.<br />
 - take up one of the shaman's spell gem. That is needless annoyance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Blakdecree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Like I said, it could be an aa.  And 5 percent is actually a very, very significant amount of dmg reduction.  Especially when you get into some stuff that is only slightly slowable.  The reason you need more than one shaman is so that you can have it on backup tanks.  Think about it like this... 5 percent less swings at the MT is more valuable than the MT mitigating 5 percent more damage.  You have extra time to heal.  You say, &quot;so what?&quot;.  Now remember back when everything was fully slowable.  How often would the tank die?  There is only one situation and that is when he got one rounded (discounting the possibility of healers being clueless).  The response time allowed was just too high to make anything challenging.  Although this is not a 75 percent slow, every chunk towards that mark helps in the same way.  It is rarely one single round that kills the tank, but the mob getting in the next round before the tank is healed completely.  This is a game of fractions, and 5 percent, while not overpowering, I think is a good enough figure to be a huge help.  If it were an aa, could maybe make it scale 3, 5, 7 percentages or something.  Like I said, it is just a brainstorm for a way to get our slows back to a place where there is some differentiation between shm and enchanter.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if we seem needlessly insulting Blak, but your ideas seem even less than brainstorming and more of brainleaking to those of us who have been playing for years and have been paying attention to how and why things get done.  Shaman have been beat over the head with the nerf stick so much due to us haveing &quot;the best slow&quot; its rediculous, this would besides being highly annoying and possibly game breaking would just make it worse.<br />

Honestly one of the last things we want is a variable slow.  A proc would not be consistant and therefore you would get lots of spikes which would mess up the healers even more, besides if we were givin 5% more slow it would be immediatly taken away in the form of balancing content against that always being used.</div></div><hr />

I'm not surprised you are better geared than I am, I am just surprised that you harp on the wrong things with the amount of experience your magelo points to you having.<br />
<br />
No need to patiently wait. The AA has nothing to do with anything, nor the gear. I was interested in the zones you have been raiding/grinding in. It has a huge impact. If you haven't been anywhere how do you know how to scale something? Alternatively, if you've been everywhere and still don't understand something, at least you have been there. :/</div></div><hr />

What is the benefit of casting a buff like that on someone who will not be tanking? Do you also think that more shaman are good because that means that every druid will get spirit of the panther and FA?<br />
<br />
Think about it like this... 5 percent less swings at the MT is more valuable than the MT mitigating 5 percent more damage.  You have extra time to heal.<br />
And you would not have extra time to heal if the tank mitigated more or what? What kind kind of logic is that?<br />
<br />
P.S.: What is the possible benefit of an added 5% reverse proc buff over just asking for an 80% slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Blakdecree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">MT's die... it has a 15 min repop so therefore you couldn't cast it on all of them.  The situations where this might be the case are the situations in which you would benefit from 5 percent more slowage anyways.<br />
<br />
That is the whole theory of a ch chain.  The tank is healed at regular intervals so therefore the mob must take that many hps in an x second interval in order for him to die.  By the mob swinging slower (or having more clerics) you can expand the interval to the point to where it eventually becomes impossible for the tank to die without getting one rounded.  There are often other factors to take into account, such as procs or aoe's that can damage during this interval also that don't give a **** what the tank's mitigation is.  Additionally, I'm pretty sure mitigation is not constant, but relative to an inherit stat of the mob.  <br />
<br />
p.s.  It is unmitigated, instant, and helps stackability, but you are right.. not much.  Really, the whole point is that if we are getting a heal vastly inferior to the other two priest classes (looks like it), then we should have a larger advantage in slowing.</div></div><hr />

Not much? Not at all! Is this so hard to see?<br />
<br />
1 MOB<br />
old system - 1 shaman is needed to slow<br />
your system - 1 shaman is needed to slow, 1 to prebuff the tank. The same shaman can do this<br />
<br />
4 MOB<br />
old system - 4 shaman are needed to slow<br />
your system - 4 shaman are needed to slow, 4 to prebuff the up to 4 tanks. At most 4 shaman are needed<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Blakdecree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">/shrug say they have to offtank.  <br />
<br />
With one shaman, you can have them all slowed to 75 percent * mitigation with one slowed to (75 * mitigation) + 5 percent.  <br />
<br />
With four shaman, you can have them all slowed to 75 percent * mitigation with four slowed to (75 * mitigation) + 5 percent.<br />
<br />
Say you are tanking one mob.  <br />
<br />
With one shaman, you have 75 percent * mitigation + 5 percent.  MT dies, second tank hits his usual fur / def routine.  Now you have 75 percent * mitigation until your ability repops.<br />
<br />
With four shaman, you have 75 percent * mitigation + 5 percent.  MT dies, second tank has his on, mob is still slowed at 75 percent * mitigation + 5 percent.  Second tank goes down, etc etc.  It stays up unless all die so quickly that your ability does not have time to repop.  The more shaman that you have, the more tanks that you can go through in that interval.<br />
<br />
Like I said, the stackability is not much, but it is a small factor.  The more mobs that you are forced to fight at once, the more stackability it has, though.</div></div><hr />

Stackability does not mean stacking up tanks with a useless buff in case it needs to become a useful one.... do you see that?<br />

Stackability means that at all times all shaman are providing useful effect to a raid.<br />

With one shaman, you can have them all slowed to 75 percent * mitigation with one slowed to (75 * mitigation) + 5 percent.  <br />
<br />
With four shaman, you can have them all slowed to 75 percent * mitigation with four slowed to (75 * mitigation) + 5 percent.<br />
(bolding mine)<br />
<br />
Look, the sole reason for having multiple shaman on a raid is to have the debuffing go faster. Shaman can not malos or slow multiple MOBs simultaneously. So if you will be facing x MOBs at the same time you are going to want up to x shaman. That is the definition of stackability, the extend to which multiples are useful.<br />
<br />
Your proposed ability does not raise that number. In fact it may give one shaman the ability to slow multiple MOBs simultaneously, albeit to a small percentage. So, if anything, it decreases shaman stackability. It certainly does not increase it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Blakdecree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I have not argued for my idea once.  I have done nothing but correct people who are trying to twist my idea into something that I didn't say (ie you).  <br />
<br />
It might not be a good idea in general, or you may not think it is a good idea.  Either way, it was my idea and seeing that this is an idea thread, I posted what I thought.  <br />
<br />
If I said I wanted a DT spell, then that is my right to say it.  <br />
<br />
Murtak... let's define stackability.  Obviously, you are talking about something completely different to not be able to see what I clearly already said.<br />
<br />
Stackability:  getting use from having additional shamans at the raid past the first one.  <br />
<br />
Now, clearly you get more use always from having more than one in the form of more mana efficiency from buffs, more blast heals overall, more blast heals that go off at once making for a higher hps healed per second, mobs are debuffed quicker, and someone is less likely to die to an add with more shaman watching for them.  Probably others, relating to curing and such but it is too numberous to list.  <br />
<br />
All of this is stackability.  You listed one way that shamans stack.  I said that the aa that I proposed would also increase shaman stackability (I even said only slightly).  I proved why this is true.  Yet you still argue over something that makes little difference.</div></div><hr />

Your idea adds less, wayless, to the desirability of multiple shaman then a straight up 5% addition to Nihil or Turgur's. Would it improve shaman stackability? Strictly speaking, yes. However if shaman would not get other things - say, a minuscule increase in healing or nuking power - because they got this ability instead then shaman will stack worse on raids then if they had gotten some truly stackable ability instead.<br />
<br />
Or, to put it another way, your idea does not promote more slowers per raid, it merely promotes more of those slowers being shaman. And it does so less efficiently then the easiest possible solution - more straight up slowing power, which stacks better and comes with less hassle, no spell gem lost, no AA costs, no annoying rebuffing and no stacking issues.<br />
<br />
You will run into the exact same issues of &quot;what to do now that everything is slowed?&quot; that you run into now, at the exact same time, with the exact same number of shaman on your raids. Only now MOBs will deal a bit less damage and the shaman are a bit more annoyed. If you define these extra 5% as stackability, if you say that our stacking issues will be solved if we get a little more distance to beastlord and enchanter slows then you still should not push for your idea. Instead push for a higher percentage slow which has all of the benefits of your idea and less downsides.</div></div><hr />
