<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im curious if anyone has experience with leading a guild and distributing loot that can offer some comments on this item.<br />
<br />
Bone Clasped Girdle (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=934)<br />
<br />
Now considering that it does have almost 100hp and 75 mana, but no int, would this be a worthwhile item for a magician, wizard or enchanter (and yes chanters have a couple dots to use.../cough) but it would affect mezzes, maybe one ticks worth.<br />
<br />
For druids and clerics, I dont see them wanting this item very much as their playstyles would tend not to fit the effect.  Druids quad far more than root rot and when many of them do dot its with clickes anyway.  Clerics have very very few detrimental spells but I guess this would be decent for some of their undead dots.<br />
<br />
Then of course this item seriously rocks for shamans and necros, particularly shamans I would say because of the massive hp's and that it has no wis/int which (myself personally) wouldnt miss.<br />
<br />
Im curious because last night two of these dropped and were randomed to all able to wear.  Wizard and enchanter won, competing against 3 shamans and 2 necros I think it was.<br />
<br />
Made me pretty sick that they wouldnt bow out of that roll, but whatcha gonna do.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">loot whores suck, i bet they wanted for twinks/etc<br />
altho hp/mana items are pretty much good for all classes, my guild takes  NBG approach (as all good guilds should)<br />
same argument for weight redux bags, sure evrybody wants one, but our monks get them w/o exception, which is exactly the way it should be. classes that benefit most form an item's stats/effects should be the ones getting them. end of discussion.<br />
/rant off =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Crappy AC. The hp and mana are nice, but they are nice for everyone really. It could be argued that hp are nicest for shaman / necro, but hell some of those pyjama wearing finger wigglers need all the hp they can get!<br />
<br />
The AC and stats on this item are, IMO, a red herring - The item is of interest for one reason only - the focus effect. The extended affliction III makes this item a DoT caster only item. Druids, Shaman, Necro. I do not believe that any of those classes has a better claim than the other 2, but I do think that those 3 classes should be given &quot;first refusal&quot;.<br />
<br />
I will just mention that because the AC is rather low, most shaman would, I think, be better off getting the coldain bracer - which, unless you have a bracer of sense and a JBB would probably offer less AC / stat &quot;penalties&quot; for the same focus effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye weyalan thats what Ive been thinking from the shaman side.  The wristguard is a pretty good piece considering the effect + stats.  The girdle has low ac true but almost 100hp plus a ton of mana.<br />
<br />
It really is a tough call, especially since the wristguard is SO easy to get.<br />
<br />
My guild is having a hard time with NBG as we are doing HoT now but still also have many low 50's in the guild.  Our player base is too wide for our own good I think and so loot is quite an issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your words :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why wouldn't a druid want it again?  They snare, so they don't get hit so the low AC isn't a big issue for them.  They dot so the affliction focus is useful.<br />
<br />
If you wouldn't miss the wis, why do you think a wizard would miss the int or a cleric would miss the wis?<br />
<br />
There are VERY few decent belts in the game.  There is a huge empty spot between stuff like the chitinous belt and really great belts like a Belt of Dwarf Slaying.  The BCG has fantastic hitpoints and mana and that makes it a viable choice for any caster.<br />
<br />
As far as the focus effect goes, would you stay out of a random for Onyx Gloves in NTOV (+35 AC, +3 vsMg, +3 vsFire, +3 vsCold, +3 vsPos, +3 vsDis, +100 HP, +75 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of Reanimation Efficiency III) because they have reanimation efficiency on them?  <br />
<br />
Hey Jaidin, I hear what you're saying about difficulties with NGB in HoT.  I think my guild came up with a really great approach to HoT farming.  We used a &quot;leapfrog method.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Our guildmaster created a place where every guildmember could list their gear level for each slot (head, boots, arms, bracers, bp, helm, gloves, legs, etc).  It was each guildmember's responsibility to keep the table updated if they had an upgrade.<br />
<br />
The system we used was:<br />
<br />
1) Non planar, lowest level (we had casters in loam, for example)<br />
2) Planar<br />
3) Kunark<br />
4) Thurg<br />
5) Velious quest (SS/Kael)<br />
6) High level raid drop, superior to SS/Kael<br />
<br />
So, let's say a pair of chain gloves dropped. The officers would ask the chain wearers to send a tell with their armor level for that slot.  Let's say: Ranger01 has level 4 Thurg, Rogue01 has level 2 planar and shaman01 has level 2 planar.  Rogue01 and shaman01 would random for the gloves.<br />
<br />
A tiny bit of personal accountability has to go into this method.  For example, if someone were eligible for 3 leapfrog upgrades in one day (bracer, boots, gloves, for example) over people who have had no upgrades that day, it was considered the honorable and gracious thing to do to bow out for the rest of the raid after receiving an upgrade.<br />
<br />
This method is GREAT for gearing up a guild, but it does require some sensitivity.  A person that has been in the guild awhile, with really high playtime might have a full set of Thurg (for example). With leapfrog, they might get passed over for upgrade in HoT several times while people newer to the guild would get upgrades to replace sub-Thurg gear.<br />
<br />
It did work out very well for us.  I was a high playtime person in nearly full Thurg (minus bp) when we first started hitting HoT.  Although it did take a really long time, I was full SS by the time we left, and so was nearly everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye we are starting that kind of leapfrog approach.  I remember you mentioning something like that a while ago.  The decision is based on officers evaluation of his class members at the raid and of course the members themselves who wish to be in on the piece.<br />
<br />
Specifically for the belt though, I do see the relevance of everyone rolling on the item that is true.  It should be open as, like you said, theres very few good belts for casters.  There were other circumstances involving that particular rolling that influenced my questioning of perhaps defaulting to a class or classes though (like member playtime and level, etc)<br />
<br />
What I did learn though is that we need to go to fear a few more times and get some more belts :)  I had no idea they dropped that frequently.<br />
<br />
Do you mind if I suggest such a leapfrog approach to my officers?  It might help a lot with their decisions, plus would really alleviate some of the tension when nice gear does drop.  My guild seems to be in an awkward time, when we arent raiding high level areas regularly but have no problems when we do.  As such, many members have lower level gear and all want what does drop :)<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldnt miss the wis because I havent ever really felt that shaman need to aspire for high wisdom or mana, whereas other classes wanted it specifically for the mana.<br />
<br />
I dont know of druids that dot with actual mana dots too much 50+.  I think all our guild druids have epics and bracers.<br />
<br />
Although Im really not well versed in how other classes view items, still learning the politics of it all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not at all, Jaidin.  Jaiieq is our webmaster, he's the one that created the online table where we kept track of our armor levels.  You could also ask some of our officers how they thought the system worked (Khael, Onepz, Stumpf (former member), Shazanti, Aganerral).<br />
<br />
It was a really good system, but we had a definite goal in mind of creating a really strong guild to tackle the next level of Velious, so our system paid off for us. People really have to go into it with a &quot;guild first&quot; mentality.<br />
<br />
I'm wearing a BCG myself, I like the hitpoints/mana/focus effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Barbed Rubicite Girdle is a very nice tradeable upgrade to the Chitinous belt.<br />
<br />
Artificer's is good too if you can find a grand master tribunal smith. Very similar to the barbed rubi belt.<br />
<br />
I believe both are level limited though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cultural belt should be recommended lvl 45 can be worn with reduced stats.<br />
<br />
The barbed rubi belt should be recommended lvl 51 can't used untill then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyzzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly I wouldn't worry about this.  Ther are many better shaman belts out there that you would not want to sacrifice for this.  And if it is the effect you want, get the coldain wristguard.  If you get it on a roll great, but I wouldn't argue about shaman not getting first dibs on it or spending raid points if you use that system.<br />
