<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macabre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK folks got some questions on PoM. <br />
first how do ya get there? I know its in ToV some where <br />
but i cant find any info on it any where.<br />
second just how rare are the drops of quest items?<br />
third how tuff is the zone? Are the stories about lvl 60 shaman being able to solo here correct? If not what kind of forces do ya need to bring with yas?<br />

It is in Ntov.  See the map on the site above.<br />
You RUN LIKE HELL to get there.  I (and my friends) ran all the way there, I am CoV ally so I had some advantage that I could get in there a bit before trouble started.  4 out of 6 of us made it on our first attempt following that route on the map.<br />

Easy for 60 shaman to solo most all stuff in there.<br />
<br />
The zone was nerfed and the quest armor is currently impossible to get if you were not there pre-nerf.  Or have a friend that can sell you a doll.</div></div><hr />
