<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good lord this is painful. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed killing halflings at first but now I just want to scream lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Words of wealth drop offa anything in the zone right? I guess I could make things a little faster if i'd just go after greenies.<br />
<br />
On the plus side I am a leet stomples/white lith pharmer and people like to buy my spare thrones.<br />
<br />
Generally I will just log in, check my 2 favorite named, clear AiWL4, and then go do something else. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I should kill in the rat maze?<br />
<br />
Killed all the puppets but 2 so far<br />
<br />
Havent tried killing nothing but audience members yet.<br />
<br />
Die halflings die<br />
<br />
<br />
Then once I make my last 2 funny money I have like a 1/12th chance of getting a shaman doll<br />
<br />
Then its back to farming.<br />
<br />
Ridiculously Funny!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a friend that has literly spent months there , he is bound there and spends all none raiding time there and still doesnt have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my time there, which is about 2 months or so, I have gotten shaman, wizard, enchanter, necro, and another shaman box.  Also 2 times I got nothing so it was either a dupe box or the nothing.<br />
<br />
So yeah, fun stuff.  I have gotten all the armor pieces I wanted, but oddly enough I cannot leave the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Funny Money Pieces are best obtained either in the forest or from audience. Audience even gives exp at 65 :P  If you can get a mage or necro partner you'll both rip through them and you can keep the entire audience cleared before repop.</div></div><hr />

I'm nowhere near being able to go there, level-wise or gear-wise, yet I feel like I've already been farming there, because of all the threads I've read on here about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Basic rule about PoM: if you go there expecting to be able to get items in a reasonable amount of time, you're going to be disappointed. Guaranteed. It takes more patience than just about any other solo activity/quest in the game. Between the very rare drops of most cards, to the endless quest for WoW top left, to the mob/pet depop bugs, it's easy to be frustrated, especially 61+ when the exp is pretty weak.<br />
<br />
Just enjoy the zone for what it is. Yes, it's buggy. Yes, there are plenty of unfinished quests and bizarre items for which there is no apparent use. However, it's quirkiness and very unique nature keep bringing some people back (myself included). If you can handle just being there to pick up some exp or whatnot, then you'll do fine, and the boots will be a bonus (unless you plan on buying all the items, of course... many of which are readily for sale, at least on Stormhammer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i bought my shaman doll for 100p!<br />
you should check the bazaar atleast on BB there are always a ton of PoM pieces for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I spent months up there with 3 friends before the revamp... and so I was just farming cards and looking for a doll to buy.  I bought my doll for 20k and a white crown for 10k, and a friend gave me my white throne... and it still took about 3 months for me to get the other throne.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got the boots after 1  year on and off pharming PoM not worth the trouble, go kill Vindi and get his boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my guild is too cool to kill vindi anymore unless he is in the way to statue/idol/aow. Boots are his rare drop. I have the cards out of the way for the boots as it is. Now all that remains are tons of words of wealth. I will not change my bind point until I have my boots. <br />
<br />
period!! /twitch</div></div><hr />
