<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As all of you know, three classes are getting Pure Blood.  Bards are also getting a song that is pretty much like Disinfecting Aura, as well as a curse removal song.  Does this mean there will be tons of poisons and diseases in LoY? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doubt it, even there will be some, it wont affect end game much becuz its designed for pre-60; when my pally solo to 51 in 5days (slow I know), I dont really care about what spell we get in 44 or young lvl 50, it all will pass so fast u wont even notice it; maybe not the pure blood since druid dont have that spells.</div></div><hr />
