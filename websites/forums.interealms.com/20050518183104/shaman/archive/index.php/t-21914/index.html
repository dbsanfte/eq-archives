Neg rep bump me for saying it, but I don't like it.<br />
<br />
We're functional slowers, continued attention to beefing up our slowing ability detracts from the argument of letting us do anything else at a capable level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guess is this wont have a Slow componant at all . I dont even belive this will end up a slow spell . Probibly a Debuff of some sort .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IF it is a slow...hell if it's ANYTHING, it's got the #1 problem with shaman spells in my opinion: cast/recast time. Casting Time: 5 Recast Time: 10 !<br />
<br />
Whats with our slows all having these huge recast times? I had a chanter tell me the other day &quot;just use one of your lower level slows&quot; when I asked him how the hell he was slowing TWO mobs in the time I slowed one. That cleared things up a bit, as you can see here:<br />
<br />
Shaman slows:<br />
Turgur's Insects - cast time 3 secs - recast 6 secs - 75% slow - 250 mana - level 51 <br />
Togor's Insects - cast time 5 secs - recast 5 secs - 70% slow - 175 mana - level 39 <br />
Tagar's Insects - cast time 4.25 secs - recast 5 secs - 50% slow - 125 mana - level 29 <br />
Walking Sleep - cast time 3.25 secs - recast 5 secs - 35% slow - 60 mana - level 14 <br />
<br />
Enchanter slows:<br />
Tepid Deeds - cast time 3.5 secs - recast 2.25 secs - 50% slow - 100 mana - level 24 <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok I wont even list more than one chanter slow, because this one spell says it all. 2.25 recast time, vs. our lowest of 5. So if this disease spell IS in fact a slow, it's still going to hamstring us with the ludacris 10 second recast delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep it will be a disease based slow wich will be capped at 40%. Interesting combo though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Disease based slows are one of the few things unique to our class.  Enchancements that don't steal from other classes are very appealing to me.  Imagine if it was lure, 70%, with a fast recast?<br />
<br />
I want to hear, &quot;nah, better get a shaman for this&quot; again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they up this to 50%, it will be perfect.<br />
<br />
This is the answer to our ability to operate in short fights.  A &quot;lure&quot; slow with moderate slowing effectiveness, that we can cast immediately and have land on the mob very quickly.  Instead of having to Malos first and have slow land when the mob's half dead, we can cast this and have it land when the mob's around 85%.<br />
<br />
The slow doesn't have a high %, but the fact that it lands quickly will make it generally equal to Turgur's in the damage it reduces over the course of the fight, and it frees us up earlier in the fight to do something else, be it canni, heal, dps, etc.<br />
<br />
If this goes live, and isn't Ancient/impossible to get, this spell alone will be enough to keep me around.<br />
<br />
Now all we need is a decent direct heal and some way to deal moderate DPS in a short fight scenario, and we're good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">up disease counters to 99 so I can land it in PVP and have it not cured by a shield of the immaculate in 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, BL and Enc don't get a new slow in OoW atm, and i know that the current dev team hates our 75% slow w a passion...  So they might actually be trying to phase out magic based slows, or at least be making them very hard to resist/not work.  If done correctly this could be good.  Because we would gain our slow advantage back, if a mob could say only mitigate magic based slows, so a 50% dis slow would land for full where the 65%/70% magic slow is only about 30% effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For a disease slow to be useful the MOB in question has to be slowable and magic immune or close to it.<br />
<br />
That of course screws over almost all other classes.<br />
<br />
The easiest solution to this is giving shaman and only shaman a special slow or spell with a similar effect (like a debuff that lowers average damage per hit) and then make MOBs you want shaman to be useful on immune to normal slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That spell is just a placeholder currently. Necros have a &quot;Root&quot;(well listed as root just like our is listed as Slow) with the exact same slots and effects(or lack thereof):<br />

Putrid Decay Lucy History (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=5392&amp;source=Test).<br />
Looks like they'll probably just add back in the 40% slow once they finish monkeying with the slots stuff to me.<br />
<br />
We'd almost all love a better Disease slow obviously.  I'd love it to be about 60% personally.  <br />
<br />
Of course we could all be wrong and this won't be a new slow, just a new Malosini-icious Decay that will get a gem icon change instead of a slow added before going live.  /shudder.  That would be garbage. :mad: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Will be interesting to see what happens with it.  Im hoping for a good solid %, which is needed as disease slows lag behind in terms of power.<br />
<br />
What really catches my attention is the fact that one of our biggest beefs may have been addressed to some degree here.<br />
Resist Adjust -100   <br />
This may actually land without having to debuff the mob first, that alone makes it appear to be a nice change of pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In my opinion, it is not so bad thing that we have other options to slow mobs even if it only slow mobs at 40%.<br />
This might escape us from stereotype pattern of slow.<br />
<br />
Balance of Nihil; CT 1.5, recast 6,   duration 1.5min 75%, magic adj-40<br />
Turgur             ; CT 3,    recast 6,   duration 6.5min, 75%<br />
Putrid decay     ; CT 5,    recast 10, duration 3.5min,        disease adj-100<br />
<br />
At Raid, we can share our role in shamans by using different slow.<br />
<br />
The only problem is..... recast time is... toooo long.. <br />
and... there are not so much magic immune (disease-slowable) mob. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Would be nice if disease based slows were unable to be mitigated; therefore, a 50% dis based slow might be a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Since getting Balance of the Nihil my Time's anithesis only gets clicked if Balance is resisted, which is damn rare.<br />
<br />
For me to even think about using a disease slow the mob must be immune to magic slows or the disease slow must equal our magic based ones i.e 75%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm, I'd be willing to bet that this spell is going to be the next in line of this series:<br />
<br />
Insidious Fever  (L19, 1sec casting time, 30 mana)<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 4 <br />
2:  Decrease Disease Resist by 19 (L19) to 35 (L50) <br />
 <br />
Insidious Malady (L39, 1 sec, 60 mana) <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 9 <br />
2:  Decrease Disease Resist by 49 (L39) to 60 (L50) <br />
 <br />
Insidious Decay  (L52, 1 sec, 100 mana, Unresistable) <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 9 <br />
2:  Decrease Disease Resist by 36 (L52) to 45 (L70) <br />
 <br />
Malicious Decay (L63, 1 sec, 150 mana, Unresistable)  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 9 <br />
2:  Decrease Disease Resist by 51 (L63) to 55 (L70) <br />
 <br />
Putrid Decay  (L66, 5 sec, 400 mana, neg 100 to DR) <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 18 <br />
2:  Decrease Disease Resist by 55 <br />
6:  Decrease Poison Resist by 55 <br />
 <br />
I'd expect the cast time and mana costs to go down, but the neg 100 is a bad sign as the previous two similar buffs were unresistable. On the plus side, it does stack with the PR debuff offered by Malos etc....<br />
<br />
And there's the other part of the clue - the necro root is now:<br />
<br />
Scent of Midnight  (L67 necro, 5 sec, 400 mana, neg 100 to DR) <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 18 <br />
2:  Decrease Disease Resist by 55 <br />
6:  Decrease Poison Resist by 55 <br />
 <br />
Lo and behold, necros have long had a &quot;scent of...&quot; line of debuffs - so the fact that theirs fits in with their debuff line suggests that just as we'd be getting two stacking PR debuffs, necros will now have two stacking DR debuffs.<br />
<br />
Going on that, I'd also expect these to change - they've kept the &quot;Omen-Shaman-whatever&quot; names and had their effects removed.<br />
