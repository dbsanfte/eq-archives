2nd the motion to post this. I've been looking for a good shaman UI for a while now. This looks great!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oops, been semi afk for a while ... I'll post it this evening.  I have it zipped at home and sent it to someone the other night via a PM he left me... I'll post the URL this evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">clock thing is taken from another site somewhere... it measures in game &quot;ticks&quot; ... so a poison dot lasts 7 ticks from when it lands, etc., and timer under it can be used to keep track of longer duration spells like slows, etc. on raids.<br />
<br />
I wish I could take credit for the timer, because it's a nice piece of work IMO, but I don't remember who's responsible for it.  Certainly someone with more freetime than me.  <br />
<br />
It takes the place of the pet window, but I figure I've used hotkey commands so long for my pets I can keep on doing it and get more use from that window as a timer.  Plus my ISP kicks me off every 5 hours, give or take, so this timer is also perfect for knowing around when I need to camp and reset my connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dazzle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you want the timer and don't want to loose your pet window they have a custom version.<br />
<br />
You can download a number of versions of it  here<br />
