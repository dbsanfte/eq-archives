<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys. Its me Azmo having returned from my sabbatical in the real world for the last 7 months. :)<br />
<br />
Just can't get enough of EQ....unfortunately, alots changed and it seems my Circlet of the Falinkan isn't working anymore.  Before I left it shortened the casting time on Malo and Turgur's, but it doesn't seem to be doing so anymore.  Any thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
God I feel like such a newb....to make matters worse, my JBB is gone :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL, I've been in the game now for 7 months, looks like we just missed each other :) Affliction items do affect detrimentals like malo or turgurs anymore =( to make a long story short, it was a bug that lasted for 9 months and they fixed it a while ago =/</div></div><hr />

Sigh. Damnit. That sucks.  I loved the quest simply because of the focus effect.  :(  I take it nothing affects Malo or Turgur's anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, there are some higher level focus effects dropping in PoP which do affect all detrimental spells.  You can do a search in Lucy by entering the term Solusek in the Spell Search field.  Here's an example:<br />

<br />
If you are using Lucy to research focus effects, you can tell if a focus effect works on all detrimental spells if it is missing the &quot;hitpoints allowed&quot; line.  <br />
