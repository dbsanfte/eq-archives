<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know much if any about how these mods work, but I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if this is possible.  I want to sort of combine two mods that I have found.  One is a so called &quot;melee&quot; mod (it says F--- Casters at the top) and the other is Vert 1.1.<br />
<br />
I like various features of the melee mod, and other features from vert.  So what I am wondering is, are the files intercompatible?  Meaning, if I liked say the player window of melee mod, can I copy it over to my vert directory, overwriting it's player window feature?<br />
<br />
Any documentation out there on doing this?  Sorry if it's a &quot;noob&quot; question or has been asked before, I couldn't find anything though.</div></div><hr />

Depending on how extensively they change things and how they make those changes it can be anywhere from just grab the files for the particular peices you want from each one and throw them into a directory together to impossible with out essentially creating your own hybrid skin.</div></div><hr />
