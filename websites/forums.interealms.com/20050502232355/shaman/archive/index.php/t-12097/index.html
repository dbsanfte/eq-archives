<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya All,<br />
OK, I dont know about you, but the first time I started making any money, was in my eary 20's (soloing mamies in EF for tusks).  I realise that this is somewhat pathetic, but I didn't have Luclin for the bazaar, and I really didn't know how much the silk swatches sold to other players for. (I still cringe when I think of how many silk threads and swatches I sold to vendors)  Anyway, my wife had just hit 24 (new spells, woo hoo for her), so I told her about the mammies.  After about an hour and a half, she had goten almost a dozen tusks.  (figure about 120pp made) She was very excited, because she had never killed anything that she could sell for money to vendors before. Since I had supplied her with her armor, weapons and starting level spells, AND told her about selling swatches and threads she has a TON of money in the bank, but this was new and exciting for her.  The funny thing is... she was playing the next night, and while I was watching TV, I could hear her mutting curses (mild ones, hehehe) under her breath.  I went over to see what was going on, and my wife had discovered the joys of &quot;the race&quot;.  She was very annoyed that peeps would &quot;race to get to the next pop.  All I could say was, &quot;keep calm, it happens alot&quot;.  I went back to watching TV worndering what will happen when she discovers Rath Mountains.  hehehehehe<br />
<br />
P.S.  She was also quite &quot;miffed&quot; why she could find any mammies, so she had to go fight those new spiders (gigantic), Even though she was getting really good EXP from them.  I'm afraid my loving, sweet wife, is turning into a loot monster.  I figure about a month of EQ will fix that (I hope) hehehehe.</div></div><hr />

Newb is truly he best time in the game.  The world is huge and amazing.  Every new discovery is a joy.<br />
<br />
I am glad your wife is enjoying the game.  My wife hates EQ and will never play.</div></div><hr />
