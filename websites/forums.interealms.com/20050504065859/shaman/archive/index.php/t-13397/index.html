<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you have any alts? If you do, what are they and when do you play them?<br />
<br />
I myself have a full stable of 7 alts. HiE:Ench, Dw:CLR, Hum:Pal, VS:BL, Frg:Wz, Hum:Mg &amp; Hlf:Rng. The only one I am serious about is the enchanter for enchanting materials for my tradeskilling. The BL was my original main before I discovered the best class in the game. The rest are just sports to play when I get tired of grinding.<br />
<br />
I have also started a Troll Shaman,Thrudd, on the new server but have not had much time to grow him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">During my time in EQ I played ever class to some point beyond 30... but whenever I starting getting close to higher level I would always come back to Shaman because nothing really came close to comparing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All over the place.  On my home server, Bertoxx, I have a HIE CLR, OGR WAR, HIE PAL, HIE ENC, HEF BRD, HFL DRU, and ERU WIZ from 22-53.  On Xev, for no particular reason other than Bertoxx was down one night I have a 10 TRL BST.  I've got a 4 IKS NEC on Prexus my wife badgered me into playing, and I've started a Gnome Enchanter on Stromm, the new server, who is up to 14.<br />
<br />
I love playing Rorgg, but sometimes I want to be able to quit at the drop of a hat, or I just don't feel like paying that close attention or working that hard, or maybe just feel like something different, so I play them all.<br />
<br />
Note: play them all as opposed to have them all PLed up.  I really, REALLY don't get the point of that, but each to his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Much like Hrothgar, I start a lot, play them a decent ways -- nothing compares.<br />
<br />
I have a 51 warrior and a 36 beastlord that I have kept on Bristlebane, and a few near-50 folks elsewhere that I haven't played in over a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My first character was a monk.  He is sitting at 55 and has been sitting idle for a while.  During the time I still thought of him as my main, I started a wizard and a shaman, both as characters I could solo comfortably with and worked them up fairly evenly.  <br />
<br />
The wizard was the character I played when I wanted to be on line but not really think much, and didn't want to group for whatever reason.  Go out, snare something, nuke it down, med as I read a book.  I hit 51, discovered quad kiting, and SCREAMED through the levels.  He got parked at 61 while I went back to messing with my shaman.<br />
<br />
The shaman is 54 right now doing all AA as I wait for friends to catch up.  I'm 65% through AA number 6, and I'm going to feel silly as a level 54 Baron.   I love the shaman because I can go toe to toe with stuff and laugh at it as my DoTs and pet rip it up.  Its also nice to be able to put LFG up and have a group within minutes, UNLIKE the wizard and monk.<br />
<br />
I've also played warriors up to 20 on two different occasions, a druid to 12, mage to 8, cleric to 19.  I keep coming back to the monk for melee, the wizard for fast damage, and the shaman for sheer versatility</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My first character was a wood elf bard, played her to 21 but I wanted to be able to heal/buff players directly (plus, I kept getting lost so I figured bind/gate would be helpful)<br />
<br />
On Thanksgiving Day, 1999 I created a barb shaman and a high elf cleric.  I played them both until level 21 when I decided (after some agonizing, high elves are SO PRETTY) to go with the shaman since I figured I could heal/buff AND have all the fun utility spells.  At this time, I had no idea that debuffing would be so important later.<br />
<br />
I never played the bard again, she's still level 21 and sitting in Thurg where I would sometimes use her to hold tradeskilling stuff.  I got the cleric up to level 28 during a leveling slump during level 57.  <br />
<br />
Right before Luclin and AA points, when I was finally maxxed 60, I did start a couple of alts...I have a 10 barb rogue (just to dress her up in mithril bp/legs), a level 5 erudite magician (just to use the name Elektra) and a level 5 human druid.<br />
<br />
Currently, I just have no time/interest/money for alts.  I like playing a shaman, I am utterly bored by any other character.<br />
<br />
While working on faction in OS for my Crown of Deceit, I've lately been casually two boxing my boyfriend's level 58 enchanter.  He retired and the enchanter is on his old account, so I figured why not get him to level 60 and have my own KEI whenever I want?  His gear is pathetic, nearly all pre-Velious so I have spent a little money on him.<br />
<br />
My computer can't handle two accounts running on the same machine, so any half hearted leveling attempts are restricted to times when my boyfriend isn't on his computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a 45 gnome SK on a 2nd account I play when i feel like taking the effort to Duo some .. right now he's camped out in dulak .. since i can use him to get parts and iksar blood while getting him exp at the same time :)<br />
<br />
I have a 24 necro, which is really kind of a joke now. He's so insanely twinked out I feel like i really can't delete him. He's got 8 or 9 pieces of armor that are reccomended level 50-55. Funny thing is, I haven't spent a cent on his equipment .. anything he has, or the SK has i've gotten with aaellyn over the course of exping.</div></div><hr />

I probably enjoy the ranger the most out of all of them but I can't seem to play them very long before I get bored and go back to my Shaman.<br />
<br />
Have a:<br />
51 Wood Elf Ranger.. good for tracking, foraging and farming tradeskill supplies and fun to 2 box with sometimes<br />
46 Halfling Druid... port whore and forager<br />
40 Dwarf Cleric.. origianlly was going to PL her for a rez whore but got bored<br />
35? Barb Warrior.. my Role Playing twin sister to my shaman fun to buff her up and tear stuff up<br />
24? Human Monk.. on different account than my chanter below, used monk to PL chanter so she could get the levels needed to makes those mana vials<br />
24? Dark Elf Enchanter.. had to have a chanter to make those vials of mana for tradeskills.. she is also at 244 in JC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well technically I am the alt :)<br />
<br />
I generally three box:<br />
65 Shadow Knight 102 AA is main<br />
65 Cleric 10 AA is second box<br />
60 Shaman 15 AA is third box<br />
<br />
I also have a 60 Rogue with 10 AA, 52 Wizard and 34 Bard.<br />

Following the advice of many here I am not leveling until I get Can V, then it is straight to 65 for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">have a few alts, most are mules now though.<br />
only ones I have that are not lvl 1 are..<br />
Lateralus 20 ranger, a tracking mule.<br />
Aiah 30 monk, very very twinked.<br />
Deein 65 monk, a friend left EQ, hope he returns, untill he does this is my alt, great for 2boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My first &amp; main toon is a half-elf ranger chilling out from too much POP grinding. I really love playing the ranger, I like the utility type roles he can play. I like that I can take off solo &amp; rip it up a bit when I'm tired of grp'ing or no grps to be had.<br />
<br />
My second toon is a 52 gnome wizard that is nothing more than a ride &amp; bazaar mule now. He was a lot of fun to 52 but the blasting &amp; medding, blasting &amp; medding just got to get kinda boring. <br />
<br />
I started my VS shammy more just to start a VS... I liked the look of the cats. Well after parking my wizzy because I was tired of just nuking &amp; medding I was getting the same feel for the shammy (totally playing in grps) before he hit lvl 10... seemed I was just buffing, healing &amp; medding, so he became my bazaar mule until a few weeks ago. <br />
<br />
I have a 28 monk that has been parked in HHK for a while now, kinda fun when I don't want to worry about anything realted to mana. It's kinda kewl to just wade in &amp; melee &amp; not have to worry about making sher eveyone has your buffs &amp; sitting to med. He's a good distraction when the grinding gets a little much.<br />
<br />
I started a DE necromancer after much grinding in POP with the ranger, wanted to start a solid solo'r. Well got that toon to 20 when I decided to give the shammy another whirl &amp; sher glad I did. He's everything I think I am looking for, solo'r, awesome grp'r, has best buffs, man's best friend &amp; he can hold his own going toe-to-toe with the mobs.</div></div><hr />

I have three Vah Shir, warrior (Cattypult), rogue (Cattylak) and bard (Cattywaul) I made as mules to do the Sonic Wolfbane quest.  All are level 6 but have the tradeskills to do their parts of the quest.  Farming with them blows chunks but NOONE does that quest anymore and I want that cloak! :cool: <br />

I haven't played the Sk on Rallos in about 3 years, he should be camped in AoF room in Cazic Thull waiting on insta log-in death.  I also had a warrior and shaman there at 51 and 49, but I ditched that account a long time ago.<br />
<br />
my cleric and warrior where on Terris, but my uncle took off for  SH about the time I lost my job and couldn't afford the account fees on them.  He took over account and took them with him, though I could still prolly log them on.<br />
<br />
My 55 Sk was my main until recently, but hes now been stripped and liquidated so the one true class I love can be twinked ...Shaman.  He has the oldest Birthday of all my toons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My shaman was an alt until I decided she was way more fun...so my prior main has been retired to alt status:<br />
<br />
35 half elf bard<br />
27 de shadowknight<br />
19 half elf druid<br />
<br />
Course, the druid exists to feed the shammy's tradeskilling addiction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well my Shammy was my main till I started an Ogre Warrior when he was about 25. Then when Shammy was 29 war became the main one I played for a year and a half. When War was 59 I got a second computer set up and PL'd the Shammy to 39 so I could group them.<br />
<br />
Currently the Shaman is 62 with 8 AA and War is 61 with 48 AA. Decided to level the shaman to 62 for the spells well keeping the warrior at 60 farming AA, now trying to get war to 62.<br />
<br />
My next highest character is a Lvl 16 Ranger, who I started back before I created the Shaman.</div></div><hr />
