<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A bit tired of LiO, although I suppose I could do the infamous Kunark treadmill :  LiO, FM, DL, etc...<br />
<br />
Any suggestions from 25-35?  Either solo or grouped.  <br />
<br />
Would prefer somewhere less crowded.  Anything on the moon or Odus?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

In Echo Caverns there is a room full of these bugs.  AWESOME xp! Check on the EQatlas about a discription to this room.  I went 25 - 30 there in no time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is that the room that is a drop down from the route to FG?<br />
<br />
If so there are only 4 that spawn there correct?<br />
<br />
If that is the case I tried the Needelites room.<br />
<br />
I would kill them all at 27 and be waiting on my rear for a long time before they respawned.  Exp was good but slow so it seemed to balance out to just decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't forget to check out the Hunting Forums (on this board) - good suggestions from 20-30 and 30-40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Needelites are a total of 7 spawns.  Depending on your gear, it is possible to clear the spawn and then have some extra time.  If that happens, don't despair, there are several spawns of the little alien looking buggers nearby that can be pulled.  I usually, cleared the room, and then was able to kill two scouts.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />
