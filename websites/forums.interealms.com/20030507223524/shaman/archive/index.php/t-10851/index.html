<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night while headed to Brynju Thunderclap in BoT, we ran into several dispell traps. These traps (or maybe it was giants, I dunno) would take your top 2 buffs and nothing else, at least for me. Between my 9th coldain ring and my sow boots, I had no problem at all keeping all my buffs but a few thickheaded people refuse to get instaclickies because they are convinced that they are too expensive.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm looking into some options for them so that I can help these people get instaclickies (after all it's to my benefit, god I hate the inevitable tells &quot;focus/sta plx&quot; every time something dispells).<br />
<br />
Can the shaman boots be done by anyone with faction?<br />
Coldain ring needs coldain faction (we have trashed all velious factions :o )<br />
Gobby earring is about 5k OR a long camp in warslisk (sp?) woods<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what else there is. Please post ideas :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman boots are shaman only, don't you think everyone in the game would have them if they weren't?  ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry but the only ones I know you already mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spyglasses.<br />
<br />
its made using tinkering trivial is only around 80 i think and it cost 20pp per spyglass.. it has instant cast time, inventory usable, weighs pretty much nothing and creates a buff icon that lasts around 20 second i think.<br />
<br />
go bug a gnome friend :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure about that, I was told they are inventory clickable by any class. Yes, seems like everyone would have one but I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only shaman can use them, including from inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">JBoots or TBoots.<br />
Any old Kunark armor has a right-click effect on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Old Kunark Armor has rediculously long casting times on them (depending on the item, and many don't even leave an buff icon).<br />
<br />
Another Insta click is the Bracer of Hidden, not sure if it has stacking issues with Acumen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bracer of hidden is instant, yet targetable. The beauty of the insta clickies that most people use against dispelling mobs, is that they're self-only, so you don't have to switch targets every time a buff is dispelled. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">go for the gobby earring.. at your level your pet will eat goblins in 5 seconds.. Not a long camp cause noone is there anymore.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lots of insta clicky potions:<br />
Lev<br />
See invis<br />
HpBuff<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Think see invis is cheapest at 15pp plus a foraged leaf from Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Goblin Gazughia ring.<br />
<br />
Insta click Invis Vrs Animal (Though ive ticked off more then one mage with this *snicker*)<br />
<br />
Drops off a sarnark courier in loio. Not common but not horribly rare, can probibly get one every 5 hours. Its also targetable and clickable from the inventory. Can probibly find a few in the bazaar for 1k or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The point escaped about 90% of you :/<br />
<br />
I am talking about instaclicks, that use a buff slot, that you don't have to target yourself with. I.e. to help fight dispellers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gobby Earring<br />
Jboots</div></div><hr />
