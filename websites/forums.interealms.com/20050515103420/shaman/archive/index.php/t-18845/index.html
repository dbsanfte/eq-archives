<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Preecher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a lvl 51 Shammy, and have great gear for my lvl. maxed wis and all stats over 210 self buffed. Got about 930ac and 2000hp again this is self buffed and I'm pretty twinked. And he is sitting around 3.2k self buffed.<br />
OK, a friend of mine wanted to duel me, he is a lvl 59 Pally and I'm a 51 Shaman, it is agreed upon that we only self buff and he agrees that the pet is a Shaman buff so I get out the mutt. Well we start off and its all going pretty good, he is stunning the crap out of me and we blind eachother repeatedly. I could never get a slow to land so I quit trying, all it was doing was waisting mana. I got a DoT or 2 on him and sit back and Stiocism myself repeatedly and watch him fall in HP, he gets to 5% and hits LoH and I'm at 65m. Now I know I got this fool and its only a matter of time. When he finally falls I'm sitting there on my Drogmar with 40 health and 30 mana. <br />
Oh yeah, I really hate Pallies so this gave me some mad trash talking rights on the quild board.<br />

That thing is awesome!  Saved my group in the Test of Flame in PoJ when I was the only priest class there.<br />
<br />
I can usually fight skilled pallies to a stand-off, and that's about it.  We both end up running around alot, debuffing &amp; rebuffing our insta-clickies with neither of us ever getting dangerously low.  Of course I don't PVP very much, so I could just be clueless as to how to fight them successfully.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Uber pallies are unbeatable =\  Their heal over time completely outheals any damage we can hope to do to them, and it costs so little mana that they'll never go oom casting it.  On the other hand, the same is also true for us.  Quiescence outheals their unimpressive damage and we'll never go oom casting it, either.</div></div><hr />

Pallies with a SEWS actually can hit quite hard.  I know for sure when a pally hits for 500+ it will out damage my 300/tick heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you just stand there and let them hit you and they have SEWS+ then yeah it might outdamage quiescence, but if you move around a little and force them to miss a few attacks, you're generally fine.  I have 1500+ AC, so I generally don't get hit for max much in pvp, and that definately helps.<br />
<br />
If you're really getting beat, though, you can always just quiescence yourself and run around.  If you have a respectable MR, there is absolutely nothing they can do to you.  They get no nukes, and their stun is as easy to resist as our dots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can kill one, but only if they aren't too well equipped.  If they've got a lot of elemental and Time gear on, forget it.  And the only reason I can win at all is my mana sucking mace.  I just melee with a DS on myself (potion), and keep myself alive with Q and Tnargs while stealing all his mana until he has no more.  Then he dies.  That's even without being able to land a spell on him.  But without the mace, forget it.</div></div><hr />
