<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To help clarify the new system, I went to the message boards and looked for <br />
questions that people still had and posed them to the EQLive team. If you have <br />
any other questions about the system, please send them to the Developer's Corner <br />
and I'll try to provide answers. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: I'm still confused about Endurance. Will it completely replace Stamina? <br />
How will that affect swimming? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, Endurance will completely replace Stamina. Some of the occasions that <br />
used Stamina in the old system will no longer require the expenditure of a <br />
resource. For example, swimming will no longer use a resource. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: If jumping costs Endurance, and only melee classes and hybrids have <br />
Endurance... won't that be a problem for casters when they want to jump? &lt;/b&gt;<br />
&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: All classes get an Endurance bar and an Endurance pool. So everyone can <br />
still jump. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: I understand that the new combat skills and all disciplines will use <br />
Endurance, and that's why Endurance won't be affected by any spells that <br />
currently affect Stamina. But why remove the Stamina effects from those spells? <br />
Some classes gain some value to their group through the use of those spells. &lt;/b&gt;<br />
&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: Since we are removing Stamina, there won't be any value to spells that <br />
affect Stamina. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;There will be additional spells added that modify Endurance. Right now these <br />
will be buffs that increase your total pool. We are not planning on adding any <br />
that would regenerate the pool. These spells will be tuned to balance the <br />
ability to aid in the return of Endurance. Just exchanging the Stamina effects <br />
with Endurance effects wouldn't allow us any control over the balance of the new <br />
system and its interaction with spells. It hasn't been decided which classes <br />
will get those spells yet, but obviously we'll be taking into consideration the <br />
effects of the changes to the existing spells might have on caster desirability.<br />
&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Will NPCs be using these new abilities? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: Not at this time. Frankly, there's a lot of work involved in allowing NPCs <br />
to use these abilities, and it would have a rather wide-spread effect on the <br />
challenge of those NPCs that would be complicated to evaluate. So we're only <br />
giving this to PCs. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: There seems to be some confusion about how these new skills will be <br />
used. Will we be clicking a button on the screen with our mouse, or can we make <br />
hotbuttons with the new skills and just press a key to activate them? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: You will be able to click on the icons, use hotbuttons in your hotbutton <br />
box or access a melee skills box only for these abilities through CTRL+ #. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: You mentioned that you are making some other changes to melee, <br />
including giving warriors an automatic mitigation percentage. Will PC warriors <br />
of all levels get this ability? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: PC warriors of all levels will gain the mitigation boost. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: These changes look very interesting. But some of us are concerned that <br />
these changes might overbalance things. What steps are you taking to keep the <br />
balance pendulum from swinging too far toward the pure melee classes? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: We'll be testing this system on the Test server until it goes Live. The <br />
big advantage of the system is the flexibility. Adjusting it won't require days <br />
of programmer time. If we discover that a facet of the new skills is over or <br />
under powered, we can adjust it. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Regarding the new discipline system using Endurance: will it be <br />
possible to stop a disc midway through its use when it doesn't make sense to <br />
keep it up, in order to save some Endurance? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, you will be able to stop a discipline while it is active. If you <br />
cancel a discipline, however, you must still wait the normal recharge time <br />
before using it again. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: You mentioned that these new skills will be learned by finding ancient <br />
tomes. Will these tomes be No Drop? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;A: Right now the plan is to introduce them as droppable. There may be some <br />
tomes that result from special quests that are no-drop in the future. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
=============================================<br />
Personally I feel saying they are trying to decide who gets the endurance buff is silly. I think it rightfully belongs to us and I want it. If they are going to use it as a tool to help another class with group desirability I can see it going to another class.<br />
<br />
What do you think? Do you want this new buff? If so I think we better make it known ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We are the melee buffers, so we should get the best endurance buff.  Enchanters should probably get a reduced endurance buff.  Bards and Beastlords might get versions of them also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so no extra HP from stamina buffs?   stamina buffs removed completely?   or is stamina a passive stat for HP purposes only and the old &quot;yellow bar&quot; will now be endurance?<br />
<br />
i'll assume that STA as a buff will remain, and still give me a couple extra HP, and will reserve judgement on how endurance will work.   :rolleyes: <br />

anyone who knows different, please speak up so i can stand around the PoT portal stone and /petition for Winged Courier to come back as a replacement spell<br />

<br />
I second that motion, frog, and move to close ...<br />
<br />
And yep, give me that Endurance buff ... a shaman's spellbook is the rightful place for it, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Something should be done with acumen.  Give it mana regen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye give acumen some mana or hp regen that stacks with all spells :). and we should get endurance buffs followed by cleric bard ranger at a reduced effectivness. necro should also be able to feed you end from themselves since everyone will have a end bar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Acumen should stay as is but with removed STA regen. See invis and Ultravision is still widely used (not everyone is uberly equipped with those 2 effects.)<br />
<br />
As for Endurance buff, undoubtfly it should go to shamans... after all, we buff as much as we slow mobs...<br />
<br />
From my understanding STA will determine hps (as it is currenlty) but it will also determine your Endurance pool (think of it as WIS for mana pool.)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Something should be done with acumen.  Give it mana regen :)<br />
<br />
I'd rather have acumen give damage mitigation or something ;-P<br />
<br />
At first I agreed with you-- maybe we should get something similar to what our hybrid counterparts have that we don't.. but even shadowknights have extra spell functionality that necros do not.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the most logical solution would probably make acumen/acumen of dar khura give vision improvements and a strong endurance buff.<br />
<br />
Invigor and Extinguish Fatigue would probably just be changed into lesser versions of acumen without the vision improvements for now.  bleh.<br />
<br />
Actually, if this turned out to be the case, I would not be sad-- it would suck to have to keep Extinguish Fatigue up for the melees... we don't have enough spell slots as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yup, we should get the Endurance buff. As stated before something KEI like without the regen I guess. I would be upset about losing the added hp from stamina buff and not as much use for Acumen. But if the stamina stat remains it should be ok.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and here comes another 15kp spell. Yippeee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well im sure glad i never bought acumen of dar khura for 6k+, it seems everyone who did (as well as anyone who bought acumen, like me) have been ravaged by SoE, or as I like to call them, &quot;Nasty Nate&quot;.<br />
<br />
It seems very stupid that they dont want to &quot;make melee's reliant on other class's buffs&quot;.  You mean more or less reliant than casters are on KEI, pot9, or kitty crack?  <br />
<br />
Hypocrites...<br />
<br />
edit: im sure when Absor mentions stamina he means the stamina bar, not the stat stamina, i seriously doubt they have any intentions of nerfing the stat, so dont go crazy and delete boar from your spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I personally feel its a mistake to have no endurance regeneration buffs of any kind.  The day I have to sit for an endurance bar meditation session....  &quot;Hold the raid, our warrior tank is out of endurance and can't defensive!&quot;...  &quot;Hold pulls, I'm out of endurance and can't taunt&quot;...  Just a few random thoughts I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think there is some confusion here, about the word Stamina in the context Absor is using it.  He is meaning the stamina bar (the one that goes down when you jump, swim a long time, or melee extended periods with very heavy weapons.)  He is NOT talking about the stat Stamina, that Talisman of the Boar buffs, and gives more hps.  :)  Just felt compelled to clarify that somehow, hehe.<br />
<br />
And far as the new endurance bar, and buffs for it, or to regen it... It makes sense for shaman, seeing how we are the number 1 buffer for melee stats (all stats but wis and int, haste, attack, and used to be stamina bar regen with Acumen).  But, by reading Absor's statement from above, it sounds like they know it should go to Shaman (and all corresponding classes.... beast, chanter, bard to lesser extents...), but they are reviewing which class needs the most loving to get invited to groups.   So I wouldnt be suprised if a diferent class recieves this ability.  And I dont want it, if it's duration is anywhere under at least FoS length.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Acumen of Dar Khura is just as useful as it always was...group ultravision/see invis.  I haven't been in a situation where anyone needed stamina regen for 3 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My money is on Sks and/or Paladins receiving the Endurance buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ok, If they are trying to use this buff as a way to balance caster desirability, then necros, druids, and possibly mages are stoaked.  But I can't see how melee buffing fits any of their profiles.<br />
<br />
The only classes that could concievably have the buff (imo) without just blatantly ignoring class norms is clerics, chanters, and shaman.  Obviously I am biased and think it &quot;belongs&quot; to shaman inherently (even though I don't want the stupid buff.  I already have plenty of crap to drop on melees that is killing my mana pool) but I could also see in feasably going to the clerics.  It seems to fit clerics role to have the ability to help someone endure longer.  Chanters SHOULD NOT HAVE IT in my opinion, as it doesn't make much sense to me that someone who &quot;enchants&quot; things  should be adjusting your endurance pool.  Mindbuffs, sure, endurace?  just doesn't seem right.<br />
<br />
Heck, Even druids seem like a better fit than chanters for me.  <br />
<br />
Ok quick question I just thought up...  <br />
absor said &quot;Right now these will be buffs that increase your total pool. We are not planning on adding any that would regenerate the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does this mean there is no heal-type spell for endurance whatsoever?  Not even a form of regen?  oh god!  I can already hear it:<br />
Tank_001: ok, I gotta med.  OOE<br />
<br />
Man, this stuff better regenerate FAST or this is going to drastically increase group downtime.  One of the great things about having a melee as a tank in the first place is that you don't have to wait for medbreaks (although hybrids get FT items and KEI still, so they med fast.)  If I have to wait longer for a Warrior to med because there are no spells to help regen his endurance pool, I am going to stick with a hybrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thing thing I'm not getting, and maybe I'm just clueless, is why drop stamina and add endurance...why didn't they just use stamina to begin with.  Instead of gutting spells and adding spells, changing attributes, and messing with the interface they could've just done some minor twinks to stamin replenishment spells.<br />
<br />
/em looks around confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Unless this potential buff lasts 2 hours, I don't want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Zhahz:  from my limited programming experience...sometimes its easier to scrap something and start over than trying to tweak existing code.  This is even more true if the person who originally wrote the code no longer works there (which is probably true in this case).<br />
<br />
While it certainly seems easier to us to leave it as it is, it probably isn't from the programming perspective.  I can't imagine they wouldn't be taking the path of least resistance in coding this--so its the logical conclusion i made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just fricking change Acumen so it's the endurance buff in addition to see invis and ultravision so people will actually want a spell we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If endurance replaces stamina does that mean normal melee swings use endurance and on top of that the new melee disciplines will also use endurance?<br />
<br />
Using DAoC as a frame of reference, melee combat (and caster casting) used endurance. It regened rather quickly but it did take &quot;medding&quot; (sitting to increase regen rate) by melees between fights. In DAoC each melee skill or style consumed X amount of endurance. They found that an endurance enhancement buff and regen was required to make the melee's able to maintain combat over the long haul.<br />
<br />
Unless the endurance pool is extreme, this is going to completely alter raids by requiring numerous MA tanks to rotate in and out of the combat to maintain effective damage/skill usage until their endurance is gone.<br />
<br />
Going to be an interesting few &quot;weeks&quot; watching how this balances out with the tons of patches likely to pop in ... after testing on Test, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I guess I need to see this in action, but we have too many steps I think, for this crap... err ...innovation to be useful.  First, the war has to have enough stamina, then the &quot;tactic&quot; has to be available (via refresh timer, ala AA abilities), then the war has to wait for an &quot;opening&quot; during a fight in order to use the ability.<br />
<br />
Unless the war is bombarded with flashing &quot;click X effect now&quot; lights and either has a ton of tactics available or a very short refresh timer, I don't see how one would run out of endurance in a given fight anyway.<br />
<br />
How do you do that attack again?  forward, crouch, forward, attack = dragon punch (&quot;SHO RYU KEN&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If endurance replaces stamina does that mean normal melee swings use endurance and on top of that the new melee disciplines will also use endurance?<br />
<br />
Regular melee doesn't affect the Endurance bar on Test at this time.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it will be interesting to see what they do to Acumen. I picked up a copy for 20pp in the Bazaar the other night - I assume the seller figured the spell would be less useful after the next patch - but for all we know it may end up being actually more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I really don't want to be an Endurance buffer like DAOC. That game just had people making &quot;Bot&quot; shaman only to buff endurance so melee could then just wipe areas out without the need for a true healer or shaman style class.<br />
<br />
Melee styles is a cool idea, however there is nothing wrong with the current stamina system. Just make the styles use a bit of stamina.<br />
<br />
They are already putting a timing counter on the styles so there should not be the Style chaining through a whole fight that happened in Daoc (which was also boring imo).<br />
<br />
So why break what doesn't need fixing? Just make the styles = to a jump style use of stamina...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I think many of you realized this already, but some comments and questions seem to have missed it.<br />
<br />
The Stamina &quot;stat&quot; and the Stamina &quot;bar&quot; are two different things.  (to illustrate, when you use up the stamina bar by jumping or swimming, your stamina stat does not fall, and your hp's from the stat are unchanged)<br />
<br />
The stamina stat is not changing, as far as I can tell.  So Boar, Vigor, etc. should be unaffected.  Not sure about Acumen, since you will apparently no longer consume stamina, and would have little use for stamina regen.<br />
<br />
It is the stamina bar that is changing - being pre-empted to display a new characteristic, Endurance.  This is apparently an entirely new, uh, stat.  No existing buffs would affect that new endurance stat.<br />
<br />
The buffs for that new endurance stat would make sense for a shaman, but are not &quot;obviously&quot; shaman buffs.  Remember, most of our stamina buffs (and all of the ones I actually cast because of their stamina effects) would still do what they have always done.<br />
<br />
Not going to argue what class should get the buffs, as there are several good comments already posted here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Acumen is not in &quot;everyones&quot; spellbook, it is a shaman only spell. If they get rid of it, and do not replace it with something at least as functional from the ultravision/see invis standpoint, I could rapidly see my days of playing EQ ending. I will not go back to being nightblind, and spirit sight/ultravision do NOT cut the mustard for effect or duration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">We are the melee buffers, so we should get the best endurance buff.  Enchanters should probably get a reduced endurance buff.  Bards and Beastlords might get versions of them also.<br />
- Yes please, I want Endurance added to the never ending line of useless shaman stat buffs. I am willing to bet that with Elemental+ gear,  melee will be maxed out on Endurance anyways since VI is adding +Endurance modifiers to current gear. I hope VI gives this buff to another class.<br />
<br />
And on a side note, we are melee buffers on paper. FA is extremely nice, but our huge repertoire of melee buffs ends there. With VT+ gear, melee are already at STR/DEX cap. Same with STA, hell no, with LDoN augs every smart melee is STA capped. Not to mention AGI is garbage.</div></div><hr />

Acumen is not in &quot;everyones&quot; spellbook, it is a shaman only spell. If they get rid of it, and do not replace it with something at least as functional from the ultravision/see invis standpoint, I could rapidly see my days of playing EQ ending. I will not go back to being nightblind, and spirit sight/ultravision do NOT cut the mustard for effect or duration.<br />
<br />

you can pay people to loot stuff ya know  :D</div></div><hr />

The hardest thing about Seru is simply having the willpower to do reports.  Seru himself is an utter joke these days.<br />
<br />
But yeah, removing acumen isnt acceptable in my book, I always have ADK up, why?  Because I jump a ton for the extra speed, sta regen = good =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Zorlac, Agi is about to get a huge kick in the pants into the &quot;Usefull&quot; department.  In the first Dev Chat about this it was stated that Endurance is going to be based on Str, Dex, Sta, and Agi.<br />
<br />
Why would Acumen change?  The only thing that is going to happen to it is that the sta regen is going to be gone.  It will still grant Ultravision and see invis.  I, for one, still find that to be incredibly usefull and its a buff that I always have up on myself.<br />
<br />
Endurance buffs are going to be like heals.  Which kinda sucks, because if shaman get the endurance heals (which seems very likely but you never know with SOE) Im going to have to find a place in my spell line up for it and frankly, I dont have the room.  It will all depend on the size of the Endu pool and how quickly it is used.  It was posted on the FoH boards (Ill edit with a link if I get around to it) that some testing had been done on the Test server and that the Endu bar regened from empty to full in under a minute sitting.  Furor (who ran some of the tests) said that he believed that it was a little too fast; I prefer to make my own decisions about that and not rely on a super geared warrior test without first hand knowledge.<br />
<br />
I , for one, am hoping that any +mana items that pure melee have will be changed to +end and that they will have pools comperable to caster mana pools.  The more end they have, the less the buffers (probably us) will have to do.  But by god, if SOE makes the end buff like avatar with an insane recast on it I might forget to get the spell.  What I would like to see is to have out Focus line have +end added to it (like +500 or so).  Or, if (and when) SOE decides to add an end regen to the game, to make Focus have the regen component to it, possibly scaling like the KEI line starting with the 60 focus of spirit.  <br />
<br />
I am having a hard time understanding why SOE is reticent to add an end regen line of spells into the game.  On one hand I can see why they would be nervous about inroducing a line of spells simmilar to one that seriously threw the game out of whack (KEI).  But conversly, I think it is truly masochistic of SOE to make melee classes (and the class that will buff END) rely on small patch end heals.  As I stated before, it will all depend on the size and usage of the END pools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Whenever I hear that EQ1 is moving or taking ideas from DAOC I get the same creepy feeling as I do listening to William Shatner 'sing.'<br />
<br />
One of the beauties of EQ1 is that in a well tuned, good group, good defined as people who can play their classes; it is possible to chain pull with zero downtime.  As a 50 Nightshade (Elven Realm / Rogue Class) in DAOC, the ONLY time we did so was in AOE groups. (Or their cousin Focus groups).<br />
<br />
All of this &quot;melee rebalancing&quot; would be moot if SONY would admit a couple of things:<br />
<br />
1) Classes ARE out of balance.<br />
2) The Monk NERF was WAY uncalled for and WAY over the top.<br />
3) Warrior taunt is broken.<br />
4) Hybrids have encroached on pure melee (esp Warrior) to the point that in a standard EXP group it behooves you to take a SK or PAL IN LIEU OF a Warrior.<br />
5) Their lazy itemization has ascerbated not eased the problems.<br />
<br />
So what to do? Well I don't think borrowing from DAOC is the answer. <br />
<br />
1) Stop acting so contentiously towards your player base. abashi was a poor choice (and a waste of DNA - but I digress). As Zorlac (iirc) said it so well: &quot;When one of your top guilds WHOSE PLAYSTYLE YOU HAVE CATERED TO, is Beta testing an opponents game, then you have an institutional mindset problem. <br />
<br />
And yes, it DOES &quot;trickle down&quot; (Unlike David Stockman's theory) to the casual player<br />
<br />
2) Reverse it. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
3) Fix it. Lot's of good ideas that don't include 'sharks with friggin laser beams,' are out there. (This goes hand in hand with 1) - stop treating the player base as your enemy.)<br />
<br />
4) No nerf. But put the brakes on their constant exponential improvement while other classes improve geometrically.<br />
<br />
5) Eat less, exercise more. Stop being lazy fawqers. PLAY the game, don't /bot 65 your toons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why the hell are you so eager to buff people?  I *HATE* buffing people.  People get Focus, they get Focus only, and they like it.  The MT gets charisma for DI if he asks nicely.  Ferine Avatar I break out on raids if its a holiday.<br />
<br />
Please GOD give this new endurance buff to another class.  Clerics for example.  Clerics don't buff enough imho.<br />

Well, I'm sad to hear that every melee not in a top end guild isn't very smart.  Next time my groupmates ask me for stamina buffs, I'll have to break the bad news to them.</div></div><hr />

I 100% agree with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Talk to people in-game about EQ and the response you get is most often:<br />
I like it, it's the best thing out there atm, BUT I can't wait to try...<br />
<br />
That &quot;I like it BUT&quot; should be sending a bit more of a signal to Sony than it currently appears to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Seriously, this does nothing to solve warrior agro issues or monk mitigation issues. Everything else is just fine. <br />
<br />
Second, if Endurance is based on str sta agi dex, you are going to see min/max melee gravitate toward whichever race has the highest aggregate total of the four stats (unless some stats are weighted to be more important). <br />
<br />
Third, this is not going to be tested well and generally disrupt my play time with patches, exploits, and imbalances. <br />
<br />
Fourth, what exactly am I going to get for losing a whole class of spells? Granted they were not that useful, but in LDoN I get continual requests for stamina regen/heals in fast paced groups. <br />
<br />
Finally, everyone will hate this, but I think &quot;on demand agro&quot; is bad. Warriors have about the best &quot;taunt&quot; that should be allowed in the game. Pallys and SKs should have their ability to generate agro reduced to warrior levels. When I group with knights I NEVER worry about agro unless I slow a mob that the knights have not touched yet. That is wrong. It makes the game too easy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">In a way it is a boost to all melee though; they (or we) can use any type of weapon of any weight and not have to worry about stamina.

- Take a look at gear for people in elemental+ guilds. Then, check out this: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3178&amp;source=Test .  At my game level (Time guild) every single stat buff is UTTER CRAP. Worthless. Garbage. I haven't casted STA in a long time. Even when we were only in elementals I rarely casted STA. Not to mention with enchanter haste + Focus every melee is stat capped. In quite a few cases even without Focus.</div></div><hr />

Give it Avatar's duration and recast, and make it group only like shrink.  Then give a warrior version to monks, a monk version to rogues, and a rogue version to warriors.  That'll learn 'em.<br />
<br />
Oh how priceless that would be!<br />

If I'm in a group that has no chanter, sometimes I pretend not to have FA... Can't take the constant messages of &quot;FA fades&quot; combined with refreshing haste every 5 minutes...<br />
