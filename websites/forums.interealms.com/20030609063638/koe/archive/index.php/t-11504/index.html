<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amric Grimmson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">. . . I am making a formal introduction.   Hail.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
My name is Amric Grimmson.  I am a 49th season ranger, hailing from The Glade, and I seek greater contact with the Keepers in the future.<br />
<br />
I've met Soriathus a few times when scampering for griffon eggs in Eastern Wastes, and he seemed pretty happy with his guild, so I am considering whether or not to change the hunting habits of this character and apply to your guild.  I have been a solo project on this server, but I've been playing EQ for 3.5 years, mostly as a seasoned warrior on another server.  I haven't applied to any guilds here since I felt I could not make a full commitment.<br />
<br />
At this time, I am merely soliciting aid on the first part of my ranger epic.  I need assistance doing the Dark Elf Corruptor hunt in East Karana.  I do not feel it proper to request aid when I've yet to build sufficient social capital to be worthy of such, so I would like to offer some compensation or prizes to a group that can help me.  I make a couple of different items for the POTC quest, and can offer some of those in return for the time spent.  I also look forward to the &quot;networking&quot; opportunity that meeting a few of Soriathus's friends can offer.<br />
<br />
I will be around at random times this Saturday, the Ides of March (i.e., 15th)  in East Karana, and there specifically from 1-3pm on March 16th, should anyone have an interest in bludgeoning that wicked Innoruuk worshipper with me.  If nothing else, I'll keep busy getting some spider silks.  :)<br />
<br />
I hope to meet some of you folk soon.  Hail again to Soriathus and thank you for suggesting that I post here.<br />

Ok so it might not be an exact quote from the night we hit the hole, but as you can see from my sig... &quot;PROUD member of Keepers of the Elements&quot;. /flex...<br />
<br />
Anyway Amric, again I'll help you whenever you can get it organized. PM me with the inf0z on what you need done and how may people you need. It's the first part of your epic, how many people do you need? LotZ? Some? A group, 3 people? Need specific classes? Not everyone is familiar with other people's epics.<br />
<br />
Good luck man. As always nice grouping with yah.</div></div><hr />
