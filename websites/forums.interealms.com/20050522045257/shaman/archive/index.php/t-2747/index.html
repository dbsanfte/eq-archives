<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just reached 200 Wisdom, at lvl 52.  I'm not ignoring AC, and have eagerly read all the debates here about AC vs Wis on gear, and think I've walked away with a lot of good advice from the great shamans here.  But what I can't seem to find out is what IS the advantage to Wis of 200+.<br />
<br />
Mana calculator doesn't show an advantage - After 200 the mana added per pt of wisdom actually drops to 6 from 10.  I came across one reference to a second roll against resists and failures, but is this a big deal?  <br />
<br />
So is 200 just a number thrown around, or is the above mentioned second roll just more than I make of it?  And now that I've hit 200, is there truly a reason to keep stacking WIS points?  Now I'm not looking for the &quot;Why you should be putting pts into AC instead&quot; arguements here, just an answer to IS there an advantage besides the extra 6 pts of mana per wisdom? <br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, 55 x 6 = 330 which isn't a terribly paltry amount of mana.<br />
<br />
I would always advocate a balance. If you have enough mana to get the job done on a daily basis, start concentrating on AC and hitpoints.  Don't let any &quot;magical wisdom number&quot; determine how you set up your gear, set up your gear so you are the most effective.<br />
<br />
If for you, that means a fungi tunic, high AC and 170 wisdom, do that.<br />
<br />
I have heard some folks say that having a higher wisdom reduces your chance of fizzles, but I'm at 252 and I fizzle like crazy (I still think Verant dickered with fizzles and channeling to make AA points more attractive).  So, I think that's a bunch of hooey.<br />
<br />
High wisdom also means greater tradeskill successes (and skill ups?) as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the reason 200 wisdom is the magic number, is that there used to be a hard cap there. every point beyond 200 was worth 1 mana, making it worthless. now it's 5-6 mana depending on what lvl you are, 50-60.<br />
<br />
200 is just what most people still shoot for. has no real signifigance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's actually sligtly worse than that even. I beleive that post 200 is 1/2 mana of pre 200 and that for him it would actually be 5 not 6. 6 just comes up as a common number because most people testing it are lvl 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a quite unique perspective on this, being a ranger.  You might ask why a ranger concerns themselves with mana.  Well, I do.<br />
<br />
For most of my EQ life, I had very little WIS, and mana, and judged it as mostly not necessary, as I primarily focused on melee.  (AC, HP, etc)  I see shamen are much the same here.<br />
<br />
But some spells were continually frustrating to me; the fizzle rates.  Greater heal, nullify magic, ensnare, etc-- I had a ~20% fizzle rate on these spells in parsing!<br />
<br />
So I thought it was quite frustrating that the fizzle rates were so high and spoke to Lawrence Poe about it.  He said none of our fizzle rates were high in code, and indeed, when I looked at the spdat, the spells I had the biggest problems with (ie greater heal) just had a high fizzle mod for anyone that could use them.<br />
<br />
So I began to get WIS gear.  Which is odd, as most rangers don't give a hoot about WIS.  Now I have 200+ WIS and 3000+ mana, unbuffed, in my normal gear.  The difference is incredible.<br />
<br />
Every 10 WIS is about 1% fizzle rate.  I've increased my WIS by literally more than 100 points and my fizzle rates are now pretty low.  My mana pool is huge, and this is nice not only in terms of how much I can cast, but when I do get to med I can fill it up and have much more mana available to me.<br />
<br />
I think WIS is quite important, and will someday even buy the improved natural wisdom AAs (I only have 64 AA atm).  With the new information on how low the AC caps truly are, I'd make my priority HP if I were you, not AC, as you will cap that easily, and don't neglect WIS entirely.  Post 200, it's not so important as it is pre 200, but still is relevant and helps with fizzle rates.<br />

<br />
On fizzles...<br />
<br />
With max skill, and 75 WIS/INT, you have a 20% fizzle rate.  Every level above the spell, and every 10 points of WIS, you get a 1% reduction in that, to a minimum of 5%.  Unfortunately hybrids don't get the fizzle reduction AAs, so I'm all too familiar with this...</div></div><hr />

200 is fine.  Don't break 220 unless it comes from gear with which you receive high hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Okay okay here it is :P  From an old Archmage Answers.  Some other rangers and I calculated that X = 10 through parsing.<br />
<br />
Also, in another archmage answers, he also says a high WIS score effects your chance of a successful specialization roll.  But to what extent, I don't know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work? <br />
A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check. There is always a 5% chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). What modifies a fizzle check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) your primary statistic (Intelligence for Magi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and Charisma for Bards) (c) the difficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell. <br />
<br />
When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% chance of fizzling. This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill (Evocation, for example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum of 75 in your appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did not set the difficulty of the spell to less then average (some spells we assign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not made any spells with higher difficulty). <br />
<br />
If your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.), we reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your statistic above 75. <br />
<br />
Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus, three levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max out her Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell. <br />
<br />
A high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind Affinity without fizzling earlier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Interesting stuff, but I suck at math.<br />
<br />
Okay, if my wisdom is 252 why am I still fizzling so darn much, is it just the 5% always a chance to fizzle?<br />
<br />
And what about that AA skill spell casting mastery, how does it figure in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm skeptical. The Archmage post makes some sense but, doing the math.. I wouldnt need a wisdom score over over 125 to affect any rate of fizzles.<br />
<br />
IMHO, wisdom is for tradeskills. I dont intentionally wear a single peice of gear for the wisdom stats. Incidentally I walk around with 176 wis, 2k hps, &amp; 1000 ac with resists at or above 100, unbuffed. I'm always willing to sacrifice wisdom for hps/ac. LvL 58 Barb.<br />
<br />
When its time to tradeskill I get my dr00dsuit out of the bank.<br />
<br />
More info on this subject would be much obliged. I don't think I fizzle much, but if I could fizzle less, I'd consider changeing my gear around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">probably a base fizzle rate Gloriana.  That's all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What's your fizzle rate, on which spells?  You might want to check out a parser and see.  Your high WIS alone should be reducing fizzles by about 17%.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Another thing I just thought of is, spell skills 50-&gt;60 are only 3(?) per level instead of 5/level... that might be driving up the base fizzle rate, if it assumes &quot;max skill&quot; is 5/level.<br />
<br />
And what about that AA skill spell casting mastery, how does it figure in?<br />
<br />
I don't know... it's not available to rangers.<br />
<br />
 I wouldnt need a wisdom score over over 125 to affect any rate of fizzles. <br />
<br />
It depends on what spells you cast, and what their base fizzle rate is.  (which you can find with a spdat parser or lucy.fnord.net)<br />
<br />
I'm always willing to sacrifice wisdom for hps/ac. LvL 58 Barb. <br />
<br />
With the recent information about the AC caps, you might want to divert some of that AC into HP or WIS :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Very informative. <br />

I sit at around 150 wis and only seem to fizzle when I am lom and absolutly have to get my spell of without a fizzle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Now, that's interesting. <br />
<br />
If no spells have been changed to make them fizzle MORE &quot;spells we assign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not made any spells with higher difficulty&quot; and supposedly our chance to successfully cast increases with levels (ie, we would more often successfully cast our level 4 gate than our level 60 torpor), why do Turgurs (51) and Chloro (55) fizzle more than cann IV (58) and Torpor (60)?<br />
<br />
Could just be the size of the sample.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh, and ha! You've cast can IV over ELEVEN THOUSAND TIMES!  How about that for some scary shiznit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">One of the big problems most casters had initially with Kunark was the fizzle rates on spells. VI set fizzle rates for post 50 spells the same as the pre 50 spells. The problem was that pure casters got very little (if any) increase in spell casting skills post 50.<br />
<br />
What do shamans spell skills(abjuration, alteration, etc.) cap at at 50? All pure caster had very high fizzle rates initially with their post 50 spells because of this.<br />
<br />
OK, I just looked up the skill caps on castersrealm (don't blame me if it's innaccurate) and I can explain it pretty well.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the numbers for Cann IV. It is a level 58 spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). &quot;<br />
<br />
So Cann IV assumed you have 295 Alteration skill and gives a base 20% fizzle rate at that skill. Unfortunately, no shaman in game has that much Alter skill, since it is capped at 230(?). That is an added 13% chance to fizzle, or 33% total chance to fizzle at 75 wiz and 230 Alter skill.<br />
<br />
I don't know if VI ever changed the mechanics for spells over 50 to assume the correct skill instead of just using (lvl * 5) + 5. They might have just reduced the fizzle rates directly on the spells themselves. If they just directly modified the fizzle rates of spells, it would be noticeable with spells that are shared out among different classes, like sup heal, or celerity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Shamans, not shamen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I understand where you're going with that Graal (or I think I do).  Does that explain why Tugurs would fizzle more than Torpor?  They are both alteration spells, Turgurs is level 51 and Torpor is level 60.  According to the &quot;increased levels = fewer chances to fizzle&quot; logic, Turgurs should fizzle LESS not more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>rahven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">IMHO the reason Torpor would fizzle less is that VI lowered the fizzle rate on it.  I cant imagine them not lowering say any 57-60 spell.<br />
<br />
Maybe when they did this the fizzle rate on torpor ended up being less than 51-56.  This is just a opinion but sounds resanable to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It all depends on what they set the fizzle rate for each spell Gloriana. Lucy is only showing the fizzle adjustment for Cann IV, it doesn't show it for the other spells that were listed in the parse. Maybe they just have the base fizzle rate and Cann IV has a different rate. I don't know.<br />
<br />
BTW, it isn't actually increased levels that modify chance to fizzle. It is increased spell skills. Before level 50, the two are essentially the same, but after 50 there aren't the improvements in spell skills that there were before.<br />
<br />
So level doesn't play a direct role, it does affect spell skills indirectly at certain levels.<br />
<br />
EDIT: One other thing I wanted to point out. I'm going to guess that Jaradis is specced in Alter. ;)<br />
<br />
Notice how low the fizzle rates are? They are way below the natural minimum failure rate of 5%. That has to be an artifact of speciliasation.<br />
<br />
Jaradis, you want to check how many times you fizzled a non Alter spell?</div></div><hr />

Look at those shaman over there...<br />
He's a shaman too.<br />
<br />
I remember reading a while back that everything up to 200 wis was like 1 point every 5 levels...so like 1 at level 1-5, 2 at 6-10 and so on til 10 per wis at 50.  It used to be that every point over 200 was only worth 1 mana, but I thought that changed with all the gear out there from Velius and Luclin.  I think it is 5 mana per every point over 200 now.  It's definately not still 1 per 1, I think the ratio is closer to half of what it was at 50.<br />
<br />
Still looking for references to back this up...it was an old article..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The way I've done it is to just ignore the post-200 Wisdom changes. I generally try and keep my Wis as close to 200 as I can, and then go hard on HP/AC gear. At 55 (ding, yay) I've got about 1418 HP and 963 AC unbuffed (1803 HP, 1000 AC self-buffed). <br />
<br />
Between Canni and medding I'm almost never out of mana. This doesn't include &quot;extreme&quot; situations, such as raids, trying to xp where I shouldn't (resists, mucho healing needed), etc. <br />
<br />
The way I look at it, the extra 55 Wis will come in time as the Velious quest armor comes in, since currently very little of my visible items have any Wisdom whatsoever. I'm too busy going after AC/HP to worry about it much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Shaman is both singular and plural, like deer. <br />
<br />
Actually that would be 'Shaman' as in 'deer' not deers.<br />
<br />
Main Entry: sha·man <br />
Pronunciation: 'shä-m&amp;n, 'shA- also sh&amp;-'män<br />
Function: noun<br />
Inflected Form(s): plural shamans<br />
Etymology: ultimately from Evenki (Tungusic language of Siberia) samAn<br />
Date: 1698<br />
<br />
However, I shall concede the point of 'shaman' being a perfectly valid plurality of 'shaman', as the Tungusic language does not utilize the letter s at the end of the word to signify plurality, but instead relies on altered pronunciation. But you knew that, right? However, as I'm not (currently) speaking the Evenki tribal dialect, I rely on Merriam-Webster to show me the way.<br />
<br />
No matter how you slice it, it ain't shamen, because the 'man' in shaman has nothing to do with the thoroughly western etymological roots of the word 'man'. It would be like telling someone in abrupt 'manner' to mind their 'menner'.</div></div><hr />

Actually it's Shaman and Shaman just like deer and deer although you could use Shamanists. The 's in the name of this site is denoting ownership (possessive case) of the Crucible and not multiple Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Would you in your case mind being a Shawoman? Or shall we be known as Shapersons? Can't be too PC these days you know.:p</div></div><hr />

With my gear on I did the same thing and out of 100 casts I fizzled 3..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I just saw Jaradis' full list of spell fizzle rates and I have one thing to say:<br />
<br />
I want specialization!!! <br />
<br />
Damn, that skill is effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">An interesting point for those of you considering what to spend AA points on.  <br />
Torrent of Poison is easily my most fizzled spell.  <br />
I have MAX Evocation and have had max evoc for over a year now.  <br />
I am specialized in Alteration<br />
<br />
Now for the info, I had about a 25% fizzle rate by my estimation on Torrent with all of the above spell casting stats.  It was annoying to say the least, never could tell if the dam spell was going to cast or just fizzle again. <br />
<br />
I put a couple points into Spell Casting Mastery the other night, then used Torrent a lot on the next raid vs. the slime goos.  I cast Torrent 35 times, had 5 fizzles.  That seems like a pretty good improvement, from 25% fizzle rate to 15% fizzle rate.  No idea how much mana I saved with the skill as well, but I plan to get more of that skill.  In the places where Torrent will land, it's quite effective at dealing out damage quickly.  <br />
<br />
I use Torrent if things die too quickly for DoTs to be effective, if I am not the puller or have extra mana, and if more damage would speed us up more than simply faster pulls.  <br />
<br />
I also use Torrent combined with Ice Strike to KS on raids.  My guild did a quickie raid in CT on the Ring of Slime.  We killed about 15 goos or so, and then the ring goos.  With an average group, I was able to KS about 8 of those kills.  <br />
<br />
I start with Torrent, then once it is casted and raining I begin casting Ice Strike.  If all waves and Ice Strike lands for full, I've just done 2295 damage in 15 seconds and if the mob is still alive, I can do it again.  That won't KS a determined wizard or mage, but it will up my group's damage contribution enough for us to get exp on the mob in 90% of the cases.  <br />
<br />
PoG raids are good for this if I'm not the main slower.  CT raids are frankly INSANE for this.  If yer in the exp group on a CT raid, you will get ASSLOADS of exp.  On the short ring of slime raid we did, I got 2 blues worth of exp, in about a 20 minutes of killing mobs as a raid.  <br />
<br />
Evocation can be a very worthy skill to have.  I recommend my shaman brothers and sisters to practice it.  And no, that JBB clicking doesn't count.  I think I see a LOT more Iksars with maxed Evoc than any other race, simply because they can't click away all day with JBBs.  <br />
Believe me tho, with the right skills, the JBB doesn't even come into play.  It's slow dmg.  With my mana regen powers, it's faster and safer for me to dot/nuke something to death and then hit Canni5 than it is for me to mindlessly click the JBB for 5 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Oh and Chardok under the bridge is a fantastic solo spot.  Mobs have just the right number of hps to die with Epic, Poxx, and Bane applied and a few bracer clicks to speed the inevitable along.  Ice Strike near the end if they are a caster.  <br />
<br />
I foresee a day when I can use Torrent instead of DoTs as my killing spell.  <br />
<br />
I'm just a bit envious of my druid friend.  He has both wildfire and moonfire, and it's crazy how fast he can make stuff die, specially if his crits go off.  <br />
<br />
I WANT A REAL NUKE!!!</div></div><hr />

High wisdom also means greater tradeskill successes (and skill ups?) as well. [/B]<br />
<br />
Success rates of tradeskills only depends on the actual skill and the trivial.<br />
However a high wis/int (whichever is higher) determines the chance on a skillup.</div></div><hr />
