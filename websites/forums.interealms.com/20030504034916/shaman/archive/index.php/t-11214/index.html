Yep my point is that, while Stoicism may be great for the folks in the 44-60 range, yet ANOTHER core competency of the shaman class has been gifted to clerics and druids, who formerly could not cure Poison / Disease as efficiently as we can.<br />
<br />
Sure its a minor deal, but if we got a port, a short duration snare, a summoned hammer, I'm sure others would be screaming.<br />
<br />
We have grown so used to having our abilities given away that when they 'only' take a minor one, we celebrate.<br />
<br />
I don't claim to be an expert on the spells available to Druids and Clerics in the realms of PR/DR cures, so perhaps the other priests already had spells of this nature.  I was under the impression that shaman cures were superior to those of druids and clerics though, and that seems to be no longer the case.<br />
<br />
&lt;/coffin_nail&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nope, just different.<br />
<br />
At 49, shaman got abolish disease, clerics got abolish poison.  That was it for quite a while.  Not sure what druids got out of those.  After luclin (long after the level cap was raised to 60), DA was put in, allowing us to cure both at once (and being our first ability to cure poison so well).  I *think*, but am not 100% sure, that clerics also got some form of cures along with one of their heals, but I don't know the name.<br />
I don't remember druids getting any of them previously, but I know clerics and shaman both have had.</div></div><hr />

Why get the lvl 52 spell when a level before you get same spell that removes 8 more counters with faster cast time and same recast/range/mana costs?   This spell just doesn't make sense unless it is a balancement spell against what they are providing for the other classes ... and what Shaman's have to bear to get mini-torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So, assuming it works like Torpor, will Stoicism be a 640 point heal (160 points at 6 seconds, 12 seconds, 18 seconds, 24 seconds), or will it be an 800 point heal?

<br />
Quite looking forward to this.  A little dismayed by the realization that I'm now going to have two &quot;heal&quot; spell gems, and then three next level.  I'll learn to live with it...</div></div><hr />

I think thats how it will end up with a lot of people.  However, these spells aren't meant to be spells that you will want to scribe and use at 60, these are spells put in to benefit those at lower lvls and people that are still trying to get to the higher lvls.  I know that the mini-torpor spell they are putting in would be really nice ( still will be actually since i dont have torpor yet) if I was just turning 44.</div></div><hr />

1)Look at the existing Paladin spells. They already have a line of fast-cast heal-over-time spells. This merely extends the line downwards - just like Stoicism extends the shaman HoT line downwards.<br />
Celestial Cleansing, L59, 175/tick, 1.5 cast time, 225 mana<br />
Supernal Cleansimg, L64, 250/tick, 1.5 cast time, 300 mana<br />

2)Paladins do not have the ability to convert their HP to Mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Paladins do not have the ability to convert their HP to Mana.<br />
Because a Shaman can Canni means it has to take 4 times as long to cast a spell as well as be rooted and slowed while it's in effect?  That doesn't make sense.<br />

i dont want to use bad word against the game designer<br />
but they seems to have a real problem with shamans<br />
enought is enought the problem seems to be reel deeper at this level of stupidity<br />
<br />
they realy have no clue about the shaman class and dont want to know more about it ?<br />
for them think about upgrade us is like a pain ?<br />
for sure they seems to do it in last ( see the order how new spell are showed , clerc + druid and shaman at end )<br />
<br />
so what may be the cause ? i dont know <br />
may be stupidity ? no-skill ? lack of imagination ?<br />

Disinfecting Aura:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2526&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Pure Blood:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3693&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
So, Pure Blood costs 50 mana less, cast time is 2.5 (vs 6 for DA), fizzles less (5 adjustment vs 15) is 1 lvl lower for clerics (same for shaman and druids).<br />
<br />
Only advantage for DA is 2 extra poison and disease counters.  I bet there is NO encounter where that makes a difference.<br />

It's a joke.  I do like the idea of changing Disinfecting Aura into a group spell.  Seems unlikely tho.<br />

But the new druid heal at 44 and our mini torpor fills the gap a bit for both classes 44-51, about time for that, 44-51 is weak for shamans and druids.<br />
<br />
But for all those complaining that these spells don't do anything for them, bear in mind that they are 44 and 51, so shouldn't necessarily be worthwhile for a level 60 char. That goes for all classes.</div></div><hr />

Excuse my language, but jesus.... how about fix the problem for shaman introduced in PoP - the need for DPS and the fact that our DOTs are ridiculous agro and generally not usable until too late in the encounter to be worthwhile and we don't have a nuke worth a ****.<br />
<br />
It's pretty damn annoying that we STILL don't have DPS, we are losing MORE of our class disinction, and our class-defining SPELL (Torpor) is still on a ridiculous drop rate.  Anyone that says that Malo is &quot;class-defining&quot; needs to find a level 60 mage and buy him Mala for 300p in the bazaar....<br />
<br />
They still haven't fixed our class-defining tradeskill.<br />
<br />
They still haven't fixed our spell drop rate.<br />

They could have made us better healers/curers... but now they give another boost to druids... who already have DS, better nukes, nearly as good of dots, can SoW/Lev combined, port, now they have better heals... equal cure capabilities now... hell, give them Malo too... why the hell not... <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Stoicism - GREAT addition, but should've been added at least 2 expansions ago or at the latest with PoP like it was SUPPOSED to be.  I can see this giving younger shamans a break in the healing, mana regen and soloing area.<br />
<br />
Pure Blood - *** ARE YOU THINKING?!?!?!?!?!?  I could care less if this spell comes 1 level or 5 levels before Disinfecting Aura.  I have no use for a spell that doesn't do as well as another that I already have even if it's 1 level later.  I would never scribe this spell if I was 51.  I would wait the extra level and get DA.<br />
<br />
Another thing to keep in mind is smaller number of people that are pre 55.  Most of the people pre 55 are alts and probably don't need Pure Blood.<br />
<br />
For them to add Pure Blood to the shaman line of spells is yet another kick in the teeth, but with them whoring it out to every other priest class it's unbelieveable.  Why didn't those annoying, overpowered a$$lords get it too?  Ooops, opened my mouth and will probably see them with it too.<br />
<br />
We have asked for a group shrink spell for I can't remember how long.  What do we get instead?  The ability to shrink anywhere and not just indoors.  WOW!!!  what a big fuggin help that is.  We wanted a group shrink to help with shrinking on raids, but we get some cheaply thought up bone tossed our way.  We sucked it up and hoped that next time they would get it right.  Hahaha, we were let down yet again.<br />
<br />
Our DoTs are worthless in groups unless the mob is rooted, which isn't a good thing to do if a ranger is around and it's just a waste of mana.  They generate too much aggro to even think about memming them while in a group.<br />
<br />
DPS needs do be upped just a bit to be in line with everyone else.  What do we get?  A new pet.  The pet is great, but with it unbuffed it takes a lot of damage soloing green mobs.  I have also killed the same type of mob my pet (unhasted) was killing faster with my epic dot.  If it takes 5 epic casts to kill a mob and my unhasted pet can't keep up there is definately something wrong.<br />
<br />
Caster balancing - What ever happened to this?  I remember reading Fan Faire transcripts that said they weren't done, but I don't recall anything new being added for any casters.<br />
<br />
Nukes - An enchanter can nuke for more than a shaman.  This is completely uncalled for.  Enchanters get mana regen spells that they whore out for money, they get a NICE charm spell that enables them to solo mini bosses in Teir 3 planes, and they even get Illusion Froglok.  Sorry, but I want an Illusion Froglok button that turns me into an old graphic Froglok :)<br />
<br />
Spell drop rates - We are still having issues with spell drop rates.  If Malo dropped half as often as Mala then we wouldn't have to spend 30-150k for the spell in the bazaar.  You can't even think about selling Mala on the server I play on.<br />
<br />
Shaman AA - Alchemy Mastery, what is that????  We're going to blow more money and AA points on a skill that is useless?  Come on, either fix Alchemy or scrap the AA.  Rabid Bear, I see no point in this ability at all.  Even with Avatar on I hardly see a difference in my melee abilities and fully buffed with Avatar I have over 1500 attack.  I believe I break the soft cap so Rabid Bear would be pointless.  Canni 5, why make us get Mental Clarity 3?  Why not Natural Durability?  Canni 5 takes away hit points and gives us mana.  Wouldn't it be more logical to increase our hit point instead of our mana regen?  Don't get me wrong, I love Canni 5 and probably couldn't play without it, but that has always bugged me.<br />
<br />
As you can see, there are a lot of problems with shamans.  Giving us more crap spells just isn't helping at all.  We have always been reasonable when we ask for things, but we always get some sort of off the wall bone thrown our way that doesn't come close to what we need/want.</div></div><hr />

24 poison counter is removed.<br />
<br />
If they make priest lv 1~60 spell require alchemy item to help research, that will be encourage a shaman to train alchemy for torpor or malo research.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the group solution better, then no one gets nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...DA now cures 4 x 12 disease counters (no more poison).<br />
<br />
Okay, I'm a little confused by that one.<br />
<br />
So DA is now an upgraded Abolish Disease?  Or do you think they mean it to be 2 x 12 disease and 2 x 12 poison counters but screwed up the cut and paste...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">No, VI just decided to take a spell that we already have and compltely nerf it to make us all get the brand new spell that's coming out with LoY. (aka try to make more ppl waste $18 bucks to pay for 5 zones and 2 spells)  I will never use DA if that change stays, i have my right click abolish disease legs that cure almost as many disease counters, so there's no reason to ever mem cure disease.  It would be much better if they made DA a group cure....but that'd be too powerfull of course.....  Such is VI.<br />
