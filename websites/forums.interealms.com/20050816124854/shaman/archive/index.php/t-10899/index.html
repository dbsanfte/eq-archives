<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">unless they are changing the way it worked in the past, i would say no.  any quest you did for grobb, you'd lower broken skull clan faction, etc.  Killing grobb guards would raise broken skull clan, etc, etc....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I totally nerfed my faction with broken skull clan :(<br />
Btw if you go to paineel and kill every firebettle there is they almost instant respawn, you can also stack attack commands for your dog.<br />
Nifty way of farming firebeetle eyes to use to increase the old grobb faction.<br />
I had to do this because the ivandry hoop quest has neg basher faction and positive broken skull clan, got myself indif with my home town then back to warmly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I understand the lore correctly, the Broken Skull Trolls still follow Innoruck. I think it would be cool for Innoruck Trolls to start with Clan Broken Skull. New Cazic following Trolls would start in Paineel with the Erudite Heretics.<br />
<br />
Assuming that the new ship in Stonebrunt Mountains takes you to Broken Skull Rock, the Cazic Trolls would be in fairly close proximity to CBS. You have the potential for some really cool battles between Paineel and Broken Skull Rock. :)<br />
