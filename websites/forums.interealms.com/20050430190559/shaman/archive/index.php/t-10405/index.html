<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Noticed last night that procing the mace took me from full mana to oom instantly. I bug reported it.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
(Mace procs theft of thought for those who were unawares.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Soe seems to have broken that line of spells or atleast ToT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Please tell me you play on a nonZek server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes it is bugged.<br />
<br />
But i saw something weird last time it proced. I went oom, used cann 5, and get all mana back (the one lost plsu the one from cann 5).<br />
<br />
Reported the bug, not sure if VI care much about this proc anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info. I was terrified of it being another Zek-only bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guildmates end up in interesting situations when they solo. Where did my mana go? Yeah it's bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea mine did it to. I proc'd and went from 85% to OOM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought this had been fixed yesterday. One of our clerics was reporting he wasn't losing mana from it at least.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the theft of thought spell now drains all of your mana, seeing as this doesn't help players, estimated fix time is late 2005</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd be willing to bet you can solve this bug (just like the ghost-dot AoE bug) by unequipping and re-equipping an item with +mana, thus forcing a server-refresh of your mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lost a roll on that mace last night.  Can't think of a better shaman PvP item.  You pretty lucky to have one Asta.  That's gotta be ownage vs. any caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Best PvP item ever is definatly the hoop of emptyness from AL, clicky nullify magic is hilarious. Dark mace kicks ass too when it isnt bugged tho....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Before the bug, Theft of thought worked as lucy says in PvP, as in, it drains 400 mana and gives you 400 mana. But, in player vs monsters, you only get like 100 mana back from attacking a higher lvl mob. At level 65, no exp mobs give much over 100 mana back, so its pretty useless.<br />
<br />
I went in on this item, under the impression that it gives you 400 mana back, regretting it now, should have went in on that VT affliction staff :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From the first patch this week, a guildie enchanter casted Theft of Thought, and went OOM. He got up to full mana again, and tested it again, and sure enough, it was bugg'd and he reported it immediately.<br />
<br />
I find it odd than not too long ago, VI screw'd up an SK spell that normally would take 100 mana and give it to the SK, but with the screw-up, it gave the SK 100% mana back, thus FM when cast. Rumor even has it that an SK solo'd Woushi because of it (again, rumor, as I haven't seen any post on it myself). Course, VI had an emergency patch that same night fixing it.<br />
<br />
I won't be surprized that VI will fix it in a couple of weeks, kinda like when they messed up our Avatar spell, making it only scribable at level 255. Then if you /petition, most guides had no clue about it, and once you finally got to a GM, they told you to &quot;wait for the patch...&quot;, or &quot;I'm sorry, I don't know how soon, i it will be fixed in an upcoming patch though...&quot;, then almost 3 weeks later you could scribe it finally at level 60, with no acknowledgement on VI's that there was anything wrong with it...<br />
