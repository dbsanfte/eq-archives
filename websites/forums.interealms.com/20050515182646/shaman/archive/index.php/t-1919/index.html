<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone tried and has feedback from this strategy?<br />
<br />
60 Shaman: Slowing, Maloing, rooting mobs and Torporing Wizzy.<br />
60 Wizard (With Mana Robe): Nuking and converting HP's to Mana.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Sounds like a good Strategy... but you never know till you actually do if it's a good one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">using mana robe is as fast as using clarity 2 sitting.<br />
it sux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Replace the mana robe with a manastone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sitting on horse is same as medding, plus you the wiz can right-click the robe.  Unless something has changed... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mana Robe doesn't suck as long as the wizard is sitting on a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail Pabs,<br />
<br />
Sounds very doable. A lot of it has to do with how skilled the player(s) are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree.  I have a new technique for xping involving a couple of different duo combos.  I am doing xp faster than ANY other method I know of (including uber AE groups) and most if not all powerleveled method.<br />
<br />
See if you can work it out and join me in this new xp.  Not sure the exact amount of time for AA point etc, but I have gotten like 12 points in less than a week with a goodly but not uber amount of time xping (average of 3 hours a day).<br />
<br />
(sorry, delibrately being a bit evasive about my new methods cause don't want to compete with everyone and their dog for good spots etc.  Think about the capabilities of the shaman and should be able to work it out)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you arent on Antonius Bayle and dont mind helping a fellow shaman on a different server feel free to PM me with how you are doing this :D Or even at least with a nice big hint ;)<br />
<br />
P.S I am very good at keeping quiet about sweet spots :)</div></div><hr />
