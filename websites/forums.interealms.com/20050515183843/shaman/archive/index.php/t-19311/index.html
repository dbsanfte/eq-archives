<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I just thought I'd share...<br />
<br />
I got a new, sweet gaming box last summer, and have loved it. But now it just hangs, and I'm working with tech support to get it resolved. But in the meantime, I've been out of game for 9+ days, and actually getting a lot done around the house. No DTs. No shakes. No sneak-gaming at a friend's house. In fact, I just remembered that I used to run EQ on my older machine, and I haven't even wanted to reinstall it there.<br />
<br />
So the point, if there is one, I guess, is that no matter how horrible it seems, when you're heavily in-game, to imagine not playing... once you pass that hurdle, it's really not that big a deal.<br />
<br />
Having said that, when I get back in-game, I'll probably scale back my playing significantly. Like I told my guild I would last month, and never did...<br />
<br />
A little sabbatical can help put things in perspective.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I took 9 months off and now I am having more fun then ever.  Looking forward to making a Berzerker to  fool around with.  But until then, gonna grind AA with mah Shaman.  I have a 55 Warrior and a 65 Shaman that I play.  I think that a Zerker is gonna be part of each.  Would be neat...but that is a whole nother thread lol</div></div><hr />
