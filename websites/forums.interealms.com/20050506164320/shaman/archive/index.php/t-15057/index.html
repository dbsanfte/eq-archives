<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, I am thinking about making a shaman and would like to know sokme basic things. My race, I would like to have either Barbarian or Troll or Iksar. Iksar probably the least I want just because he wouldnt be able to wear some things. Also I have ~5k I can spend on him to twink so gear suggestions would be very helpful. Like, is there any item every shaman should have some time in his life. Ok thanks a bunch in advance for all replys. I will keep in touch with what I decide for my shaman.  ;)</div></div><hr />

1. Pick what you like as far as race (no JBB for iksars, this is prolly the item you speak of as far as &quot;once in your life&quot; goes.)<br />
<br />
2. take your 5k and buy an ikky regen BP and a REIF (rune etched iceworm fang). May depend on prices on your server but BP ~ 4k on tunare and reif ~ 1k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5kpp isn't a lot of money to outfit a shaman. I've probably spent around 185kpp just on my basic gear and I'm not even close to considering myself a good twink but then again, I play on a server where prices are higher then other servers. Prexus has really cheap prices right now because of the 2 rollbacks. Characters that were once deleted, appeared on the account again with all their equipment so the market is flooded with cheap gear. Anyway, keep in mind, the shaman is very gear dependant because they melee. You can get by with 5k but it'll be a tough road.<br />
<br />
As far as to which race to play, I chose a frog. I like how they do a flip when they cast a spell and they can use a jbb. I think barbs are ugly but that's just me. The bottom line is play what you like. It's a long game and you might as well enjoy your character. All stats can be overcome eventually.<br />
<br />
Now, for the guy suggesting that you use the search feature, it's not a bad suggestion but you can only use the search feature once ever 60 seconds. It kinda sucks. The only bad thing about this board is everytime you ask a question, 12 jackasses will tell you to use the search feature and two of the posts will actually be constructive. Just ignore the ones that tell you to use the search feature, especially the ones that think they are clever and make the search button appear in their post. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck with your shaman, you picked a great class. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that rune spear from kael was nice, did have This (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4282) on one of my guys sometime ago, same proc but lesser stats, to bad it was on the wrong server :( my little shaman is as untwinked you can be, but still fun.<br />
<br />
Made an iksar for the nice regen, but xp is a lot slower then for my halfling druid fighting at the same place in overthere(same level)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Treedom Gottasnare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks a bunch so far guys, I went with troll because of his looks. True 5k isnt alot, but I dont plan to twink him so that I wont get upgrades till Im 50, maybe around 30 or so  :D .  Thanks again. And I will post a magelo of him as soon as I get him outfitted to make sure I did this right  :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oops sorry Treedom was me, I was using a different computer sorry for the confusion.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gee, for a class that's so hopelessly 'broken' there sure are a lot of people flocking to our ranks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only non shaman call them shammies/shammy , I hate that ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just use the search feature in the bazaar.. :)<br />
Really though I'd check out some of the quest in PoK cheap easy focus items such as Fine Antique Ring,Fine Antique Velvet Rose,Fine Antique Corset,( I use this at 56). Of course the 6ac 65 hp rings, even the 5ac 55hp. A chipped bone bracer has Affliction Efficiency, a serpentine bracer is cheap and has burning affliction. Any cheap high hp item is good. Oh yes.. Ikky regen plate best of all :) A few high hp items and ikky regen plate and crap for the rest you should be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ikky bp would be nice, but you could also pick up a heap of totemic/jaundiced for dirt cheap, land yourself a decent weapon too and you're pretty much set to 30's. Thanks to a shaman pal that's what I had and it was great til 40's, when I got his jaundiced throw offs. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd seriously look at weapons becuase you will most likely be meeleing a lot early on as our dots are pretty sad at the lower levels, and any hp/ac gear is great. A REIF would be fabulous but might be a bit costly, I seem to rememeber I had a slime coated harpoon which did the job, but don't forget the 2 handers there's a ton around now that give great bangs for the buck.<br />
<br />
Have fun trolly.</div></div><hr />
