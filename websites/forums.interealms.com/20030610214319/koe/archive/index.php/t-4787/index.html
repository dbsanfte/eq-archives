<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recieved confirmation that the only thing this spell does as of right now is consume mana. The spell is broken.<br />

Now if I only had a choice to use Mark of Karn :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was following the thread about this spell on the EQCleric forums for some time.  Seemed like there was no end to the speculation about what this spell is supposed to do...althought I must say I like the &quot;reverse damage shield&quot; theory.  Of course, I think the general consensus is, in fact, that this spell currently does nothing at all.  Inf, did you get confirmation from a GM, or just going off of the experiences of players?  Of course, not sure I'd believe a GM over player experience.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After testing it on a few low level characters on 6 different accounts on different parts of the worlds I got no noticable hit point adjustments, these where all less than level 10 characters with and without buffs and  w and w/o twink gear.</div></div><hr />
