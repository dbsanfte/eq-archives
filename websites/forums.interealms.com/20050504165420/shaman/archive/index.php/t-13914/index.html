<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Plane of Growth used to be one of my favorites zones to hunt in before they added back to the PoGs, however I managed to muster up a group to finally go back and see just how bad it is with the PoGs back in action. So I'd like to share my conclusions about the zone now.<br />
<br />
First off I am lv 61 shaman with NO malo or torpor. My group consisted of myself a 3 necromancers(lv 63,61,60). <br />
<br />
You have about 2-3 minutes from the time you zone in to make a pet and buff it up before the PoGs come running at you. Somethings to note about the Protectors of Growth is that they are quite slowable at 61 with no malo or any sort of debuff they don't hit hard only about 160 ish and they are ALL rangers every single time thus they don't nuke hard or gate(was there for 12 hours). However they have a ton of HP and took about a minute or two to kill with 4 pets bashing it non stop. Solo I would say they are totally not worth dealing with cause while they are simple to kill they just take forever(ton of HP). There are 2 of them but they spawn individually so if you kill one and hold the other one off for 5 minutes or so you can easily split the spawn so you don't have to fight them both at the same time agian. Overall the PoGs are exactly what they are intended to be, a total pain to a soloer but just a nuisance to a group. <br />
<br />
After clearing out all the mobs on the first half of the zone there are few things that I noticed that were different now. Horses are no longer paladins instead they are lower lv druids (cast drifting death, ice). The bears now cast higher level druid spells (winged death and breath of ro). They always cast these 2 dots on you asap, which do about 2200 damage to you and very hard to resist so becarefull. Wolfs were also druids no longer any ranger regular mobs. Gem drops were less then before, there was a very noticeable amount of crystalized sulfur dropping at a rate which was much higher then previously without question. While I can't be certain about this it also appeared the number of mobs in the first half of the zone was reduced to about 1/2-3/4 its previous number(all the named were up so I assumed it was full spawn).<br />
<br />
Overall this zone is now I'd say is a waste of time for anyone looking for just quick cash, don't get me wrong though it's still a lot of fun and we cleared quite deep into the zone with just a small group which was fun. Which is the up side, that it is now usually full spawn so you can take a group in and have some fun clearing. Anyways hope this information was usefull. Thanks.<br />

Edit: Spent 2.5 hours there the other night clearing west half of the zone... not a single piece of PoG armor dropped and this was chain pulling w/ only breaks for the stinking pogs.  Add PoG armor to the list of &quot;raid shaman only&quot; tagged gear in the game a la L59/60 kunark spells, despite the fact that I doubt a raid shaman would even loot the stuff.  Bleh.<br />
