<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Friend of mine mentioned that he can alt+tab just fine with EQ, but that you needed to change some windows setting for this to work..<br />
Anyone got any insight on this? I dont know if it was only when he was using EQw, or if it was on normal EQ also.<br />

That link doesnt seem to work, gives me :<br />
&quot;The download you requested is unavailable.  If you continue to see this message when trying to access this download, you might try the &quot;Search for a Download&quot; area on the Download Center home page.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Microsoft has a utility tool program you can download to allow alt tabbing in game.  Microsoft Windows Application Compatability Toolkit 3.0.  It does work but it is not an elegant solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks guys, I downloaded the Microsoft Windows Application Compatability Toolkit 3.0, and followed some instructions on the EQw forum to use it. Just have to wait for servers to be up to check if it worked ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use it with WinXP Pro. Works well, although running in windowed mode EQ will be much darker than using EQw or running in full screen mode. Especially noticable if you're a nightblind race.<br />

<br />
In windowed modes EQ reacts to your desktop gamma settings. Adjusting them will lighten/darken the EQ screen. I use NVidea, which allows for saving settings. I have an EQ setting and a standard setting for when just using the comp (tends to &quot;grey&quot; my desktop view in optimal EQ lighting.) This allows me to quickly switch out/in to different settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The really annoying part of tabbing 2 EQ windows for me is that you lose control of your mouse if one of them is zoning.  I'm mentioning this in hopes that there's some kind of tweak or workaround for getting the mouse back...<br />
<br />
It seems to speed things up greatly for me to have 2 separate EQ folders to run from, as well.  Putting these 2 EQ's on separate hard drives is even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The last patch changed some things about this:<br />
<br />
1) on xp, alt+tab is now more effiicient in that other applications will start faster and internet browsing will not be so painful<br />
<br />
2) the in-game gamma setting now works even in windowed mode, so you're not tied to your desktops gamma setting anymore<br />
<br />
As for the mouse thing, there is no work around that I know of.  I think its just an outright bug in EQ.  You can minimize it by activating objects using your &quot;U&quot; key, targeting NPCs using your F8 key, and casting spells using alt+#.  You can also mem spells (like travel spells) using /memspellset.  Not a fantastic work-around, but it gets me by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LaughingWoman: Just activate your global mouse(with ctrl+alt+r) before you zone, and use the taskbar to switch to the second window. That's how I do it, works without a problem =)<br />
<br />
If I forget to activate the mouse before I zone, I can ctrl alt del and switch to the second window using task manager, but this can be buggy and cause the mouse to lock until the first window is done zoning.</div></div><hr />

That was actually fixed in the last version of EQW (2.35a), hopefully the fix will remain in place when J.S.D. gets it operable with the current patch woes :-/</div></div><hr />
