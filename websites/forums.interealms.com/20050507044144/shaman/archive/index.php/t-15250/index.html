Go to HHK and get into group list.  They will send you a tell when your turn is up.  Also, turn on your lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman are very wanted in groups.  Stick with it!<br />
<br />
PS Shaman or Shamans, never Shamen.  The word is Russian in origin, it's not like &quot;fire + man = fireman.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's a somewhat depressing experience. In a good XP group the mobs don't really need slow and you have few DPS or healing options. I always used to look for a group without a chanter since that meant no haste, tight on mana (ie. want slow) and no slower. But it can be hard to find such groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well at lower levels 45 and down slowing is more a nicity to have.  As you start getting high in level from that point shaman start to become more and more wanted.  By about 54ish or so most groups demand them just go hunting.  Though soloing might be a real pain at your level right now it attually helps you more then hurts you.  By soloing at your level it allows you to learn...<br />
<br />
... to control multiple mobs with little or no other help.  <br />
... manage your mana. (canni dancing)<br />
... control and manage your pet.<br />
... increase your defence skill. ( Must not do the root rot thing though get in thier face and beat them to a mushie pulp )<br />
... allows you to learn the finer arts of agro control. (Pets not the best taunter)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying grouping is bad or anything there are just a lot of things you can learn by soloing that you can apply to groups.  All you have to do is figure out how to apply those lessions in different ways once your grouped.  When your solo and you mess up you dont have to listen to the group rip you a new one either.  Though I would never stay with a group that did that to someone that messed up.  Everyone I group gets one freebie mess up card.  Or two or three. hehehe What I dont accept is someone that repeats thier mistakes many times and does not alter their tactics.  I ussually laugh when I get ganked in groups as most times I see exactly what I did wrong to die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its shaman, not shamen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's hard for many people at lower levels these days to find groups, due mainly to many of the lower level characters being twinked alts that are just in the mood to solo or be PL'd. Once you get a few more levels, that should change. Just keep a LFG tag up when looking for a group and go to level appropriate zones. You'll get a group. Shamans are in VERY high demand, so if grouping is your thing, you'll find plenty. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">or &quot;shamans&quot;<br />
<br />
suggestion: form groups wherever you go from ppl who are LFG.  Doesn't matter what class they are, everyone has something to contribute.  Just talk to people and keep trying.  It does get easier later, but to tell the truth, I still prefer to form my own groups.  Saves me the trouble of having to disband from the bad ones that &quot;find&quot; me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actualy wouldnt it be Shaman's ?<br />
<br />
Shaman is the plural and singular interpretation i believe, so the only differing variation would be..<br />
<br />
&quot;This epic is that shaman's&quot;<br />
<br />
but when talking about a group of shaman, it would be shaman.<br />
<br />
But to be on topic, its not the shaman thats hard to find groups, its the groups that ard hard to find. There isnt as many people enjoying the low end game as their used to be, once you get up around mid 40's+ you will see a huge difference as everyone is in the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamphibian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well the PC route would be Shaperson. <br />
The desert route would be Shami.<br />
The accountant route would be Shaman x __.<br />
I prefer the carwasher route  Shammies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Shaman&quot; can be used as the plural, or &quot;shamans&quot; can be used as the plural.  Both are reasonable grammaticaly.<br />
<br />
If Shaman is used as the plural then Shaman's is the plural possessive.  <br />
<br />
If &quot;Shamans&quot; is used as the plural then Shamans' would be the plural possessive (even though it looks stupid) and would be pronounced &quot;shamans-es&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons I favor &quot;Shaman&quot; as the plural, because it makes the plural possessive easier on the eyes and ears.<br />
<br />
All that said, one doesn't really use the plural possessive that often, so it ain't that big a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">apostrophe denotes possessive OR a contraction as in...<br />
<br />
<br />
but other than grammar nitpicking as far as the original topic, I think being a 65 shaman has made me very spoiled. When I go LFG (if I dont get send an immediate tell), I rarely spend more than 10 minutes /oocing my level and class with the LFG tag on. This is simply because after level 55 the mobs you fight for experience NEED to be slowed, or else the downtime would be too great for the healer/cleric.<br />
<br />
Playing a high level shaman has made me spoiled for that reason... I find whenever I play one of my alts (bard, ranger) after about 20 minutes of lfg'ing I just get frustrated and give up, because I'm used to getting groups so quickly. When I ask my wizard or warrior friends though, they will take any group they will get, and 30 minutes average lfg before finding a group is a good figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah whatever. :rolleyes:  Back to the original thought...<br />
<br />
Shamans are very group-desired... one of the most group-desired class in the game, along with clerics and enchanters.  50+ or 55+ you'll really start to see the love.  I can just log on and start getting tells to join groups, whether it be with guildees or anonymous tells.  You'll end up finding some action somewhere, at least if you're a good shaman.  Playing a shaman lets you make a lot of friends too, which only helps your group-desirability.<br />
<br />
Since PoP came out, *I think* shamans have had even more desirability in groups, for their 2000-heal and slowing capabilities.  Slow is so crucial in PoP, where tier 1 mobs can hit for ~400+.  A cleric without a slower will have trouble keeping the group healed; a slower without a healer will have trouble keeping the group healed (hehe); but a shaman can slow, then keep the group healed with their level 58 heal AND be 80m when the fight is over, ready to pull another.<br />
<br />
I know 50+ is a ways down the road for you, but by level 34 you should at least start seeing how well shamans do in groups, and how well people like them in groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aside from word derivation arguments and signature size discussions - in answer to your original question - <br />
<br />
yes.<br />
<br />
You are at a slight &quot;down&quot; period in terms of Shaman power. Dogdog is nice, but at 34 he's like taking a jeep into a tank battle.  Treat the mutt like a DOT for the time being. That means he doesn't tank (You do which has the side benefit of raising weapon skills and defense) but you do want to drop a buff or two on him. :)<br />
<br />
Do a /who all 34 39 lfg. (Or whatever range you feel comfortable with.) Your flexibility is key. Once you meet and group with the same people over and over they'll remember you and look for you.  <br />
<br />
It gets better from here on out. Right now you are a struggling young whelp from the plains of Halas or the swamps of Oggok / Innothule. Soon you will cut a one man swath of destruction and healing across Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I sometimes run into trouble because I zone into an area with a guild raid gathering, put on LFG to inform the guild that I'm looking, and I start to get tells from people in BoT looking for a shaman :-)<br />
<br />
So yeah, shaman are desired for groups at high levels.  At 34 you're just coming into your first really powerful levels, you'll find it easier the higher you go from there.  For now, take Chazic's advice, solo a bit, learn how to deal with your pet, and get your defense up.<br />
<br />
I soloed FM or OT at your level - FM is easier if you don't feel like working that hard, OT is pretty awesome XP at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shaman(s) are a good class. Even if enchanters / beastlords (at 65) come close in slowing we still have a lot to offer for a group and many groups want us for slowing. Even when I hang around in PoT / PoK (without LFG up) I get offers to join a group. Just put LFG up when you want to join a group and you should get invites.<br />
<br />
Of course you can start a group on your own (as Landragoran already said). You can duo with every class (well, duoing with a cleric may be the worst combination) and from there you can add what ever you want. On my server (KB) I see lot of tells in Nexus / PoK &quot;zone_01 group of level x - y looking for more!&quot; You can try this too. Great Dungeon are Dalnir, Kaesora, Runnyeye, Sol A, MM castle, CC or some of the luclin zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok back on my soapbox.<br />
<br />
The plural of &quot;shaman&quot; is &quot;shamans.&quot;  Period.  It's not &quot;shaman&quot; and it's not &quot;shamen.&quot;  I know EQ has spelled it wrong in the past.  EQ's spelled a lot of things wrong.  Feel free to look it up if you don't believe me.<br />
<br />
Shamans, shamans, shamans.  Period.<br />
<br />
One other minor point: it's not Russian (language) in origin, it's from the Ugric language family which spawned the Aleut (Eskimo) and native siberian languages.<br />
<br />
Of course, Siberia is in Russia, but it's not Russian-language.<br />
<br />
Ok, please go on now while I go lie down for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not to be too much of stickler, but shaman actually is a Russian word.  The Russians borrowed and slightly modified it from Evenki, the language of the nomadic Evenks of the Siberian taiga.  The Evenks got it from Tocharian, which in turned borrowed it from Parkrit, which lifted it from the Sanskrit word sramah, meaning religious exersice.<br />
<br />
Ugric languages are rooted father West than Evenki.  Most member languages of the Finno-Ugric group are spoken in the Ural region, though it can be found as far North as Finland (hence Finn-Ugric.) The most prominent example of an Ugric language today is probably Hungarian, though there are several less well know people groups both East and West of the Urals that still speak an Ugric language.<br />
<br />
You're right about shamans, however.  Its an inflected word in English, so it catches most folks by surprise, cause it just don't sound right!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am a level 34 shammy and I seem to have trouble getting groups.  I am wondering if that trouble will begin to fade away as I get to higher levels.  I really don't like soloing but I do it if I have to =\ kind of painful<br />
<br />
Erm, sorry if this sounds rude but...what are you doing wrong?<br />
<br />
I have always had to turn down group requests because I preferred soloing...XP was faster (this was before KEI got nerfed)<br />
<br />
Even without KEI, you should be able to take a good solo spot in the OverThere at SF ramp or in EW at Icefand (? The huts with the wolf inside and the dorf ghost outside). Walruses only, unless you have good gear and like playing tag with the Man o Wars.<br />
<br />
Or...a Shaman's playground can be found on the beach in Gunthak if you have LoY. Feed some AlphaChow to dogdog and melee to your heart's content. At 34, I would toss 1, maybe 2 slows per fight. Very little down time, and it's easy to single pull (a few instances where you may need to pull two to break a spawn point)<br />
<br />
If you do SF ramp, keep your eye on that group off to the left. You know, that group of 4 or 5 who are running into trouble all the time? Toss a few heals. If ya really want to make a statement, heal 'em while you are taking down the Bezerker and keeping that sabertooth add parked to the side. When they ask you to join, you can say yes...unlike me, who always said &quot;No, but /yell if ya need me&quot;<br />
<br />
Unless your gear just completely blows, you should be able to solo just fine (you will just have to canni down far more than I did, because I always had KEI cutting my down time). <br />
Root rotting works well, but don't get too hooked on it...you need to get your melee up.<br />
<br />
And as someone else already said...get a duo partner and really go to town. We can duo well with absolutely anyone. If they are a melee class, we turn into a support postion with just buffs, slows, heals (and dogdog). If they are a caster class, we can melee to keep the mob occupied while they nuke. Shaman\Necro teams are a fearsome thing.<br />

Oh, and to join the Shaman vs Shamen fray:<br />
Shaman is, indeed, Russian (or thereabouts) in origin. Plural is, indeed, Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One suggestion:  <br />
<br />
During my 30s, 40s, early 50s I kept a list at my side.  Everytime I grouped I kept track of the players I thought were decent.  I even had it broken down by class, so when I was in an exp group and we needed a cleric, I had a list of 5 or so to immediately ask.  This allowed me to bring good people into the group, build friendships, and get more invites because they began to remember me as well.<br />
<br />
The last thing I would do when leaving a group is send a tell to those who I wanted to group with again.../tell Goodwarrior Let's group again, I enjoyed it! (or something like that)  Add Goodwarrior to your short list of decent players and get him into the first group you can.<br />

It's all about the networking =)<br />

<br />
Well, your troubles will all fade away at 51 which seems like a long way off but really isn't. <br />
<br />
I was 34 about 3 years ago and finding groups was easy for me because there weren't many twinks, there were hell levels and soloing was very slow for everyone except necros. <br />
<br />
When I had trouble finding a group back then the easiest solution was to start your own group and advertise like this: &quot;34 shaman looking for more. I can haste, slow, dot, root, greater heal, regen ..and I have this really cute puppy&quot; Well ok, back then our puppies really were cute, they were solid not like the near invisi-dog we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Casters generally have their power vs. level curves slanted toward late game, and shammies are no exception, although I think we have one of the worst curves around.<br />
<br />
Levels 24-34 are particularly bad, since your best heal is maybe 1 bubble of health on a tank, your dots/debuffs are expensive and seemingly useless, and your buffs have the double disadvantage of both sucking and not lasting very long.  I quit my shammie at 34 for about 6 months in frustration, and I suspect that many of my contemporaries started alts during this period as well.<br />
<br />
Seek the light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
By 34 you will get your first dog and begin to taste the power, and by 51-52 you will have become one of the more powerful classes in the game, and will both be good at solo'ing and highly desired in groups.  By 60, you'll be able to brag to guildies about solo-farming mobs for cash or loot that would take any 3 of them to kill.  Even at 62, I can farm Droga and Sebilis with such ease that even necros in my guild are envious. So trust me, it may suck now, but it gets a lot better later.<br />
<br />
BTW, look at beastlords for a class that was well-designed in that it retains consistent power throughout the level heirarchy.  Compare this to druids or any melee class, and you will see how power curve balancing is one the persistent design issues in EQ, since all of these classes are too powerful in early/mid-game and too weak in late-game.</div></div><hr />
