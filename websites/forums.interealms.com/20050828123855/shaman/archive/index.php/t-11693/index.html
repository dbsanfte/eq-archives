<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Overall some good changes that attempt to redress some Shaman grievances<br />
<br />
The new group cure (blood of nadox) casts in 7.5 sec - nice spell, but still ... would be nice to get the single target DA on par with the pure blood casting time<br />
<br />

<br />
DA: 150 mana, 10 counters, 6 sec cast<br />
PB: 100 mana, 9 counters, 2 sec cast<br />
<br />
PB is the better spell.  DA needs to be upgraded to be on par (15 counters, 3 sec cast)<br />
<br />
Also, group haste apparently needs an AE range and should be 60%<br />
<br />
Please /feedback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Group haste does not need to be 60%.<br />
<br />
The longer duration AND the fact that it effects the entire GROUP more than makes up for the fact that it only 50%.<br />
<br />
If you have only 1 or 2 melee then use Celerity. If you have 4 or 5 melee then maybe use group haste.<br />
If you have no enchanter on a raid and are hasting ALL melee then group haste everyone. Simple.<br />
<br />
Also, you normally get group versions of spells at a higher level than the single target version. If there was a 60% group haste it'd probably be a level 65 spell....<br />
<br />
I think the new spells are a GREAT help and we should all stop whining and play the game.<br />
<br />
/cheer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">See the other half a million threads on this... Oh, and would people stop asking for one thing, and then when we get it, MOAN ABOUT IT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So use pure blood and stop bitching.<br />
<br />
For a week when I came to the boards all I read were shaman bitching and moaning that VI had nerfed DA and we HAD to use thier silly PB.<br />
<br />
So they changed it back AND gave you a group version of it and you are STILL gonna bitch and moan?<br />
<br />
I can see being currently upset because the group haste isnt working.  Fine...I /feedbacked it and I hope everyone else will too.  But to cry because you got what you wanted is just beyond me.<br />
<br />
And I used to think that druids were whiny....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pure blood is no longer an option.  That quest giver returns a differnt spell to a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">re: &quot;Quit bitching and moaning&quot; - nobody made you click the thread. You know you like it!<br />
<br />
No, technically, nobody playing this game &quot;needs&quot; anything - the word is used loosely and for rhetorical effect.<br />
<br />
A friendly reminder: /feedback does appear to work.  This patch is a positive sign; somebody upstairs does care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Frankly, I'm glad to have DA back the way it was.  I was not about to quest for a spell that I had and that was taken away.<br />
<br />
Now that it's a useful spell, I shall do the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Modified the Pureblood quest to return Blood of Nadox for Shaman characters. In addition, any Shaman who has previously done the quest and received Pure Blood will be able to obtain the Blood of Nadox scroll simply by hailing the quest NPC.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does this mean I cant get hold of Pure Blood spell? If I now do this quest, do I only get the group version, Blood of Nadox in return? If so, how can I get hold of Pure Blood?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Right..no more Pureblood for da shammies, only Blood of Nadox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BUT....<br />
<br />
I still have Pure Blood as I did the quest a few weeks back and now I have Blood of Nadox just by hailing the NPC. Hopefully they wont retroactively remove SHM from Pure Blood.<br />
<br />
So it looks like if you were smart enough to do the quest before the change you get both spells, at least for the time being. Group cure is still pretty uber anyway and more useful in raid situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Disinfecting Aura has been changed (yet again) on Test.<br />
<br />
Cast time lowered to 2.5 - same as PB<br />
Mana Cost dropped from 150 to 100 - same as PB<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Talisman of Alacrity has had its AE range increased from 0 to 60 - exactly what it should have been.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you have Pure Blood in your spell book, you won't be able to mem it since it is no longer a Shaman castable spell.</div></div><hr />
