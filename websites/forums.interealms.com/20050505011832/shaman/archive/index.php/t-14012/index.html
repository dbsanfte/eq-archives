<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just out of curiosity, what is the nature of spells when you zone?  I know that when you debuff or dot something, eventually you see a message that says that it has worn off.<br />
<br />
But if you cast it and zone out and zone back in, the spell is still there, but you don't get the message anymore.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that the spell doesn't belong to you anymore when you zone out and back in?<br />
<br />
If so, does that mean you can Breath/Pox/Plague something, zone out, zone in, and Breath/Pox/Plague it again, stacking with yourself?<br />
<br />
This sounds like an exploit of course.  I'm just really curious about the inner workings of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I haven't done a lot of experimenting in the area, but I think it leaves the debuffs and strips the agro and DoTs.  You can check it for yourself, if you're curious, but roots, malXX line, and slows will hold, as will some others like cripple, etc.  You may still get the message that XX has worn off if you zone back in and wait.  I've had it happen to me.  However, even if you don't get the message, the mobs will still show those effects.<br />
<br />
As to the DoTs, the last time I can remember zoning out after dotting was back in Kael when I was trying to get faction by turning in d0rf heads.  I had dotted the militia captain down to about 5%, refreshed my dots and rooted, then zoned out and back in.  He was still rooted right there, but was full health and undotted.<br />
<br />
I can't offer any experiences in PoP or LoY.  I will suggest you be careful experimenting, as people are gonna be grumpy if you start parking mobs at ZI/ZO points!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that once you get out of range of the mob it tends to regen faster then all of your dots combined.  I was duoing in PoV the other night with my necro friend and we had about 5 or 6 dots stacked and if we accidently ran to far aggro kiting the mob would regen up at an incredible rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, as long as the mob is still agro on something (say a duo partner), it is still fighting so it doesn't have resting regen.  The distance regen thing was a bug which they supposedly fixed recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, resting regen is phenomenal.  If you outrun the critter while it's still dotted and you go out of agro range, the second it's near enough its spawn point to stop walking, the resting regen kicks in.<br />
<br />
It's still mad at you, but you're not in its awareness radius, and it is &quot;resting.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One time, the guild was trying to kill that guy in Grieg that can sometimes drop the very nice RGC cleric thingie.  He was carrying his DA hammer and we wanted to kill him so he would spawn again, this time hopefully with the RGC item.<br />
<br />
Since the guy has a DA hammer, it's very important for him NOT to hit anybody, since when that mob has DA he can still hit players and it lasts for a very long time.<br />
<br />
We generally used a system of snare/root dotting which was pretty fun.  I found out that I couldn't dot and then zone to remove aggro since it also removed the dot.  (at least, I think that's the way it went, it's been a long time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zoning (or dying) does not remove DoTs or Debuffs.  It only removes your agro, the DoTs are still there.  I have two accounts, and I can put a DoT on the mob and zone out and still watch with my wizard that the mob is still DoT'd and debuffed (still slowed/rooted).<br />
<br />
As for being able to stack the spells... not sure.  You would have to watch the rate that the mob drops before and after you cast to see if the rate of drop increases or stays the same, if it increases then they stack, if it stays the same then you just ended up over writing yours.</div></div><hr />

I've never heard about this and I'd assume it would an exploit(staking two of -your- same dots that is...not what Jaradis is taking about)...one thing you'd hae to keep in mind with trying it though isif your previous dot did 51% of the damage...your mob would poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All you do is you drop off the hate list. Thus you will not receive any message when your DoTs wear off, yet they still do their damage and more importantly they are still &quot;yours&quot; in regards to stacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Standard strategy in pvp. Dot someone up and zone (or even better, they run to the zone themselves). After zoning your dot ownership is cleared, and the dots will do 100% pve damage instead of 66% pvp damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PLing a low-level twink in DSP, I would pull 4-5 mobs, root them all, epic them all, and zone into Sanctus Seru while the twink tagged all mobs.  Epic would start killing them just after I zoned, twink got all the credit.  I'd zone back out and epic dot was still killing mobs, twink still getting all the credit.  The DoT did not go away and was not credited to me.  However, the mobs still had aggro on the twink.  Based on all this, I believe the DoT stays if the mob has aggro on anything, and does not &quot;belong&quot; to you - but I'm not sure what would happen if I threw the same DoT on there again.  I would hope the game would not allow it, but you never know until you try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I cannot attest to being able to stack with your own DoTs after zoning, however, the DoTs do remain on the mob after you zone/die.  Just ask the Great Sapprophyte.... oh wait, you cant.  It's dead.  During my first solo attempt (to get my Remove Curse spell) on the big shroom I died, but managed to get off a DoT before I went down.  When I came back in, it was dead and I looted.  No one else was around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is how I powerlevel people. Pull 1 big mob, slow it..tank it until your twink can get in 1 hit for damage..then root the mob..dot to all hell and zone out before it dies. Boom insta-xp.</div></div><hr />
