<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mastahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks.<br />
I figured since everyone else was doing it, why not get a critique of my gear as well. Im a pvp server shammy with alternate blue diamond resist gear to swap out for fighting. I know I needa upgrade for boots/face/neck.. Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play on Vallon too Mastahh, but given that you are Torrent, I'm not even gonna mention which guild I am in, heh heh!<br />
<br />
Here are a few suggestions:<br />
1. Feet <br />
You dont have to be wearing the wolf fur booties to click the SoW effect - putting them in a free inventory slot works fine too, allowing you to equip a better boot. Maybe Tribal War boots, or better still, Wolfcaller boots<br />
<br />
2. Finger<br />
The trusty 6AC 65hp ring is getting past its use by date. Circled toe bones are the obvious upgrade, but you may wish to consider a valorium ring of gallantry. There is also a really nice ring dropping in LoY, but i cannot remember the name of it<br />
<br />
3 Chest.<br />
The JB breastplate is good, but frankly, there are lots better out there, and your guild is perfectly capable of dropping either Rumblecrush for Wicked Mail or Derek for Vindi BP. You might even consider a Tae Ew Cahin tunic<br />
<br />
4. Ears:<br />
Pesonally, I think the Skull Charm is better than the Silver Hammer. Going to an Earring of the Solstice is also the obvious upgrade from Ivandyr's<br />
<br />
5 Face:<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians, Golem Jawbone, Mask of the Executioner<br />
<br />
6 Neck:<br />
Amulet of insight, Tracking Wolf Collar, Worm Eaten Skull Charm<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas for ya</div></div><hr />
