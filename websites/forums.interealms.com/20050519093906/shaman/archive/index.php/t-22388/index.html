<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw this thread over on the BL's site which is nice as you get LOC's and # of wins to max.<br />
<br />
But look at what he says:<br />
<br />
Once you have completed the the required adventure wins per theme, hail Barstre Songwearver in East Commonlands. He will tell you to go see Chaenz Abella (the raid recruiter) who is standing just east of Barstre there in the EC camp. <br />
<br />
If your Adventure Stone is not augmented into an item, then just hand it to Chaenz Abella and he will reward you with the emblem. However if your Adventure stone is being used in an item you will have to remove and destroy it. Purchase a Slot 1 Solvent from the Magnus there in EC to remove the Augment. <br />
<br />
Then walk over to Chaenz Abella and say &quot;Emblem&quot; he will award you for your efforts with the &quot;Wayfarers Brotherhood Emblem&quot; augment. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Wayfarers Brotherhood Emblem <br />
magic item lore item no drop augmentation <br />
Augmentation Type: fits in all slot types. <br />
WT:0.0 Size:tiny <br />
<br />
*AC 10, All Stats +10, All Saves +10, Mana +100, HP +100  <br />
<br />
Ok- but I got news for ya - my charm is better than that now - &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Is he saying that once you max wins - you can get said Emblem and then of course get your green stone back?<br />
<br />
So you not only have a &quot;maxxed charm&quot; (Depending on your planar progression (I couldv'e sworn my charm got &quot;something&quot; when I gained a couple of planes access)) but ALSO have this emblem to add to your gear as you see fit ?<br />
<br />
Inquiring minds want to know!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Would help to include the thread I suppose :)  :<br />
