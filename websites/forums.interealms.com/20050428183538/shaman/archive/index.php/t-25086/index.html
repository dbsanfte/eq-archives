<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRYHILL01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been running around looking for the &quot;hidden&quot; cave to get the regeant bag for 3 hours.... Ive been up and down the road and all through the gulch... Ive read the posts that shows that its on top of the plateau...but I cant find it at all.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there thats done this quest that can tell me exactly how to find where the cultists are? and how to get to them?<br />
<br />
tks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tolgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a bridge that crosses a river between Barrens and Durotor, at that bridge travel south along the eastern side of the river until you get to the mountains. Right where the mountains and river meet there is a small 'spirit' stone that marks where the hidden path leads up the mountain. The path is narrow and winds back and forth up the mountain and Telf is near the top along the path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From Razor Hill head out like your going to Otown but veer to the right instead of heading down the ravine. You will come out above the ravine and pass a little house with an orc farmer inside. Continue along the edge and you will come to the hidden cave to your right, it will have 3 burning blade thugs outside. In relation to the ravine its right above the fairy section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bascially from razor hill start going northeast. When you get to the ravine with harpies DO NOT JUMP down but continue on the edge. As you keep going northeast you will see a cave opening in the distance. The thugs drop nothing you need but the casters there do. it's a fairly common drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck this quest was awesome i loved the view u get when you get to the top of the hidden path. You see all the land all around you it was breathtaking. Btw be ready to heal yourself/use a potion for the fight with the elemental to complete the quest cause he hits pretty hard.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget to hiit a shaman trainer to get the OTHER &quot;nova&quot; fire totem. Does aoe damage.<br />

And larryhill - you think YOU were frustrated.  The reagent bag drop used to be in the cave near Skull Rock.  When I created a new shaman to play with my guildmates during the stress test, I killed stuff in there for like 2 levels looking for that stupid bag until a very nice fellow shaman pointed out this entirely new cave in the hills above Razorhill to me.   :eek: Ouch!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hahaha yes, I did exactly the same thing.  Spent like two hours running around that cave swearing to myself until I decided enough was enough and went exploring.  Took a while, but I found the right cave eventually.  Guess my l33t beta infos were more of a hindrance than a help  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Water totem isn't that bad.  Everyone whines about getting the water from Ashenvale because of the elementals surrounding the well.  They are around level 23 - 24 but are great exp!  The casters have like no hitpoints and are cake at level 20.  I think everyone just tries to run through them without killing anything and get owned by all the casters nuking them.  Just clear a path slowly and the quest is cake, although there is a lot of running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LARRYHILL01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tks for all the info.. Im on the water totem now at level 20 and got owned by the water elementals....<br />
<br />
Not sure where I should start clearing from ... the logical place is the house by the lake but the damn nasty DEs are all over the place... any suggestions on what part of the lake to start at to clear to the middle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think you're in the wrong place LARRY.  I assume you're filling the &quot;blue bag&quot; in Ashenvale? There are no water elementals at the correct location - only those big ugly swampthing-like beasts.  If you're at Lake Mystal (or something close to that) you need to go further west to the next lake.<br />
<br />
Oh, and those DEs are actually NEs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just finished the water totem last night and i must say it was the most annoying quest EVER. I hated the running around. Ok i had ghost wolf by that point but DAMN. Back and forth a million times. And finally when i got to the last part i went nuts tryign to find the place where the spirts were. <br />
For those doing the water totem quest: The place in silverpine where you have to fight the spirits for the last part is found BEHIND the sepulcher (to the west). So go north of sepulcher and west to the coast and run along the quest south until you get behind sepulcher. Stay on the coast do not try to climb the mountains. You will eventually see the shaman rock. JEEZ. Wasted 2+ hours on this quest runnign here and there ugh :(<br />
<br />
<br />
And to add to that the first water totem we get is not ALL that great. I am sure it gets better tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had no problems with the water totem.<br />
It's just a lot of wandering around.<br />
The quest says the shrine is on the coast west of Sepulcher, so I just went around the mountains to the coast and found the place in about 5 mins.<br />
<br />
And ya, the water totems aren't that hot for the most part.<br />
Mana regen totem is most useful when you do instance dungeons for group mana regen.<br />
Poison cure totem is useful as well when you fight things like snakes and spiders that poison.</div></div><hr />

Lots of questions answered - lots of fun and adventure spoiled.  Use at your own discretion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if you thought water totem was easy, wait till you do wind. basically just have to find the cow and hail her :). I haven't bought any of the wind spells yet, so can't comment on their usefulness</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ooo - good news on wind!  I haven't done it since closed beta when I hit level 30 (August).  At that time, the intention was to make the quest more difficult (along the lines of the water totem) - is it still just finding the quest-giver in 1000 Needles?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Is it my imagination or can NPC Shaman have more than 1 totem out at a time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not only on npcs, players can have multiple totems out at the same time also.  I think you can have one of each type out.<br />
<br />
The air totem is still in thousand needles</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Is it my imagination or can NPC Shaman have more than 1 totem out at a time?<br />
Not uncommon to see 4 totems out at one time during the long fights Faern.  Between either 1. Stoneskin/tremor (green), 2. Mana/Health (blue) regen, 3. Searing/Magma Totem (orange) and 4. Windfury totel (grayish).  Normally you only see one or two though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Errrr, I'm pretty positive that when I try to drop my stoneskin and my taunt totem, at the same time, one of them poofs.  Gonna go do some experimenting, then, after reading this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Stoneskin and Taunt totems are both Earth totems, which is why one of them poofs.  You can only have one totem of each type out at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">U cant drop stoneskin and taunt... u can drop one of each of the 4 elements...stoneskin and taunt are both earth therefore u cant have both out, You mis read what he meant=) :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ahh, I thought stoneskin was earth.  Thanks folks, that should make instances and boss fights JUST a bit easier.<br />
<br />
Crucible just keeps on coming through for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">WoW, the fire totems rock big time. I heard someone say that they arent too exciting, but i bet they didnt know that once you get the fire totem, you can lay down a fire totem and a earth totem at the same time. <br />
I routinly have the totem that shoots at people going with either stoneskin or the attack buff. Good stuff man.<br />
<br />
btw, thank you all for your help on this, i got stuck and this thread definetly helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">WoW Shaman simply rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">no doubt, very exciting class... my favorite thing is getting killed and reincarnating, then finishing off whatever killed me :) that kicks ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Remember how casters sucked for the shaman class in eq because we had no way of interrupting them? Short of spending aa in virulent paralysis?<br />
<br />
Well now things have changed. I LOVE fightign casters. I wait till they cast then stun them and beat the hell out of their low hp caster azzes.<br />
<br />
Shamans own absolutely OWN. I have killed so many mages in duels they got no chances. I have killed priests too and warlocks. Warrirs however cause problems :( But hey i never play on a pvp server :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Agree Soul - with the interrupt spell (augmented by talents reducing mana/cooldown while increasing damage/crits) it's really almost unfair . . . if you can get in close.  ;) <br />
<br />
The warrior fight is a different animal and involves a lot more self healing, a potion (health or mana depending) and the hope that the warrior's crit rate isn't too high.  If it is, I have relied on the reduced Wolf Form casting talents to &quot;come back another day.&quot;  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Heh &quot;live today. Fight tomorrow&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Edit: I am not going to spend any points into the shorter cast time of ghost wolf. While one second is definately appealing I will most likely never use this spell after i get my horse at level 40 and I am more than halfway to 40. I am puttign all the relevant shock spell points in (shorter recast lower mana more crits) then goign all out enchancement. I already got the reduced cast on heals 5/5.<br />
 If i have any room left i will try and spend soem more in healing. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I put the 2 points into the Improved Ghost Wolf talent.  I plan to respec after I get a faster mount.  Untraining all my talents only cost 1 gold the first time you do it.  I believe price jumps to 5 gold if you want to unlearn your talents a second time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">does a mount break root effects and such?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You can still be snared and such while riding on a mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The problem with mounts is they take so darned long to &quot;cast&quot; (at least they did in Beta).  Has that been shortened?  Previous casting time was around 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Also, you had to &quot;dismount&quot; to fight.  Still true?  Escaping a fight by horseback was simply not doable in Beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I'm definitely spending my shaman's talent points on the fun, agressive (and faster wolf cast) talents, because respec is going to be cheap, considering the kind of money that'll be available to me later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yep yep, horsey takes about 3 sec to cast.  Trying to escape by casting horsey while getting beat on is still not an option.  Using Improved Ghost Wolf form is with the 1 sec cast.  I will miss those quick get-a-ways when have to respec.<br />
<br />
You can not fight while mounted, nor can you fight while in ghost form.  You must remove either to cast a spell, fight, or use a consumeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You can not fight while mounted, nor can you fight while in ghost form.  You must remove either to cast a spell, fight, or use a consumeable.<br />
Not completely true.  You can fight in wolf form, but only melee (no spell casting).  You fight with the DPS of the weapon you have equipped, plus any damage adds you may have buffed it with (like rockbiter).  Additionally, if you're pre-buffed with lightning shield, you will still get the three damage rounds from that during a fight against a melee or archer opponent.  Otherwise, I agree with your statement.<br />
<br />
As a side note, you can also loot and skin while in wolf form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">And harvest herbs - I'm assuming mining would work, then, too.  It's a real treat for getting up hills for those hard-to-reach herbs, or ducking behind/between pathing critters to snatch up flowers.  I'm not very deep into the tree, but those 2 points are easily the most noticeable.<br />
<br />
I'm interested to hear what kinds of other talents people get excited about later on.</div></div><hr />
