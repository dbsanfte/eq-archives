Shammy Hammer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10400)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eh? My understanding is that it was dropped off a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got one of these last week. Dropped off a named brown Tae Ew in the 4 corners at bottom of Archon pyramid. Fun toy but the proc is only about 3 tics long not enough to make or break a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i saw one of these drop in 4c last week ... the item was and  still is tradeable  ... <br />
<br />
it seems when the new CT went live majority of loots were no drop .. since then VI changed it  /shrug<br />
<br />
so yes it is possible to find it on a merchant .. but um good luck daddy-o</div></div><hr />
