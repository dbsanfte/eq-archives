<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried the primal reptile room while he was down. exp seemed kinda nice, would be better with a nec partner. Yellow ones ran faster than SoW it seemed, which would be bad. Didn't get to spend much time here, but I'm definitely gonna have to go back for BIC pieces.<br />
<br />
anyone else tried this out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">have done this with a necromancer partner, the exp is as good as fennin tables for the most part and the mobs die faster.  the only problem is that the primal reptile has to be down, and also if you kite around in the pit the bugs tend to warp rather badly.  usually 5-8% a kill duo, a lot more solo but as an sk would take me forever to solo those heh.</div></div><hr />
