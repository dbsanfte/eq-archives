<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if they are, or is there any way toget faction up ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, not KoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Woot Thanks again fellow trolly : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To expound on what my learned green friend said :)<br />
<br />
The outpost in OT is pretty much all on Venril Sathir faction. Venril Sathir is a Undead Iksar Dude (UID). You will see lots of UIDs around Kunark :)<br />
<br />
You can trash your VS faction (and become KOS in the outpost) by hunting in several zones in Kunark, including:<br />
<br />
Timorous Deep (the ogres)<br />
Charasis (aka Howling Stones)<br />
Kaesora<br />
Karnor's Castle (Venril himself hangs out here)<br />
<br />
There is only one way known to raise VS faction - that's to hand in 4 sarnak war braids to Captain Rottgrime, who lives in the outpost. You need to be at least non-KOS to do this quest. That means if you lower your faction so far that you are KOS, there is no way back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killing Kunark dragons also raises VS faction I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just dont fight in Karnor's Castle or in Howling Stones, both of those places will destroy your faction with the outpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Which is a shame, cos people keep telling me that HS is a nice zone for high 50s.<br />
<br />
However, never having fought in KC, except for one trip to kill VS's remains, is a blessing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OT faction is very worth trashing.  With spiritstones being widely available and PoK ports, the only reason to hold on to OT faction is nostalgia.<br />
<br />
Access to HS and KC is great to have during your 50's.  HS is a really fun zone with needed quest components if you plan on doing the Cudgel or Spirit Wracked Cord quests.  The exp there is great from 50-55 and the loot is still useful/saleable. <br />
<br />
Kaesora is a great training zone for it's level, but finding people willing to go there for exp can be a chore.  I would even go so far as to say that it is one of the hardest zones for appropriate levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Naagruz -<br />
I bets any troll asking about da OT faction is young enuff to hunt in OT.  in dat case they needs to hold on to da faction for a bit.  for da over 50 crowd, ya make a gud point.<br />
<br />
and on da hunting KC idea, it is only the big dogs dat hang out closest to the zone in/out that hurt VS faction.  nothing elsxe in the zone hurts Vs faction.  Even killing VS or his remains don't hit yer VS faction.  so - if ya got a group and can drag em past the train tracks to do some serious hunting, KC will not hurts da VS faction fer da Outpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can easily use OT for all it is worth and DO the sarnak braid turn-ins because they are good exp THEN trash your faction when you don't need it anymore.  Use it and Lose it.<br />
<br />
OT golems are a fine source for Tirgir's and Bane of Nife later in life.<br />
<br />
I have kept my OT faction on my OSK and will keep it simply because the hammer is pretty durn useful for melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have no idea if this changes as you level, but my Iksar Monk was whacked several times while trying to get on the boat in OT.<br />
<br />
I finally solved the issue by swimming around the fort wall and boarding the boat as it left the dock but the experience was generally unpleasant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only one more annoying thing to consider... our 50+ spells that are vendor bought/trade-in quest are either via FV or OT... Since you troll .. I'm willing to bet FV hates you before you even thought about defiling their women... So either stock up on your spells prior to trashing VS factions or find a friend to help ya in the end (ie a busty barb in da back pocket can be quite rewarding)<br />
<br />
Course.. bazaar spell prices kinda makes all this a moot point!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Spell turn-in results are droppable so you can mule them out if needed, but the Bazaar usually has all the turn-ins for cheaper than L50 vendor spells.</div></div><hr />
