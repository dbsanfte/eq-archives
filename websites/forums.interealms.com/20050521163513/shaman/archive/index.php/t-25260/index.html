<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there is a lot of uproar about server merging and what not but I had some ideas that could potentially keep people in EQ longer. I know Sony would never do it but I think it'd be great. After reading through a bunch of &quot;eq memories&quot; threads it really brought back the old days and reminded me what I missed most about the game.<br />
<br />
What if instead of simply merging servers to bring back populations, why don't they use those extra servers to offer different ruleset servers to appeal to different gamers. I know there are already a few out there but most are simply some form of PVP and then of course FV which is referred to as the &quot;no drop&quot; server. This has been talked about before, but I think a &quot;classic&quot; server would really do well and if it was that popular they could open up more. However the ideas for this server aren't simply opening up a new server and only having old zones, it'd be more of a  natural progression of the game that so many have missed. Bear with me a minute.<br />
<br />
So many players started EQ after one or two expansions came out and never enjoyed the game how it was originally designed and implemented. Yes there was a lot wrong back then, yet our fondest memories of EQ were during that time because absolutely nothing was trivialized. There were no fungi tunics to twink with and you had to earn everything the hard way. Nowadays a new player can earn a few plat and buy things in the bazaar that they never could have had otherwise and trivialize older content even at the lowest of levels. Not to mention what new player is going to hang out in unpopulated old zones that have horrible risk/reward factors and low exp?<br />
<br />
What they need to do is introduce a server that sets EQ back to the classic era with no expansions available. This time through a lot of bugs are fixed, classes more balanced at these levels and most of the exploits are gone. Let people play through the game in this way, with a fresh economy, no bazaar to go find twink items, no Paludal caverns to power lvl in, no PoK/Scions/Firepots/etc... to travel with. The game should stay like this until certain flags are met. Perhaps the killing of Vox/Naggy, killing of the gods for Fear/Hate/Air and whatever else. And because there are always those out there with too much time on their hands their should be more requirements. Perhaps these mobs need to be killed more than once, and by different players. The same guild doesn't get credit for killing each time. Once you've been flagged for killing a dragon/god then doing so thereafter won't help advance the server. However other guilds/players killing it will. There could also be a minimum time limit so even if the players are more resourceful than once thought, they'd still have to wait a few months. Yes those that rush in and get 50 asap will be bored, but then why are you rushing? Stay on your old server and load up on AA's or something.<br />
<br />
Think about it though, you're stuck in the old world with no benefits of the newer expansions so killing those gods and dragons would take time and a lot of effort. Then once the flags are finally all completed then the first expansion, Kunark, would be unleashed and a whole new set of flags are required to move to Velious. Kunark would take a long while to complete no doubt as their would be many flags to overcome and having an elite few people that power level all day won't help to progress it themselves. It requires a greater portion of the player base, casual non-hardcore, to get to these points.<br />
<br />
There are so many details that'd have to be ironed out, but to me and a lot of others this would be a dream come true. Trying to play classic EQ on your own with the lure of uber items and such is too hard for guilds to upkeep. However playing EQ the way it was designed again would be so much fun for old players and new players alike who never got to enjoy it back then.<br />
<br />
Revamped zones could be put back to their original state until such time that a flag is set to advance it. Paw could go back to it's original low level state and many would go just to experience it. Then after so much time has passed they could release the first revamp with the Tech Mas Gnolls, etc.. The Hole and Paineel would open up later on, etc...<br />
<br />
Imagine being able to yield Ykesha's, FBSS, EBBP like you used to and still be uber on the server. Imagine Lower Guk being full again, Mistmoore trains, Mino axes being the weapon of choice, etc... This time all the things that unbalanced the game wouldn't be there to unbalance it anymore. The weaker classes would have a better time through, the uber classes back then wouldn't be as powerful as remembered. No more &quot;pre-nerf&quot; items because they wouldn't exist. I would love progressing through Everquest once again and reliving the days I camped for the PGT, BBC and doing all of the Sol Ro armor quests. Which by the way wouldn't be available right away, maybe a month or so after they'd release that zone.<br />
<br />
I know it would never happen but I think if Sony actually did this it'd be so popular that they'd end up starting it up on different servers for those that missed it the first time. Once they hit a certain number of players they'd start another classic eq progression server. I know I'm dreaming but if someone ever got that damn emulator up and running and had the knowhow and drive to do this I'd pay money to play on the damn thing. Those that never got to experience EQ in this form would start to appreciate where all of us old timers are coming from and understand why we had to camp guards and NPC's because there weren't unlimited dark blues like their was once Kunark came out.<br />
<br />
Anyways I'm rambling but it just seems like it could work if Sony would put a little effort into it. They have the hardware, they just need a small team to get things in order and figure out the rules and how and when to progress the server. It'd give people an option to try something different and if it worked then they could do other servers on different ideas or rulesets. Ultima successfully launched a &quot;hard&quot; server with stricter rulesets and EQ could do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry, but I have to disagree. The problem with this theory is that all those zones have been WELL solved for years. There is nothing &quot;fresh&quot; and nostalgia can only carry you so far. <br />
<br />
And no, the solution is NOT to &quot;re-vamp&quot; the old world zones. I want new content, not old content polished up and passed off as &quot;an upgrade&quot;. I would much rather see any development resources SOE is putting into EQ1 going toward NEW content. <br />
<br />
The best example I can think of is the evolution of the Spell Distribution system. First we had a vendor-dropped combination. PoP gave us the &quot;turn in&quot; idea, where players could get spells for their class by turning in dropped items to a specific NPC. PoP also expanded the research system, creating a solid market for dropped research items. <br />
<br />
LoY introduced a couple Quested spells (I wish they would do more with this, myself), and LDoN gave us a different form of &quot;purchasable&quot; spells. Both very decent ideas in the overall evolution of the process. <br />
<br />
Then comes OoW, which has, IMHO, the best distribution method for spells BY FAR. The idea of making the runes themselves tradable, and NOT the spells seems simplistic, but it absolutely streamline the whole process. No more getting dupes. No more hoping you will get that &quot;One Last spell you need&quot;. And making the uppermost level spells no-drop at the rune level also works. It allows those spells to be GUARENTEED to go to the person in the group who needs a spell, and not /random with someone who has all his spells selling the result. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I dont think the idea would be &quot;sustainably popular&quot;. Sure, a lot of people would check it out, but eventually, they would get bored with content that has already been solved, and go back to the old characters. Besides that, I think many would rather go to WoW or EQ2 than re-play EQ1 from the beginning again. I know I have absolutely zero interest in EC-N Ro-Oasis-Guk, or Lava-Najena-Sol A-Sol B. None whatsoever.</div></div><hr />
