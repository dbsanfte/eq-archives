<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think there was a thread similar to this in the past but I want to ask your guys opinion on something... Today I was playing my alt rogue and grouping in Karnors (I know, I know...) and was grouped with a all &quot;new&quot; players, as in none were alts or twinks.  The shaman in the group was severely under equipped, even by newbie standards and was just doing things that irked me like slowing incoming mobs before agro is established, using individual str and dex buffs in place of HoS, rooting runners (we had a ranger for snare), etc.  I seriously considered trying to educate him on some better habits to get into as a shaman but I didn't want to get him torqued off... there was also a slight language barrier as his English wasn't very good.<br />
<br />
  My question to you guys is this, do you think its PC to tell someone that you have a main Shaman of XX level and start telling them what they are doing wrong or should you just generally keep your mouth shut?  I gave the guy a couple pointers while we were playing but I was generally busy pulling and managing agro (eww)  And I really didn't want to come across as a &quot;know-it-all&quot; because there is still a LOAD of stuff I don't know.<br />
<br />
 Let me know what you think...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and as an example of how under equipped they were, Jarcrap Gauntlets dropped and the cleric won them to replace his Splitpaw, and the shaman swapped out his banded gauntlets for them... Level 51 Shaman and Level 50 Cleric (*cringe*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wel, if it was me, I probably would have just sent him a quick tell saying what was annoying me and leave it at that. The last thing you want to do is humiliate the guy in front of the other group members. <br />
<br />
<br />
I just have a few other thingys to say about this post.<br />
<br />
What's so bad about being under equipped? I was still wearing leather at 56 and I took pride in the fact that everything I have I earned myself. Fact is: Items don't make the player good or bad. I've seen better equipped shaman than me have no clue what they're doing. *shrug* <br />
<br />
Slowing before agro is established is what I've always done in &quot;exp&quot; groups. (Root is a wonderful tool for allocating agro - learn it and use it ;) ) Fact is, nothing in KC is gonna do much damage when they're slowed anyway - I think the guy based on what you've said did the right thing :)<br />
<br />
To be honest, people have to accept that just because people don't do things their way it's not wrong. Give him pointers by all means, if he's not endangering the group then let him do what he wants to do - or if you can't deal with it leave the group. Simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I'd have sent a tell like &quot;Hi, my main's a 53rd Mystic.  I notice you prefer slowing before agro's established.  It's starting to distract me, could you wait just a sec before slowing?&quot;  or some such...<br />
<br />
Being an avid alchemist--sad, but true--I went into KC for the same reason I bet he's in there... Jarsath armor, in my early to mid-40s.  Aside from the helm, it looks good, has some decent stats, and once actually belonged on folks in their 50s.  Aye, there's tons better out there, but I never have cash.<br />
<br />
I am, however, a bit sad that he swapped banded for 'paw gloves.<br />
<br />
As for slowing, well, I'm right up front with the melee folks.  I'll slow the critter as soon as he's nearing melee range.  Yeah, he'll get PO'd at me.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol whats so wrong about switching banded for paw gloves. I am using them at 49 LOL.  I am kinda hapy with them, well maybe.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anything but paw gloves, anything.  You might as well be carrying a Testament of Vanear.<br />
<br />
If you are, don't tell me, for the love of god.<br />
<br />
*eye twitch*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can see where you are coming from Uloff, but with the abundance of equipment options nowadays compared with just 6 months to a year ago when some of us made level 50 =|.  Even dumping alot of money into alchemy, most shaman now days should be able to afford JB armor with just an hours time killing giants in Rathe Mntns.  I don't know... maybe I'm more picky about my equipment.  <br />
<br />
  The part I was really cringing about was the splitpaw gloves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I for one have never done giants in RM for pp. I've never camped an item for the express purpose of selling it for cash - I have better things to do with my time online. I can tell you that some of the best people I've ever played with have had sub par items.  In fact most of the guild I am in have done their 60 levels with gear which would make most of the people on these boards cringe. BUT, these guys constantly amaze me with what they (and we) achieve - because they *know* their class well. <br />
<br />
Don't judge a book by it's cover, accept that people have different ideals than you, accept that people play the game for different reasons than you, learn that just because people aren't as good at something as you it doesn't mean they shouldn't be doing it - you'll certainly be much happier if you do.<br />
<br />
BTW, I apologise for the agro. This happens to be a pet peeve of mine. Back around lvl 53 I responed to a call to join a group looking for a shaman. When I got the the camp I was invited into the group - about 10 seconds later a lower level &quot;more uber&quot; shaman turned up and I was asked to leave the group because I was missing &quot;essential&quot; shaman equipment. (He had a JBB, I didn't.) Ironically, this shaman got the whole group killed because he thought that his time would be best spent nuking (JBBing) than slowing and healing. Each to his own I guess - but theres some insight into where you could be headed when judging people on equipment ;)<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can see why you are bitter... =(<br />
<br />
  I would never do something like that, though I might rummage around in my pack and offer you equipment upgrades to buy... hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I usually keep my mouth shut (in-group, anyway) unless they're doing something really dumb, like a shaman not slowing at all, or a chanter not tashing, or something.  If someone fails to do their classes basic job, I'll usually just ask them to, outright.  &quot;Hey Shaman-x, can you please Slow the mobs as soon as I have aggro, or sooner?&quot;  This usually either a) gets me slowed mobs, or b) gets a discussion going about why Shaman-x doesn't think that's such a hot idea.  It's kind of shocking how many higher level (40+) shamans don't understand the power of Slow, but often once you explain it from a tanks perspective, the light bulb goes on and everythings groovy.<br />
<br />
Speaking from my own perspective as a shaman, I'm more likely to tune out unsolicited advice if it's preceded by the words &quot;My main is a lvl xx shaman and...&quot;, so I usually don't bring it up.<br />
<br />
As far as equipment goes, again, unless it's directly affecting the group in a bad way, I stay quiet about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Speaking from experience with this.. . . if you must tell them you have a shaman main, please do it in a tell so they aren't needlessly embarassed.  Your suggestions will be a lot better received as well, since the pressure is off.  <br />
<br />
As far as gear and shamans go . . . I've had better experiences with all sorts of geared shamans with my monkie twink.  It matters more how they play, if they have basic skills down . . . <br />
root parking, when to slow, how to cannidance, what buffs are important (i hate it when i get dex, agil, stam, ac, and then finally haste and HoS)  HoS and Haste . . I'm good to go . . .really.  <br />
<br />
When I get up the interest to play my monkie these days and I group in KC or some other ungodly place, I'll often run into this sorta thing.  Sometimes the shaman really knows his ****.  However, I've run into just the opposite.  people who **** up time and time again, then get all pissy when i make suggestions.  <br />
I boot those people from the group.  I don't have time to babysit.  <br />
I'll teach, but I'll not put up with attitudes from idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Me usually keeps me own council.  If sumpthin in a groop's really annoyin me, me'll leave before sayin anythin.  Dis be real rare fer me tho coz me be in guild groops 95% of da time.  On da udda hand (ODUH, hehe), me will offa advice in da form of questions or suggestions, ratha dan directions.  Fer example, if me is grooped wif a shammy dat never winces, is alwayz at full health, and sez &quot;OOM&quot; a lot, me'll ask 'em (in a tell) &quot;Heya brudda, duz yu use a macro ta cannidance or duz ya do it manually?&quot; ta which dem usually reply &quot;what is cannidance?&quot;  Similarly, &quot;Which root duz yu use fer root-parkin?&quot; fer shaman who run 'round screamin fer da melees ta &quot;get it off me!&quot;<br />
<br />
In my experience, it be best ta never edumacate sumwun unless dem asks wot dem be doin wrong or preaches sumthin patently false.  It also very dangerous ta assume dat one is always right.  Fer example, like Uloff abuv, in exp groops me slows as da mob cums in and positions meself so dat da mob lands next to da melees.  Me's just found dat dis be most efficient coz da damage frum five unslowed seconds (or 10+ wif resists) can be huge.  Also, if me were in a groop wif a dedicated snarer and da mob started runnin, me'd root immediately.  Snare usually put on *before* da mob starts runnin.<br />
<br />
Da main ting tho is dat peeps play fer fun.  Bein told how ta play yer class ain't fun, and if yu ain't havin fun in a groop, it probly best ta look elsewhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cortez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I started a cleric a while back because my guild has a big need for them...was grouped in LOIO and the monk told me that he had a lvl 56 cleric as a main (seems EVERYBODY has a high level character of some kind) and he told me that I should make sure to heal the puller because he took damage from the mob as he brought it back to us. I just bit my tongue and did what was needed but finally his constant spamming in group chat &quot;Heal the puller! Heal the puller! Heal the puller!&quot; finally got to me. I calmly explained that my main is a lvl 52 Shaman who has, on occasion, actually done some healing...and I also have a lvl 47 Shadow Knight so I know a little bit about pulling too. He just kept spamming so I left the group...life is too short - my cleric now groups only with guildies who realize that I know who to keep them alive. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
BTW, I almost always slow the mob right away...know that might change in a few levels but it's never seemed to bother me - especially in KC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">everyone has different playstyles and not everyone has the time to have what you might consider good gear. good gear to them may be full banded or leather, who knows, we all play at our own pace.<br />
<br />
offering suggestions about there class isn't wrong, just don't do it publicly where it may make them, or in some cases you , look bad.<br />
<br />
in an exp group i slow a mob as soon as it is in casting range, even if it isn't in sight yet and the puller still isnt in camp yet. never had a problem, just have a slowed mob comin to camp. let others learn the game as they learn it, don't try to force your playstyle onto others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Was the guy having fun, that's what counts you know, let's /TELL him how to play and then send him here so he can become another whiney Shaman. :D<br />
<br />
Seriously if he was having fun with what equipment he has, which from the sound of it is almost comparable to mine, I'm still wearing a Lizard Scale cloak, why ruin it for him? I'm  proud of my Dark Ember which I got in my 30's with a friend and I use it to this day and the looted Tree Weave on my Warrior and his quested Wurmy and all the other crap I quested for or looted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've ran into this situation when playing my Monk and grouped with a shaman who was incapacitating instead of slowing and who was LOM all the time and was never caniing.<br />
<br />
I never said I had a shaman alt, I just asked questions of them.  And tried to not make them rude or accusatory.    I don't know if it was the right way to go about it or not, but I didn't want to be all like 'I know how to do this and you dont''.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmmm good topic.  I occassionally give advice in a pick-up group, but usually do so in group say.  I never thought about it much.  I always try to be polite and all.  If I do it ever again, I'll send a /tell.<br />
<br />
I always slow as soon as the mobs is in range.  If I get aggro, the tanks usually get it off me in a sec....I guess I always figured that the sooner I slow the mob, the better, since it means less healing of tanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't think giving advice is bad as long as it is done tactfully.  When I first started grouping I always felt lost because I didn't know what my part was.  Now that I am getting more group experience I think it is essential that the group work together to reach their common goal.  If someone is not doing their part or could be doing something better to help the group, I think letting them know as a /tell is just fine.  It could be that this guy just doesn't know his class very well yet.<br />
<br />
The other night I was in a group, fom, and tired of sitting on the sidelines so I started nuking.  Someone sent me a tell to let the Necro nuke and save my mana for healing and slows.  At first I was a little ticked, but when we got trained on and I our cleric left us, I had enough mana to keep us alive.  So I guess I was greatful for the advice and definitely learned from it.<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion, but I for one am always open to any advice someone can give me to enhance my game playing experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I usually will send a private tell to the person saying something like this, <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I have a xx shammy, if you have any questions or just want to talk, i'll listen. &quot;<br />
<br />
Sometimes I can offer real solid advice other times not.<br />
<br />
I think it just depends on your &quot;tone&quot; in the group, and the receptiveness of the shaman.<br />
<br />
There have been other times where I've been the shaman and peeps in my group will say, hey I've just started this shaman, can I get some advice on when to slow, root or what not.<br />
<br />
I've benefitted from learning from the more xp shaman, just as my monk has benefitted from her older brethren.<br />
<br />
The pt is its a game, and sharing of tactics and styles is important and can be done in a way that is both educational and fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The shaman in the group was severely under equipped, even by newbie standards <br />
1) nothing wrong with having crap equipment.  <br />
<br />
and was just doing things that irked me like slowing incoming mobs before agro is established, <br />
2) nothing wrong with slowing mobs before they arrive at camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
using individual str and dex buffs in place of HoS, <br />
<br />
3) Is it possible that the shaman didn't have HoS?  It's a moon spell, and if they are just 50 (and in Kunark) he might not even have the spell.<br />
 <br />
<br />
rooting runners (we had a ranger for snare), etc. <br />
<br />
4) rooting (inside a dungeon) is always better than letting them get away.<br />
<br />
My question to you guys is this, do you think its PC to tell someone that you have a main Shaman of XX level and start telling them what they are doing wrong or should you just generally keep your mouth shut?<br />
<br />
I would have sent him a tell and asked if they had HoS, and I would have discussed the rooting/snaring in groupsay...make sure the ranger knows that he needs to snare before they run, and then make sure the shaman understands that he doesn't need to root.  <br />
I wouldn't even mention the fact that you play a shaman...the things you are talking about aren't super-secret-shaman-sh*t...a good player of *any* class would know this stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I say nothing.<br />
<br />
I'm sure when I was learning my Shaman I did tons of things that would have annoyed the hell out of me now but I learned by making my own mistakes. Granted I think I had things pretty much figured out, the basics anyway, by the time I hit 40 but that doesn't make me better or worse then anyone else. <br />
<br />
I've played with numerous Shaman on my alts (and with my own) that did things that drove me up the wall. One's that dotted everything when they didn't live longer then 20 seconds, that blasted everything instead of healing, that didn't have root memmed, that didn't use slow at all, that had a Testament of Vanear because of the Wis (at level 54 *cry*) and I never said a word. <br />
<br />
It isn't my place to tell them how I would play or how I do play. I'm not the worlds most knowledgeable when it comes to playing a Shaman, none of us are. We figure out what works for us and we do that well, it just takes some longer then others to figure that out :)<br />
<br />
Oh, I slow on incoming too ;) But I tend to stand next to the tank anyway so it's not like the mob is going to go where it isn't supposed to. Besides, I'd rather it came straight at me slowed then straight for the casters sitting on their butts swinging at full speed :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by Jallail <br />
things that irked me like slowing incoming mobs before agro is established, ...... rooting runners (we had a ranger for snare)<br />
<br />
He was correct to slow incoming mobs before aggro is established and if there were runners, then the snarer was not doing their job and he was correct to root them.  As far as hos vs regular buffs, who cares?  Maybe he did not have Luclin.  Unless you had 14 buffs up it makes no difference except that he has to rebuff more often.  <br />
<br />
Waiting to establish aggro before slowing is something worth doing on the occasional raid caliber, high MR mob (these usually require a full debuff strategy anyway).  But pretty much only if you are short on clerics.  In 99 percent of situations, you slow everything that aggros the group/raid and do it as quickly as possible.  If the mob ping pongs as a result, that just means the shaman is not standing in the right place. - He should always be right behind the main tank.<br />
<br />
So I would say in this situation you should definitely *not* give unsolicited advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think advice about playing a class and equipment are two seperate issues. Example of how to play a class in group instead of tell. Twink warrior comes into a group one of the very few times ive ever grouped there. Was playing my wizard at the time and was just tired of soloing. Anyway he preceeds to tell the group countless times that he has X amount of hps and that the cleric should only us CH on him. Well the cleric had already been spending mana from before he got there so the he didnt feel he had the mana or needed to use CH. Ive never played a cleric so i dont know. All i know is the warrior was staying alive along with the rest of us but joe had to keep going on and on about it and it set a tense setting for all of us in the group and it broke up soon after. So i think if you feel the need to stay anything at the least do it in tell or bring it up in a question and dont harp on it. If need be than leave the group. Not saying anyway in these posts was doing that just an opinion from some things ive seen. <br />
<br />
     As for equipment i never say anything either way wether someone has really uber stuff or someone has less than uber stuff. My wizard had always had lesser stuff than my shaman had at the same lvls growing up. My wizard being my first i tried to earn everything on my own without a lot of browsing of websites to find stuff and to explore and earn my little bit of plat as i went lol. Not the best way to do it and also kept my stuff below par for a long time but it was how i wanted to play at the time and if someone had made comments about it i probably would of stung me. See i felt i could play my wizard very well even if my stuff sucked for a long time. So i still think the person playing the class is more important than what they are wearing. Finally to be totally honest ive been killed more in groups by an &quot;invincable twink&quot; than an under equipped charachter in my personal experience. Even back in oasis when the twink cleric was pulling adds instead of healing my monk who proceded to die not once but twice and this cleric was a guildies twink lol. I gave him hell for a long time and thats just one of the examples theres been more silly stuff of a twink doing to much. <br />
  <br />
     Finally just recently a friend of mine plays a cleric and he got passed from a group due to not having good enough equipment. Ive played my warrior and shaman with him and he is a very good cleric. I found that to be pretty mean not to mention how good a cleric he is and he got booted for someone who had better stuff yet might suck at playing. So anyway just my 2cents on the subject. Be nice if someone is screwing up at first , can always leave if need be and dont judge a class by its equipment. <br />
<br />
Sorrry if i rambled and have a good one, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm still wearing a banded mask :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yuck, i hate it when clerics do that.  Refuse to use complete heal i mean.  The uber-unslowable-but-doable-by-our-group mob is laying into our warrior like mad and hps are dropping rapidly but they dont use CH.  Instead they Divine Light until oom and then panic and gate.  Leaving me to mop up the mess.  I'd boot such a cleric in a heartbeat.  They are common enough lately for lots of groups to have one.  Plenty of clerics out there, plenty LFG even.  <br />
<br />
If I was the warrior in that group I'd just keep pulling nonstop.  If the cleric could keep up on heals without using CH, then no problem.  If he was oom in two fights tho, I'd tell him to start using that heal he was paying for by not being able to invis or snare or port or whatever.  <br />
<br />
It's the silly people I don't like to play with.  I'll rank them in order of most dislikable to slightly annoying. <br />
<br />
1.  The AFK player.  This guy or gal is permanently AFK only coming back often enough to give his next return ETA.  His contribution to the group is to suck exp and loot and claim surprise when you wipe.  <br />
<br />
2. The reckless player.  This guy charges in supremely confident in his gear and his abilities, trains the group with an enormous amount of mobs, and often causes a wipe.  This is the guy who is off &quot;pulling&quot; after you have 6 mobs in camp, all unmezzed.  Monks and necros are the worst offenders here, but some warriors I know are even worse.  <br />
<br />
3.  The clueless but defiant player.  This guy has no clue how to play his/her class but wants you to respect his/her &quot;playstyle&quot;.  He does a significant amount of things completely wrong.  Forgets to snare . . . every time.  Doesn't mem an evac.  Slows halfway thru a fight.  Is a wizard yelling OOM when the puller goes out to get another mob.  He's the guy who's not only untrained, he's untrainable, refusing suggestions and supporting his actions with comments like, &quot;I saw it on castersrealm.&quot;  <br />
<br />
4. The greedy player.  This guy/gal firmly believes that this group exists for the sole reason of providing him and his twinks with new gear!  He will claim NBG on stuff others could use too.  He will constantly talk about the possible drops the group might see and attempt to establish a claim for each one of them.  He'll ninja loot if not the Master Looter, and he'll piss and moan if he loses the roll on something he &quot;really wanted.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Those are the people I just hate grouping with.  Anyone care to add a &quot;class?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm not the type to say anything. I have been in groups where someone with a 60 shaman main has given me pointers and I've taken them and learned by their teachings. I've also been in a couple groups with another shamans (usually a level or 2 higher, maybe has epic) and gotten tells from them questioning some of my actions. The shaman's of the latter type want to nit-pick and boss you around a little. Not good.<br />
<br />
Actual examples - <br />
Uber shaman: &quot;You using regular root spell, right. The low level one?&quot;<br />
Raikor: &quot;Yep&quot;<br />
<br />
Uber shaman: &quot;Stop nuking, bro. I'm lom.&quot;<br />
Raikor: &quot;JBB )&quot;<br />
Uber shaman: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />

It's all about how you present your constructive criticism. I'm still an EQ newbie (less than 1 year) so I'm all for advice...If the advice doesn't fit my play style, then I won't use it, but most of the time it will improve my ability to make a good group even better.<br />
<br />
Don't judge a PC on their gear. Maybe he liked what he had on or he vowed to wear only dropped/self-crafted items. Maybe he was ignorant....his gear, his deal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Guess what he was doing just seemed wrong/semi-inappropriate at the time... looking back I guess it wasnt all that bad, though the slowing on incoming was without placement or anything + sitting immediately after slowing = mob ping pong.  The rooting thing I agree about runners but the ranger was snaring and the shaman rooting when then went into stationary run mode. He also rooted a mob to prevent it from being knocked in the water which really doesnt work... he learned about it though.  I'm not trying to say the guy was a really bad shaman or anything... I was just asking about the PC of offering advice and what people thought about it... I've seen a lot of good thoughts about it.  THanks for the input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, sitting right after you slow is dumb (unless you're doing the placement ;) ). I slow exp mobs ASRP. They usually come over and have a sissy slap fight with me, so I stand where we want the mob to end up. Stand there doing clever emotes at it for a little while and eventually the MT gets aggro; a bit later and you can sit if you need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree on the &quot;slow the mob right away&quot; method. But I'm prepared to be slapped AC wise and just canni until the mellees grab is off me (or root and step back if it gets too bad).  Rooting in KC is my prefered method too; yes, the mellee takes a couple of extra hits, but the risk that you have your snared mob meet a returning train from the entrance is minimized.  And I think (unless you are of vastely greater experience (min 10 levels) ) you should refrain from offering advice unless it really endangers the group.  I've been grouping with a guy who keeps pointing out his vast experience in my chosen class (his alt shm is 2 levels above mine), and it get's annoying to the point that I avoid grouping with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">1) I'd send a light hearted friendly tell.  If its recieved badly, appologise and let the guy fall flat on his face.<br />
2) slowing a mob before it gets to camp, in KC sure, why the hell not?  In OS/Kael/HoT then your an idiot and deserve to eat the exp loss.  Any dungeon with high damage (hard/fast hitting) mobs, or highly resistant mobs you need to wait.  Sure you can likely survive the onslaught with a good party or decent AC/HP total, but you're slowing down the party that has to bust a lung to keep you going.  I don't wait long, but I do wait till the MA gets a couple good shots in.<br />
3) poor equipment, who really cares?  All equipment does is raise potential.  Some shaman get too dependant on gear and lose their edge because they know they can get away with stuff.  I know some stupid shaman that are decked out like gods and play like putzes.</div></div><hr />

I've met level 45 shaman that knew more about their spells and abilities than some level 60 shaman.<br />
<br />
I've met level 60 shaman that were complete idiots.<br />

<br />
What's all this mean?  It means that giving advice is fine and dandy.  Stating that you have a level XX character as if that means you know what you're talking about, however, isn't.  I also agree that generally it's better to send a direct /tell with a sggestion or a question.  Unless they're doing something that is blatantly dumb or endangering the group, I try to keep my comments to others very minimal and only offer 'suggestions' or ask leading questions about ways that I 'think' might be better to do something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do decide to give advice have tact.  Don't bash people for having bad gear.  If you see a shaman with the testament of vaneer and the othmir fur cap...well, wait until they just get the crap beat out of them.  Then send them a tell.  Something light hearted and joking that sympathizes with them for getting beat on and offers advice without embarrassing them.   Tell them a story about how your shaman got the crap beat out of him all the time and then you decided you had to have HPs and AC on your gear.<br />
<br />
As far as slowing mobs on inc, I do it too.  All mobs that I fight that do not require malo are generally slowed before they get to camp.<br />
<br />
If you wanted HoS, you could have sent a tell and said - if you want to save time on me, all I need is Harness of Spirit, you don't have to do the individual buffs on me.<br />
<br />
If he doesn't have it, you could tell him where to get it.<br />

If the guy is rooting runners, at least he is semi-attentive.  Things like snare and rooting I bring up in group chat.  Personal advice I try to avoid but it is tells only.<br />

OMG yes they do. I had the misfortune of grouping with one of them in maidens the other day.<br />
<br />
SCENARIO:<br />
<br />
I buff the tanks (Warrior and 2 monks), there is also a mage, me and a cleric.<br />
<br />
I'm am Lom..so I start dancing. I have buffed myself and have casted regrowth.<br />
<br />
Cleric sitting on tush.. Me 1 bub of life left.. Using all mana for slows and speed for tanks, and regrowth.<br />
<br />
Me: hey um cleric can u heal me... he says why, heal yourself!<br />
<br />
I'm um if I do that then I can't slow/ and speed.. He goes hey your choice, don't cana then sit.<br />
<br />
I said do I look like a druid to you? Why would I sit?<br />
<br />
He goes I refuse to heal a healer.. <br />
<br />
DOH..<br />
<br />
So I say: sorry guys I refuse to group with a cleric that won't heal.<br />
<br />
So after mob dies, I leave.<br />
<br />
Cleric sends me a tell, you don't know how to play a shaman.<br />

I say ok fine, have a nice day.<br />
<br />
Tell me was I wrong? I'm looking for advice here. <br />
I've been canna dancing since level 24 and am pretty balanced on AC/ Wisdom.<br />
<br />
AC tends to be around 890 wisdom around 190. So I think I'm doing ok.<br />

4. The greedy player.  This guy/gal firmly believes that this group exists for the sole reason of providing him and his twinks with new gear!  He will claim NBG on stuff others could use too.  He will constantly talk about the possible drops the group might see and attempt to establish a claim for each one of them.  He'll ninja loot if not the Master Looter, and he'll piss and moan if he loses the roll on something he &quot;really wanted.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Luckily I haven't been grouped with to many strangers and we had to roll for some magic item. But once in awhile you get a real winner. Usually the greedy player is jumping up-n-down doing the pee-pee dance when the item is dropped and demands a roll. The leader tell everybody to /random 200 300. If the greedy player ever loose, he/she will say, &quot;...that's not how we roll for items. We always assign a number to each person and /random 1 6&quot;. Of course they always say this after the loose the first roll. I've seen these players win a few times with the first mentioned rolling but then demand the alternate way if they loose. Ick! Then the whining begins if they loose the 2nd attempt for the item.<br />
<br />
Even worse, hearing all this crap happening via /shouts with other groups.</div></div><hr />

Thank you, I am not a healer either.  I don't mind on raids healing the cleric while she/he heals the main tank, but in a pick up group... Sheesh, I think my role is clearly defined.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">A shaman's role is NOT clearly defined hun.  <br />
That's the beauty of our class . . . and what keeps it interesting.  We have many different roles we can play. Exploring those roles to their full potential is what makes this game fun for me.  <br />
<br />
Example, I am grouped with a mage and no enchanter in a group.  Mage has epic pet but no clarity so spends much time sitting on butt.  Mage has modrod2.  I think, &quot;Hmm, all she needs is mana to make a really substantial contribution!&quot;  I offer to Torpor the mage almost continuously.  She signals the need for Torpor by mod rodding down to half life, I slap it on, she continues as she needs to and I basically keep her in Torpor about 2/3 of the time.  Result?  A mage with nearly unlimited mana doing insane amounts of FAST damage to mobs.  Our puller had to start pulling 3 or 4 to keep up with the kill rate, cause I still was slowing the mobs as they were incoming.  And then the mage was using AEs to kill the stuff fast.  I tell you what, i was happy I had canni5 at that point cause I needed it to keep up with the group!  VERY nice exp.  <br />
<br />
The best shamans are the ones who can adapt their playstyle to any situation or group composition.  We are kinda like bards in that respect.  Bards can do a little of everything, but it's knowing WHEN and how much to do it that deliniates the difference between a good bard and a dead bard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I wonder how many people on this this thread think that in a 50's group their makeup requires at least a cleric and/or a enchanter? (All this talk of clerics healing made this spring to mind... BTW, that cleric should have healed you IMHO) That would be a poll I'd be really interested in seeing from the shaman community. I've spent a lot of time with groups (KC, chardok, HS, seb etc) where people would refuse to go with just a shaman as main healer and crowd control - but I can tell you afterwards they're absolutely blown away by what we can achieve. My main group basically throughout my entire 50's was Monk, Shadow Knight, Shadow Knight, Warrior , Druid and Shaman.<br />
<br />
Below are some of the typical questions I'd get when trying to convince people it was &quot;ok&quot; to not have a cleric or a chanter. (Usually these groups would consist mostly of guild - non-guild were the ones with the questions)<br />
<br />
Heres a few of the questions I routinely got:-<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you park a caster and stop him from casting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Root the mob out of line of sight. (Around a corner)<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you do when you're low on mana for heals?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tell the FDer's to FD at 1 bub of health no matter what until they get a heal. Root the mob and get the non-FDers to back away until they got a heal. (People have to understand the idea of root agro though for this to work well - root = agro's closest person to rooted mob. You can distribute damage if the tanks are communicating correctly.)<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you stop a mob from gating?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fight it on it's spawn point - we rarely &quot;pulled&quot; to a camp.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I play a shaman because it allows me to &quot;think outside the box&quot; and fill in the gaps we're missing by not having the &quot;required&quot; classes. So next time someone asks you if you can do the halls of testing in ToV with 1 group (non uber) with a shadow knight tanking - I'm here to tell you it's possible ;) Mind you, I did have the required classes for that so maybe I'm talking out of my ass! hehe (Shadow Knight, Shadow Knight,  Monk, Cleric, Shaman, and Enchanter was the group makeup.)<br />

<br />
GAH, help. <br />
<br />
No clue of the circumstances beyond what you've told.  But just for arguements sake.  Let's say I was playing my 52nd level cleric.  We just formed a group up, and we're all buffing up getting ready to pull.  I throw out a heroic bond.  Uses about a bubble and a half of mana.  then I throw out a few ac buffs (me, for timing, main tank, puller).  That takes me down to half mana or less.  Then I throw out a couple symbols (me if I have mana, for timing, main tank, puller, enchanter if one is with us).  Ok, no chanter in the group, or the shaman wouldnt be doing the haste.<br />
<br />
Main tank might be pulling as well.  And I might be using Naltron, if in a tough area, or pinzarn if it's a moderately easy area.  Or no symbol at all, if somewhere extremely easy.<br />
<br />
Chances are, after that buffing, I'm sitting around 20m.  I look over and see the shaman at 20 % health, or lower, and we havent fought a mob yet.  I'd be pretty tempted to not throw him a heal either.  And of course, I'm sitting on my butt, because I don't have cannabalize.  <br />
<br />
Maybe these arent the circumstances.  But not everything is quite so cut and dried.<br />
<br />
I try not to ever, ever canna myself down below 40 health in a pickup group.  Of course, things happen - 5 mobs in the camp, chanter just died, I've finally gotten everything root parked, But I'm down to 10m, and not finished slowing, then yeah, I'm canning down for all I'm worth.  But for buffs,  they just get timed a little better.  The tanks are just gonna have to wait on a few buffs.</div></div><hr />

I think the last time I was in Velk's was 56 or 57. Been a while. I go to CT or Chardok basement for exp. And yes, since I don't play with a 60 Torpor-equipped shaman and am not one myself, I bring a cleric.<br />

<br />
I usually slow on incoming, especially in places like the Hole, Seb, HS... Pretty much any place I know I won't get smooshed on a resist. <br />
<br />
Since I my usual group is monk, warrior, chanter and cleric I'm kinda used to having them around. Means I don't have to worry about keeping haste and I rarely have to heal. I don't like to be  the only healer in a group but gimme a druid that isn't afraid to heal while I slow and there aren't many things I'm afraid to tackle. I do like having a cleric around, I'm addicted to CH although I guess that will change once I get 60 and torpor. <br />
<br />
I was keeping a friend company on a Rage camp last week and it surprised me how well a shaman/cleric duo worked. Slow on the pull, add BoN and EB as required in between epic and JBB blasts then canni down for a CH and be ready to pull again. I'm tempted to say it was as fast a kill rate as when I was teamed with a 60 epic monk since I can kill things a bit faster than the monk if I mana dump. Kinda boring for the cleric though :)</div></div><hr />

I always do that.  Especially in Karnors, you save a buttload of mana by slowing early.<br />

Understand that I will welcome a productive conversation and take advice but not ridicule. <br />
<br />
Yes, I also slow before mobs hit the group. For one it wakes up the other tanks that forget to target the MA. Youd be amazed what the macro /assist can tell you about where their minds are. For another if the mob comes after me great I get to increase my defense. Woohoo. I have more than once told a group I am not a cleric, Please dont treat me like one.  I have been killed more than once when MAs drop a slowed mob to break root of another slowed and parked mob. Curious the slowed mobs all seem to find me.  <br />

<br />
You EVER considered the fact that he might have HoS, but just felt that it would be more prudent to give Individual buffs, cause after the patch HoS doesn't stack with neither Dex nor Str buff?<br />
<br />
In some cases it is actually more giving for the melees to be individually buffed, cause then they get higher str and dex? and the diff in hp is only about 100 or so, if you are not using Kragg in which case hp total is about 150 higher, if not more?<br />
<br />
As for the equipment question.... just because someone doesn't have the Plat to twink, and maybe, just maybe have played their characters all the way to that level without twinkage you cringe???<br />
<br />
GHEEEEEEZZZZZ, only tells me more about them than it tells me about you.... hey wait... not true, if you base respect on what people have and not have you are VERY Silly in my eyes....<br />
<br />
As for the Slowing incoming .... HELL yeah, in KC that is NOT a problem, as you can easily root the mob and get them parked nicely ....<br />
<br />
Button line is that in my experience it is often the so called &quot;under equipped&quot; characters that learn, have learned, to play their class the best.....<br />

But this is must my few thoughts.....<br />
