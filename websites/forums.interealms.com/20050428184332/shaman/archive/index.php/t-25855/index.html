<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Blizzard have just announced that they sold 280,000 copies on the first day in Europe. (compared to 250,000 US first day), and that figure has grown to 380,000 after the weekend. (compared to 350,000 in the US after thanksgiving weekend)<br />
<br />
I think that the European figures would have been higher as I know a lot of people who faked the required address info to get onto the US servers.<br />
<br />
I just hope that Blizzard aren't victims of their own success, and manage to keep it going. So far there have been server queues, but I've only had that happen to me once, and once I got on the everything was running smoothly with a ping of 60-100 ms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By what you are saying this means that by the time i am typing this over 1 million people are playing WOW. This game didn't beat EQ. IT RAPED IT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eq had around 400 000 accounts at it's peak. I am not even sure if SWG + EQ1  + EQ2 have 1 million accounts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm so WoW must be around under 1 million subscribers.  <br />
I wouldn't say its raped eq though, eq has managed to sustain one of the highest subscription rates, it will be interesting to see how long WoW can keep its older subscribers.</div></div><hr />
