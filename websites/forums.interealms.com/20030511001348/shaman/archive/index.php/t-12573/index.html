Since i'm poor and can't afford many of the high level shaman spells, I've been collecting research items like crazy.  I've gotten the components together for tigir's insects,  I took them to a necro in my guild who has 200 research, and it won't let her combine them, it didn't fail, just wouldn't let her combine.  <br />
<br />
  Questions:<br />
<br />
1. Do i need to see a priest class researcher?<br />
2. Is there a site that has all the receipes and information?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">any int caster can do the priest combines.  they need their LoY container and they need a quill and a parchment (available at the quild research vendors) in the container at the same time.<br />
