For shaman upgrades to Focus (this is 62nd lvl and the group verion is 65th), upgrade to Superior Heal/chloro (63th lvl 1300hp in 3.75 sec cast but 450 mana), and upgrade to our CH (64th lvl 3120hp or 75% 600 mana).<br />
<br />
Of course druids get better CH heals, but I think that is how it should be. Thinking in fantasy worlds, the druids are peace loving tree huggers that are more in tune with nature promoting peach and health, where shaman are the witch doctors and promote empowering the body to do more than what one can do normally through magic.<br />
<br />
Plus then we don't get stuck being backup healers as much as the druids do.  If a natureboy doesn't want to heal, this is our excuse, &quot;yours heals better, VI did it for a reason, they want you to be 2nd best healer&quot;<br />

Now give me muh Improved Invis and Melee capability.<br />

Thinking in Celtic lore, I think druids are human-sacrificing fanatics.  Think Unkempt Druids in Everquest :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, VI heard our call and gave us better heals.  VERY nice :)    Now if only we can convince them to raise the heal per click of Qui a LITTLE bit more to justify the extra mana for self medding :)  (cost is 1.5 times the old Torpor, so maybe a 400hp a click would be nice...  Not quite the same mana/hp ratio, but no snare, so you can live with the loss :))</div></div><hr />
