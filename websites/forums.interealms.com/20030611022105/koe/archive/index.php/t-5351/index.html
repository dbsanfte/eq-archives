<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night it was the New York Islander's turn  (LETS GO ISLANDERS!!!) to humble the Blues... has anyone seen Waran? He didn't jump off that arch thingie did he? The world would be a poorer place with one less barbarian: I'd have to kill about 50 dorfs and inkies to restore the balance...<br />
<br />
/pokes Waran when he's down <br />
/giggles sadistically</div></div><hr />

haha... evil :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That was an impressive win.  Especially considering they were coming off that 6 - 6 tie with Florida (they didn't get back to NY until 4 am) and were playing on only 4 or 5 hours sleep.<br />
<br />
The Islanders look damn good this year.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And this is what sport?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, that ice thingy where all the fights break out, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
;) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd hardly call losing to the Islanders &quot;pain&quot;<br />
<br />
We'll see who's in the playoffs this year...oh wait that's right, the Islanders don't belong there ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah Fall, that sport that's played on ice.<br />
<br />
You know the one -- 82 games in the regular season, 4 best of 7 rounds of playoffs, all spanning 10 months of the year.<br />
<br />
Each player plays 100% for 20 or 25 minutes a night -- sometimes losing as much as 6 or 7 pounds a of weight a game due to the exertion, not to mention all the body checks and physical play.<br />
<br />
Then the guys take a month off, start conditioning and go at it again.<br />
<br />
Those big hockey wusses.   They're nothing like those big, tough, masculine football players.  Heck, those football guys practice at least 4 times a week for their grueling, demanding, boring (oops) 20 week long season.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wasn't arguing against the physical aspect of the game, Quinn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just sort of underlining the fact that I find hockey dang boring to watch, second only to baeball of the major sport for bore factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just doesn't do anything for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No worries, I just love to take cheap shots at other sports.<br />
<br />
well, at least hockey rates over baseball in your book.  I totally agree with you though.  Baseball is quite possibly the most boring sport ever invented.<br />
<br />
Golf running a close second.<br />
<br />
-Quinn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the &quot;bore&quot; factor in any spot goes along with your understanding of the game. Personally, I think hockey is one of the most exciting, because of the speed and physical aspects. I also grew up with it (any Canadian can tell ya all about this institution we have up here called &quot;Hockey Night In Canada&quot;, dating back before the televised games into the radio era :p ).<br />
<br />
I love football, but I prefer the 3 down, larger field and 20 second play clock of the Canadian rules over the NFL rules: it makes for a faster, more wide open game. Baseball, to me, is somewhat akin to watching paint dry, even though I played a little baseball when I was a kid, and have played a little slow pitch since. I like to whack the ball around the course, but I find golf as boring as baseball to watch on TV.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Waran? Bet ya the Isles (who WILL be in the playoffs this year) go as far as the St Louis &quot;max of 2 rounds and out&quot; Blues :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Whatever, I'm so sick of sports right now I can puke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Isles was raking Burnt Leafs last night!!! 4-1!<br />
I do have to laugh when Leaf fans say that Toronto is &quot; Canada's only hope for making it out of the first round of the playoffs&quot;... they haven't played bad hockey this year, but they are definately not what I would call a contender at this point (no niether are my Isles: I'm just happy to be playoff bound again :p ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't feel so bad guys, however far Toronto or St Louis get, ultimately they will end up in the wake of..... DA FLYERS ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xouqoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Philly?  Surely you jest!<br />
<br />
Last time Philly went to the finals, they got swept.... by some team.. uhh.. umm...  the Red Wings or something like that?<br />
<br />
Red Wings = teh win!<br />
<br />
Stanley Cup year baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually Xoooooocow Philly went to the finals against Edmonton...you may be thinking of someone else...<br />
<br />
/bonk Xoooocow<br />
<br />
I agree those bastages (except Stevie Y and Shannie!!! The rox0rz) look pretty ominous...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Odds are good that Toronto will fall off a bit as the season progresses.  The loss of Dimitry Yushkevich because of a blood clot for the rest of the year will hurt them a lot.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Mogilny isn't healthy either.<br />
<br />
The road to the Cup definately goes through Detroit; but, I think there are a couple teams that might give them a run for their money - Chicago in the West for example.  St. Louis is probably going to go home early this year.  How early depends on their seeding.<br />
<br />
Remember, a single injury, trade,  or guy on a hot-streak can change everything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xouqoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wulfran.. I know my Detroit Stanley Cup years. :)<br />
<br />
In 1997, Detroit swept the Flyers in the finals. :P<br />
<br />
http://pages.map.com/sven22/StanleyCupHistory.htm<br />
<br />
1987 was Edmonton/Philly... but wasn't a sweep.<br />
<br />
Did you know Lord Stanley's full title was Right Honourable Sir Frederick Arthur Stanley, Baron Stanley of Preston, in the County of Lancaster, in the Peerage of Great Britain, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath?<br />
<br />
That's a mouth full.  I read that here... very cool read if you have the time.<br />
