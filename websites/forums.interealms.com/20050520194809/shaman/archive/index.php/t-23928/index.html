<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I screwed up.  OOW came in the mail yesterday and I eagerly opened the box, clicked the account link which popped up a window with a field to put in the CD key.  I put the key in, clicked submit, and another screen popped up congratulating me on upgrading OOW onto my brothers account.  (This wasn't my intent, I was trying to put OOW onto my own account)<br />
<br />
So I did the live chat thing.  The agent asked me a few questions about who I was and the stations names and such and told me a new key would be emailed to me in one hour.<br />
<br />
I have to admit I was amazed, because I really only hear about how terrible the CS is, and really haven't had to deal with it before this.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am posting this for 2 reasons.  <br />
<br />
First reason is to warn you to CHECK which account you are logged into ON THE WEB PAGE.  This does not depend on which account you have most recently logged into Everquest with.  Nor is there any indication WHICH account you are logged into when they give you a field to put in the CD key.  If you or anyone else has ever logged into the web-based account maintenance page, and there are existing cookies from the last time someone logged in, it is entirely possible that you could be logged into someone elses account maintenance page without realizing it.<br />
<br />
Second reason is to give this particular CS episode a thumbs up, since its a rare thing to read about anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">congratz, glad it worked out for you.  Personally I've had an open ticket since Thursday sep 16 at 5:45 am that has not been answered yet regarding my precombined epic pieces.  Unfortuntely I've long past given up that I would get an answer and I already went back and did it all again.  I'm leaving the ticket open to see how much longer it takes for them to respond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had an open ticket relating to the Enchanter research snafu.  It had been open since June or so.<br />
<br />
So I closed it (Because I had bigger issues) and sent an email to the URL they gave on the ticket.<br />
<br />
Came back undeliverable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think Sony run 2 different CS departments.<br />
1 for billing etc and 1 for ingame stuff.<br />
Ive had a few account problems and always recieved a very prompt response.<br />
Ive also had ingame problems and you may as well forget your petition as 99% of the times it goes unanswered or &quot;not a known problem&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well since mostly negative people peruse class forums (all the happy people I know don't even touch class forums), I assume all we'll hear in this thread is bad ones.<br />
<br />
Last week I bought an aug for my monk's Velium Inlaid Claws, which is a 17/20 weapon and worth 10-20k.  I put the aug and weapon in the aug pool to combine, and got a message that they were incompatible.  I looked at the aug,a nd sure enough, it was for the wrong slot.  *My* fault.<br />
<br />
So I grumbled, closed the aug pool, and sold my aug back to the vendor for half price or whatever, and logged off for the night as it was late.<br />
<br />
Logged on the next day, and --- where is my Velium Inlaid Claws???<br />
<br />
In the aug pool.  Someone got a nice little gift after I closed it...<br />
<br />
I put a petition in using the petition tool, saying I had left my claws in the aug pool and that I was wondering if there was any way I could have that returned to me, and logged off.<br />
<br />
I logged on 2 hours later, with a note in my petition tool from a GM saying that my claws were returned to me in my inventory.<br />
<br />
So there ya go.  A positive CS experience in-game.  It was prompt, polite, no-fuss.  In fact I've had very few if any experiences that were otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">About a year and a half ago, I was lucky enough to get a corroded chain tunic on my first visit to the Kael arena. I was soooo happy and started working on my faction with the coldain. As I was working on the faction I was getting impatient and asked a fellow factioner what amount of faction did I need for the turn in. They told me wrong, so I turned in the items and lost them. I petitioned for help and later that day a GM kindly returned all the lost items to me, but warned me that that was the last time he could help me and I needed to be more careful in the future.<br />
<br />
On another note, earlier this year I was XPing in Valor on my alt cleric, when he died. I ran back to the camp (it was right camp) but the mobs were still there (snared) and proceeded to give me a second lashing. I waited a bit longer and then went back again, only to find one corpse (the clothed one). I figured my second corpse fell through the bridge so I waited in the GY for it, but it didn't pop after 30 minutes. I then realized to hit /corpse. No corpses in this zone... Petitioned and about 6 hours later a GM said they couldn't do anything for me. I had a stack of summoned food and summoned drink on that corpse, and it just poofed! That's how I know I didn't acidentally loot it without rezzing first. I checked my packs and no summoned food or drink (and I hadn't logged or gone LD). =\</div></div><hr />
