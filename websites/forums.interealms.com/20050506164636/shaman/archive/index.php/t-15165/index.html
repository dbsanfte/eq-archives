<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since folks haven't thought about this for awhile, I thought it would be useful to get an idea of what people really thought of the AA's required to get Rabid Bear and its PoP &quot;upgrades&quot;.<br />
<br />
It might be useful for Sony to see just how useful this AA is in actual game play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use it for a cold resistance boost once in a while. Does that count as useful? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what id really like is if we could &quot;duel weild&quot; or some form of bash iwth Rabid bear  but i dont see that happening  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At the least it should be changed the way the mage elemental form AA's were imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I voted I have it and is working fine because it is, its not really &quot;broken&quot; just I would prefer if the aa was more useful or maybe the implementation of a weapon in the game especially for rabid bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How is not broken?<br />
<br />
It's useless.  It may be working as intended, but it's worthless.  That's the same as broken to me.<br />
<br />
I guess I can't really say because I don't have it, but it sure seems worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I will train 20 points of innate charisma before I train rabid bear....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It maybe useless but its not broken it works as the description intends. Other classes get useless aa too. I would like rabid bear to be looked at, but I don't hold my hopes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't have it and won't get it until 60+ Shamans can do melee damage in the first place.<br />
<br />
The AA works as stated; that's not what is broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">its a melee toy, it is how its supposed to be. the only thing iw ould add is bash, since they wont give it to is as a class, i dont see why we cant get it with this AA ability. Dual wield wont happen. We already double attack with it.<br />
<br />
Oh, the on thing that is screwed on it is reuse time. The reuse on it MAKES it worthless if you ask me, if i could keep this up for 45min with a 1 hour repop on abiltiy, then it would be better or even better, keep it up all the time.<br />
<br />
Its not overpowering, we have been getting the short hand for a long time now and we certainly arent overpowered anymore, i dont see why this bone hasnt been thrown to us, just shorten the reuse please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Reuse time is terrible, and duration is sad.  The hastened rabidity aa is just a slap in the face, oh wheee lets suck off another bit of aa points to only take off 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
That said, I do use it frequently, and I like it, but its not near as useful as it should be for such a duration/reuse.<br />
<br />
Plus, to whomever said 60+ shaman can't do melee, try breaking out your weapon sometime  :p  I know I certainly can melee pretty decently, though theres nearly always something I can do to add more to the fight than meleeing heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">its such a slap in the face that they gave us Hasten Rabidity or what ever its called...<br />
<br />
rather then give us a usful AA haste, like lowering C5 duration or making C5 do more damage for more mana...<br />
<br />
or at the VERY least make the duration 10 times longer with a lesser recast...<br />
<br />
i will never get this ability until something drastic changes<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This skill is more a toy for shamans having 300+ aas... With a weapon procing 400+dd, and Fury of Magic 3, you can do some nice damage... For few minutes...<br />
<br />
I use it when we need Cold Resist, otherwise, almost never...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This skill is more a toy for shamans having 300+ aas... <br />
<br />
I think this is gonna be my next buy, and I'm not even at 180 yet!  but definately it's only use seems to be for getting elder title or goofing off once every couple hours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As it stands now, Rabid Bear is a useless AA. Its at the bottom of most shamans to-get lists. This is another one of those &quot;Fun AA's&quot; that SoE got their panties all wadded up in a bunch over. For no reason too. A shaman using rabid bear can do a litte bit of damage. NOT LOTS. But some. Someone at SoE is scared ****less of a decently equipped shaman being able to melee for ~80 DPS. That person at SoE probably still fights Orcs regularly too.<br />
<br />
This will never happen, but it should stop the complaints...<br />
<br />
Reduce the reuse timer on Rabid Bear to 15 mins (2 hours?? WHAT do they smoke????)<br />
<br />
Make the Hastened Rabidity AA take the reuse timer down to 8 mins.<br />
<br />
This ability would not be over powering if it was enabled on Shaman with the AA's permanently. Single wielding, double attacking shaman are fun, but once every two hours is a sad joke.<br />
<br />
The battle priests, well, arent. And we should be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">you people that are asking for this to be available 24 hours a day realize it has +50CR that stacks with everything right?

I will put 20 points in innate charisma AND advanced innate charisma before i train rabid bear! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I could care less about the 50 cr.  Cold resist is super easy to get on items, heck I think I run around unbuffed at 399, or some silly amount.  If your picking up rabid for the 50 cr, save your aa and put it into innate cold resist, then you'll have it 24/7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Unlisted option: I don't have it and will never train it. ;) I see no use in it. I don't even see it's 'fun' value as it has such a long recast timer. But that's just me. Some people like it. More power to 'em. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Rabid bear is fairly meaningless, but we are hardly unique in having some meaningless AA abilities.  How would you like to be a cleric, with their UBER INNATE INVIS VS. UNDEAD.  There is a skill you'll use often.<br />
<br />
I would be happy if rabid bear were changed into almost anything else, but I don't think that it is an evil conspiracy perpetrated on us to keep us down.  It's just a not-too-useful AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So if they took the +50 CR out, you then feel that it would be ok for us to have Rabid Bear permanently?<br />
<br />
I could care less about the added CR... Seriously. CR isnt something I worry about that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have had Rabid Bear since 2 weeks after Luclin was released and it's horribly &quot;broken&quot;. The skill adds nothing to our class, yet it is a class skill. Once you get it, you soon will notice that you don't even use it.<br />
<br />
Last time i used it was like a month ago(clicked it on accident).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No, Shaman are not unique in have some bad/Worthless AA's but we certainly seem to have gotten the short end of the stick. <br />
<br />
We get 7: Alchemy Mastery , Cannibalization, Mass Group Buff, Pet Discipline, Quick Buff, Rabid Bear , Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
<br />
Lets check the other priest classes...<br />
Hmm...lets see Druids 8 : Dire Charm, Enhanced Root, Exodus, Innate Camouflage, Quick Direct Damage,   Quick Evacuation, Spell Casting, Reinforcement Mastery, Mass Group Buff<br />
<br />
Clerics 8: Bestow Divine Aura, Celestial Regeneration,  Divine Resurrection, Innate Invisibility to Undead, Mass Group Buff , Purify Soul, Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery, Turn Undead <br />
<br />
Hmm, the other priest classes get a couple bad ass spells - Dire Charm, Instant Succor or Instant DA, Heal over time...and one gimp spell each Cammo or Invis to Undead. Shaman get Canni 5.<br />
<br />
And our PoP AA are just as bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What they should do with rabid bear is make it like the mage elemental form AA's.<br />
<br />
They have a fairly short duration, but a shorter re-use timer.  Like... it lasts 20 minutes, but only has a 10 minute re-use.  That way, you can keep it up 24/7.  The effect needs to be tweaked a little.  I would like to see it made in to a 3/6/9 aa, which each rank giving a higher haste, proc, and double attack rate, as well as a smidge of mana regen (1, 2, 4 at each rank respectively).  There was a huge thread about this a few months ago, but nothing ever came of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i got 310 aa and 7 in bank,and i don t have rabid bear and don t even think to get it atm. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Clerics 8: Bestow Divine Aura, Celestial Regeneration,  Divine Resurrection, Innate Invisibility to Undead, Mass Group Buff , Purify Soul, Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery, Turn Undead<br />
<br />
Just for the record... Turn Undead gives Rabid Bear a run for its money for most useless.  Rabid Bear I agree is rather silly - and I don't plan to get it - but turn undead as it is is unusable.  It is a dot with a built in fear.  As soon as the fear portion is resisted the dot stops working as well.  <br />
<br />
Cleric class AAs aren't all that wonderful.  I had over 100 AA before I spent any in Class skills besides MGB.  SCRM is nice I got that second but it was pretty recent.  Free heal over time is usefull as is Bestow Divine Aura but neither is all that wonderful - I just got BDA last night because I couldn't think of anything else to use the points on.  Innate Invis to Undead is actually considered pretty nifty by a lot of clerics... must be cause we are the only caster class with no self invis so we feel like we can at least hide from something with this.  Purify soul was nice but was made useless by Radiant Cure which all priest classes share.  Divine Resurrection would be really nice if it didn't have such a long recast time - 36 RL hours if I remember correctly (which was shortened from 3 days when it first came out).  Seems like once every 8 hours wouldn't be overpowering but as it is I doubt I'll ever get it.<br />
<br />
Priest archtype skills are very nice.  I plan to have all of them eventually.  Class skills... ick.  The good thing about shaman skills though - at least shaman have one that is class defining in the class skill section.  There is no cleric (or druid that I know of but I don't know druids well) skill that you will get 90+% of clerics to agree is a must have like cani5 is for shaman.</div></div><hr />

not everyone is in a full suit of elemental gear already</div></div><hr />

It's reuse timer makes it a waste of perfectly good aa. It has stacking issues with buffs. And it turns you into a BROWN bear .... Nuff said.</div></div><hr />
