<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bakstabb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 65 rogue with good gear i got 4200 hp unbuffed 1250 ac and primal + epic. I would like to group with shaman through 50's and get him through them fast. Any good places you guys know of that would make it faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jedafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">similar situation, would like to know if anyone has any tips :) bumpage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here is a good tactic.  Dunno how much exp you'll sap from him with a 15 lvl differance.  When I duo with a melee that might get eaten by planes mobs I usualy just agro kite in a circle while they beat the piss out of said mob.  Shammies can pull a hell of a lot of agro when they stack cripple slow and a few dots.<br />
<br />
You could also go the route of CoM, Most Mobs should be green at 65, when grouped with a shaman that is 50 they will be DB to him.  Just group and kill away..they no longer yield exp for you so the shaman will get solo exp.  I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Velk's and Chardock come to mind too.<br />
<br />
Now that Velk's is pretty much deserted, you should be able to pull plenty of spiders.  Shaman slows and stacks a few dots, rogue then just beats it down.<br />
<br />
Chardock has great exp all the way up to lvl60 in the Levi tunnel.  It would be a little slow as the shaman gets close to lvl60, but it's very steady.<br />
<br />
Once the shaman hits lvl60, then you'll pretty much have to group in the Planes.</div></div><hr />

not true.... I exp in velks, and when grouped with my 56 shaman it takes 7 kills for 1% exp, when ungrouped it takes 2 kills for 1%, im sucking a lot ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nermerl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1 word... root.  Mobs that are rooted hits the person closest.  Thats how I powerlevel my rogue, slow with shaman, root it and stand right on top of it and then melee with the rogue from max distance.</div></div><hr />
