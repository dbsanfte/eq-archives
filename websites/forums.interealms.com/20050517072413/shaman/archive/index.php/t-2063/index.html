<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After 25 lvls of playing my troll shaman, I'm considering rerolling an ogre.  Although I love my troll, the exp penalty is too steep for the amount of time I get to play.  Afraid all my friends are going to out lvl me :)<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, doesn't a troll have 15% penalty and an ogre 5%?  That 10% difference would help me out in the 50+ game.<br />
<br />
Or am I just completely crazy and should just keep my troll?<br />
<br />
I'm sooo confused :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are completely crazy :)<br />
<br />
Seriously though - trolls have a 20% xp penalty, and ogres 15%. I've spent almost 55 levels as a troll, and I still think it's worth it.<br />
<br />
Ogres are cool in their own way, but, putting aside the fact that trolls are the sexiest creatures on Norrath, their extra regeneration will only make things better for you as you go up in levels. Until of course you get to level 60 and get Torpor - if you level as fast as me, that's about 2 years in your future :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played an iksar to 60, a troll to 55, and now have an ogre SK at 40. Never saw the first hand experience penalties until I started duo'ing with my wifes rogue. We keep killing the same stuff and she keeps outlevelling me.  Started grouping at 37/35 and we're both at 39 now and she's about to pass me.  95% of the time or more has been duo'ing together.<br />
<br />
I like the regen of a troll I suppose, but I don't know that I'd go with one again.   I always have regrow/fungi so I don't know how much troll regen really adds (not talking actual numbers, talking real time situations where i say to myself &quot;If only I had a little more regen&quot; ) Playing the ogre has made me respect the &quot;bash from the front&quot;. <br />
<br />
Exp penalty doesn't really make any sense to me as the benefits of the classes don't really seem all that far superior. Then again at level 60 exp hardly matters.  <br />
<br />
If you're going to powerlevel yourself somehow back to your level I'd say switch, if not, seems like a waste of time to me especially  for only a 5% exp difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aren't you gonna loose a lot of time and exp if you reroll from 25 and start from lvl 1 again. You'd propably be 30 by the time you have your new shaman at 25. Troll exp penalty is 20, ogre was 15 and barb 10 if i recall correctly from the top of my hat.<br />
<br />
Pick a race you want to play and play it. Otherwise you gonna be rerolling from ogre shaman to something else too after you hear some cool stuffs about some other race.<br />
<br />
If you just want to max exp, why not make Vah Sir or Barb.<br />
<br />
I've played 3 different troll shamans along my career, the main is 60 and I've never suffered much of the exp penalty, instead I've always enjoyed the gorgeous look and how racial regen gives you less downtime in game. I hate downtime. Sure sometimes exp seems slow (esp after 51), but that's the same with any class/race. You just gotta find a better way to do exping then ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im sorry it took 25 levels for you to realize that da ogers are the best shamans...but at least you realized it!  Some poor people still play other races (/boggle).  :D<br />
<br />
All teasing aside, the differences aren't as big as you think.  Both have a lot of STA, and the other stats are pretty close to each other (except for STR).<br />
<br />
Both are evil, both have a crappy ghetto for a hometown (the only reason I go to Grobb is so I can feel good about Oggok).  Both are stuck down in the corner of Antonica, far away from any spires.  Both have a xp penalty, the difference is only 5%.<br />
<br />
Play the race you like.  I prefer Oger, but a lot of people enjoy Trolls.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I had a high lvl druid friend that said he would help me get back to the 20's with my new ogre shaman, but if you guys are telling me there's only a 5% difference, screw it.  I'll keep the troll.<br />
<br />
I was thinking there was a bigger gap between the 2 races experience wise.  Since there's not...just can't justify rerolling.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.  Very much appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

Ogre - 15%<br />

Halfings - 5% Bonus (not that they can be a Shaman but thought I mention it :) )<br />
<br />
The exp penalty really isnt that bad, just dont think about it, I never do and I do just fine leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spent many levels happily running back and forth around Oggok and Grobb, hunting, banking, exploring, training, etc.  Never ventured into other cities.<br />
<br />
Ignorance is bliss.<br />
<br />
 A friend (DE Necro) dragged me over to Neriak one day, and after seeing the 'black light' graphics, and real buildings, etc for the first time...a little voice in the back of my head told me &quot;Snap, you live in Norrath's Public Housing.  No wonder nobody visits your town unless they are killing the guards.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What exactly do ogres pay the 15% penalty for? no stun from the front?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">no stun, our considerably higher stats, slam, and our ravashing good looks.  not to mention our wonderful faction.  yeah it's fair /sarcasm off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Make sure you put the appropriate amounts of points into charisma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What do Ogres pay a 15% penalty for? Heh... lemme put it this way, I've been stunned maybe 20 times ALL the way up to 50, and most of those were probably Cynthia and her Force Shock. My buddy troll will get stunned at LEAST once a fight.<br />
<br />
Plus Ogres treat bashes like just any other hit. You'll get a little kick out of the first time you channel through about 10 - 15 hits. I actually summoned a pet while I had 3 greenies hitting me yesterday. :P<br />
<br />
At 60 with Torpor regen really mean diddly and being able to cast Torpor means a lot.<br />
<br />
And Grobb/Oggok are cool towns! They're one of the few places I don't have to zone 4 times just to get to the freaken bank!!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the non-stun thing is pretty damn sweet actually, i so rarely get interrupted, and if there's one thing that PISSES ME OFF TO NO END, it's getting stunned by melee (on my rogue). also, you cannot get interrupted directly by a bash (even if it doesn't stun) like other races can. and we are o so sekzi!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Stay with the Troll, I think overall you might like them better. And the exp penalty isn't that much different that you'll even notice.<br />
15% for Ogre and 20% for Troll....big deal ! <br />
<br />
And the whole stun thing.....I've been stunned during a fight and to be honest its never been a dire thing where it cost me my life. And I'm the weakest race physically for a Shaman (Iksar). The no stun thing is cool but, you'll benefit from regen alot more. <br />
some will argue that point because of Torpor. But let's look at that for a second: <br />
<br />
Torpor is a level 60 spell that is hard and expensive to come by. Therefore Torpor is of no use to you until 60.<br />
<br />
At 60 with Torpor it really doesn't matter what race you are at that point. Getting to 60 with innate regen is very nice, I'd take that over no-stun in a heartbeat. <br />
<br />
As far as stats, Trolls aren't too far behind Ogres<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say Trolls are better than Ogres, but I wanted to point out why at this point you shouldn't re-roll just because of the exp penalty. It isn't worth it when the difference in penalty is minor. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not getting interrupted by bashes . . . man that would rock.  I think that's my only real gripe these days when soloing.  All the freakin interrupts, mostly from bashes.  Slow makes bash far less frequent, but it always crops up at the most annoying times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally, I think ogres are a bit hosed on the exp penalty.  I think they should go down from 115% to 110%.  The no stun from the front is very nice, and the huge strength and stamina is great, but the low starting wisdom isn't too cool at all.  I think the 115% is good for tank classes, but it doesn't make as much sense for a priest class.  Too bad they can't make the exp penalty a reasonable combination of race and class (I'm glad the got rid of the original class penalties--I just think some class/race combinations should get a BONUS instead of a lack of penalty).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Stay with the troll. Personally I think trolls look better than the Mr. Clean looking Ogres but new models for both are not that good. A troll has a 20% exp penalty and it HURTS. An orge has a 15% penalty and that will hurt. Trolls get regen that will help you get to 60 and torpor slightly faster and Innoruuk trolls get a supremely useful snare necklace. <br />
<br />
If you are going to reroll for to get rid of the exp bonus go Kitty. At most they have a 5% penalty. They get safefall and sneak (I think sneak, not sure). Sneak is great for questing. Kitty can wear plate and JBB and get some excellent hometown quests. <br />
<br />
Just to put it in perspective, I started a halfling druid to collect pelts for my shammy, and leveled him to 24 in less than 17 HOURS with no twinking or powerleveling. The difference in exp gain is amazing.<br />
<br />
Off topic, exactly why do Halflings get a 5% exp bonus? They get native sneak and hide (ie no faction problems), faction, a great starting location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Anyone levels slow beside a Rogue...  I remember being on a website that was *coughNOTVIAPPROVEDcough* that had access to the XP tables for all classes so you could compare and contrast them (Yes, classes XP at different rates above and beyond the Hybrid Penalty.. though that was the worst by far) and Rogues have the shortest route to 60 of all the classes in EQ.<br />
<br />
Shamans have a very slow XP curve as do all the &quot;soloable&quot; classes. (Necro, Druid, Mage etc.)  <br />
<br />
If I remember right, Rogues would hit 60 around the time a shaman is hitting 55 or so if they fought side by side all the way from the noob areas.  It's rather shameful really.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't know if the XP split while grouping is designed to even this out or not, but either way, as a Troll Shaman, you probably have the slowest XP curve in EQ now that Hybrids are not getting punished, but your curve is not much slower than any other Shaman race and there are benefits to being a Troll in the long run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I dinged my little fat troll to lvl 26 last night.<br />
<br />
Went off to my super secret camp to stay until lvl 33.<br />
<br />
First time I've taken a troll there so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br />
<br />
Painful...that's all that can describe it. *sigh*<br />
<br />
I actually might consider rerolling a barbarian or vah shir after last night.<br />
<br />
My respect for lvl 60 troll and ogre shaman just went up substantially.  Hats off to you guys for being able to stick it out.  That exp penalty sucks..bad.  <br />
<br />
Maybe it's the limited time I get to play..but I think it would take me forever to get to higher lvls as a troll/ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wargbearjumper, <br />
<br />
I'm familiar with your *coughNOTVIAPPROVEDcough* website ;)  and I believe that information is outdated.  I'm fairly certain that verant removed CLASS based exp penalties.  It used to be that an iksar necromancer levelled slower than an iksar warrior, but that's not true anymore (Can someone back me up?)  Now, there only exists RACE based exp penalties - an iksar warrior levels slower than a barbarian warrior.<br />
<br />
Now I can say for sure that my kitty shaman levels way faster than my iksar shaman buddy.  That's the best aspect of the cats for me - fast levelling - in the end race means jack for shaman.  I want to get to 60 and be &quot;done&quot; asap TYVM.  Then, I can then start grinding out AA =\  <br />
<br />
/sigh levelling sucks :p <br />
