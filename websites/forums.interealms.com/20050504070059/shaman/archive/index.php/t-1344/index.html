<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried replying to the &quot;dogdog not so weak&quot; thread, but I can't.  I'm currently just JBB blasting Bloodgills for exp.  I haven't summoned my pet there except when i'm pulling to shore.  My question is, if I fight in the water, will my pet drown?  I'm sure this is a yes, but i'm asking since my only exp with pets in water was with my chanter, who's pet drowns in water, which is why i'm sure our dogdog does as well.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just checking to see if this post is having a reply problem as well, since noone's replied, and it's a fairly simple question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're kidding me right?  No one can answer this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty sure NPC's are not required to breath underwater.  Your pet is technically a NPC so should not require water breathing.   Should be pretty easy to figure out though if he would drown though.  Just cast pet take him out 10 feet in the water and tell him to guard the bottom on the ocean.  Really dont think he would drown though.  Never heard of a pet drowning from any class though.  If you test it out let us all know would be nice to know for sure one way or another.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No npcs at all can drown...only time I could think of a pet drowning would be when some ench charmed a player in a duel and stuck EB on theirself and took the charmed guy underwater.  Most likely they still wouldnt since you are considered an npc while charmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tried it out.  Didn't drown, at least not in the 2 hours I was there.</div></div><hr />
