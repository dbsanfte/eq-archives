<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Update, last night I helped gather Acies, IceWulf, Aust, Nad, a_random_mage named Crater, and Tarachi brough an SK and a Monk, and we took down a_lame_enchanter for Tara's Kedge Robe.<br />
<br />
Then we made a quick stop the bazaar and picked up a Shinny Metallic Robe since TeamJapan has had the damn thing camped for 2 weeks strait.<br />
<br />
Then we ran out to some place to meet up with the brigand waited around to the wee hours of the night to get her Cazic's Quill. BTW, on our way there, I say Fippy for the first time.<br />
<br />
Then we rand down to Highhold where unfortunately a guard agroed on me, but I gated in time. Was hoping I would be there for the turn in, I wanted to get some nice screenies damnit. Got a good sceenie of her and the brigand.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for the help on Tara getting her Ragingbringer.<br />
<br />
Lastly I leave you all with this:<br />
It's overkill, and Salvatore does this over and over again. I would say he's wordy, but the definition is too short by at least 30 characters. In another scene, where Anakin goes all Dark Side on us, Salvatore writes it like this (well, not exactly - but it feels that way): <br />
<br />
And as the rage raged through Anakin's rage, he raged through his raging rage to rage the rage rage.<br />
I'm not clear here - is Anakin angry?</div></div><hr />
