<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Geldon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged to 30 and i was wondering what i should Specialize in, Alteration or Conjuration. I heard from some Shammy friends that Alteration can save alot of mana when buffing, healing etc. I am also a split down the middle in soloing and grouping. I usally get a tell from guildies to group up, so its not hard for me to get a group. Any advice is usefull. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go alteration:<br />
<br />
alteration spells that you need a lot:<br />
slow (always when soloing grouping or raiding)<br />
buffs (always when soloing grouping or raiding)<br />
heals (always when soloing grouping or raiding)<br />
debuffs (always when raiding, sometimes when grouping or soloing)<br />
<br />
conjuration spells that you need a lot:<br />
dots (sometimes when soloing, rarely when grouped or raiding.  usually a waste of mana.  we are not a damage dealing class)<br />
<br />
I think that should make it fairly clear.  There is more to soloing than just dotting the thing.  You need all the alteration skills to make it possible.  You might be a SLIGHTLY more efficient soloer if you go with conjuration (i dont use dots to solo btw i use jbb and epic), but you WILL be a MUCH more efficient grouper and raider if you go with alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll second alteration as the specialization to choose. Whether you group or solo, THE main spells you'll cast will be from the slow line and they are alteration spells. Also, regen for canni (heck canni, also) is an alteration spell. Heals, buffs debuffs are all alteration spells. If you solo, you'll cast your dots quite a bit, but nowhere near as much as you cast an alteration based spell. Still, as others have suggested in the past, you could just put a point in each discipline, play like normal, and see which specialization becomes your prime specialization. It's almost certain to be alteration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used Alteration.  I group a lot and this is great for buffing.  To use this correctly, you must put one point into EACH.  Then, the first one to 51 is the main special.  So, after putting a point into each, go to a newbie zone and cast you low level spells of which ever you chose, until the special skill is over 50.<br />
