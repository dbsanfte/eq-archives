<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, so much for the ease in alchemy.<br />
<br />
Total output:<br />
<br />
22 10-shot grow pots <br />
<br />
Total skill raises:<br />
<br />
3<br />
<br />
Went 18 straight 10-shots (plus failures) with 0 skill-ups.  I even buffed DEX and CHA in an all out attempt to get SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
Logged twice, zoned 3 times.  Anything to get the RNG to play nice.<br />
<br />
Nope, nothing.  The sellback of 9pp is really sick on those.  I can't sell these even at 100pp, so there is 0 cost recovery.<br />
<br />
I sure hope that others were luckier than I was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/blush<br />
<br />
10 point raises in 60 attempts on Grow in SH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Current Streak: <br />
<br />
32 10-shot potions<br />
<br />
0 skillups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">120 combines - 12 skill ups.  Wis at 254 - combines done in SH.<br />
<br />
I think they fixed it quite nicely.<br />
<br />
Cost me about 1300p for 15 skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just for the record: 239wiz.  Even buffed DEX as a last ditch effort to get SOMETHING to work.  Did this in SH, Bazaar, and every zone on the way to Ssra.  Heck, if I could stand on my head I would try that.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do at this point.  I have dumped more cash than I want to count trying to break 175, but damn it seems like I am bugged or something.<br />
<br />
Don't say RNG, because at this point after 3 sessions I can't see this even being a statistical possibility with the new &quot;increased&quot; skill-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Buffed to 252 wiz.<br />
<br />
7 more 10-shots back to the vendor<br />
<br />
No skill-up.<br />
<br />
Now I am thinking that my char is bugged, but I have no way to verify.  If I had ONE in this drought, then I can write ot off to bad luck, but not now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I feel your pain.  I smith, got to 201 just before the triv nerf patch.  Got to 204 after a couple hundred combines.<br />
<br />
In 204, I have made 213 combines, and am still not going anywhere.  Str/dex maxed, Wis darn near it.  <br />
<br />
Skill on alchemy's always been quick for me, thankfully, and I have a pretty good return on the tougher potions.   It's just the SoW potions that seem to fizzle 3 of 10 times when I try to restock my trader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was hungover at the weekend so I thought I know I'll throw some money down that black hole that is called alchemy.<br />
<br />
I went from 70 to 103 on Aura of Purity - All sold back to the vendor.<br />
<br />
then I went from 103 - 165 on Titan potions averaging about 5 skill ups on 40 combines. I saved the potions and I'm selling them on my trade mule for 90pp per 10 shot. <br />
<br />
I made a macro that sells them as a fun thing for all the short races, you know amaze your friends with your new found height...<br />
<br />
all in all it cost me about 8K to get from 70 to 165.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Umm...... am I being stupid?  You say in your sig that you are level 59.  The cap for Alchemy for a level 59 shaman is 175.  Is that why you aren't raising it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sorry to break the bad news to you - it truly sucks.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doh Torelorm, Even though I'm grinning as I write this I feel for you mate I really do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">*BIG HUG*<br />
<br />
Sorry, man.<br />
<br />
I am really truely sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frostbyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OMG LOL you just made me wake my kids up man........I read the very first post and said to myself &quot;cap&quot; then you kept crying and whining........sounds like something i would do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A message would be nice.  Something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you moron, try dinging 60 before you try this again&quot;<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
&quot;How about checking your Alchemy skill caps again Einstein&quot;<br />
<br />
People at work are wondering why I keep walking around with my &quot;I am an Idiot sign&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree. A message should have been put in a long time ago. Like, &quot;you cannot increase your skill further at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
I used to sit down and calculate my cap before every skillup session, but I was only made aware of it by reading eqtraders.com. If I had just stumbled onto alchemy, I would've been like the poor fellow who put k's into it at level 25....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am very grateful to you for saving me the trouble of doing the same thing myself. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the fact that you have helped many brain farting shaman all around Norrath gives you some consolation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Woot! I'm a Disciple!!</div></div><hr />
