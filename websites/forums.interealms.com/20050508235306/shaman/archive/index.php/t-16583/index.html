<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I had real trouble with that subject, but as the terms go &quot;group was VT level gear&quot; or &quot;guy was SSRA level&quot;. How does this rank? <br />
<br />
What I want to know is which place produce the best armor, in order.<br />
and<br />
What does it take to get a piece out of these places?<br />
<br />
My guild has started doing SSRA, should I bail on public ToV? Should I just buy Tae EW? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also some magelos wearing &quot;xx level gear&quot; would be helpful and informative. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I definetely think you should surely bye Tae Ew.<br />
<br />
I'm wearing Dozekar-BoT-Tactics-Chardok B-Cazic gear.  Bottom end raid gear in other words.  I like to call it Ghetto Raid gear.<br />
<br />
Rankings these days go roughly like so:<br />
<br />
Plane of Time<br />
Elemental PoP/VT<br />
Ghetto Raid gear (Stuff that can be gotten with 3 groups or so)<br />
Player made gear<br />
<br />
First magelo below, the second one is my twink rogue and some of her gear totally blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not an authority by any means, but I believe the progression is something like this:<br />
<br />
Kael, ToV, NToV/Ornate, SSRA, VT, Elemental, Time<br />
<br />
I'm sure soeone more knowledgeable will fill in the gaps, but thats how I'd rate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bout only thing I could think to change would be adding Tier 3 bosses in between VT and Elemental. Thats the point PoP loot really starts becoming better IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now its....<br />
<br />
<br />
Kael, ToV, NToV/Ornate, LDON, SSRA, VT, Elemental, Time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now its....<br />
<br />
<br />
Kael, ToV, NToV/Ornate, LDON, SSRA, VT, Elemental, Time<br />
<br />
<br />
actually I'd rank it more like ...<br />
<br />
Thurg, Kael, Hot, Tov, Ssraa, Ornate, VT,  pre Elemental Pop, Elemental, Time.<br />
With Ldon having 2 sets of armor per class <br />
<br />
-700 ish being somewhere between hot and ornate (haven't compared much)  <br />
<br />
-1490 ish. Vt Level,(70 - 100 hp/mana) potentially upgradeable to elemental level.<br />
<br />
I rank ornate above ssraa for the usefull focus efffects and the fact they generally have pretty good mana/hp. The saves on Ldon armor aren't quite as good as vt but when you hit pop resists may as well be negative for all the good they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Most luclin bosses (RC, DS, AB...) I would place at NToV level too. Some touching the lower Ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">me at elementals level I guess :) but less hps than most ssra level shaman =] but next 145hps bracer is mine, dunno if that helps you when it comes to &quot;magelo&quot; links and where me at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's just quibbling on my part, I suppose, but I rank VT gear as superior to most PoP loot before the elemental planes. My bard is in his second VT capable guild, without ever getting in the elemental planes. I look at the drops from Tier 3 gods like the Zeks (barring rallos maybe, never inspected his loot carefully), Agnarr, Mith Marr, etc... and I don't see a darn thing I want. Usually not anything that's even a solid upgrade from my velious loot (eg cloak of the falling stars off Statue in Kael or Vindi BP), much less my various drops from Vex Thal, or my Ssra Weapons. For my weaker slots, I can still EASILY point at multiple drops in VT that will upgrade them substantially. I can't do it off the Tier 3 gods. <br />
<br />
This is one of my pet peeves about PoP. For a VT guild, there is no substantial reward in PoP before you make the elemental planes. Sure, some of the items are good, including some of the ornate armor, but VT gear is substantially better. <br />
<br />
HoT &lt; NToV &lt;= Luclin Bosses (depending on the mob) &lt; Ssra Bosses &lt; Lower Tier PoP bosses &lt; Vex Thal, Emperor, Seru &lt; Elemental Planes &lt; Time would be my ranking. <br />
<br />
Put the 760 pt LDoN gear in there around NToV gear maybe, with augments? And the 1500 pt stuff is easily of VT Caliber, counting augments. I'm now planning on saving some of my weaker slots for the 1492 pt LDoN armor rather than getting ornate or VT armor, so I can enjoy some of the type 3 augments. <br />
<br />
My &quot;little&quot; L 57 shaman is absolutely LOVING actually being able to find people who *gasp* want to go into a dungeon. That's saved my shaman for me. I can only do so much DL-style exp in PoP, and that's all I'd been able to find a group for pre-LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, it would depend a lot on what you are after.  VT offers very little for weapons.  In this regard, ssra is much better (pre elemental of course)</div></div><hr />
