If a focus affects duration type spells, it basically lists a minimum duration somewhere, so no it doesnt. Sad thing too, its a nice foci.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It works on DoTs, our curse line are the only magic based ones though (so Bane and Curse if sissilak etc).</div></div><hr />

Is this from personal experience with the focus or ??? From the Lucy spell data it doesnt look like it affects DoTs, just instant cast stuff.</div></div><hr />

Not true. Compair to improved damage v<br />

Note line 4. Instant spells only. This limits the effect to nukes.<br />
<br />
Now look at burning affliction<br />

<br />
Note line 4 again. This limit's it to spells with a minimum duration so works on dots but not on things with no duration aka nukes.<br />
<br />
Muram's Anger lacks either one of those so will work on both nukes and dots. All the new OoW focus seem to be like that at this point. In the case of Muram's Anger line 12 means it only works on magic nukes or dots.<br />
<br />

Well, I was trying to be helpful and productive (even if I was wrong)....what were you doing here??? Oh thats right the bitter prick part.....<br />
/shrug so I made a mistake, this was the first effect I had seen that affects both DoTs and nukes.</div></div><hr />

*wryly* Pot meet kettle.<br />
<br />
Muram's Anger DOES work on nukes and DOT's, and it's really great to have (I always have Bane loaded).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;3 love this focus. Outweighs all the ones I've ahd access to so far ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks like it is a good focus.  I use bane and anethema more than others anyway.  I've been convinced that they generate less aggro than BoS whether or not it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, I love how they did the new OoW focuses.  After the horrid handling of the GoD focuses by splitting everything up, they got it right this time imo. Can't wait to get a Venom of Anguish item.  45% increase dmg on both our Poison DoTs AND Poison Nukes is going to be really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its cool, I just love how so many people know they are 100% sure about things and are so clearly wrong. The lesson is not oh I tried to help even though I was wrong, the lesson is don't post unless you are sure. <br />
<br />
<br />
And that pot kettle thing, other than being old is just such a stretch in this case. Try something like, **** Buz you are a complete waste of skin, we prefer being fed bull **** than being made fun of.<br />
<br />
/smoochies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">feeling better now Buz ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">...the lesson is don't post unless you are sure. <br />
<br />
In that case, I offer:<br />
