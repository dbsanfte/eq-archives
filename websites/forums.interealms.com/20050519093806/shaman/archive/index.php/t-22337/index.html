<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone seems to think that you need an ench pet and you need the perfect group, thats not true at all. Shamans are very useful in GoD groups at these levels and I am constantly wanted by guild groups.<br />
<br />
Enches can do crowd control, sure, but vxed pulls should be single every time, and tipt aswell with a reasonable puller. Enches can't backup heal! I have done both tipt/vxed with Clr/Shm/Tank/3dps. One time that was War/rog/monk/rng, which just destroyed the expedition we were doing and it wasn't even mildly challenging to keep up with repops. The other was War,pal,sk and necro, and we still did just fine. with Heal aa's Daluda's does 1844, and focused that usually hits 2074 average, then chance to crit. With a semi-decent haste item (Wicked Bone Atlatl will do) Shamans have a 2k patch heal at 3second cast time (then subtract whatever Aura of Reverence takes off).<br />
<br />
In a normal makeup group, as in clr/shm/tank/3dps, people prefer shaman to enchanter, because we can patch heal, and with no snarer and no backup healer, it takes a special kind of ench to keep the pet in line. <br />
<br />
I must admit, I was PLed through my first Tipt by an enchanter in a qvic guild, who had something like 8.4k group-buffed, and he made it easy. He pulled everything up to Jhiru, ramp tanked the cragbeast/jhiru, tashed on inc, memblured, provided dps with pet and I am not saying that enchanters aren't overpowered. But 9 times out of 10 you get a retarded enchanter who doesn't really pay the best attention and gets killed while looking over at the TV and suddenly you wipe to a haste pooka add. Furthermore, to do a group with a charmed pet you need a perfect group almost. You need cleric, backup healer (clr/dru/shm), enchanter, snarer, tank, and 1 spot left for puller unless your enchanter is really amazing. That group is a pain in the ass to get together and there is huge risk if the enchanter isn't on the ball, or even if he is.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a normal group has no unnecessary risk, and might take 1.5 times as long. I take the normal group anyday, so quit your damn bitching.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Also, I am not speaking for higher up zones in GoD, because I am only KT flagged, I am not commenting on the raiding situation, this can be applied to KT though aswell, because I am wanted there too. I am simply addressing this to the myriad of posts I see whining about how difficult Tipt/Vxed are and how enchanters are necessary, which they aren't.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
And another thing, in a normal group I sit on horse, malos/slow on inc because I dont have GoD slow, then Bane and nuke with PR nuke 1-3 times. So we can also add dps when the pooka doesnt kill the mob before any spells can be cast.</div></div><hr />

I'm not looking to &quot;re-whine&quot; about Vxed/Tipt - but relying on &quot;enchanters watching TV and get everyone killed&quot; as how SOE will achieve class balance seems...well...goofy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Charmed pets aren't that risky with a competent enchanter.  I totally agree about avoiding groups with AFK enchanters who keep pets, though quite frankly I can't imagine what sort of idiot would go AFK with a hasted 1282-quadding pet that could break at any moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that in a group without an enchanter, we are VERY usefull.  I did a Vxed trial w/o an ENC and did most of the DPS in the group with DoTs and nukes.  <br />
<br />
With an enchanter though (who knows what the hell he is doing), we are rather useless..which I think is what most of the shaman on the board are upset with.  The mobs lasts less than 30 secs with a charmed pet.  Sure we are there to Malos(inia) the pet to help out with charm...but a mage can do that and contribute more DPS than us, and with a good cle..back up healing really isnt needed, there for we arnt really needed.  IT doesnt mean that we wont get asked to group, it doesnt mean that we dont have anything to contribute....but our utility becomes much less needed in a group with a good ENC.<br />
<br />
Most of the whining people on the boards are people who have been putting up with the high end BS for a while now, they have already posted well thought out, informative posts and they have been patient waiting for changes, now they are just fed up and are getting upset..and posting so.  <br />
<br />
People who post posts about whining, just add to the frusteration and whining posts on the boards...so in essence you are just contributing to what upset you in the first place.</div></div><hr />

I have killed most of the named in vxed, and as I have said, have killed Jhiru. It is not a problem. On Chavoor or Jhiru, as mob came in, warrior would furious, I would malos on inc, it would probably hit after jhiru had been in camp for 2-3 seconds, recast, slow, and should hit that time, I start spam patching with cleric, and sometimes DI would be necessary, most times not. On Chavoor, warrior can defensive, Jhiru its just a matter of killing it. If warrior drops, Monk/Ranger/Rogue would step up with whirlwind and if it lasted long enough to eat through monkx10seconds, rangerx15(? how long is weaponshield?), roguex10seconds we deserved to lose.<br />
<br />

<br />
Are you serious? Go back to Bastion of Thunder. Any shaman can do without kei/voq easily. And clerics should be able to aswell with a reasonable tank. In groups on non-named mobs the clerics usually chain CH and if the CH starts and a lucky hit gets in I patch. usually 3 ch'es per battle, which are really cheap 400mana unfocused unspecialized. And clerics I group with usually have some FT, self buff (8mana/tick).<br />
<br />
Bottom line is I get by without downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, Shaman should be GLAD that Charm is so good in Vxed-Tipt, because MOSTZ enchanters LOVE to have a shaman around, trust me. The love Malos.</div></div><hr />

Real original. Regardless, telling people that they can and should do vxed/tipt more often without an enchanter would hopefully give people a reason to not bitch rather than promote more bitching.<br />

<br />
Oh... I haven't been doing this for a while? I don't check these boards too often because of all the people whining about their class. I agree, shamans need a tune-up, but I don't like reading the graffe boards and being referred to as the whiner class.<br />
<br />
We need some changes, but we aren't as bad as everyone makes it seem. If I just read this board and didn't play, I would think that shamans are the worst class in the game, without competition, when that is no where near true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what groups you're doing, but in the groups I do, shaman aren't useless even with an enchanter charming a pet.<br />
<br />
My typical group makeup for Tipt/Vxed is this: monk, enchanter, paladin, ranger, cleric, and shaman, all level 65. Between them, the monk and enchanter have more than 1000 AA's, the rest of us are between 100-200 apiece. With the monk pulling, we have a steady chain of singles. The enchanter charms a pookah (not sure if I spelled that right, but they're the ugly-as-hell dragonfly/elf things) as soon as she can, and we're off to the races. I'm there to malos her pet and heal her if she takes a smack so the cleric can focus on the paladin. I'm there to slow and root mobs. I'm there to be a backup healer on the monk and ranger if they happen to take a smack. I'm constantly doing SOMEthing ... slowing, nuking (lol), healing ... I've never felt useless with that group, charmed pet or no. <br />
<br />
You're certainly right that a mage can debuff an enchanter pet and provide the group with more DPS than us, I'll not dispute that. A good cleric DOES need help healing. The one I group with is max FT with a sizeable mana pool (sorry I don't have the exact number for you, if anyone is absolutely desperate for it, I'll ask her tonight). <br />
<br />
I never have a problem getting GOD groups, whether in the sewers or Vxed/Tipt (and I got a group in Riwwi yesterday, AND got two BIC drops, go me :p). When I ask if the group has an enchanter that could slow in place of me (so sue me, I like soloing sometimes, lol), I'm told the enchanter doesn't want to slow in GOD for fear of dying and would rather have a shaman take care of it. When I ask about a beastlord, 9 times out of 10 I am told the group still wants a shaman for buffs and healing help.<br />
<br />
Of course, this isn't the way it goes for every shaman every time, and I'm certainly not saying all is rosy pink in the world. But we're certainly NOT useless. <br />
<br />

EDIT: For the record, I'm not flagged for anything (still working on that ****ing sewer trial, lol). I go to the sewers, Vxed, Tipt, and Riwwi. Kod'Taz and above may be an entirely different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, probably the only one who really needs VoQ in Tipt/Vxed is the cleric, and if they die most times it isnt going to matter if you have a chanter or not.</div></div><hr />

I am kinda surprised to read this. If there is an ench outside vxed/tipt when we head in we might ask for kei but I have never stopped an exped to get kei/voq. I am shocked people do this. For the love of god its an outdoor zone! 18 mana per tick from horse! thats your VoQ right there... If you need kei/voq for tipt how the hell do you fight in indoor zones?</div></div><hr />

The point has been missed and I feel it necessary to point out why people are complaining (or whining if you prefer) about these trials.   It's not that Shaman are useless though a strong case has been made to that effect.  Sub-optimal groups are capable of doing these trials as you've proven here.   <br />
<br />
It's that a majority of the EQ player base understands that the BEST and most efficient groups includes what is refered to as the Holy Trinity and that Shaman are easily replaceable by other classes, in fact preferably so.  <br />
<br />
You agree that shaman need tweaking, well that's the entire point right there, the fact that shaman even need tweaking in order to not only fight the perception that we are so far below optimal for a group, but to even perform to par with other classes when we used to be in high demand.<br />
<br />
Just because a person is whining, doesn't invalidate their concerns and just because you are having no problems getting groups doesn't mean that others aren't.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Honestly, the holy trinity isnt needed for these expeditions, ive had a druid healer for vxed before and a bst tank for tipt ( well we had a pooka and the bst was almost 10k buffed ). It takes alot of skill to do it without. It's funny how the mobs in KT are easier than the mobs in the trials / boggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">First off - what Tordail said.<br />
<br />
Shaman can do two things Mages can't - Root and Heal.<br />
<br />
And with a charmed Pooka - who cares about other people's DPS?  Am I missing something here? You have the charmed pet of doom - it's like the old Eddie Murphy line:<br />
<br />
&quot;You married Johhny Carson - he's got 300 MILLION. What you gonna do - get a second job at a boutique on the weekends?<br />
<br />
&quot;Here Johhny, now we got 300 million and seventy.  Cuz I want to do my share.&quot;<br />
<br />
F - that - you keep the Enchanter standing and the pet snared. Slow, heal, root. It ain't fancy - but it works.<br />
<br />
Or as we say in the Army - &quot;If it's stupid and it works - then it ain't stupid.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And allow me to reiterate, the point isn't that the holy trinity isn't needed for these particular trials.  The point is that a majority of people will not even consider making a group without it.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter that you can get by doing a trial with sub-optimal classes, what matters to virtually everyone is that they do anything in EQ as safely and efficiently as possible.... So as long as an Enchanter is looking for group, they will get chosen over a Shaman.  Sometimes this condition will persist even if no Enchanter is around, groups will frequently wait till one becomes available before even moving.  <br />
<br />
The issue here isn't whether trials and groups in GoD can be done with a Shaman.  The issue isn't that you don't need the Holy Trinity to do trials or make a decent group.   The issue is that most people don't care, they want the 'best' class for their group and would rather wait hours than choose a shaman to fill those roles that we used to be good at.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Juat as a note here. In Vxed, Enchanters aren't even an issue. With the change to only 50 kills, it is a simple crawl. I get invites all the time. Chanter, No chanter. Warrior, no warrior. Never been without a cleric though.<br />
<br />
Tipt on the other hand is VERY different. Even there, I still get plenty of invites. Look at it this way, if you have a good enchanter with pet, why would you need major DPS? Most of the Tipt groups I get have an Enchanter in them and low and behold they want me over one of the DPS classes.<br />
<br />
The first time that a friend of mine was talking about DPS + chanter. I had the chanter send ONLY his pet in against the named lizard. pet lost 2/3 health (2 CH to heal), mob died and no one even got a scratch.<br />
<br />
Now, for named Archer... the most fun I had was Shaman/Druid/Cleric/Enchanter/Ranger/Warrior. Everything you need. With Furious AND weaponshield AND pet AND slow, the cleric and druid get to heal cast one or 2 spells a piece before he is dead.<br />
<br />
Just be careful, that pet likes to break charm WAY more often inside the last room. I think this might be part of the &quot;change&quot; SOE made. Anyone else notice this?</div></div><hr />

--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If your smart and making a tipt/vxed group around a charmed pet (any enchanter will tell you the same) you don't want the enchanter to be the slower. For a few reasons. Aggro, if pet breaks early durring a fight enchanter now runs risk of getting summoned because pet dps is alot of aggro for the enchanter so you should try to minimalize it. Please don't say you don't even need to slow the mobs, because for the same reason above if pet breaks during a fight and you have an unslowed mob for xxxx amount of time your tank or who ever is taking heavy damage. Enc's dont have a magic trick that lets them insta recharm and mez every mob in site during a charm break. If enc goes down then you have yet another mob in the camp to deal with, pet (and usually leads to the whipe). So hence having a shaman would be the ideal spot in your group as slower since he can also heal enchanter while the cleric is getting the tank durring a break or root pet or whatever (not all enchanters are super dooper uber and dont need help when charm breaks, its just reality they do get hit sometimes or have resists). Remember when you have a charmed pet the entire group is centered on that pets dps, so adjust your playing to fit the situation and its all about utility which we have tons have. An ideal tipt group for me would be (and I've won about 20+ times) Cleric, Tank, Rng(for WS/Snare), Shm, Necro (Res if cleric dies), Enc. This is a no fail set up. Remember if pet breaks and enc can't get control a quick slow on it can save the day even if it costs you a few minutes.  To me I fail to see how shaman are not desirable on tipt/vxed runs with a pet because I personaly know I make the difference between a win and a loss every mission I do. My heart does go out for all those dps classes though who have no spot in these groups because its irrelavant with a charmed pet. Why have a monk? rogue? bst? wizard? mage? necro (if really solid group)? Yes you dont need an enc pet to do these trials, but when it cuts the time in half why not? Oh and here is a reality check, how desirable is an Enc in a KT exp group where nothing can be charmed? Anyways, thats my take on it. <br />

This won't work any more.  Defensive and weaponshield (and I'm assuming the rest of the &quot;I can't be hit anymore&quot; /discs) make you lose aggro when you pop them.</div></div><hr />

They are more desirable, not by much, and its no more balanced for us to be wanted more than they are.<br />

Little bit more heals, little bigger nukes, maybe something with our buffs. We will be fine.</div></div><hr />

Druids heals surpass the dmg saved by our slow+heals (when mitigated, and obviously when immune).<br />
<br />
Enc dps surpassed the dmg saved by our slow+heals, and then some.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, a shm/cleric+tank+3xdps can do it, but a druid or enc does it better.  If you think your 1300 hp fast heal compares to the dmg saved cause a charmed pet is dishing out 500dps+, or you think your fast heal compares to a druids fast heal when the mob mitigates slow anyways.... well, you are wrong.  <br />
<br />
The only time a druid/cleric is &lt; a shm/cleric is when the shaman has his heal foci maxed and the druid does not, and the mob is partially or fully slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't heal for 1300. I heal for 1844 + 25% focus. Just because you don't have GoD Spell or any aa doesn't mean that I don't.<br />

Average crit = 3918<br />
<br />
Also... clr/dru is not &gt; clr/shm... who slows in this magical scenario?<br />
<br />
clr/ench &gt; clr/shm maybe, most clerics have trouble keeping tanks up on named solo, even if the fight doesn't last long.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Now. clr/dru/ench &gt; clr/shm/ench ONLY if the enchanter is comfortable slowing<br />
<br />
Whenever the cleric gets low on mana if we are without kei/voq, I take over healing fo a few mobs. I can usually do 5-6 mobs before I go from sitting at 80 to needing a break at 20-30. During that time the cleric is back to normal mana. And that is with slowing aswell.<br />
<br />
Druids can be the main healers for vxed, but it needs to be a really good druid, and a backup healer such as shaman.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I dunno how I got myself into this argument if thats what it is, I am not saying our healing is amazing. Our CH needs retuning for one, because if its me and a druid healing with just our patch heals, I can keep it up longer than them, a druid can still effectively use their CH though.<br />
<br />
Bottom line the holy trinity needs a backup healer one way or another, and shaman fills that slot better than druid. And non-holy trinity groups work just fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Last time I looked Druids couldn't malos or slow, and Shaman couldnt snare. When you go into these things with a chanter you want to take a balanced group, and you build your functionality around that. You want someone who can snare (quite a few classes can do that), you want someone who can slow besides the chanter (and I dont care what any of you say - having an unslowed mob quading you for 1300+ when you are tanking is very high risk when you dont want risk - the people who say these things have obviously never tanked these trials), you want someone who can malos/mala the pooka, you want someone who can act as secondary healer. Beyond that you want a proper puller (not someone who could do it, but has no escape options on a resist), and having one or two rooters is nice. In parts of these zones having someone capable on interupting gate makes life way easier as well. You want a tank, preferably one with a riposte disc (ie a warrior). Having someone else with a riposte disc (monk or rogue) would be nice, allthough ranger WS will do (thats a parry disc though).<br />
<br />
Obviously you can make groups with quite a few classes and still do just as well. The only essential class really are clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Torp, not all of us have the focii, AA and spells you do in order to heal like you.  My point of veiw is different than yours because i can heal for just over 1500 tops between AA and focii.<br />
<br />
In a group with a good enchanter and cleric...my heals are rarely needed...especially if there is a druid there.  I am there for Malos(inia) and FA on the pet the entire time, and buffs are easily bot-ed.  Doesnt mean I dont find other things to do in a group...but it doesnt mean that i'm as useful as, say, a mage would be in my spot.  My heals are pidly (hell 1 hit for max from any trash takes most of what i heal for away), my slow is negated by the fact the mob lives for about 15 secs-ish, the druid or ranger can root as well as i can (well better really AND SNARE), A druid can better back up heal AND snare, a mage can out DPS in a short fight....<br />
<br />
Are we useless in Vexd/tipt?....kinda.  Thinking outside the box gives us more to do, but it doesnt mean that another class cant fill our spot better than us in Vexd/tipt.  <br />
<br />
  I don't heal for 1300. I heal for 1844 + 25% focus. Just because you don't have GoD Spell or any aa doesn't mean that I don't. <br />
<br />
Torp, You cant base an argument against the entire shaman community on healing if you clearly have superior healing abilities than a chunk of the shaman out there doin Vexd/Tipt.  I have farmed the hell outta Vexd and have yet to see any spells...I'm not alone on this.  <br />
<br />
As For buffs and the cle/shm &gt; cle/dru....you're right...but who's to say you can either bot a sham for the buffs or pay a near by sham for 7 and Sta?<br />
<br />
Slowing is nice and all..but with a charmed, hasted and wpns on a pet...the mob doesnt live long enough for slow to be effective.  You said it your self...with an enchanter, druids and shaman are back up.  Groups dont need both.  Without an enchanter...hell yeah a shaman is definatly effective...hell we'll contribute a HUGE chunk of the dps and slows will help because the mobs last for a lot longer.  <br />
<br />
Most of the arguments and general upset-ness comes from grouping with chanters mostly in Vexd/Tipt.  Most people wont group without one in there.<br />

I don't know about this. I notice a pretty big difference on when the cleric is calling out NEED TO MED. Even with a pet, the Tank is still taking damage and the Cleric still has to heal. The pet still break which means the Cleric has to heal ABUNCH more. Enchanter pet or not, people still like to have those mobs slowed. Also, keeping everyone topped off with Qui saves cleric a bunch of mana. <br />
<br />
...Just some things I've noticed from experience.<br />
<br />
Actually, it's not that bad for Shaman in these trials. Enchanter pet or not. I can see people having a problem with pickup groups, but thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Some things i've noticed.<br />
<br />
Daladula's mending while it helps actually heal, it doesn't help you get a group at all*.  When checking for people who are lfg, it doesn't mention if you have it so unless people remember that you have it this doens't help you get a group. (* this might help you get a group from friends, but then again, they would most likely give you a group anyway).<br />
<br />
 ................mob dies in 30 secs with a charmed pet.........<br />
<br />
Well, with a charming chantter, this is your first problem.  It is possible to get a mob to die less than 10 secs after a tank engages, and the pet starts attacking after the tank engages.  This just a little thinking and preperation.  <br />
<br />
Lets take 2 hypothetical groups (well not hypothetical, these are my experiances).  They are the same (actually 5 people were the same) except for one thing, good tank vs. ok tank (group: me, cleric, druid, chatter, rogue, war).  I was pulling for both groups.  I would pull with malos run back to the camp, and stand just behind the MT.  They would engage, i would slow the mob pet engages 10-20 secs later  mob dies, rinse and repeate to the crag beast room (no deaths either time).  For both attempts no one died, and the cleric didn't need to heal the group with only the ok tank.  Before this room i checked the cleric's mana both times.  With the good tank, the cleric was always at 90m+, with the ok tank, we had taken 2 sort med breaks before getting here.  I was also pulling for both groups, and would normally slow at about the same time, so this wasn't the reason.<br />
<br />
Then, i decided to have a little fun and test a theory.  Instead of slowing the mob when i brought it to the camp, i used that time to instead run and get ready to pull another mob instead of slowing.  I would wait untill i got the xp message and malos the new mob (asuming i got that far).  The group actually prefered this opposed to me actually slowing the mob because of the speed at which it died.  <br />
<br />
2 things to note here.  First the group would rather have me pull than slow.  And two, slowing saved the cleric less mana than a tank upgrade.  The tanks were my guild's MT as the good one, and another EP geared tank as the ok one fyi, neither are slackers.  <br />
<br />
And for charming primarily it should be broken every 5 or so mobs to prevent bad breaks.  By doing this i never had to remalos the pet when a break occured becuase it was always done when charm was refreshed.  By doing this i didn't need to be in the camp when it broke.  Usually when charm broke, something like this occured:  cleric finishes current heal on tank (if tank needs it, or it's close otherwise he ducks), uses 1 sec cast time on pet.  Druid resnares pet and takes over healing on tank if needed (normally not).  Chantter quick mez's ex pet, then charms it at his next convience.  If needed chantter would slow the mob that's in the camp now if i hadn't done it (see above, group would rather me pulling than slowing).  To make a worst case senario: Cleric must chain spam heal tank, druid somehow can't snare/root pet, chantter can't mez/charm pet, i'm at the mob that's next in line to pull.  If this were to happen... the chantter would just kite the mob as there was always room, and the druid's root can't be resisted forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hail,<br />
<br />
I agree with Warren.  (/wave, good to see you!)<br />
It really doesn't matter that groups CAN get through trials without the Holy Trinity.  MOST folks simply won't try it.  They would rather sit on their butts outside the entrance hunting down whichever part of the trinity they are missing instead of try with a less efficient (but capable and competent) group.  Once they have the trinity, picking a shaman over other classes in my experience doesn't happen often unless the enchanter demands one or you have a friend already in the group.<br />
<br />
Most shaman don't have a 25% heal focus, aren't wearing 6 pieces of Rosrak's, and they don't have 4200+ unbuffed hp.  The fact that you can do well in Tipt/Vxed is great and really not surprising Torp.<br />
<br />
But whining about others who can't is assinine.<br />
Any level 65 character with 100+ aa's and pre-EP gear can probably do just fine in those trials for just about every class.  But the power curve for shaman at that level makes us less desirable to the masses than almost any other class in the same AA/gear area.  Not that we can't be an asset in those trials with that many aa's or gear, but that we just aren't wanted much of the time over someone else.<br />
<br />
I'm 420+ aa's and 4k unbuffed.  I've done Tipt &amp; Vxed but part of the reason I even got into the groups I did is because there are people who KNOW me &amp; understand that I'm not your average BoT exp Prophet.  Whereas I have to be exceptional to do well in getting GoD groups, many other classes can get groups easily and do just fine being mediocre in poorer gear &amp; fewer aa's.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't have to have a ton of aa's and amazing gear just to get groups in GoD content!  A similar thing happened back aways with the PoJ trials wehn they first came out.  Remember those?  An average shaman just wasn't wanted much of the time, even if they had more levels &amp; AA's than a random DPS class.  Either you got help getting pushed through or you had a very strong group that might have succeeded without you there.<br />
<br />
Now the game has matured enough that some of those PoP trials are pretty much a joke &amp; a group of just about anything in their 60's will win.  I usually power 2 low level people through when I go now (like upper 40's).<br />
<br />
Eventually I'm sure the GoD trials will reach that stage as well, but right now while they are still relatively new the folks working on them will most of the time look right past the average shaman LFG and pick someone else.  Not because the shaman isn't capable, but because we aren't optimal to the trial's success. <br />
<br />
I don't think these two trials need to be changed any more than they already have.  They are doable.  We as shaman just have to be more proactive in showing our merits and push the edge of our capabilities in order to prove our worth.  The fact that many other classes can be relatively lazy and still do an adequate job sometimes annoys me, but I enjoy the challenge.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously a cleric would drop Fo7 and use their self buff, which would mean a few less hp for the cleric, but thats not really a big deal in my opinion. And 9/Zealot don't stack so dunno what you are getting at here.<br />
<br />
 Most shaman don't have a 25% heal focus, aren't wearing 6 pieces of Rosrak's, and they don't have 4200+ unbuffed hp. The fact that you can do well in Tipt/Vxed is great and really not surprising Torp.<br />

Any level 65 character with 100+ aa's and pre-EP gear can probably do just fine in those trials for just about every class. <br />
<br />
The trials were not tuned to newly 65 shamans without any aa. Healing aa's (especially seeing as our healing is looking to be our most important ability in GoD) are probably going to be relatively early aa's. I waited until 150's, but I think most people who are smarter than me would probably do them around 60-85. &lt;--- thats a reasonable aa expectation for vxed/tipt.<br />
<br />
Also, spells. I saw the thread about people who don't have spells, well --after the rune change-- that is rediculous. I have been doing GoD expeds for maybe 3-4 weeks. I have won my heal spell, I am KT flagged, and I have lost on Yiktu rune for slow to 5 people. The spells are accessible. The eril rune has dropped from sewers1 boss for me, I got it as a spell from chavoor pre-rune change, seen it drop from chavoor as a rune, seen it come from a minor named in sewers. Yiktu rune I have seen 4 times dropping from Umbiki (easy as hell to farm named in Vxed) and once in a sewers named. And if you just want to farm named, build a group. have each of you 6 go get an exped ungrouped, all zone in, wait the 10 mins for the phes that are down to spawn and see if you get a roamer umbiki near zone, and kill it, then rinse and repeat. Check with fd class to run up, or just use bard horse to run to chav room and run back out. It is easy to train around without being hit until you get to the ukun chains mobs. Note: Anyone can get tipt/vxed expeditions now, sewers flag not needed except for progression.<br />
<br />
People don't have the spells because A) they aren't the level required for content B) they aren't in a guild where they can make a group and encourage people to do more GoD trials (I feel bad for these people, because thats not their fault) or C) they are known retards on their server and don't get invited to most groups, let alone tipt/vxed or D) Don't take any initiative to get GoD Groups and don't try to form their own (any pack of retards from BoT can do sewers post nerf the dps is so low) In sewers 3 the burrower spawns almost every time, and after 20 mobs sludge-fly or rigara can spawn, easy kills, might tkae some time, at a little bit worse than BoT exp.<br />
<br />
 I have farmed the hell outta Vexd and have yet to see any spells...I'm not alone on this. <br />
<br />
Never seen any or never won any? And this right here makes me want to make a big farming vxed: the easy way post. Because chav/umbiki drop eril/yiktu rune respectively, easy to farm without an ench pet without getting caught in repops.</div></div><hr />

You dont need to slow when the charmed pet is around, allthough you would be stupid not to if you can. The problem is when the charmed pet is not around and is instead down the canyon chasing your chanter. Sure, the cleric can heal through it, but if the tank's hp is plummeting to 10-20% between heals on a regular basis you could wipe at any moment. Why take the chance? Just because someone who has never tanked these things before says you dont need to slow? As someone pointed out earlier, the dps comes from the pet. Everyone else is there to support the chanter and to make sure that the group survives when he is pre-occupied.<br />
<br />
I also know that people say that a druid/cleric will keep a tank up on an unslowed mob under those circumstances, and that may be true. However, they forget that the druid is probably also the snarer, and as such will likely be chasing the pooka to resnare on charm breaks.</div></div><hr />

Usually when charm breaks I take over healing mt while snarer gets aggro and cleric stuns/keeps chanter up.<br />

The best chanters and necros I have ever grouped with have all asked me NOT to slow their pets when charm breaks.  Instead I used to re-malos and a snare class hits the charmed mob while I watch the chanter's health.  This process, apparently, is better for DPS and the chanter isn't as dependant on slow landing.  In these situations I could do the job, but my group would have been better off replacing me (the point being there was no job I could hold in this high DPS group that a shaman could be the &quot;best&quot; at, or that the group couldn't benefit more from replacing the shaman with another class).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Plain and simple, fact is that when groups are put together for these trials they're looking for the following setup:<br />
<br />
 Cleric - A must for Rezes<br />
 Enchanter - The most important class for vxed/tipt because everyone believes you need a charm pet to pass.<br />
 Snarer - Either a ranger or druid.<br />
 Malo'r - Can be filled by a mage or shaman.  Groups want us only for malosinia so the pet behaves nicer.<br />
 DPS/Melee classes - Pick random dps classes and insert.<br />
 <br />
<br />
So the problem is that: <br />
<br />
 We're not considered dps classes, so we can't join the group as part of the DPS slot.  <br />
 Our slow is pretty much overlooked in these trials, with a charm pet, mobs die too quick anyways, and chanter can slow boss.<br />
 For the only slot in which we are needed, the malo slot.  A mage will always be chosen over a shaman because of higher DPS.  In fact lots of groups don't even consider the malo slot, let alone know if malo is needed or not.<br />

I can function as sole healer, as a shaman, in a KT group on all mobs except for named ones. I've functioned as sole healer in almost all zones in experience groups. I even functioned as main healer in a PoD CY group back when I was level 59.  There was another shaman in the group, but he was mostly healing himself after getting slow aggro.  The tank even told me I did better than most clerics he grouped with.<br />

Yup, I brought that point up as well to my chanter friends and they said it ate into their DPS for short periods and that they didn't need shaman slow to stay alive anyway. /shrug  makes more sense to me to slow those mobs, but I catch hell from my friends for doing it, so I stopped.</div></div><hr />

Are you maxed on healing AA's and item focus? (My point:  balance should not revolve around items and AA's. It should be inherent to the class.)<br />
<br />
Would the group kill faster/be safer with a rezzer and enchanter?<br />
<br />

My point isn't that the shaman class doesn't work.  My point is, we do not bring anything exceptional to a group.  When you think &quot;shaman&quot; you don't go &quot;Oh, they are the best at this, we want them for X role&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am tired of hearing everyone say this. 65 was last expansion, I find it perfectly fine to balance shamans with aa. 1850heal for shaman, 2500 for druid. or 1550 for shm, 2100 for druid, who cares.<br />
<br />
Also, exp is better without a charmed pet. In a normal format group, I can do a bane after slowing and have it wear off 50% of the time, ideal IMO. And the experience is about 4% a kill with ~1 minute fights, I malos as soon as I see it inc. and maybe 30 seconds before the next mob comes in.<br />
<br />
What I hear from everyone is that we do fine, but everyone wants enches anyways, enches are good for winning, not for getting experience. Also, its not VI's fault that all the people you want to group with are retarded. Most of the complaints I see about our balance have more to do with you guys grouping with idiots than anything else... <br />

If every single class were balanced perfectly with zero items and zero aa's, then as soon as one character of any class has more aa's and/or better gear then the balance no longer exists.  The *only* way to truly balance classes is through aa's and gear because of player progression.<br />
<br />
My point isn't that the shaman class doesn't work.  My point is, we do not bring anything exceptional to a group.  When you think &quot;shaman&quot; you don't go &quot;Oh, they are the best at this, we want them for X role&quot;.<br />
<br />
Shaman never have been the type of class you just described.  The only classes that would really fit that statement would be a war due to defensive and a cleric due to complete heal.  I haven't ever seen Shaman as desireable for just slow alone because just like the other slowing classes, it's one of many abilities we bring to a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">yep, the shaman is a utility class; if you want to be the best at something reroll a warrior to tank, a cleric to heal, an enchanter to do crowd control, a bard to pull, or a wizard/rogue to deal damage.<br />
<br />
if you want to be able to solo a bit, help with crowd control, backup heal, and generally have a lot of skills to fall back on in emergency situations, play a shaman.<br />
<br />
a lot of the grief that shaman, knights, and the more utility-based dps classes are feeling arises from the inevitable fact that groups made up of the proper balance of specialty classes perform at a higher level than those composed of the various utility classes.  this has always been the case, it's just that the gates expansion, with all its hard-hitting fast paced one group encounters, has made the oddball utility groups a lot less feasible than they were in the planes, or luclin, or velious and so on down the line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I can function as sole healer, as a shaman, in a KT group on all mobs except for named ones. I've functioned as sole healer in almost all zones in experience groups. I even functioned as main healer in a PoD CY group back when I was level 59.  There was another shaman in the group, but he was mostly healing himself after getting slow aggro.  The tank even told me I did better than most clerics he grouped with.<br />
<br />
And DPS isn't really a problem for the groups I'm usually in, it's a steady flow of mobs to kill.<br />
<br />
Frankly, as far as places like KT go, it's all dependant on the tank how well you heal, not on your healing capabilities.  I would bet my entire (EQ) bankroll that your tank was pretty damn uber.  I've done more than enough KT xping to know this.   I don't care how many AA you've got in healing, and what focuses you have, but even with an uber tank I would be guessing you would have been totally unable to keep up if something went wrong.  <br />
<br />
Basically, you were lucky, and had a good group to keep easy single pulls, good snap agro generation and agro keeping, and a warrior with probably 2300-2400AC and 11-12k hps.  I've grouped with our warriors in this range, and then compare them to the warriors who are only at 2kAC, and 10-11k hps, and the difference is quite astounding in the amount of healing needed.  Additionally, if you had a hybdrid such as a paladin or SK, I am damn sure you would not have been able to deal with it as well.  I've watched 11k+ paladins tank in KT, and the damage spikes are quite large compared to warriors.  Redo the KT group with a less well equipped group and then come back and tell us how well you healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The best chanters and necros I have ever grouped with have all asked me NOT to slow their pets when charm breaks.  Instead I used to re-malos and a snare class hits the charmed mob while I watch the chanter's health.  This process, apparently, is better for DPS and the chanter isn't as dependant on slow landing.  In these situations I could do the job, but my group would have been better off replacing me (the point being there was no job I could hold in this high DPS group that a shaman could be the &quot;best&quot; at, or that the group couldn't benefit more from replacing the shaman with another class).<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about slowing the pet, I'm referring to the other mob you are fighting when/if charm breaks. Before GoD was nerfed they would put out considerable dps. After the nerf it was ok, but from what I hear the trash is back to the original atk values.<br />
<br />
What you described is pretty much what I did at the time on my shaman when I still did that content, with the exception that I would slow the mob we were fighting as soon as it was practical.</div></div><hr />

I've tanked in KT with 2kAC/11khp when our cleric took an extended afk, with a shaman healing, and we had no problems. The pull rate didnt change. It is doable once the mob is slowed. Getting singles there is dead easy anyway. All the recent changes to our HoTs have made a significant difference in grinding situations.</div></div><hr />

his response<br />
<br />
I am tired of hearing everyone say this. 65 was last expansion, I find it perfectly fine to balance shamans with aa. 1850heal for shaman, 2500 for druid. or 1550 for shm, 2100 for druid, who cares.<br />
<br />
my response.<br />
<br />
I think I phrased that poorly.  What I meant to say in regards to being able to be the primary healer in a KT group was that I'm guessing it took maxed focus and AA for you to be that healer, whereas, a druid or cleric can be that healer without the AA and focus.  <br />
<br />
What I'm saying is, we shouldn't have to max our AA and focus to be that primary healer when other classes do not.  If all the healing classes had to max focus and AA to be effective, thats one thing... but it seems to just be the shaman that needs the boost.<br />

<br />

<br />
Well, I partially agree with you.   I agree that we haven't been wanted in the past only for slow.  We were also desired for our buffs and healing.  Now that our healing has fallen behind, now that our buffs are largely worthless, and now that our slow has been &quot;mitigated&quot; and now has competition from other classes who's other abilities still function fine, we aren't as desirable.<br />
<br />
When slow isn't mitigated, that extra 5% over an enchanter adds up over time.  Our primary role WAS a slowing class, who's heals were balanced around that slow. Our disease slow (think Emp ssra), was also a trademark, further entrenching the idea that the shaman was, hands down, the best slowing class in the game.  Our AE slow further categorized us as a slowing class.<br />
<br />
While we were never wanted ONLY for slow, slow certainly was our biggest assest to a group/raid.  Gear that effectively nerfs our stat buffs, content that nerfs our slow, and healing that was balanced around that once powerful slow, makes for a grim situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I just won a tipt with Clr/Shm/monk/war/wiz/wiz. Great experience, and easy win. Mobs went down really fast. 1 casualty on Jhiru, monk, after WW wore off. Quick note: Riposte Discs can be used on jhiru, only thing restricted is defensive, I just tested it.<br />
<br />
Whole expedition took about 2 hours, got 3.5 aa. You won't get that much aa with an enchanter, pet soaks up an assload of experience. So that group was a lot better than winning in 1.5 hours and getting 2aa imo.<br />

<br />
While this is kinda true, it's a moot point. Doing this kind of content if you plan to be part of a group and be a contributing member, you need to have a good amount of aa, and everyone needs to.<br />
<br />
 This point is kinda like saying that we need better mana regen because not everyone has canni5, and without canni5 our more expensive spells and patching and using a lot of mana we can't keep up. <br />
<br />
There are certain times when aa should be expected as a part of balance.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, a druid is supposed to be a better healer than us. We aren't supposed to be able to main heal and slow in KT, but we can with AA/Foci. Druids are better healers, with no aa/foci they might be able to, but its highly unlikely. With aa/foci the average druid can main healer a group. With aa/foci a great shaman can full-time main healer a group in KT(I haven't tried in KT, but I can't keep it up for more than 15 minutes in Tipt/vxed, it wears me down).<br />
<br />
Also, the people responding in this thread seem to think that any druid can main heal a tipt/vxed with no-aa. THEY CAN'T! Only time this has happened with me i when a uqua guild druid with a 12k uqua guild tank was able to main heal a group, I have no doubt the druid has a minimum of 300aa.</div></div><hr />

only responding because he said 'people responding in this thread seem to think....'<br />

I know a sup-par druid with no AA or focii can not MH in vexd and tipt.  But only a seriously above the line, LOTS AND LOTS of aa, focii and the right spells...can a sham be a GOOD back up healer (true back up healer..not just throwing a fast tnarg's on the enc when the charm breaks.).  Doesnt mean we can't do it...just means that you truly need to be more of an outstanding sham in terms of euip, AA and spells.<br />
<br />
And in response to an early post torp, i didnt SEE any sham spells (pre patch, saw lots of wiz and bst though :( ), and havnt seen any spells since (but gave up farming the hell outta vexd shortly after patch because I hadnt seen any spells and had better things to do).</div></div><hr />

I dunno about that one. Go leaf through my Magelo if you're of a mind, it's linked in my signature. I don't consider myself &quot;seriously above the line,&quot; (is 3700+ HP unbuffed above the line??) and I only have 160 AA. I have HA, HG, AHA and AHG all maxxed, with no healing focii on my gear, and I do just fine as a backup healer. <br />

Don't be stupid 11k hps and 2k ac is AMAZING gear.. take a 10k paladin and get your ass handed to you.. or a 10k warrior with 1800ac..<br />
<br />
And I bot 2 differnet warriors, one is 2100ac 11.3k hps and the other is 11.6khps 2200AC, both pretty much have db eoe almost full time gear and are at that.. vt geared I remember was 9k ish.. with the new aa take a 9.5k vt geared tank, full aa'd you're still going to get owned.<br />
<br />
Right now I malos/slow on inc and a db tank with incite can keep aggro barely by shooting arrows.</div></div><hr />
