<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Roor rot is the only way and you may want to slow them too as they hit for a fair bit if root breaks. <br />
<br />
The aggro range is quite small but there are a number of roamers in the pit and in the tunnels so just be careful and you'll be ok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sure you can :) However having certain equipment, spells and AA will make things much easier. Specifically:<br />
<br />
Essential: (suicide without)<br />
Malo(s)<br />
Torpor or better<br />
<br />
Very Highly Desirable<br />
Non-DD DoTs (at least 2 of Ulthor, Saryrn, Bane, Anaethma)<br />
VP3<br />
<br />
Nice to have:<br />
Epic<br />
Clicky root<br />
BA4, Crit Dots<br />
Bo9/Virtue<br />
LR5<br />
Canni V, Kei, FT etc<br />
Radiant Cure<br />

Important Notes for Pit<br />
Wraith type mobs see invis, the rest don't<br />
Diaku mitigate slow, the rest don't<br />
Aggro range is pretty low<br />
Mobs resist root quite a lot even after malos, but VP is near fool-proof after MD<br />
Oracles and wraiths can dispell (you or themselves) and root<br />
SKs cast some dots but nothing too major<br />
Other mobs are straight melee.<br />
Zone out is in the near-right corner of pit from zone in.<br />
<br />
<br />
My tactics:<br />
Bind outside. Buff up, including levitate and invis.<br />
Zone in to the pit, float/run down the left side to the far left corner, avoiding any undead that might see through invis.<br />
Go through the tunnel into the small square room. There are 2 diaku in opposite corners, and one roamer mob that paths through the middle of the room. On your left are the pig pens.<br />
<br />
The two corner mobs will never aggro if you don't go near them, so you can leave em up, or go kill em if you feel safer that way.<br />
<br />
I move to the near right corner, and await the roamer. DR debuff it and then VP (or malos + root), slow if you feel safer with slow on (I know I do!), then just root rot til dead. Start a timer, repop will be in 27 minutes IIRC.<br />
<br />
Once the roamer is dead I invis up and head back to the pit, looking for any named mobs (enraged war boars and frenzied initiates seem most common). If I find one, wait for a clear pull back to the pig-pen room and root-rot as before. If nothing special is up, pull anything else to clear the spawns and hope a named might pop later.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out for the &quot;stampeding hooves&quot; message - this means piglet is on the way. Finish off your current mob fast, or get it positioned out the way right in the corner and root it there. Invis up and wait for the stampede. Try to get piglet on target, wait for it to come back around at the end of the stampede and if its clear on its own, root it and proceed to root rot, making sure you stay pretty close to it at all times. More detail on other threads if you use search :) If you get adds rooting piglet you have a chance to zone out and run back fast with VP3 to still catch it... if you're lucky and zone fast.</div></div><hr />

Soloing in the pit in Tactics is my hunting ground of choice.<br />
I can do it self-buffed, but I recommend FT Tribute points (if you aren't capped) and VoQ for efficiency.  If you want, you can add Regen X Tribute and Affliction Efficiency IV as well.  That will be spending a little over 10 tribute points a minute with all 3 of those going, but it is worth it.  If you don't have BA4, buy or beg a Rallican's Steel Bracelet from a Magician.  Virtue will give you extra breathing room if you aren't used to soloing there, but it isn't essential if you are 3500hp+ unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Root rot is the only way...  <br />
I disagree, but it is the best way. ;)   If you don't have 2 non-DD component DoTs, don't bother with Tactics solo.  You don't HAVE to root/rot, but it is the easiest way.  If you fully buff dogdog, equip him with mage weapons, mask, belt, and then get him a Virtue or 9, he can tank the fully slowable trash pit mobs, but not the Diakus (mitigated slow means he'll croak).  The upgrade Q plus the occasional Tnarg's can keep him up if you need/want to do this, though it isn't efficient.<br />
<br />
Bane, Blood of Saryn, Anathema, Epic is my normal Tactics DoT lineup.  Mob dependent I will add Breath of Ultor to that mix.<br />
<br />
Wraith type mobs see invis, the rest don't<br />
That's close, but incorrect.<br />
Tortured Souls &amp; War Wraiths will always see invis.  *SOME* boar beasts will also see invis, so /con them if you are running invis through the stables or back hall.  As an additional warning, some of the Zek Initiates can see invis if they were previously used as an enchanter's charm pet - so beware any of them dual wielding swords or red flashy globes (mage weapons) while you are running around invis.  I personally seek these former pets out for root/rotting to get dogdog free toys - don't pet tank them.  War Crows are sometimes hard to see, so keep your eyes peeled for them when pulling.  It is generally VERY easy to single pull anything from the pit if you are a little patient.<br />
<br />
There are 3 zone-outs in Tactics.  The one near the zone-in, the one in the corner of the pit, and another in the back corner of the stables.  The one in the stables will be 'magically locked shut' if Glykus (the pig farmer) is up, so be careful if you are using that as your escape route.  Be sure to bind yourself right outside by the stone to Tactics for gate/CR purposes.<br />
<br />
Frenzied Initiates have ~10khp MORE than standard zek initiates, and they FLURRY.  Root/rot only if you are soloing.  They uncommonly drop spectral parchments.  Zelrin Morlock is the named war wraith.  Typically drops a spectral parchment.  Can also drop gauntlets or bracer pattern/mold or one of 2 shields (neither of which we can use).  Enraged War Boars are the named boar (separate from a stampeding piglet) that can also drop gloves/bracer mold or a War Crested ring, a bard sword, or a Gold Tipped Boar Horn (used in Cloak of Greater Pernicity quest).  Several posts in this forum already deal with A stampeding piglet, so I won't cover that here.<br />
<br />
Glykus the pig farmer can be done with 3 people.  I've been farming him regularly now with a druid and enchanter. 24 hr respawn.  The Diakus Overseer can also be single grouped, but is more difficult.  Avoid them both solo. ;)   Be nice to the soloing enchanters or druids in the zone, and you may be able to team up short-term with them for Glykus kills. :) <br />
<br />
The tunnel on the left (near the stables) is much safer for soloing than the tunnel on the right.  I use the tunnel on the right only for single kills when I have a clear single pull to there.  The right tunnel gets TONS more wanderers going through it.  Do not camp the zone-out in the pit - too many people train out there, and it is just lame to block a zone-out that is so out of the way.  This will likely be your most commonly used escape route.  I'd recommend zoning if you ever have 3 or more mobs engaged at once, even if all 3 are safely root parked.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion 2 and a clicky invis item (I use a Tae Ew Ritualist Mask) are also nice to have items for soloing here.  Suspend pet and click invis to scout any time you like.  I generally do this right after a kill while I'm regenning w/ Quiescence on after smacking Canni5.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call is a great way to buy yourself time if an unanticipated add comes your way.  SC the add, then root it and slow it.  The dogs should take aggro very quickly.  Virulent paralysis is also a great way to handle single adds.<br />
<br />
Also be aware that most of these mobs will run at 15-20% health, so have some sort of plan with dealing with that if you aren't straight up root/rotting.  All of these mobs are social, and a mob at 6% that gets a little too close to the pit may end up bringing 2-3 adds because you didn't finish him off fast enough.  Clicky root is awesome for handling this.<br />
<br />

 almost there :)  the souls and wraiths are undead. I don't understand your distinction in terms of the context of my post.  Yes, you are right, they are undead - which means they will see through invis.   I wasn't addressing what mobs were live or undead, just describing which see through our regular crappy invis or not.  ;)   I can't think of any reason to worry about them being undead when soloing, as they certainly aren't worth burning an IVU potion over, and I don't know many (any?) shaman who have a different method for soloing an undead mob versus a live one in Tactics once engaged. :p  But if that was your point (that you could IVU through them), you are correct. :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
I do not believe that. 54 means no malo(s), no petrifying earth, no torpor/Q, no Dot without DD (only anathema). I kill them at 65 with full spell book, heavily using Bane and BoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,I do not believe that. 54 means no malo(s), no petrifying earth, no torpor/Q, no Dot without DD (only anathema). I kill them at 65 with full spell book, heavily using Bane and BoS.  <br />
Originally, I agreed with you Dohrian, but now after doing some digging I think it might be possible.  I don't know if Frakass actually did it or not at 54, but consider what a 54 shaman (albeit extremely twinked) could use today:<br />
<br />
Ornate pants means clicky root for zero mana every ~60 seconds.  Considering the spells one would have to use to pull this off, clicky root makes this feat much more possible.  Scaled Avatar's Leggings have no required level to wear - I believe they'll click for anyone over 51, though I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
No Malos, but he does have Malosi.  Malos debuffs 55, Malosi debuffs 60 (Malosinia is -70).  If you figure a single pulled a Tortured Soul with Malosi from max range (supple scale armband is extend range III and easily obtainable at 54) and it landed, the bulk of the rest of the spells ought to be landing most of the time even against a red con w/ this debuff in place.  Root it before it comes within melee range, and then back up to max spell range again.  <br />
<br />
Tortured Souls in my experience are not very resistant, and they seem to me to have the fewest total hitpoints of any pit mob in Tactics - though I haven't done any indepth hp analysis of all the pit  mobs.<br />
<br />
For DoT's, he would be using Curse of the Spirits, Anathema, Odium, Plague (preceded by Insidious decay for DR debuffing), and possibly Ebolt.  This means he would probably lead with Epic dot (mana-free), then Insidious Decay.  Cast Plague from max (extended) range, re-applying clicky root if it breaks when Plague lands.  Then loads on Anathma and Odium (with no fear of breaking root) and capping the rotation off with Ebolt.  Though personally I think it might be better (&amp; safer) to just stick Epic, Anathema, and Odium so you don't need to worry about so many root casts (w/ resists likely getting you killed or wasting too much mana.)  Plague only needs to be re-applied every 2 minutes, which isn't that bad and could possibly be cast as soon as a root was about to break anyway if you were very careful with the timing.<br />
<br />
CanniIII in between DoT casts, with Stoicism running most of the time.  Bone Clasped Girdle (or a Coldain Military Wristguard) with Burning Affliction III on it means every DoT does extra damage, and Affliction Efficiency III (from a Band of Twilight maybe) would save significant amounts of mana.  Add in Spell Haste III for fasting casting makes a huge difference too.<br />
<br />
Another possible method would be nuke&amp;root, sort of a hybrid tactic of how you would take out a Cliff Golem.  Pull with Malosi, Root (level 14 version if you think Ornate pants is too much of a gift).  Nuke with Ice Strike (using an Improved Damage III item) from max spell range and immediately cast root (2 second cast time).  Tortured souls don't have a super high movement rate, so you might be able to land it w/o getting touched.  This would be doing 700-800 points of damage maybe every 20 seconds or so (6ish seconds to cast Ice Strike, recast delay of 2.25 sec, 2 seconds cast for root, a few seconds to reposition, another 6ish to cast Ice Strike again) with a few small breaks for a Stoicism cast (with an Extended Enhancement item worn of course).  <br />
<br />
Malosi is 175 mana - only cast once.<br />
Turgur's is 250 mana - only cast once.<br />
Root is only 30 mana (or clicky if you prefer).<br />
Ice Strike is only 250 (less if you give him Mana Pres. III).<br />
<br />
I think both methods would be doable.  If I get really bored, I'll try 'em out though it won't be a true test since I'm 65.<br />
<br />
The whole scenario would assume the 54 shaman got the best in available PoK buffs (nine, symbol, VoQ, etc) and beneficial neighbors (I.E. someone like me camping nearby outside stables who would be keeping any back hall wanderers from adding). :D  For any focus effects that the 54 shaman is lacking in his equipment, they could all be purchased using Tribute Points.  Buy an architect's BP for 2k or so in the bazaar and Tribute it to set yourself up for a week's worth of attempts.<br />
<br />
<br />
It took some indepth Lucy searching, but I think it could be done.  Not necessarily something I'd recommend a 54 shaman do regularly, but a nifty accomplishment all the same. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My bet is on a typo, should have been 64 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm a few points:<br />
<br />
1) You can't do the ornate turn-in until 55, the quest NPC won't give you the class symbol.<br />
<br />
2) Unless you had a lot of FT gear, I would expect you to go oom using those older, relatively inefficient spells<br />
<br />
3) What about adds? I always get an add if I solo in the pit. Pig pens room is ok, but then you have to clear the roamer first, which is normally a diaku for me (sometimes a wraith).<br />
<br />
4) 2% of normal xp seems low at 54 for killing a red mob in Tactics.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing its a typo too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Instead of Invising up and running into the pit risking a see invis mob seeing you or it wearing off, while in your corner try using Assidious Vision on one of the mobs in the pit.

BS!<br />
<br />
Duoing in Tactics with my wife a lvl 59 Cleric she was getting nearly a full blue of exp per kill, 4 blue ticks, thats 3.2 % per kill.  As a 65 Shaman I can root/rot forever and a day in there, she is just there for free exp and to buff me if I need it heal etc.  Solo there I get 7 blue ticks of AA exp per kill.  So again I don't think you did what you are claiming.  <br />
<br />
At 54 unbuffed you have what, 2500 HP that will not last long there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/shrug<br />
<br />
I killed the easiest, slowest moving mob of tactics when I was level 54. I used epic to do damage and it was not even close to hard, just took a lot of time.<br />
<br />
If you think it is not possible, then you should consider learning a bit more of the game and improve your skills.<br />
<br />
Btw, I really doubt that your wife's cleric is getting 3.2% of real xp from a mob that consider blue to her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The &quot;black robe mobs&quot; are Tortured Souls, level 62-63.  Where did you find it?  I have only ever seen the souls roaming where there are a LOT of other mobs around that would assist.  If you fought it in the pit just using your epic, it would have taken long enough that you would have gotten adds *guaranteed*.<br />
<br />
Also, the only &lt;60 mobs in the zone are two or three mobs that are only there for dire charm.  They also roam around in the pit.  The mobs that Bludletters is probably killing are 62-64 or at the very least 60-64, hardly blue cons to a 59 cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There used to be a stray pather that would pop up into the 'graveyard' room (its not really a graveyard just looks like one) and wander out, to the right and then down into the pit.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hail Jaidin,<br />
<br />
Going to pick a few nits here because I'm anal retentive. ;)   I also think I've spent more time in  Tactics exp'ing than the vast majority of shaman, so I know the zone rather well.<br />
<br />
I have only ever seen the souls roaming where there are a LOT of other mobs around that would assist. If you fought it in the pit just using your epic, it would have taken long enough that you would have gotten adds *guaranteed*. <br />
Sorry Jaidin, but this is flat out wrong. *Guaranteed*  :p <br />
There is a wandering mob (frequently a tortured soul) that goes very close to the zone-in (Graveyard).  Easily snagged without any fear of adds, and the likelihood of another wanderer coming by for ~20 minutes is pretty slim - plenty of time to kill one mob.  In fact, once you pull it, he could even drag it right to the zone-out (down the stairs) &amp; take hours to kill it completely safe from any adds.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, in the room outside the stables you can see a tortured soul path by every so often.  Even the set path wanderer that comes through (typically a Diaku or Wraith) will not aggro if you are fighting in a corner.  At the 2 corner spots (where there aren't static spawns) you can usually be add-free as long as you like if you know where to stand.   Players typically will go AFK there for extended periods with no aggro worries (unless trained). <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the only &lt;60 mobs in the zone are two or three mobs that are only there for dire charm. They also roam around in the pit.<br />
This is also incorrect.  Nitram Anizok  :D  is also below 60 and the only time you will ever see him in the pit is if he's been pulled or dragged there.  So not all the &lt;60 mobs in Tactics roam the pit.<br />
<br />
I agree with what you said about Blud's mobs with regards to the cleric. :) <br />

Indeed! :)<br />
<br />
There is a wandering mob (frequently a tortured soul) that goes very close to the zone-in (Graveyard).<br />
<br />
I believe I said if he fought in the pit, not near the zone :).  I was unaware that the soul pathed all the way up to the zonein, so indeed he could have fought there and if so, sure there wouldn't be any problem with adds.<br />
<br />
Additionally, in the room outside the stables you can see a tortured soul path by every so often.  Even the set path wanderer that comes through (typically a Diaku or Wraith) will not aggro if you are fighting in a corner.

Players typically will go AFK there for extended periods with no aggro worries (unless trained).<br />
<br />
Agreed, I have fought in the hallway and in the corners many times.  However, since we are talking about a 54 Shaman and mobs in Plane of Tactics that are notorious for breaking root very regularly, the mob would require kiting and there just isn't enough room to do so in these spots.  Even with an extremely lucky cast of malosi for him it would still be landing spells on a very high red.  They resist root enough at 65 to make this improbable.<br />
<br />
This is also incorrect.  Nitram Anizok  :D  is also below 60 and the only time you will ever see him in the pit is if he's been pulled or dragged there.  So not all the &lt;60 mobs in Tactics roam the pit.<br />

Doh! :eek: Wrong gnome.  I meant the one by the zone-in that you hail for pre-flagging.  My apologies :D  Giwin is the name maybe?  Can't remember the exact name.  :rolleyes: <br />

There are quite a few yup but most are quest npc's.<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, they need to fix the pathing in Plane of Storms so I can finish up my tactics quest for my alts dangit! :)  I have three diaku emblems now but the desert is so fubared now that we can't get any mobs out of their stuck spots :(<br />
<br />
Also, Frekkels, have you been camping the pit named or the piggy much lately?  I haven't been in tactics for a while (boxing a few alts) and plan to get them some ornate when I finish that storms quest, assuming the pit named and piggy aren't camped 24/7.</div></div><hr />

Bah, both of you from Emarr?  Sheesh, does this mean we need to start a sign-up sheet so I can carve out a chunk of time to solo the pit?  I'm running a little low on cash, and could use another bulwark for tribute. ;)<br />
<br />
Just teasing...good to see our server represented. :cool:<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

To be honest, piglet is almost always camped during prime time American play hours on E. Marr.  There have been several pickup Behemoth raids in recent months which has populated what was once an almost always empty zone w/ an average of 1-2 pit groups w/ another group doing named (Arm/Supp) in addition to a few soloers up top playing in the sandboxes.<br />
<br />
Your best bet for piglet camping on our server is in the mornings EST in my experience.<br />
<br />
Naturel (a druid) frequently camps piglet for extended periods while waiting for Glykus &amp; the Diaku Overseer to spawn.  He's a pretty serious farmer. :p   Zombo (who pairs w/ Naturel) and a few other enchanters frequently charm solo in the pit as well during afternoons.  Two or more of them in the pit at the same time and the pickings get very slim rapidly.<br />
<br />
Jaidin, if you do a search of the forums I think I posted here about the Diaku emblems &amp; how to pull the placeholders out of the cliffs so you can get flagged unless your problems are related to the recent collision adjustments.<br />
<br />
Also, Frekkels, have you been camping the pit named or the piggy much lately?<br />
I haven't logged on in ~2 weeks now (though I'm still cruising boards daily).  Seriously debating whether or not to keep playing.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Ugh, I hear that.  I haven't played much in a month or so now.  I've been on a half dozen times in the past 4-5 weeks.  I'm having a hard time justifying the monthly fee for my 2 accounts.  I LOVE my shaman...I just hate the lack of a role in the new content.  I fear that my character is being phased out :-/<br />
<br />
Anywho...thanks for the info Frekkels.  I was mostly teasing ;)<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dugok Grumblehawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I recently got PoTactics flagged (Finally after 9 MB attempts) and I had a quick question about pulling places for the pit.  I was able to find where everyone was talking about pulling to where there was 2 zeks in 2 of 4 corners and there was a roamer who went through the middle near the pig pens.<br />
<br />
This is a great place to pull to but the problem is, this is usually camped.  Is there anywhere else that I can pull to and not have to worry about adds?  I was thinking of possibly trying to pull in one of the corners of the Pit but that probably would get messy.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated because this place is a lot funner soloing then my normal PoV NE golems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hail,<br />
<br />
If the camp outside the stables is taken, you can still do a few things.<br />
<br />
1.  Back Hall.  Talk to the person/group that is there.  Sometimes they won't mind you taking out the back hall area (diakus) if they are only pulling the pit.  As a solo shaman nearby, you can exchange buffs w/ their group (since honestly most groups use an enchanter there in my experience) and if you have proven yourself competent (meaning you won't train them, you can actually handle the mobs there w/ no danger, etc) they usually don't mind neighbors.  The back hall area is enough to keep you busy when alone.  Many groups leave the back hall mobs up when pulling the pit for exp because the Diakus mitigate slow and therefore take more mana to kill compared to most pit mobs.  Root/rotting them the mitigation isn't an issue for you though.  :D <br />
<br />
2.  SW Corner.  Alternatively, if you or the other group isn't comfortable with someone that close by, the corner closest to that tunnel (SW) is a fairly decent spot.  If the other group is pulling at a reasonable rate, the normal problem of adds is somewhat lessened, and you can always train out w/o hurting anyone if things get too hairy for you.<br />
<br />
I would NOT recommend camping the zone-out corner.  In addition to causing others who want to safely leave a wrinkle in their exit plan (for those that actually care), you can end up clicking out unintentionally rather easily.<br />
<br />
3. SE Tunnel.  The SE tunnel hallway isn't a great place to camp, but it is sometimes okay for 2-3 mobs.  I'll use it when I can safely single pull a named there that would be too difficult to bring singled to my normal camp spot.  If you are grouped, this can be a great camp spot, because the large numbers of wandering mobs pathing through makes for 'auto-pulls' which save time in a fast kill group.  Solo for extended periods this spot is very dangerous due to the frequent adds.  Additionally, if Arm/Supp is camped, you have to watch out for uncalled trains to the pit zone-out, which will frequently leave you flattened. :(   Stampeded also come through here, so you have to watch for the message and flatten yourself against the wall (even while engaged w/ a mob) to keep from getting stampeded. :p <br />
<br />
4.  NW or SE corners.  The other two pit corners can also be used, though you will have to stay on your toes 100% of the time while you are kililng.  You DO need to worry about adds coming at any moment.  When that happens, I typically will root &amp; slow the add, then 'burn' the mob I was engaged with as fast as I can.  3 or more in camp &amp; I recommend you zone.  Generally when you take one of these corners it is because there are already 2-3 other parties in the pit.  When this is the case, the adds aren't as much of a worry because the bulk of the pit stays clearer than when you are down there by yourself or with only one or two other soloers.  <br />
<br />
5.  Sandbox.   You can root/rot or kite from this camp above the pit in the 'sandbox' area as well, though that spot is often taken by druids or necros kiting.  This is pretty safe exp, though it is very boring to mer personally.<br />
<br />
6.  Stables.  You can also camp the stables itself.  Most pit groups leave the stables alone unless Glykus is up, and then they only clear them prior to killing him.  If you ask nicely, groups will normally let you kill your first mob (root pull or you will get two) in the room outside the stables (where they are camped) and then you spend the rest of your time inside the stables proper.  Keep a timer or watch the clock to make sure the respawns don't take you by surprise. ;)  If Glykus isn't up, you have a zone-out very close by at the very end of the stables.  Many people are unaware of this, and it means you can zone safely when in trouble without bothering the person/group camping the room outside the stables.  NOTE:  If GLYKUS IS UP, this zone-out DOES NOT WORK!!!  It is 'magically shut' and you will die to Glykus rapidly trying to use it.  <br />
<br />
This is in some ways more difficult than the pit itself, and in other ways it is easier.  The number of stable wanderers is less than you will find camping a corner of the pit, and they can sometimes be avoided from adding if you are hugging the walls inside the stables when they go by.  The downside is that you will frequently have to root pull in the stables, which can mean 2 unslowed mobs at once if it resists.  There are other tactics you can use for pulling as well that can also work.<br />
<br />
7.  Overseer Room.   If the Diaku Overseer has been killed recently, you can pull Diakus to his spawn location in relative safety.  There are frequent mobs pathing through, but if you stay by Overseer's spawnpoint as you kill you should be safe from them adding.<br />
<br />
Bump the rep please if this helps, and best of luck to you!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I kill the 2 diaku there then pull stuff from the pit. If piglet spawns I vp him in to a wall. Make a hotkey for /tar piglet, coz it helps a lot.</div></div><hr />
