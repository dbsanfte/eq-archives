<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont worry about that man.<br />
<br />
If someone`s got a big enough problem with the way you type and can`t skip over your post or something similar,that`s their problem and not yours.<br />
<br />
Dont let people like that gfet to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe not a big deal.  You seem like a nice enough peep, but can you do the big bear booty dance while out of food and LOM?  If you can't, let me know, I'll throw you a copy of bear form and teach you, the ladies eat it up.  Careful tho, some of the men like it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>binador1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's odd, I see two posts of yours on this thread, yet it says Posts: 1...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He deleted his other posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But I'm looking at two posts on THIS thread, right now, still undeleted, and it still says Posts: 1.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Same here, thats strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's just administrative, most likely. He made some posts, deleted an entire thread. I restored the thread and moved it to the mod section. With all the deleting and restoring, it's not surprising to me that his post count is screwy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's just administrative, most likely. He made some posts, deleted an entire thread.

<br />
Maybe he has a negative post count now but since that makes little sense the counter on new posts puts in the lowest sensible number??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe the sub-routine that keeps track of your post counts looked at his first thread, thought to itself &quot;this is the worst thread evah!&quot;, and deducted posts as punishment.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">lol this makes me wonder what would happen if i had great info but typed even more like a monkey .rofl.</div></div><hr />
