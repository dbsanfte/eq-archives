<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few years ago, there were only a couple sub forums on this board and Thantu was very resistant to adding more.  I agreed with him.  I look at this board as a pub where we all kick off our stinky boots to brag, debate, and share our medicine bag of tricks.  I really miss all those all Nixx Darkpaw's adventures from before the purge.<br />
<br />
Today, we've got too many forums and new moderators that, in my humble opinion, are too eager to click their extra buttons.  I'd assume The Grey = Off Topic but I'm seeing shaman related threads tossed in there to rot.<br />
<br />
A few weeks back I started a thread asking the shaman community to voice their support of monks, our famous duo partner.  I found my thread trashcanned into The Grey -- some nameless mod decided that it was on par with the cancelling of Farscape.<br />
<br />
Landragoran Heronwing started &quot;Inflammatory Post&quot; which I enjoyed very much.  It was curative and fun -- relieving some of the tension over the nerfs and the silly drama.  Was it a clever bit of social commentary on the shaman community?  No, apparently it's off topic noise that belongs in the junk drawer.<br />
<br />
I would like to suggest the Thantu and the mods take a hard look at the structure of the boards.  You might prune/collaspe some of the underused areas, make the topics more defined, and clarify amongst yourselves what kinds of threads belong where, especially The Grey.<br />
<br />
Sorry, just something that has been nagging at me for a while.  This is still the best EQ class boards and I appreciate the work that goes into them immensely.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Send this one to the Grey boys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Barm that we are approaching critical thread-mass. :)<br />
<br />
It does tend to lessen the visibility of the diversity that we shamans actually represent that every post gets judged and put into its own (little) separate box.<br />
<br />
I also miss when we had all the controversial posters around - Eduin, Tudamorf, Nixx and many more highly intelligent people that for various reasons dont come here anymore. I for one am old enough to judge people on my own without needing moderators to ban people. Moving posts is certainly not as serious as banning but it still makes for a confusing experience for both the poster and the readers. I do trust that our current moderators are aware of this and will act accordingly :)<br />
<br />
PS. And this post belongs in general! LOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree, its getting ridiculous, what about general doesn't include ALOT of the things going to the grey,  thumbs down mods, you're a bit out of control on this.<br />
<br />
All that's going to be left in general is stupid buffing posts and the never-ending-which-aa-should-I-do-first posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know some of the threads that went to The Grey were because they degenerated into flame wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When i posted the playwiz girls here they got shot down to the grey IT IS EQ RELATED.<br />
BAH :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i thinkthe mods are doing fine. thigns havent been moved much lately , just cause a few days in a row have moved threads is no reason to start telling people how to do their jobs.<br />
<br />
my 2 cents anyway , i think they are doing fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">People complain when there are ten thousand topics in general and then they complain when the mods actually sort them to the best of their ability.<br />
<br />
Have you ever run a message board?<br />
<br />
You can't please all of the people all of the time, you have to appeal to the majority.</div></div><hr />
