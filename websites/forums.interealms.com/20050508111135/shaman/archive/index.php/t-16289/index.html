I would get scr3 and then scrm next, but that is just my opinion. Scrm gives you a nice 1800hp Torpor/Q, which goes real nice with cann5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would go scr3 then scrm. maybe its just me but I just dont see pet hold as a big priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pet Hold would probably be one of my last AA's. Just before Rabid Bear most likely.<br />
<br />
SCR3 + SCRM = 50% longer buffs. Add a Ceramic Shield of Valor, and its 65% longer buffs. Buffs including Torpor/Quie, Focus, Stat buffs, Avatar/FA, haste, SoW, etc... Very nice to have. at 65% extention to duration, Torpor/Quie are lasting 6-7 ticks, Focus is 2 hours 12 mins, FA is 9 mins, Talisman of Alacrity and SoW are 59 mins. Very nice changes.<br />
<br />
SCM = 10% mana savings on every spell. Its clearly noticable.<br />
<br />
QB3 = Nearly all buffs casting in half the normal time. Torpor/Quie in 3 seconds. Focus in 4 seconds. <br />
<br />
Individually, none of those are huge. But when you start stacking them all up, they become huge. And if you then compliment the AA skills with things like Ornate boots, sleeves and BP, they get even bigger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't really go wrong with spending some points at this point on SCR, ND, RC, or SCM.<br />
<br />
I got Pet Discipline just before Innate Magic Resistance, if that gives you some idea of its usefulness.</div></div><hr />
