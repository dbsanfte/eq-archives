<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let's not forget what is going on in the world.  Klydon for example, can be called up at any moment.  I would like to share a letter, written a long time ago, that speaks of how our country does what is needed.<br />
<br />
Dear Mrs. Bixby,<br />
<br />
I have been shown files from the War Department, a statement, that shows that you are the mother of 5 sons that have died gloriously on the field of battle.  I feel how weak and fruitless any words of mine must be, that would attempt to beguile you from the grief, of a loss to overwhelming.  But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found, in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.  I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of you bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved, and lost.  And the solemn pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.<br />
<br />
Yours very sincerely and respectfully,<br />
<br />

I typed that from memory - I fear for our men in combat, and I wish they would let me join them.  mrs. Sullivan lived not far from my house, and my entire community knows of that loss(4 brothers on one ship in the pacific).<br />
<br />
when we consider our gripes about various epic mobs, and various guild arguments, remember this, and learn to work together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice piece Jlove.. if you had not mentioned the Sullivan brothers, I would have and there is also the case of Saving Pvt Ryan as a reminder.<br />
<br />
For my own status, I was officially retired as of 1 October 2001. While any retiree is subject to recall, it is very unlikely as they were considered to have serve their time. We do have several people in the guild that are on active duty. I think about them and I think about my old unit, which has had some people get called to serve. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, we get so wrapped up in things, it is a hard reminder that this is just a game; played for the enjoyment and fellowship of all when on the big scale of things today, it is not really that important if you really think about it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice reality check guys :) Thanks for bringing us back to earth. Sometimes we get wrapped up in our own problems and lives and forget what problems the world is facing right now.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is nice to be brought out of our own worlds back into the real one, especially with what is going on now and the time of season it is.<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays Everyone!<br />
<br />
Hugs<br />
