<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you turn horse models off in game cause i was led to believe that one cant summon a horse when models are turned off prior to the char select screen???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am pretty sure you cant turned them off in game, not that iam aware of anyways.<br />
<br />
To turn horse models off, select the options tab before you type your password, its a tab or two below the connect tab.  From their select OK on your drive and then the next screen you will have the option to turn on/off all models including horses and excluding Vahshir.<br />
<br />
And yes you can summon a horse with horse models turned off, however you wont see it of course, only players with the option turned on can see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Benefits of turning the horse models off (so you know what will and won't work.)<br />
<br />
You can keep your sow speed instead of the horse speed (the speed of the cheapest horse is slower than SoW- turning off the model removes the horse speed effect... so you can cast SoW on yourself, click your epic boots, get snared by the fungi staff, etc.) <br />
<br />
You can duck (to interrupt spells) <br />
<br />
You don't have the acceleration effect <br />
<br />
You don't have to see the horse head all the time <br />
<br />
You also keep the automed feature. Basically, when you're standing still and not attacking, you're medding (you don't need to sit down... and you can med while casting/JBB'ing/etc.. If you swing a weapon or move, it doesn't count... but if you're standing still, you're medding... this is huge. One quirk, I've noticed that sometimes the mana bar doesn't update from automed until you do something to trigger it. For example, I'll stand still for a minute and the mana bar won't move. I'll refresh my SoW, and my mana will go UP two bubbles (because it's just now refreshing from the past few minutes.)<br />
<br />
By the way.... if you have the fungi staff, the epic boots are your best friends. Click off staff effect, click boots, ready to go...<br />
<br />
By turning off the model you lose the safe fall bonus that comes with the horse<br />
<br />
Whether the model is on or off, you'll go through a lot more food wihle on a horse than while not riding one.  They eat a ton.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it does help a lot thanks =) just bought one and friends think im nuts saying the horse automed thing will get fixed eventually but we all know how long VI's eventually really is hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Horse medding is not a bug.  IMHO it was purposely implemented to give an advantage to horse ownership other than the cool look of it.<br />
<br />
Horses are a nice way to syphon cash out of the economy and prevent inflation.  Look for high-end nodrop armor vendors in the new Planes or something like this to take even more cash out of the game.<br />
<br />
just your basic economic thinking..thanks Mr. Greenspan!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have never seen this asked...and since I am considering a horse I would like to know...if you have horse models off can you still use bear form or will the horse and bear not 'stack'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bear form can not be used on a horse. <br />
<br />
Skellie form can be used but specter form can not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One last ? on this and then it will be a dead horse so to speak..<br />
Friend says I dont get the med/casting benefit with horse models turned off.. is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, it's not.  You still get the benefit with models off.  Just check your hp regen rate to verify it.  Horses just make it so that you are considered 'sitting' anytime you aren't moving/fighting, hence hp regen is affected as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, if you are not using Luclin models for your character race, you will not see your horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What Bigguss said is essentially the whole story with regards horses, but he missed one point.<br />
<br />
When on a horse, you regenerate at the STANDING rate. If you turn off the horse models, you get standing regen whether you are sitting or standing. I can confirm also, that with models off, you DO meditate when standing (but not if moving or attacking).<br />
<br />
Essentially, sitting has no effect on your hp/mana recovery when you are on a horse.</div></div><hr />
