<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Vah Shir do not have any cultural armor recipes like the other races do.  They have a few lower end smithing and tailoring progressive quests that take place in Shar Vahl and the nearby zones, but nothing that equals the new 'blue diamond' cultural recipes.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether or not they can wear any of the non-imbued armors made by other races - being agnostic, they wouldn't be able to wear any imbued armors at all, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cats dont have a god therefore they do not have any of their own cultural armor.  Im curious though if they can wear some the the non-imbued cultural armors of other races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep.  I dressed my kitty rogue in nice grey-blue non-imbued Northman Ring.<br />
<br />
Looks purty against his black fur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the northmans stuff isnt the &quot;blue diamond&quot; gear that has shown up in the last 2 months, its the old school barbarian cultural.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, the new cultural BD stuff for shamen (made by Barbs and Ogres) cannot be non imbued, therefore wouldnt be wearable by kittys.  I dont know enough about iksar to say positively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's CATS with one &quot;T&quot; and no &quot;K&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is no non-imbued version of Helanic plate or Artificer's mail (Barbarian) either.  Non-imbued is only the earlier cultural stuff, like the Northman and analogous stuff.<br />
<br />
Kinda like to see a non-imbued version of some sort of cultural plate.  Just for looks.</div></div><hr />
