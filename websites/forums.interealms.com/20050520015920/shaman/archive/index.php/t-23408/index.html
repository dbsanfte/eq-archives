<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I logged in hoping to find an open MithMarr raid or perhaps an open Bert raid for my wizard.  Instead there was a RZ raid forming.  So I respond to a call for a Shaman in a Tipt group.  Get in my 2nd GoD group!<br />
<br />
Get there and find that I am grouped with 5 members of some of the stronger guilds on the server (for those on Karana they were Pegasus, Vortex of Life, 12k tank from Novae, Maximum).  I felt real confident about this group.<br />
<br />
Started out great.  There I am Malos and Slowing right off the bat as this tank is awesome!  Tossing backup heals and Bane as well.  Then the enchanter charms a cragbeast and we really get going.  No time for Bane so I start nuking with Spear of Torment.  Druid dies from repop, but her own fault for going AFK for like 15 minutes without telling anyone.  Personally I think she was falling asleep (member of a Japanese guild and it's about 9pm EST).<br />
<br />
Recover and move on, cutting through the mobs like a hot knife through butter.  Change charmed pets to a pooka and continue to run rampant.  Druid goes quietly AFK a couple more times.<br />
<br />
Get all the way to the named boss, kill it with little trouble.  We get to the bridge at the end and a roamer finds us.  The druid missed a snare and this roamer decided to roam over to the couple mobs we left behind to save time.  1 becomes 5.<br />
<br />
I start running across the bridge, noticed our tank was there too.  Thought someone called run, but then the tank turns around.  So, so do I.  Should have kept running.  Got back to the fight and it was going badly so we started running again.<br />
<br />
I got to the NPC, and tried to hail and click the stone as quick as I could.  Got the message that I had died followed right by the message that I hailed and then zoning.  No yellow text and no clicking the stone.<br />
<br />
Aargh!  Probably my 1 chance at the Tipt flag and it's blown by a druid who missed a snare (remember, she's been trouble all night) and my indecision about running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it might be hard to miss tipt flag with such **** (tipt is really annoying!), but running like this could severly destroy your reputation on your server. I for my part prefer someone that tries to stand and do his best when the **** hits the fan (and with that, it is possible to change a train/possible wipe to a win with super excitement) than just running and looking for himself. So exactly what you did is imo right, these guys will remember that (or they are retards) and maybe you are surprised if there are some followups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you kill the Kyv but wipe, you can do a suicide run all the way up and get flagged and zone out.  We did it one night.  With SOE you can pretty much run all the way up without getting hit.   If you have the tank run first its easy.  Have the tank over shoot the hail mob and continue further (there is a long ramp past the hail mob that goes a good ways), then once everyone has hailed and zoned out he can turn back around and head to the zone out stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought about it, but didn't think I could make it.  Oh well.  Maybe there will be a next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What about the keyed door?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had a few Tipt runs myself this week, but haven't won any rolls yet. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hardest thing in tipt is not the last named or the clearing itself, it is to have 6 persons stay 100% focused for 2+ hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is that to worry about JuuJuu.  Our monk had the key.<br />
<br />
Only had 1 augment drop last night, off of the &quot;named&quot; cragbeast that spawns after killing all the hatchlings.  A +30HP/+30 End one that the monk got.  The last named dropped a Mnk, Dru, Bst Bracer that the druid got (monk had better already).<br />
<br />
I am really surprised at how little good loot drops.  Lots of vendor trash though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Meh Tebion, I don't think Zatriz has anything to worry about so far as his serverwide reputation is concerned. IMO Zatriz, you did just fine, tho sometimes when the **** hits the fan like that it's just easier to gate, let the group die, pop the corpses, and start over again. I went through Tipt about a dozen times farming augs before we made the flag run, and even then it took us three tries. Persistence!<br />
<br />
 :cool: <br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Zatriz has a fine reputation on Karana. Keep grinding at Tipt man, you'll get it soon  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Flags, schmags. The whole reason I'm doing Tipt is for the Bracer of Exploration, the augments, and the XP. Not that I'll avoid getting the flag on a win, but really, I'm not ready to go past the open zones yet anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the ego trip Tordail and Numgrak (heya bud!  been a while).  :)  My reputation hasn't helped me much lately.  LOL<br />
<br />
Samanna, a little birdy told me to stop focusing on PoP progression and get through GoD.  All the top end guilds are about done with PoP anyways.  I've always been a step behind in joining one of those guilds, so the suggestion was to concentrate on GoD and gain that step.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well as far as the flag goes you don't need to click on the stone. It's just the zone out point. Only thing you need to do is hail the mob and get the text from them. If you have smith or 4 sewers and vxed already I'd try talking to the aprentice or zoning into KT. Zoning out by the stone isn't part of the flagging process at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You have been killed by some_freaky_named_monster!<br />
You say, &quot;Hail, flag_NPC.&quot;<br />
Loading Please Wait...<br />
<br />
That's what I saw.  Maybe not word for word, but you get the idea.  Can't even take that to a GM.  Heck, they wouldn't give me back my AD flag when the server crashed a minute after I hailed the PP.  Even though my Journal clearly shows I hailed and got a response.</div></div><hr />
