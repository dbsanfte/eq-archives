<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Myself and 3 friends regularly group. 33 shaman, 33 warrior, 33 warrior, 33 cleric. I have a 60 rogue on another computer that I kill stuff with once it's down half health. My question is, what are the optimal places for us to experience, if we are killing in this manner? Right now we are at CoM, and doing well there, but I heard that starts to slow down around 36. As well, it is an outdoor zone, so we don't get the dungeon bonus. We've previously done SolA with great success. We all have about 10-15k worth of stuff on each character, so reds are no problem, especially with the rogue. Thanks for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />
