<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have got to the stage of the game where my guild has just entered elementals and I am notching up the aa. Plane of Earth proving amazing exp. I have got around 120 aa now, and looking ahead to what I can buy. I have all the important ones, cann 5 , LR5, MGB, spirit call, VP, RC, Rabid bear&lt;cough&gt; etc.. and have just started to look at my further aa. <br />
<br />
Seeing Castersrealm got a few errors in their aa, eg spirit call 3 cost 2 points and not 1 point as shown there. I am just curious on a few values of what something costs. My path now is going along crit heals, crit nukes and considering the mitigation and further RC aa. Firstly how much does 2nd lvl of Advanced Healing gift 2 cost? and how much does 2nd lvl of advanced Fury of magic cost. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get SCRM (if your magelo is updated), another 20% on all buffs is awesome.<br />
<br />
Also, magelo has all the numbers, just put in that you have 1 level in something, and look at your profile, it should tell you how much the next one costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, looking at your profile, Planar Power would probably do you a little good.  VT adds a LOT of stats equipment and you're already hitting the top with STA and WIS.  At 2 AA per 5 points, you may like the long-term effects.  Also, think about getting RC2.  RC1 was a GREAT upgrade from RC0, but you'll find that if you go to 2, you'll cure a lot more than 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm thanks for the advice, I have been toying around with the idea of planar power but I have heard 2 sides of the coin on it. I am not sure how much added hp I will get by getting it. SCRM I have thought about but with scr3 and crown of ambiveolence I  thought was 50% cap but am unsure. Also Jaruden will try that magelo thing, didn't think about thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Damn your magelo makes me feel like a noob :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are the resists in the General section worth it? <br />
Might want to increase magic, fire, and cold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IIRC adv healing gift is 2,3,4.  Adv fury of magic is 3 6 (9)? (not at level 3 yet).<br />
<br />
Yeah you have a lot that can be trained.  Combat stab, healing crits, healing adept, crit nukes, planar power, RC3, SCRM, chanelling focus,- it's all good stuff and I couldn't live without any of it at this point.   So as to what to do first.......<br />
<br />
Well um combat stab definitely helps with mitigation.  Healing crits/adept - with elemental arms and crit/adept 6 I *consistently* crit for 3300+ with tnargs, so that's handy :P  Crit nukes obviously up your dps, planar power your hps, RC3 is useful against the smorgasboard (sp) of aes you'll come across, SCRM *will* increase the length of your buffs (items stack on top of the 50 percent), chanelling focus I think I would slit my wrists in plane of water without it.<br />
<br />
You could just do them all at once.  Make a list of the stuff you'd like to train and then just start throwing points at them cheapest first.  It's probably the most fun, at this point you'll be training something every time you earn 2 AA.  And since its all useful you'll won't find yourself lacking in one particular area as you progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCM is very good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would recommend:<br />
<br />
SCRM<br />
CS1-3<br />
ID1-5<br />
RC2-3<br />
<br />
In that order but hey entirely up to you :)<br />
<br />

<br />
There is my Magelo if you want to take a look.<br />
If I had it to do over again though I would likely have skipped QB3 and Pet Hold until a later point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks great advice, Kylt your post was very useful. 3300 crits must rock. The really hard point of this is prioritising although I guess I can shove poitns here and there and develop gradually.  I just obtained healing gift 3 doesn't seem to big an improvement from healing gift 2 atm. I guess planar power and scrm look good choices next to go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">POP fury of magic is 3,6,9<br />
POP healing adept is 2,4,6<br />
POP healing gift is 2,3,4<br />
<br />
If I were you I would get SCRM first, then all your healing and nuking AA.  There is no cap on buff extension.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's is small enough we need all the help we can get, with IMP Healing 4(20%) or Marr's Gift(25%), whatever + POP adept and crits, tnargs crits are like &gt; 3350?  I don't have all my adept yet, and only imp healing4 not marr's gift, and I don't feel like doing math atm, so I can't testify to the theoretical maximum.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic is nice, I crit all the time and only have level 1.  Crits, along with something as simple as the commonly available anger of eci focus give us a much needed boost.  (It's exciting to nuke almost as well as clerics!!!)<br />
<br />
I would get all of those before planar power.  It's much more important to improve healing ability and damage output than to gain a few hp from PP or IE, in my book.  Stamina has diminishing returns after 255, like 1.8 sta per hp.  Wisdom over 255 also has dimishing returns, I believe its 3.0 mana per wis?  So the difference between 280 and 355 is 225 mana.   These are just the numbers I recall off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Finish metabolism 3 instead, buy the best stat food and drink money can buy and get almost as good of returns as planar power/innate enlightenment, but for 2 pts instead of like 25.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With maxed out Sta and Wis:<br />
<br />
PP5 adds 47 HP and 126 Mana.<br />
IE5 adds an additional 253 Mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">thanks Jaradis!  I'll save those numbers for the FAQ I am writing up for the crucible site.  Maybe someday Sunmoon will get around to giving me ftp access to take away all those old pages and add something new.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">WIth maxed out Planar power, as a shaman, at 65, with ND3, you will receive approximately 35 hps for 280-305 stamina gain via PP.  <br />
<br />
35 hps, for 10 AAs . . . is it worth it?  I didn't think so.  The friggen soft cap on stamina = teh suck.<br />
Honestly I don't even use a stamina buff lately, since I get like 35 hps from the +25 stamina it takes to get me to 280 cap.  <br />
Since none of the other stats mean jack **** to a shaman, unless you're a wis freak and MUST have 305 wis . . . in which case I pity your addiction. <br />
<br />
So many other useful AAs.  The healing ones are much more beneficial for instance.   Channelling can help.  Max out LR5 and ID5 first for sure.  <br />
<br />
**** it, it's your game play it like you wanna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">RC is a must in elementals.  Healing depends really on your guild.  I'm constantly the only healer for my group in raids and those will be the next AA's I'm focusing (no pun intended) on. <br />
<br />
Take an objective look at your role on raids and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">chanelling focus I think I would slit my wrists in plane of water without it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you have noticed a difference with channeling?   If I recall correctly back when AA's had just came out people had posted that they didn't notice anything?   <br />
<br />
(Would help a TON in pvp, so I've always wondered about it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">PP  raises the dex cap which is important to have if you want  more chances of AA crits.<br />
<br />
you also get a raise in the agi cap which helps your ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lol I heard it was kinda minor 47 hp upgrade for 10 aa ok think I will skip that. Marrs gift and IH4 can stack Henora or no? Great advice again btw. Doesn't seem to be too many posts about further aa.<br />
<br />
 I logged last night after getting overwhelmed by number of aa I wanted lol. I firstly promised back along once I got lr5 I would stop exping, now I can see lots of directions I can go in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Marrs gift and IH4 can stack Henora or no? <br />
<br />
No.  Afaik - when dealing with like focus items, only the greater of the 2 will be used.  So Improved Healing 4 is not used if you have Marr's Gift.  However, your AA skills will stack with focus effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dexterity help on critical spells? (nukes and heal?). So criticals are considering like proc?</div></div><hr />
