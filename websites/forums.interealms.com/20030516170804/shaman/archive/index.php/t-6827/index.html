You might do the Blessed Champion's Cloak quest (very nice,  wore mine till I got my Garrison cloak at near 40th) and farming Loda Kai for their armor in Shadeweaver's Thicket.  Not bad AC for 15th level and you can't beat the price (trader's in the cave drop the most).  Go to the fort in Hollowshade Moor and pick up some hopperhide armor for a couple of plat per item to fill in empty slots till you can get better, it's pretty good for the price.<br />
<br />
It would help more if you could give us some idea of how much plat you expect to be able to farm.</div></div><hr />

Many thanks</div></div><hr />
