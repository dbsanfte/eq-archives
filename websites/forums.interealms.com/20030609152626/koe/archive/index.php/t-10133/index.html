<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pahreyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At first I was going to quote the apology that I gave to Jice in the previous thread.  But since no one apparently paid enough attention to actually read it, here it is again.<br />
<br />
Jice, I am sorry.  You have my apologies for what was said. <br />
<br />
And because no one read that part, aparently no one read the end of that post either, where I did offer an apology to the corps. however, since I was being a little more sincere and did not actually use the word apologize or sorry, I'll use it here.<br />
<br />
To the Corps, I apologize to you all for having insulted Jice.  I never meant to include any of you in what I said.  It was my mistake.<br />
<br />
Now please, can we let this die already?</div></div><hr />
