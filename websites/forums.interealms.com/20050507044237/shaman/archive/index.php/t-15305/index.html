<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the heck of it, me and some others are working through the trials in PoJ.  <br />
<br />
We're progressing along just fine, except for the Trial of Flame.  Three wipes so far, and I don't really feel like I've learned too much for some reason.  Something different about this one it seems.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would be interested in what others have to say about it.  Any tips, suggestions, spoilers, comments would be welcome.  <br />
<br />
Working with 65 Bard, 65 SK, 65 Cleric, 65 Ranger, 65 Shaman, with 65 warrior, 65 enchanter available too.  <br />
<br />
It was funny to do exe again for the heck of it.  I was surprised how easy it was in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have all trials, flame is hardest by far.<br />
<br />
We won with <br />
65 paladin<br />
65 cleric<br />
65 enchanter<br />
65 Ranger<br />
65 rogue<br />
65 Shaman (me)<br />
<br />
The enchanter would charm a mob I think, helped to space the waves. Cleric and shaman both having radiant cure helps for DoT (stagger it)<br />
<br />
Flame you basically take a lot of AE/dot damage. i'd basically split my time patch healing with Tnargs while cleric used group elixir for low aggro, and paladin would burn Prexus group heal start of each wave for aggro.<br />
<br />
We'd also spread out in a circle round the pole, ranger rogue me and pally would aggro all mobs at start, and pull to walls. Enchanter would CoD mob1, mezz mob2, paladin off tank3, me ranger rogue on last full on DPS, then paladins, then mezzed. Fast control is key to stop AE's going off. Once we had things under control. I'd open up with rain/spear alternate, whilst throwing Q here an there.<br />
<br />
Also, I didnt bother slowing anything but Boss, either nuked or healed, slowing is a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Been a while since I did it, took us 2-3 attempts to win, wiped once, script seemed to stop once, seems buggier than other trials. ie: we killed fast but one wave just didnt pop etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, take a bard, not a chanter.  Much like the execution trial, this one ends up being a massive dps fest.  Go with a warrior/sk, a bard, a shaman/druid, a cleric, a rogue/wizzie/ranger, and a rogue/wizzie/ranger.<br />
<br />
The little ass mobs seem to memblur themselves occasionally and just rush right to the middle.  A good bard can mez a mob, do melee, and also sing fire resist (which cuts down on your damage).  The bard can also gate mobs (highsun?) back to their spawn point.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the secret on this one is that I think you have 1 minute to kill any mob that gets into the middle.  Don't be afraid to change targets.  That's the whole secret. :p<br />
<br />
It took us a while to figure it out too, sadly enough.  Massive dps, have the shaman offtank one of the four spawns and nuke, one or two bard mezzed, and then everyone go massive dps on the first couple.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  Even bard gate won't reset the 1 minute timer.  It just gives you more room to move around (ie, doesn't drag offtanked mobs into the middle when everyone rushes in).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actulaly i wouldnt recommand to use bard gate. I used it 2 times, and it bugged the trial like hell. We got 3 waves, couldnt make spawn the 4th, and couldnt trigger again till next patch. Tribunal guy said 'you must wait, blablabla'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys, that's very helpful.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to trying it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What's the reward for this trial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reward for finishing ALL the trials is that you get to go pay a visit to the Seventh Hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good info, thanks. We got bored a couple months ago and tried to do all the trials as well. We burned through them all with ease except for Flame which we failed twice. It was late then, so we just logged and haven't retried since. We're in elemental planes now, so I don't know that we'd really want 7th Hammer's loot much, but I think it'd be fun to kill him once just to say we did.</div></div><hr />
