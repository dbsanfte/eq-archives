<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Veakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.  I was wondering about a few places.  I read this thread since my shaman hit 52 and I'm back because like many have said, exp has slowed down quite a bit after 55.  Well, I three box like the title says.  My 56 rogue is decent with about 6.3k with most major buffs (9, symbol, fo7), my druid has a decent mana pool, has never gone oom during my shaman's earlier PL sessions nor diong a few of my own hunts in the 50s.  I've looked around here and seen many choices of where to go.  So far, I've visited Sebilis, Velkators, Nightmare, Innovation and just 2 visits to Howling Stones.  So far, exp wise, since that's all I really care about right now, Sebilis and Velks blow.  Nightmare seemed to give one blue movement every 2 kills at zone in, not sure about the hedge area yet and Innovation zone in was just plain horrible.  I've been to Howling Stones twice but had bad expreiences there twice, bad luck on both occasions and might be going back there.<br />
<br />
The exp I got in Nightmare (2 kills per blue movement) is with only the rogue and shaman grouped and the druid outside of the group just healing, DSing, DoTing and snaring as needed.  In the idea of group exp bonus, should I have all three grouped together or stay with just two in the group?<br />
<br />
Now for the questions.<br />
1.) Can Innovation factory be a hunting spot or is that too much for me?<br />
<br />
2.) Can Howling Stones compare to Nightmare? Or is exp in Nightmare much better than Howling Stones?  Because I would rather not return back to HS if I don't have to, but if HS is pretty good (2 kills for 1 blue movement) then heck I'll head back there for sure.<br />
<br />
If PoP is &gt; Most others, skip to Q#4<br />
<br />
3.) I've seen other places being listed as good places to hunt.  Btw, LoY is a no go since my druid doesn't have LoY.  But I've heard of things like Nurga, Droga, SG, Veksar and Ssra Temple.  I've hunted in Ssra Temple with 3 guildies (65 sk, 65 enc and 65 wiz) and exp was all right but not really &quot;wow&quot; like.  This was in comm1, the very first room to the right from zone in.  I've never ever been to Nurga, Droga since the revamp nor Veksar ever so how is the exp in those places?  I also hear stuff about Sirens, is the exp all right there?  Basically, like I saw in another post, I'm looking at the kill:exp ratios of zones to find the best place for my shammy.  Like everyone, I wanna level fast lol and get to the run 60s.<br />
<br />
4.) If PoP is my best choice, at 56 and 3-boxing, should I just stick with yard trash at the zone in in PoN?  The pulling sucks since I like mobs close and easy to grab.  Or at 56, could I handle the hedge or dock area?  Also, I could also hit Disease but I don't know the layout or even where to hunt in that zone and I could enter Valor now but dunno if my shaman can really handle those yet.<br />
<br />
5.) What about LDoN?  At 56, is it all right exp or would I be better off sticking with PoP?<br />
<br />
Any replies and words of insight would be helpful alot.  You don't have to answer all the questions, but give general ideas, tips, clarification and stuff would be helpful.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">start a gropu in pov with the druid/rogue and have the shaman tag along. would be the best exp for him probably as long as he could slow the stuff =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fast pl'ing isn't always about xp per kill, but xp per minute. Find a zone with a good xp mod, low hp mobs and slaughter em. I bet nurga would be decent if ya just went in and crawled it, HS would be good also After ya get in a ways. Chardok might not be bad as well. And i would use the druid in the group to add dps, if you have dire charm on the druid go to pon and get the druid a pet.</div></div><hr />
