<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>frothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just currious, I am lvl 45 and have only the Lord Rak fight to complete my epic. I have heard that you can not do final hand in till 51 yet you can do everything up to that point. However, I have also seen that people have done last hand in pre 51 and recived epic. So can epic be completed pre 51 as long as you have max ally? Is the whole &quot;must be lvl 51 to complete epic&quot; just an urban legend?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not even a myth, I don't know where you got that idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno about the 51 thing, although I'd assume it's a myth.  However, I do know that there are epics which require you to be at least level 46 to attain, because of old planar-item hand ins.  Considering the turn in for this part is a piece from PoF, you may have a slight issue if you try and turn in the scale while still 45.  <br />
<br />
God knows that's a lot of work just to receive the &quot;What's this?  How did someone so inexperienced get this?&quot; (don't know if that's the exact text, but I've heard of something close)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Must at least be 46 for the planes parts, should be done at any level, as long as you have correct faction, and maybe even MQ'd planes parts like the tear. <br />
<br />
Only thing about 51... you can't use the effect until you are 51. I know this since a friend quit EQ, deleted his 55 shaman, along with his other toons to reinforce him quitting, then ended up coming back 3 months later (GM restored his character from old tapes, 2 of them actually, both lvl 55+, but made them level 45 as a penatly). He was damn happy since once he got back to 51 he was able to dot everything again with epic, along with being able to re-use all those spells (up to 55) that are in his book now, but can't mem due to not having that level.<br />
<br />
If VI did nerf it so once you complete the quest your true faction is reset, then that makes sense. Since I have max faction, I can get a tear from PoF, turn it in, kill Rak, then have someone else loot the scale for turn in. Not fair IMO, but makes sense to get some lvl 26 their epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>frothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you all for your imput. I think, to be safe I will just wait until I reach 51 to do final hand in. I really do not want to have to hunt down another childs tear if it were eatten because I did not wait. It took a while for my main to get his epic, I can hold back and keep using my spine chill spear till I get 51. I have been leveling rather quickly the last week, so it should not take too long to get 51.<br />
