<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm only level 10 at the moment and i try to melee but i only hit like 1 out of 10 shtos n blues+. I'm thinking it might be my weapon, a FS Great staff, im not twinked but i have a full set of banded and sum other nice peices (cloak of the ice bear). I have aruond 40pp to spend on a weap(rest of cash for lvl 14 spells)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A FS great staff really is a decent weapon for a non-twinked shaman.  If you are wanting to buy something in your price range, try finding a Runed Totem Staff - its near the dmg/dly of a FS staff but it is magic.  Will help you kill those pesky wisps which can be a good profit around your level.<br />
<br />
The first thing I did as a untwinked shaman was save up 200-300pp and bought a slime coated harpoon (depending on your server).  With this weapon you can melee well into your late 20's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will definitely want to melee some in the early levels. Even in later levels, to tell the truth. I was in your shoes once. I used a FS great staff against most mobs and the summoned hammer from my initiate symbol of the tribunal for mobs that could only be hit with magical weapons. It was hard, but it was all I could afford, on top of buying all my spells. My advice is similar to the previous poster's. Buy your spells and try to save, save, save until you have enough to get a decent weapon. Ebon war spears, Slime coated Harpoons and Beetle stingers are decent piercers and not terribly expensive. They're all a few hundred plat, but you can earn that if you're patient and diligent. Hang in there. At some point things will get better and as your power grows, so will your plat earning potential. Good Luck to you! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What server are you on?<br />
So hard to find a non twink shaman to give out my used equipment too.<br />
<br />
Not that it's all that great anyway, I'm quite poor :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Antonious Bayle Fattn hehe, and thanx for the advice all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, back in the Day, I had FS spear and Great staff, Gavel of Justice, and my Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal =)  I think &quot;the Day&quot; kind of equates to &quot;2 years ago when I was lev 17 or 18.&quot;<br />
<br />
I meleed all the time.  In fact, until we get our first batch of dots, we do more damage that way.  Yes, we have to med back then, but *feh*. <br />
<br />
I ended up doing the sit-med-heal-buff routine in my 20s-early 40s.  I still haven't quite caught back up again, despite working extremely hard on melee skills.  Now that I'm 54, I have still not yet completely maxed defense (194 at last!) 2hb is now Acceptable (165, brought up 163 points since level 45) and 1hb--also ignored since I got a good piercer--is 112.  It's next.<br />
<br />
Melee and keep skills up!  Draw some agro when controllable and keep Defense maxed, since you can't train in it.  There are bajillions of hp/ac vs wisdom threads on this board, so I won't go into that here.  Just don't make my mistake and get sidelined buffing/canning/medding/healing.  Have some fun.  If they complain, tell them <br />
&quot;I'm working on melee skills so I can slow and hurt these things without dying, since most tanks take 5+ mins to out-taunt me once I set my mind to killing something.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whether or not to melee depends in large part on whether you're grouped or solo'ing.  If you're solo'ing, I'd definitely include melee in your strategy for awhile (at least to level 40 when you can max your Defense skill.)<br />
<br />
If you're solo'ing, here's a great guide (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1348).   You can make good money selling tradeskill/reagent newbie items to players (High quality bear pelts, Spider/spiderling silks, Bone chips, etc.) so make sure you don't just automatically dump everything on the vendors.<br />
<br />
Try to keep your weapon skills all close to maxed.  I kept 1hb and piercing maxed, and regret neglecting 2hb.  Just remember, skills only get harder to raise the higher you go.  If you don't do it now, it's going to be a lot harder when you get higher.<br />
<br />
So you ideally should have one weapon of each type (one hand blunt, two hand blunt, piercing) and switch between them as your skill maxes at each level.  <br />
<br />
Some weapons you might look for (snatched from another thread- many of these might be too pricey now, but keep an eye out for them.  Also prices also vary by server, and this is from an old thread... so who knows!)<br />
<br />
Piercing:<br />
<br />
Bloodstained fang (Dmg 9, Dly 32) - sells for next to nothing (10 pp?) and a fabulous ratio for the price.<br />
<br />
Rukgus's sticker (Dmg 6, Dly 25, +3 Str, +2 Wis, +2 Int) - probably under 100 pp <br />
<br />
Ebon war spear (Dmg 8, Dly 31, Rangeable, +4 Str, +3 Wis, +5 vsMg) - probably 100-200 pp, this one is nice because when you upgrade you could move it to your range slot to continue to benefit from the stats. <br />
<br />
Bettle stinger (Dmg 8, Dly 23, +4 Agi, +4 Dex, +4 Wis) - 100-200 pp) <br />
<br />
Spine chill spear (Dmg 10, Dly 28, +3 Sta, +6 Wis, +10 vsCold) - 200-400 pp <br />
<br />
Slime coated harpoon (Dmg 10, Dly 25, Rangeable, +5 Wis, +10 Mana) - 200-500 pp <br />
<br />
One hand blunt: <br />
<br />
Screaming mace (8 dmg, 35 dly, Effect of Screaming Mace), Cold iron morning star (9 dmg, 35 dly), Enamelled black mace (Dmg 8, Dly 28) - These are old-world weapons, now make nice lower level weapons, and are probably around 50-100 pp or even less.<br />
<br />
Wraith bone hammer (Dmg 8, Dly 26, +5 Str, +2 Wis, +2 Int), Sharkbone Warhammer (Dmg 8, Dly 26, +5 Wis), Velium Etched Stone Mace (Dmg 7, Dly 22, +3 Str, +3 Wis), or Centi warhammer (Dmg 15, Dly 32- great ratio!, +5 Str, +5 Sta, +2 Wis) - 100-200 pp <br />
<br />
Smoldering Brand (Dmg 9, Dly 22, +3 Str, Effect of Burn from level 1 - NICE weapon), Ykeshan War Club (Dmg 9, Dly 24, Effect of Ykesha from level 37) - 200-500pp <br />
<br />
Two hand blunt: <br />
<br />
Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer (Dmg 22, Dly 50) or Gatorsmash Maul (Dmg 30, Dly 70) - 50-100 pp <br />
<br />
Drakkel Icegrinder (Dmg 27, Dly 45, Effect of Ice Rend) - 200-400pp <br />
<br />
Shield: <br />
<br />
Bark shield (+15 AC, +5 Agi), Chitin shell shield (+15 AC, +10 vsPos), Crystal webshield (+15 AC, +10 vsCold, +20 HP, +20), <br />
Crustacean shell shield (+17 AC, +4 Str, +10 Sta, -7 Cha), Velium round shield (+15 AC, +10 vsCold) - 50-150 pp <br />
<br />
Clay guardian shield (+25 AC, +50 HP) - 200-500 pp <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
