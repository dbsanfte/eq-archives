<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyrviel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe it's just me, but I'm having (and have had for quite some time..) a hard time making plat.  I've tried a rare item camps (Gratich, Hadden, that gobbie in Dagnors...), but have had next to no success.  I've been soloing almost exclusively for the last 10 levels, and my bank is dryed out.<br />
<br />
So my question...<br />
<br />
What is the best place to farm good money at 50?<br />
<br />
I don't have fungi, nor do I have access to a healer.  I'm guildless, so I'm basically alone.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of you will suggest CC at the Geos.  I don't really like this because a) during my play times, they're perpetually camped; and b) I hate CC.  I get lost everytime.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance guys. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find a buyer and act as their supplier, that way there is no time spent in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
It is boring but you will make good pp doing this.  <br />
<br />
To get a little more money combine 2 silks into 1 silk swatch which you can sell for 10pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tyga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jagged Pine for very rare Griffion Fang Earring (kinda like chicken nuggets...didn't know they had fangs) and the Griffon Eye sell very well. I got 1.5k for the earring and 3.5k for the eye.<br />
<br />
Also I did the FM cycles. Most of the stuff is junk by todays standards but some is good ...Dustcryers Crystal Ball sells for 1k  because its a range slot item with MPII (had to let one rot...lore) and some otherthings are not bad. At the least its non-stop action and the junk sells pretty good to vendors.<br />
<br />
If you want just vendor sellable stuff go to the guide section for some good plat farming ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wish I was on your server Tyga I have 2 Griffon Eyes (1 on me and 1 on mule) and have a real hard time selling them at 2500pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">karnors;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure what they sell for on your server, but I know I made few shiny plats selling rockhopper hides to tailors for acrylia armor around that level. Although the hoppers might be just a wee bit tough at 50, yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try the Titans in Stonebrunt. The Astral Leggings and Cloak sell for quite a bit. On Zeb the average price is like between 4k - 5k each. Take on greater wolf form, nothing aggros you but the pandas. Just have to warn you though, it's a boring camp. at 50 everything should be green to you there. But there are a few benefits :<br />
<br />
1.   Titan leggings and cloak;<br />
<br />
2.   Footpads of the Tiger (from Snowbeast); Sells for about 1kpp on Zeb;<br />
<br />
3.   Heretics Quest for the Swiftclaw Sash; Sells for about 1kpp too.<br />
<br />
I accidentally spent a whole RL month there (was playing a necro and left my ranger there). Now I have 8 Titan Leggings and 4 cloaks to get rid of, not to mention 6 Footpads. I almost had a heart attack when I saw all the pelts in my bank lolol.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
<br />
Oops forgot...Greater Wolf form is at 56. Oh well, try Wolf form anyway, it might work to reduce aggro.<br />
