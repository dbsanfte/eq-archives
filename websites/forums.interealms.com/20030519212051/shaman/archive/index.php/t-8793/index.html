<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've recently come back to EQ and my very cash-strapped Shaman and thought I'd come to the crucible for some advice on upgrades (magelo in sig).<br />
<br />
The areas I think are most in need of attention are... fingers (currently saving for a pair of Velium Jade Wedding Rings), wrist shoulders and face.<br />
<br />
Suggestions for any of the other slots would also be welcome, so I know what to aim for in the longterm.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definately do velium fire wedding rings, those recondite rings aren't helping you at all.<br />
<br />
Face - Crystal Spider Eyes, Veil of the Executioner, etc, one of those 3 wis 35hp 25mana face pieces, there are several close to each other in stats. Or, if you are cash strapped, silvery masks sometimes sell for as low as 25 plat and provide 25 hp.<br />
<br />
Arms - giant scalemail (+20 hp, +3wis), or hardened grey flesh sleeves (30 hp, more expensive)<br />
<br />
Back - Shimmering Terror Hide Cloak (+50 hp, sells for 700-1k). <br />
<br />
Earring - Earring of the Solstice, will cost you 7-10k, but is one of the best earrings you can get. Period. Unless you raid vex thal every week, this is it for top notch earrings.<br />
<br />
Just a few pointers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You mentioned you straped for cash.  In that case, I recommend doing a few quests.  Start with the Fine Cut Diamond Mask out of Plane of Knowledge.  Gives 3 to all stats and spell haste 2, for a cash outlay of somewhere around 10pp.  There are a series of quests that result in focus level 2 items in PoK that can really help out while you try for the big stuff.  Try and obtain Mana Pres 2, Imp Healing 2 (if that is a role you play often), Affliction whatever 2, and spell haste 2.  Overall, this will increase your mana pool, and make you much more effective that a couple WIS here, or a few HP there.  This suggestion is only valid if you are strapped for cash and trying to get back in the game, and don't mind running a few quests.  As an alternative for a free earring, you might look at a Jasper Kundan earring.  It's basically a forest loop with 3 added STR.  And the Coldain Military Wristguard quest is EASY, EASY, EASY ... provided you can kill a 50ish mob.  If you can't, try rounding up a shaman that is looking for the bracer, and you trade off your time to build the twink and run the quest, for his time killing the final mob once each for both of you.  <br />

Just a couple ideas, hope they help.</div></div><hr />
