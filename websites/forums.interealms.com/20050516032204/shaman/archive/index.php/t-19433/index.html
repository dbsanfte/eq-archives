<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azmaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I was looking at it and are pet we have is not all that great. I like to look at it like a dru's pet but we have know that's dru's pet they get are even worce off then we are. Well We shm'a and dru's get some not alot but some of the same anime spells like inviz Vs animals and charm anime but dru's get animal DC. On raids and soloing this would be realy good and help full for us shm's if we got anime Dc. Well let me know what you think this is just an idea that came to my mind and wanted to know what other shm's would think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, back to the substance.... No.  <br />
I personally hate the blending of the classes, and really don't think shaman should get any sort of powerful charm as our class was not really designed around it.  honestly, I think the few cruddy charm animal spells we get were an afterthought that should have never occured.<br />
<br />
Really, i don't want any abilities of other classes that aren't already in my arsenal.  I'd just be happy with some, dare I say it, *new* abilities.  Or at very least some upgrades to what I already have.  Every time the lines blur between classes, classes are set against eachother, thinking they will soon become obsolete.  I'd rather keep everyone different, and happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, I dont think we need a charm either, but then agian, im stuck at 42, so I wouldn't know about raids and that what-not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In a word No. Enc and Dru can charm things at pretty much all lv's. Shm how ever can not charm anything over lv34 we only get 2 charm spells. It would make no sinces for us to get DC what so ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No. <br />
/agree with Rookz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, and I wouldn't cry if they remove the charm spells we have.<br />
Just need some upgrading on core abilities, no new garbage required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
No you don't.<br />
 English isnt the first language for some of your Shaman brethern and this is obviously the case here. Plus a spell checker would have only pulled him for three words.<br />
<br />
And yes I agree with him :). We should get a charm spell..... with a lvl 70 cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">unresistable of course :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">silly to even suggest it imo, it does not &quot;fit&quot; our class concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sunrise_01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">DC a level 30 mob?<br />
That is what would we would get asking for this.<br />
<br />
Though a spirit charm would be an interesting concept.<br />
Maybe a fun low level toy ;)<br />
<br />
Charm animal had its place at the lower levels as slightly better than out pet in some places.<br />
Should have been replaced with a better pet though imho.<br />
Should also be Shaman pets at lower levels.<br />
<br />
If you want fun stuff to add to the Shaman class spirit/animal illusions would be fun. :)<br />
Spirit Bird, Spirit Wolf, Spirit Bears and come on who would not jump at the chance to be a Spirit Snow Bunny?<br />
<br />
Could even make it so we can summon more spirits than a Wolf etc....<br />
Lots of &quot;fun&quot; possiblities for the Shaman class that will likely never be explored.<br />
<br />
Summoning a random animal spirit from a zone with no better than our pet would be fun too like the Mage monster summoning but only animals for us.<br />
<br />
WTD for animal spirits?<br />
<br />
Sony isnt very creative ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can't think of a single valid reason for us to have DC.  DC isn't even very useful any more, anyways.  There is nothing to DC in LDoN, and PoP DC pets are only marginally useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No.<br />
<br />
All I want are some decent heals.  When a hybrid class (Paladins) can heal almost as good as a shaman, there is something horribly wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DC?!?!?!?!?!<br />
what the HELL are you thinking?!?!?!?!?!<br />
go reroll a druid NOW AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">charm anime  <br />
<br />
I think we do need a charm anime spell, but I dont recall seeing very many japanese cartoon type characters running around in EQ.  Its use, then, would be pretty negligable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At one time, shaman could charm any animals in the game - our 29th level befriend animals spell didn't have a level cap associated with it, so we could charm any animal a druid could charm.<br />
<br />
That got &quot;adjusted&quot; shortly after Kunark's release, and we got the 34th level charm given to us as some kind of weird compensation.<br />
<br />
So yeah, it'd be nice to see shaman charm ability returned to its original power, but not in the form of dire charm.  DC isn't worth it, for reasons already stated.<br />
<br />
It's not likely to happen any time soon tho.  And I'd be really annoyed if I had to scribe a spell called &quot;Command of Tunare&quot; into MY spellbook anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">its not THAT horrific of an idea. People are such emphatic critics of others' ideas these boards get annoying sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shaman's DC ? No...<br />
<br />
Actually DC is too powerful imo (hey, don't slap me, I don't ask for a nerf, just my opinion :D).<br />
<br />
More seriously, Charm isn't our job.<br />
<br />
DC + Slow + Healing... Now that would be way way way too much and the others classes should have something to whine WITH reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Back when EQ was first created it may have made sense but somewhere along the way we went from being a charm class to a pet class. I for one prefer it that way, I don't have to worry about fido chewing on my leg when I'm in the middle of a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i think dc wouldnt work for shaman, i always thought shaman should be able to use spirits (ghost ,spectras, but not skeleton zombies etc) and possible summon a ghost/spirit from slain mobs as pets. or charm spirits already there.<br />
so i was thinking  shaman talk to spirits? could he not ask a spirit to help him? so possible similar to necro aa where you raise fallen npc or pc but gives a dc type stats, the shaman could do one that gives a pet similar to a dc pet(faded of course but same graphics as which ever dead thing used) whatever recast of dc is.<br />
<br />
if  thinking using this on any corspe too much, maybe limit it to corpse of the same level as dc? (think level 46?)<br />
<br />
or using this just gives an improved pet but with the graphics of a soul. (ghost) what that improvement be up to debate but would say hits harder, more hp etc. <br />
<br />
basically the more aa it cost the better it should be.<br />
the posible nice aa that could be assosiate with spirits are good, why SoE cant think of them i dont know, spirit protection, spirit angry etc all ways to havea spirit theme?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would have to sya no also, but it does bring up a point. Did ya notice that Shaman have several lines of spells that sort of get whacked. Fire nuke, Charm Animal, SoW line. I'm sure there are more, but it seems the original idea they had for Shaman sort of went out the window after the original game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">yes , we could mellee too had same skill as a warrioir till level 50. (but no double attack or duel wield so about 1/4 war)<br />
if fact till 50 we could heal ok and nuke ok too our dots where better but not by the huge amount they are today. i think i would perfer to got back to ok nukes and dots better but smaller than they are as dots arent so usefull now for groups.<br />
oh and our pets weren`t that bad either, certain better in relation to difference in (actual) level than truespirit.<br />
<br />
but it does seem the warriorpriest (well seem to me) that shaman were, has change alot, now we just a debuffer class. (yes we still have buffs too but not what they used to be)</div></div><hr />

- DA but we can still cast spells / get beneficial spells from others (0.1sec casting time, 0.1sec recast time, 10mana, duration: till you click it off)<br />
- SoS<br />
- more HPs then a warrior<br />
- DPS table from monk<br />
- dual wield / double attack (at 400)<br />
- all weapon skills at 410<br />
- unresistable 100% slow<br />

- unresistable nuke that kills any mob (0.1sec casting time, 0.1sec recast time, 10mana, double XP from kill)<br />

- track (all zones)<br />
- a skill that gives you a msg when a named mob somewhere pop (you can select which mobs spawn you want to get messaged and which not)<br />
- a spell that kills all gnomes on your server (1sec casting, eats all your mana, 2.2sec recast time) well, this spell could be to powerfull.<br />

<br />
what you mised to point entirely so make up stuff that nobody asked for ? cause you cant actually come up with any real arguements.. my word, impressive.<br />
<br />
least some poeple said no and why they thought it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Im going to say no.  Shaman are a pet class by accident I believe, simmilar in the way that we can invis by accident (have heard many times that shaman werent supposed to get regular invis, just invis v animals, probably why we are the only class that casts some sort of invis but does NOT get an improved, fixed duration invis...even hybrids get that).  We were just lucky enough, unlike druids, to get a pet that was actually worth something.  At lower levels hes not much more than a small speedbump in the way to a shaman sandwich, but at 61 our pet is almost respectable.  I still think it needs innate dual wield and we need a better pet haste, but thats beside the issue I think.<br />
<br />
Simmilarly, shaman were able to cast charm by accident as well.  Remember that shaman charm spells were added in original EQ, before people knew how to make charm really effective. The line was not continued very long for us, and I believe a hold over accident from beta testing.  Regardless, enabling shaman to use DC when the last charm spell we got was at 34 is too big of a stretch for me to see.  True, of all the classes that can charm I believe shaman are the most prepared for when charm breaks, but with Dc that is hardly a problem.<br />
<br />
Someone else said it; it just doesnt fit with what shaman have become.  Sure, it would be usefull in some situations, but so would a group heal, and we all know thats not going to happen before Satan takes ice skating lessons or bin Laden joins Billy Graham in a crusade across America.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">if we didnt have a pet do you think we could get better healing or dds?<br />
<br />
alot depends on the way you see shaman, <br />
<br />
shaman - in societies practicing shamanism: one acting as a medium between the visible and spirit worlds; practices sorcery for healing or divination<br />
priest-doctor<br />
non-Christian priest, priest - a spiritual leader in a non-Christian religion<br />
medicine man - a Native American shaman  <br />
<br />
you can go alot of ways on this:)<br />
<br />
a spiritual leader? a person who sees and converses between the visible and spirit worlds? this would be shields (from physical/magic harm) and healing.<br />
<br />
i would have like the spirit world to be more important with shamans, but hey ho<br />
<br />
and what about voodoo? is that shamistic? that would count to posions and pets(zombies), if you count the dolls then direct damage.<br />
hey zombie pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">PoP DC pets are only marginally useful. <br />
<br />
Perhaps in Plane of Time.  For a level 60 ability from Luclin era, DC is more than marginally useful.  Free dps is marginally useful?  Our own pet is marginally useful, DC pets are very useful.<br />
<br />
I do agree, however, that giving us DC would just be wierd.  Sure it would be useful, but where is the precedence?  Our level 34 charm???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You have to find a DC mob first which never seem to be around when you actually need one. I would also put it in the marginally useful category.<br />
<br />
And we definately don't need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I want a charm that will charm anything, regardless of what type of mob it is or level, without fail, and gives no agro when charm breaks.<br />
<br />
However if you try to get it to attack anything turns on you and death touches you..<br />
<br />
that way I can just randomly shrink and grow stuff wherever I am, instead of just low level animals :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'd say no, mainly because we're very limited in that area.  Enchanters, Druids &amp; Necro's have a lot of charms - so DC is an extension of that.  We have only one charm that I'm aware of, and it caps at 34.<br />
<br />
However, since we do have that line of Summon Wolf Spirit spells... I could see some kind of Pet Summon similiar to DC (in duration, recast, etc) - something that'd give us a real pet, for an hour or so (or until we zone).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">i would too, but i am sure if they did, which i doubt they will, but if they did they would probably add something to limit what zones it can be used it, like the dc is now. maybe have random bone piles pop that we can ask the spirit to help us or somin. i would certain like to make zombies? voodoo? or ask more powerful spirit for help:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">level restrictions be damned, I want to DC Tulkor.</div></div><hr />

Got it with my Necro back in early Luclin days and was actually a fairly decent AA till they nerfed the experience with it.
