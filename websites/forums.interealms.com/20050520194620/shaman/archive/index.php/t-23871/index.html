<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iskarar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does Oow compare in size and things to do as there was in pop?<br />
Ive seen 4 zones. One instanced, the main zone in, wall of slaughter and nobles just from one day of poking around. Gonna go back soon but not sure where to head. Wos looked like a dead end zone. I was wondering the scope of size in oow (landscape, things to do, raiding, soloing,grouping content) compared with pop as pop was the other last lvling expansion. Was just wondering if anyone had a grasp of the longevity and size of the expansion after one weeks worth of exploring. Havnt explored beyond one days worth yet so I have a long way to go and hoping theres lots to be excited about. I found the instanced zone boring and slow, its the only grouping I did, I left after 2 hours of that and did only minor exploring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far, the zones I know of are: Riftseekers, Wall of Slaughter, Nobles Causeway, Bloodfields, Dranik's Scar, Ruined City of Dranik, Muramite Proving Grounds, and the Citidel of Anguish (locked).  I believe there are instanced zones off of scar, city, MPG.  I'm sure there are others I don't know of.  That's 10 zones we know of for sure.<br />
<br />
All things considered, it's a pretty big zone.  <br />
<br />
PoP was what, 16 zones?  Time, 4 planes, PoV, HoH (including b in a, since it's so small), Sol Ro, Tactics, PoI, PoTort, PoN, PoD, CoD, PoS, BoT.<br />
<br />
Did I miss any?<br />

Considering the 10 static zones in OoW plus several instanced ones, it's a decent sized expansion - especially considering how shortly it was released after GoD.  6 months?  Not much time for a nice increase in content.</div></div><hr />
