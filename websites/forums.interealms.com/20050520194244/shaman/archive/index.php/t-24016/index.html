<br />
Basically, in EQLive, since slow and haste is as widespread as it is, they basically have to tune mobs with slow in mind.    So essentially, if Sony knows that every mob is going to be slowed a certain % and every player is hasted by at least x%, then they'll just up mob damage and hp more to compensate.<br />
<br />
In EQ2, the idea is to make it so that slow and haste actually mean something by not making it something a character can cast all the time.  So, by making those spells finite in their use, it allows for more creative design of content.<br />
<br />
Logically, the concept makes sense, but I am very anxious to see how it plays out.</div></div><hr />

Slows are in, and they are actually quite effective - especially when upgraded from Apprentice level to Adept I or III.  Originally, around last pwipe, they could only be maintained on one target at a time; but that's been altered, thankfully. ;)  <br />
<br />
It's balanced a bit with a cap; the level 10 shaman slow cannot affect anything above level 27.   It's a pretty generous range.  No complaints here.<br />
<br />
AE slow is also in for the Mystic sub-class (not Defilers) at level 35.  Just been playing with it for a day or two now, but so far so good.</div></div><hr />
