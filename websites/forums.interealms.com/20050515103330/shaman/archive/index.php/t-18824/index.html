<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the cutting edge of what can be soloed these days?<br />
<br />
I have watched over the years, as its gone from the PoD, to Lodi, to WW Dragons, to PoP mobs that hit for a ton. I have seen some epic fights go from 4 groups, to 3, to 2, to 1, to duoable to soloable.<br />
<br />
So, with 300+ AA, time gear, leet strats and patience, whats the cutting edge these days? Also, what is *just* out of reach, whats on the horizon currently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finding a girlfriend? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Etric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finding a girlfriend?<br />
<br />
I think that is WAY out of reach for some :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have 300+ aa's and time gear, you obviously don't have a girlfriend, and don't know how to get one.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the one guy that says he does, if she weighs 3 bills, it don't count. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they need love too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have 300AAs (well, 295 right now), almost full time gear and I do have a girlfriend.  But, then again, I just got this girlfriend so I can't say how well she's hold out over eq.<br />
<br />
Anyways, i don't know what can be soloed now that used to not be able to.  I know that we can tank some mobs that we used to not be able to.  By this, i mean i can be the main tank in a PoE group, as well as solo those mobs and solo Sol Ro mobs by tanking them and not by kiting them.<br />
<br />
However, in regards to actual other stuff.. I have no clue, I've never been one to actually go out there and push myself (haven't actually tried to solo a guardian wurm yet, although that's a great idea).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Once, when I had ~250AA and about 4kish HP I tried to solo an SRT mob.  I won, but just barely.<br />
<br />
Two days ago I tried it again.  5010 unbuffed and 370AA.  Kicked its ass and had 50m left over.  What's next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have 300+ aa's and time gear, you obviously don't have a girlfriend, and don't know how to get one.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the one guy that says he does, if she weighs 3 bills, it don't count. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
385aa's almost full time gear. Been with the same girl for over 2 years now. 5'6 110lbs and I know for a fact that she looks better then anything that you have ever had. <br />
<br />
And lets face it only someone who is still spanking it to his moms sears catalog would make a comment like that to begin with. And befor you start crying look at it this way. If you cant take it dont dish it out. You insulted myself and meny others on this MB with that comment. So be ready to take your flames.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have 284 aa and best solo was Zelnithak in Umbral Plains.<br />
As to girlfriend, no I have not got one and probably its not likely you have one either. Or possibly you are just verging past puberty to make such a statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's a defensive mechanism that most people have.  When they realize that other people are better or more succesful than them at something, they have to find some way to rationalize it and make it so that they're still the &quot;winners&quot;.<br />
<br />
Example  - The other night in auction channel someone was bragging about his ornate silk gloves and boots (this guy brags about EVERYTHING he ever does, like killing Thangbrand in BoT) and I unpolitely informed him that no one cared.  He said &quot;Oh yeah, how many pieces of ornate do you have?&quot; and I linked him my four pieces of rosraks, as well as my ornate helm, bp, and legs that I keep bagged.  I was then informed that I was fat and had no life.<br />
<br />
You have to be seriously insecure with yourself in order to make unjustified, sweeping generalizations like &quot;If you have a good EQ character you have no life&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, quality posting.  I don't recall the original poster asking for relationship advice.  And I kinda doubt the fact that he has achieved a great deal in EQ correlates to anything in his RL.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would think Kunark dragons would be up there.  I know its been done but I don't think I could pull it off.  I think ToV armor farm mobs would be tough, but that's probably been done too.  BoT Tower named (not the bosses) would be an interesting challenge for those with a zillion hps, but they all mitigate slow and may not be rootable.  For most of PoP, the named hit so hard that I don't think a lot of the non charm classes have a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you have 300+ aa's and time gear, you obviously don't have a girlfriend, and don't know how to get one.<br />

<br />
Planes of Power was released on October 22, 2002.  The expansion is over a 16 months old.  If you were level 60 when it came out, that gave you roughly 485 days to get to 65 and start getting AA's.  Your average BoT group can get you an AA every 60 to 90 minutes.  In that 485 days you would have 29100 minutes to get AA's.  If you played 3 hours a night for 4 days a week and got AA's at 1 every 90 minutes, you would have 3880 AA's.  To get 300 AA's it would take you about 38 days, playing at the same 3 hours a night, 4 days a week.<br />
<br />
As far as having Time gear, all that takes is patience and play time.  If you wanted to, I think that it is entirely possible to go from naked newbie to time gear with 300 AA in about 6 months.<br />
<br />
Your comment is petulant, nieve, and juvenille.  I think it rises from jelousy of people that have actually applied themselves and reaped the rewards from their efforts instead of spouting mean spirited comments on a message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">errr, my comment was a joke as I was leaving the office. I thought it was kinda funny, tongue in cheek..... if people took offense at it they should relax.<br />
<br />
There was nothing mean spirited in my comment whatsoever. I can't wait to have time access, and a ton of aa.<br />
<br />
Don't immediately assume that everything is a put down. Sometimes a joke is just a joke.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Clarification of joke for no reason really: I am level 65, 70aa and elemental flagged. Character was born in April of 2003. I would say it is possible to get time equipped and 300 more aa if I had the 3 years others had. Also, happily married and work for a living. Thus, no malice. Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm generally an easy going person that ignores most jabs and sniping.<br />
<br />
However, the comment that was made WAS made in poor taste and had the tang of snipeness about it.  It classified anyone that has time gear and 300ish AA's as someone with akward social ability and an inability to meet and befriend women.  I find this comment to be patently false.  EQ is NOT a hard game.  To succeed you need a modicum of hand eye coordination, simple problem solving skills and a few hours of time to apply to the game.  It does not require endless hours sitting enslaved to the computer to the exclusion of all else.  Just because someone has accieved a certain level of success in the game does not make them socially inept.  I would argue that is IS those that have personalbe skills and a willingness to meet and work with people that are successfull in the long run.<br />
<br />
Yes, sometimes a joke is just a joke.  The previous post was not a joke.  It was a jab.  It revealed a certain amount of jealousy on the posters part for anyone that could attain that level of play.  There is, however, a way to ensure that no posts are taken out of the intended context.  Dont post assinine remarks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">EDIT: I assume you don't mean me Thorzion. If I am wrong tell me. There is nothing in my post to get that excited about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dudes, relax.  This is a game, and my comment was a joke.  How can you seriously take offense at some inane comment made by someone who obviously does not know you or your real lifestyle.<br />
<br />
Chill, enjoy the game, and don't take it too seriously.  I have nothing but admiration for those of you who have accomplished any measure of success in this game.  But please remember, it is a game, and your accomplishments in game do not reflect at all on your real life, good, bad or indifferently.<br />
<br />
And in some of your replys you commit the same offense that you are accussing me of, that is, making a generalization about someone you don't know simply because of a harmless tongue-in-check comment.  Just as bad as making generalizations about someone's lifestyle based on the time they have spent in game.<br />
<br />
This is a game, repeat, a game based on a make believe virtual world, it has no bearing on real life in any way shape or form.</div></div><hr />

That I have over 300 AA's and time gear. Up untill now this board had been the one place that it didnt happen. <br />
<br />
If your going to joke you might want to make it at least look like one. Its pretty easy to do :P (joke) I am sure that most of the people that replied have had comments just like that leaved at them befor. And yes after awhile you do start to take it personal. And I for one am a person that will snap back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Snuggle, do you have any idea how many times I am called a geek at work because I am in IT? And because I play computer games? Do you care? I don't either. It's funny how you can be offended by people you don't know. Just be proud you have achieved the pinnacle of the game and ignore people who you feel are putting you down.<br />
<br />
I can't even tell who you are all annoyed with. Gonna assume you understand I was joking and are going to focus on kicking Thunderwolfjr around. I mean, what a crude git he is... haha..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your maths is flawed there ;p Taking the base assumptions you gave (3 hrs a day, 4 days a week, 90 minutes per aa = 8 AA per week), you would have roughtly 500ish aa after 485 days. (485/7*8=~554)<br />
<br />
What you did was taking those 8 AA per week to 8 AA per day. (485*8=3880)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone calls you a chubby, no-life geek and the comment is offensive then we can deduce that there is *some* correlation -- if only in peer group.  OTOH, saying that a girlfriend makes you winner and time gear makes you a loser is simply imposing personal values on others.  OTOOH, humor is nearly always a good thing.  So relax and go play.  Play is good.<br />

No matter how you slice it, if you are posting here, there is no higher ground to throw down rocks on people.  We pretty much all play everquest and are all in the same boat.  Whether or not people have girlfriends is hardly something to get worked up over, not like you can prove you do, nor can someone prove you don't.

This thread is way hijacked so I'll give a funny story from college to take it even more off track.  Was talking with this chick that lived in the same Dorm as I did and was hammered one night.  We were talking about our parents and stuff and I made a joke how bad my mom dressed and if it weren't for my dad she'd be in the same clothes from 20 years ago.  Right away she jumps in with &quot;Well I bet my dad has better taste in clothes than YOUR dad... he's French!&quot;  &quot;Well my dad can beat up YOUR dad!&quot;  I was so blown away that anyone could be so stupid and make a comment like that, it was at this point that I *started* to sober up and thought do I really care enough to have sex with a girl THIS stupid?  So anyway... the sex was great.<br />
<br />
What was the point of this?... OH yeah.  If people just relax and dont get all worked up just because of a stupid comment... you might get laid? I dont know what the point was I guess I just thought it was funny I could tell a girl my dad could beat up her dad. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I do not solo many mobs anymore as I two box but I have had a blast as more and more former raid encounters became one groupable.  Killing Dozeker in one group is fun.  I have seen him done by an individual 4 box toons with no elemental gear (which really impressed me).<br />
<br />
To me it seems that as the game has progressed and encounters have become trivialized, a number of quality quests have become doable with one group.  I am in a raiding guild and love raiding but unfortunately do not have nearly as much time to raid as I would like.  Now it is possible to do the leg work on several quality quests (ie killing the smaller stuff etc) and then gather a group or two to finish the boss mobs.  This has returned quest to everquest for me.  Hopefully this trend will continue.  Raiding should be a superior way of gaining quality equipment, but one should be able to supplement that equipment through meaning full quests.<br />
<br />
BTW I think this has the possibility to be an interesting thread.</div></div><hr />

It was just a joke. No need to go completely rabid and defensive over it. Who has such thin skin, to think it was directed at them personally? Honestly?<br />

Used to be happy and fun here, with bantering and friendly jokes amongst folks. Loose some of the angst, and smile. It won't break anything, and you might actually enjoy it.<br />

150AA 5k unbuff monk + 250AA FT12 4k unbuff shaman both with Virtue and with VoQ took 58 minutes to kill him. It was a fairly hard fight too.<br />

<br />
Seriously tho they make the really tough stuff unsoloable.. usually if it's hard you need to tank it because it summons and it'll kill your pet really fast so I think we are at a point where no one will be soloing something new.. or at least it is very unlikely to happen.. that's the only advantage we have over other classes that don't charm, ie we can tank and heal ourselves and put out just slightly more damage than the bastard can regen for and then after a while we win.. <br />

Right away she jumps in with &quot;Well I bet my dad has better taste in clothes than YOUR dad... he's French!&quot;  &quot;Well my dad can beat up YOUR dad!&quot;  I was so blown away that anyone could be so stupid and make a comment like that, it was at this point that I *started* to sober up and thought do I really care enough to have sex with a girl THIS stupid?  So anyway... the sex was great.<br />
<br />
What was the point of this?... OH yeah.  If people just relax and dont get all worked up just because of a stupid comment... you might get laid? I dont know what the point was I guess I just thought it was funny I could tell a girl my dad could beat up her dad. :)<br />
*wipes the tears from his eyes* good stuff :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">When I got back from Desert Storm I decided to surprise my fiance and didn't tell her I was coming home. She knew I was scheduled to come back soon, but I didn't tell her exactly when. I walked into our apartment and caught her with my best friend from high school in my bed that my parents gave me when I moved out. I found out later they had actually been sleeping together since the day after I shipped out.<br />
<br />
To get her off my mind I focused on my life and got a job as a clerk and went to a tech college with the money I got from the service. While in school I discovered some guys I thought were kind of nerdy but were so honest with themselves I thought it was very cool. I had been so used to people who put up this front of appearing like they wanted other people to view them, when inside they are completely different. I didn't even realize that people like that existed. Maybe I'm easily fooled or I'm naive.<br />
<br />
In any case, over the years these guys introduced me to games like Magic:the Gathering, Warhammer, Warcraft, and so on. Eventually the bug bit me and I got hooked on PC games. I became one of those guys that got excited when they would release a brand new game and look up all the info I could on them and even subscribed to the magazines. I am not a barhopping kind of guy and I feel out of place in Church, especially after the war, so I didn't spend a lot of time lookinf for a companion.<br />
<br />
In the natural order of things I picked up EQ and became hooked from the start. I spent a good deal of time wiling away the hours and got to level 60 and was in one of the top guilds on my server. I was online at least 4 nights a week.<br />
<br />
While in this 3 year stint I met a girl in EQ who intrigued me. She seemed very genuine, and of course we flirted a bunch, like EQ people tend to do with females. She is 7 years younger than I, but that doesn't matter when you find someone you really care about. We talked a lot over the phone and stuff and talked about games and things. EQ was just about the only thing we had in common. She was a cheerleader in high school and I was a motorhead. She likes all the girly movies and I like action and sci-fi. She'd never known anyone who's been in the armed forces, and we learned a lot about each other. <br />
<br />
We had an EQ wedding for fun (her suggestion) and shortly after we decided to meet. When I met her I was stunned to learn how attractive she is. I figured despite the cheerleader history she still plays video games a lot, so I thought at the very least she would be average looking. She is a knockout, man! As it turns out she was only messing around in EQ because her brother had an account that she could borrow. She started playing more often so she could talk to me. Anway, one thing led to another and I moved to her town and we moved in together.  We are getting married in June, and our families couldn't be happier.<br />
<br />
In the course of my life I can say that I have learned many lessons about people. First is that if you can find someone genuine, you should stick with that person. Second is that some people just can't see the good in people. They always have to find some flaw so they can feel better about their own life. Third is that you should never date a fat chick. However, if you happen to find a fat chick that is genuine, you should try and get your desperate friend to meet her.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps put some of your posts into perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">285 AAs and EP gear. Kunark dragons like Talendor and Severlious (sp) are definately on the soloable list. It takes a while and quite a bit of repetition, but that description fits 99% of EQ.<br />
<br />
One mob I advice against soloing is Nathyn Illuminus in Katta. Oh he's not hard, and he's definately soloable, but I had to gate out after 15 min. Why? Well, because I did some math, and it was going to take me ~3 hours to kill him if I maintained 50dps (he misses very, very rarely, constant healing is necessary).<br />
<br />
Three hours of boredem for one lousy robe I can't even use? Pass~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It's a defensive mechanism that most people have.  When they realize that other people are better or more succesful than them at something, they have to find some way to rationalize it and make it so that they're still the &quot;winners&quot;.<br />
<br />
Example  - The other night in auction channel someone was bragging about his ornate silk gloves and boots (this guy brags about EVERYTHING he ever does, like killing Thangbrand in BoT) and I unpolitely informed him that no one cared.  He said &quot;Oh yeah, how many pieces of ornate do you have?&quot; and I linked him my four pieces of rosraks, as well as my ornate helm, bp, and legs that I keep bagged.  I was then informed that I was fat and had no life.<br />
<br />
You have to be seriously insecure with yourself in order to make unjustified, sweeping generalizations like &quot;If you have a good EQ character you have no life&quot;.<br />
<br />
Your reaction to something that was obviously made as a funny comment could just as well be called a defensive mechanism.<br />
<br />
I always find it hilarious to see all the uber people that come out protesting remarks like this and claiming they have supermodel girlfriends and a hugely successful job and work out several hours a day too. And all this while they are in guilds that require 5-?? hours of raiding each day. Now if your /played time is less than 50 days Im seriously impressed :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Highest level mob I've killed solo was 68 does that count for anything? =b<br />
<br />
Seriously tho they make the really tough stuff unsoloable.. usually if it's hard you need to tank it because it summons and it'll kill your pet really fast so I think we are at a point where no one will be soloing something new.. or at least it is very unlikely to happen.. that's the only advantage we have over other classes that don't charm, ie we can tank and heal ourselves and put out just slightly more damage than the bastard can regen for and then after a while we win.. <br />
<br />
Coolest thing I know shaman solo are bot towers regular giants...<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't think that soloing a kunark dragon is cooler than that?</div></div><hr />
