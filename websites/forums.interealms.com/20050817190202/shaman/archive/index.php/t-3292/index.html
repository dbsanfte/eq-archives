<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a good way to get enough cash for my JBB any advice? All I have been doing is soloing in rathe. I want a new way rathe is getting boring :o</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Where exactley are they in OOT and how much do they drop? I am looking to get my JBB asap. Soloing giants I can make 200pp an hour. Can I make more than that in OOT? Getting items from high level dungeons would be nice also. Is 51 too low for places like that? Thanx again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seafuries are on Seafury Island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 51, the exp off Hill Giants is almost negligible (in my experience)<br />
Supposedly, Seafuries are really good exp at 51.  I haven't had the chance to give it a try, but I'm thinking about it.  Supposedly you can get a group in some dungeons at 51.  Your mileage may vary, of course, depending on server and zones.<br />
Good luck getting your JBB.  I've decided that it's just not something worth worrying about for me.  I can't afford one, I can't camp for one, and I doubt I'll be able to get the 13-18k for one together anytime soon. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends, Seafuries drop about 4 to 6pp each and gems and rings going from about 17pp up to 90pp or so. Luck is a big part of this for the gem drops. You can also pop Gornit there for HG type loot. Just stay away from Quag Maelstrom, a named Seafury because he has mana drain and you will die unless you have toys. The corrupted is no walk in the park either.<br />
<br />
Toyless, Seafuries take 2 EBolts,  slow and dogdog and melee, you can melee them without DOTS or 1 DOT but that takes longer I think. Slowed they are puss. Nice exp on Seafuries at 51 till 53.<br />
<br />
OOT map at http://www.eqatlas.com/oot.html but go East and a little North from first dock from Freeport, it's on Sisters Island, Seafury Island is the second island over, can't miss them they are just larger versions of the Rathe clops. Note that zone is backwards and when you zone in on the boat from Freeport you are put at the eastern end of the zone and from Faydwer the western.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I soloed the seafuries I pulled them with slow and then sent in the pet (buffed with regen and haste) and let him tank the seafurie wich he did easy ;) I also cast plague to speed it up some.<br />
<br />
First I tanked them myself, wich also was ok, but then I lost time I could cani dance, and since my pet was able to tank them I find it good to use him, and the pets have realy good regen rate wich is a waste not to use...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Luck is right...seafuries suck for exp..suck for loot and just plain suck imo I hated them before hate them now and will always hate them. Their hp is way too high to be fast money kills and its just annoying even with a jbb to kill them thats alot of cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only way I could see Seafuries being a good source of cash is killing them in between spawns on the Gornit camp.  Gornit is a fantastic source of cash, drops HG loot (anywhere up to 40/50pp) and is on a 6 minute spawn timer.  He is also a recognised camp by other players so he is your own personal, un-pickpocketed HG.  Killing him I used to make tons of cash and would take seafuries in betwee in order to keep xp going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye gornit is the way to go. <br />
<br />
Once you get the camp you can easily make 300-500pp per hour espcially if you have a port bot to sell the fine steel weapons for you. Also if you can manage to pull a sea fury between gornits you may get lucky and get the odd gem or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, now that I think on it Seafuries weren't that much fun but for a diversion while watching the races or some old cartoons or movies they weren't too bad.<br />
<br />
I was farming the Derv camps in S. Ro while waiting for a raid the other day, made about 30pp in bronze and junk, felt like a manaburnin' wizzie nukin them down in one hit. Actually was fun for awhile.</div></div><hr />
