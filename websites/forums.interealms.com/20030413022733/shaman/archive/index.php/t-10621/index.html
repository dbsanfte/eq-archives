<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  I'm new to posting but not to the site.  All my questions were answered in these threads. :)<br />
<br />
I was fortunate enough to get the child tear from Plane of Fear tonight and am looking forward to completing the last two kills for my spear.  But I have a question.  Back in the earlier days of my epic, I was in Emerald Jungle handing an item into the spirit when I got jumped by some mob.  I thought I had targeted the mob but I hadn't and in the end, I wound up killing the spirit.<br />
<br />
I have a City of Mist raid coming up soon and I want to cover all my bases before I proceed.  Do you think that killing that spirit has lowered my faction enough to where I wouldn't get the spear?  If so, what steps should I do to get my faction back up?  And lastly, when I go to CoM, how should Neh'Ashiir and Lord Rak con me?  I have done all the steps of my epic, never skipping over one of them.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't remember what Neh was but Rak conned ally before engagement. If you want to be positive make sure you are max ally before turning in scale. While doing Neh and Rak we also downed Ghiosk and I picked up those books and turned in to confirm faction before turning in scale. Even though I had done all the steps I wanted to be positive he wasn't going to eat it.<br />
<br />
For scale turn-in I would bring someone who can keep mobs off ya while ya do it. Better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
And BTW congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well did the spirit give you a faction hit when you killed it? (I expect not; I don't think any Truespirit mobs give faction hits when killed.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did a bit of digging around in the site and other places to check what faction should be.  Then I conned a TS faction npc.  Looks like I am right on the money and good to go.  Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />
