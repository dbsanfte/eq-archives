You still had a nice round overall. Sorry if I spoiled anything 8( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>krogchoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Errr, I'm sorry, but what I see here is about 7 to 8 k damage over 2 minutes. I think you counted 2 times each shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some will count that as 1240 instead of 620.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having said all that a very nice run anyhow and yes rangers can do over 15 K in 2 mins with a nice bow and arrows and a few AA :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah 15k is easy, i did about 19k to statue a few weeks ago and i didn't use TS for it, it was just straight shootin. got AM3/EQ.  dex was maxxed at 265, and my attack was around 1440 or so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you want a good parse, try against the mist panther in WL, you can really tell your damage there.  As an example, with max haste, fleeting quiver, bow of the silver fang (35/42), 255 STR/DEX, 1520 ATK, 240 archery, eagle eye, and 0 AA at level 60, I did a little under 6k damage in about 18 seconds against the Executioner Trial end boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">some eqlog analyzers count hit dmg and non-melee dmg together. Like Yalp! analyzer<br />

I was very happy when i checked my dmg and saw 116k dmg on HighPriest in Ssra :) .... too bad its /2 :(</div></div><hr />
