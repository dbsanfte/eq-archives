<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well the new avatar so far sucks.<br />
<br />
The new HoT isnt looking bad, but this needs to be compared to the mobs we will be dealing with before we can sy if its really good or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
ToW looks fairly unimpressive since they know what needs to happen to it and its just a plain old upgrade to Focus line. Need those modifiers on there.<br />
<br />
New DoT doesnt look horrible.<br />
<br />
Looks like we are getting a 60% group haste which is nice, even though ToA should already be 60%. I do see a new single target haste also, so hmm, maybe we get 70% single target ?<br />
<br />
New magic based root ... kinda pointless IMHO.<br />
<br />
Single target stat buffs ... ROFL is all i can say to that. But what did you expect.<br />
<br />
New rain... I like rain spells, so this is kinda neat.<br />
<br />
new pet at 66 which will be weak again at 70 .. bleh.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno, a few &quot;neat&quot; things, but i dont see anything that make me go WOW about OoW. Frankly SoE needs to WOW us right now, they painted themselves into a corner and now need to produce something interesting.<br />

<br />
At this point, it's like giving Ritz Crackers to the homeless. If they don't b**ch and whine for more and seem generally content with the &quot;&quot;Gift&quot;&quot; that they have been given, then they will probably become the final version. I was hoping Sony would give us absolute crap, to the point that other classes would say &quot;WoW, Sony gave Shaman Crap again this expansion.&quot; That way the upgrades would be noticable. As it is, this seems in line with all the other expansions we have been through. I could have predicted the spellset to almost the number. There's probably a formula to our obselecence. <br />
New Stat Buff = 10 x (Number of Expansions Class Ignored). <br />
New Haste = 10% x (Number of Expansions Class Ignored). <br />
New Dot Damage = (Number of Days a year Sony Makes money off us) x (Number of Expansions Class Ignored). <br />
<br />
Do the math. I'm right. kthks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Some thoughts...<br />
<br />
I'd rather have seen raw modifiers than stat buffs, to be honest, but there's something unusual in slot 10 on them - except for STA, which doesn't have the Unknown #262 part.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Strength  <br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase STR by 85 <br />
10:  Unknown #262 (100/85/0) <br />
 <br />
I'd bet that slot 10 relates to some sort of cap breaking thing, similar to bard overhaste. I notice the Enchanter haste still has its Chance to critical hit (10) line rather than DEX and AGI, so that would leave shamans as the only class able to break the cap. For what it's worth, Beastlords have lost the melee mod on their IoS clone, too....<br />
<br />
Secondly, only some of the spells have been assigned new names. Whether that's because they've not thought of names yet, or because the others will undergo big changes (such as the Malosinia clone became a new canni) remains to be seen....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This one will be a blast.... (DOT spell)<br />
Blood of Obkin<br />
Decrease HP by 709 <br />
7 tic's duration<br />
----<br />
So...  7 * 709 = 4763<br />
With TimeBurn (extend DOT by 20%) i'll get 5956 dmg<br />
Now take into account my Burning Aff IV item (20% dmg+) I'll get 7147 dmg<br />
----<br />
The part where I'm unsure of is how my CRIT DOT AA will be applied So I'll ignore this for now.    The fun part of this spell will be watching the shaman that cast it die like snowflakes in Death Valley.  The mind boggles at the speed  you'll be insta-death touched when the first CRIT DOT hits.....<br />
<br />
   Sounds like a fun DOT!   :eek: <br />
Anyway, I hope they'll put some kind of agro-reduction on it or this will become extremely situational<br />

<br />
<br />
I was looking at the necro DoTs on test and i realize that these won't be the final ones, however we're getting about 250 more than them per tick with our new DoT compared to http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5437&amp;source=Live.<br />
<br />
If the fights in OoW are long duration and the poison aggro gets modified, this new DoT + Bane per mob would put out some nice DPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Again, our last pet is four levels behind the cap (Lyken Spirit, 66).<br />
<br />
Some of the spell names are very stupid imo, but I realize they can change.  The new DoT, if the numbers are correct, is sick... it's just too bad it probably will never be used in a group.<br />
<br />
I pray the new cannibalize spells (or at least one of them, dreading what they'll make us do for the 70 spells) are more common by far than the ancient.<br />
<br />
The new heal  (Increase Hitpoints by 1690) makes me wanna cry :(  <br />

Also... the pain and knowledge of your ancestors?  Lol, no kidding!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">hmm so how is that dot going to be any more useful than blood of saryn. These spells look disappointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Obviously, a lot of this is still changing.  Many spells are still template copies of existing stuff, and some of the naming conventions (Ball of Really Cold Water, woot!) are clear clues that there is still revision in the works.  For now, I'd say to keep a wary eye on Lucy, calmly point out that stat buffs and 2+ minute dots aren't really a good idea (but without histrionics, yet), and wait for another round or two of changes ... and show support for things like BoObkin, which except for the innate aggro issues inherant to DoTs, is quite a fine piece of magic.</div></div><hr />

no resist adjust, good luck getting that to land in pvp or in the first 7 casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">filling the spell setup with some useless buff crap does not bother me so much, there are a couple nice spells there as well. The Canni upgrade, the DoTs and  even the root is ok.<br />
<br />
But I do not understand the heal and the nuke in that lineup. I thought they had finally found out that fights are SHORTER! Why the F*** do they come with a fast heal for 1680 hp and a nuke for 1202 and a cast time of 7.8 secs?  This is exactly the same piece of crap we have to put up with now. For me it does not make a difference if I heal 1500 hp or 168o hp with one cast, it is only a bandaid anyways. Similar useless the nuke, by the time I am done casting your regular exp mob in GoD or normal LDoN is dead. <br />
<br />
So I really hope this meeting happening ?now?  is getting someone at SOE to realize that shamans need to be tuned toward the much faster pace of combat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Devs - take off your ****ing tin foil hats and get your retard wranglers to change your diapers. Can you honestly make a ****ing regen spell for 33 a tick with a straight face? You guys are aware of what damage people face? If it was 100 a tick, it would still be ass. A brand new quiesence? Unless its 800+ a tic, dont even ****ing talk to me. Back in the day, torpor was healing a lot higher % in relation to mob dps. How about we keep THOSE percents, and you guys can cram your 47% of a cleric bull**** through your urethras, along with about a foot of barbed wire. Yeah, I'm pissed and off my meds, but that doesnt change the fact that any gloid can tell these spells suck and wont be changed unless we raise hell now. Furthermore, if we dont change these, we cant get better ones than the lame pieces of inadequate crap we have now, because, hey, gotta make the level 70 ones look good in comparison.<br />

It's the same ole crap different expansion. Plus the fact that most of the 'so called good ' spells will more than likely be out of reach as are some of the GoD spells. To TOP it off the Cann spell is still ancient. Makes no sense period!! That spell is what our class is known for and to make it so out of reach is a slap in the face!<br />

<br />
Stacking: Block new spell if slot 1 is effect 'STR' and &lt; 1085<br />
Stacking: Block new spell if slot 1 is effect 'DEX' and &lt; 1085<br />

I think they have to remove the caps.  Right now, stat buffs are useless becasue everyone has max in the stats they care about.  And God, I pray, PRAY they remove stat caps because it would help make shamans more useful and I really don't want to get rid of Megara; I am quite fond of her.<br />

Lifting the cap might not have that much of an effect though, since you face diminishing returns from even the more useful stats, such as STA, WIS or INT, after 255 or thereabouts. If that is left in place then having larger stats in those areas will be largely pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">main problem though is though stats would become nice big numbers at the end of the day stats dont make that much difference to fighting mobs and as such are really pretty useless<br />
<br />
we need buff that actually really help mellees<br />
<br />
if these go live i would assume shaman as mains will become extinct.  druids will rule, beast will act as shaman. and noone will really care as shaman dont bring much and hey they can solo right?<br />

even more bitter and twist, thank god there is other stuff coming out, i just hope its good cos as it stands i not sure i will wont to play eq more.</div></div><hr />

----------<br />
Historically they have either extended focus effects to new levels or added new items.   I have already replaced my Burning AFF IV item with one from GoD (which I hope will be extended to 70+).  Assuming there are focus items in the game that effect up to level 70 spells what I posted still applies.   If they don't add-in focus effects for that level spells then that will be another entirely different issue than what agro one can generate with the base DOT + focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I have a feeling they will up the level cap on IV items to 70.

If they don't, it could make for some pretty pissed people that spent upwards of 4k ldon points for IV augments....</div></div><hr />

<br />
And.. wizards nuke for 4200+ damage per cast, no modifiers, extensions, crits, etc. I bet you that he wil get 3 of those spells off before your 1st dot has run it's course, let alone draw the aggro that you surely will.<br />
<br />
/shrug. Those dots are utter crap, except perhaps the poison one which is just so-so in my eyes. Counting out the &quot;possible&quot; damage does no one good. I could count out the possible damage of my dots right now and they would seem impressive, but we all know how things really are.<br />
<br />
In fact, that whole spell line up they are putting out there is crap. More stat buffs? /snort. The new modifiers on some of the buffs are nice, but who knows how effective they are. We all know how good some of the combat effects on the gear is, marginally better than worth nothing.<br />
Our heal and nuke are sad. No, not sad. Pitiful. Other classes are getting some **** as well. Seems like every class who is doing well at the moment will be decently happy with the OoW spell line up, and those that aren't won't. Why? Because SoE can't understand the simple thing that % increases just leaves those with weaker spells/effect even further behind. We are happy to finally break 1k with our nuke. Wizards had that before any expansions came out. 20 levels, 7 expansions and 3 level cap raises and we finally catch up to that? Screw Sony in the eye.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Mix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">You missed this:<br />
<br />
Stacking: Block new spell if slot 1 is effect 'STR' and &lt; 1085<br />
Stacking: Block new spell if slot 1 is effect 'DEX' and &lt; 1085<br />
<br />
If those numbers are correct, it implies that the cap on stats is being removed.<br />
It just implies a bug in lucy or someone typing in incorrect stuff. I do not see any 1100 Str buffs that need to be blocked just yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Things I don't get:<br />
1.) Why did they take the damage mod that was already added off Avatar? I can understand just playing with the numbers but completely removing it and not adding anything in it's place looks as if someone found it to be too powerful.<br />
<br />
2.) The numbers on the &quot;unknown&quot; entries do look a lot like over-stat entries. Why give us those when stats are hardcoded to have diminishing returns anyways? Were the damage/avoidance effects deemed too powerful?<br />
<br />
3) Why did our DoTs get a boost when SOE clearly stated fights are not going to get longer? Our new nukes are just as weak as our old ones.<br />
<br />
4.) So shaman do not deserve to get decent heals? We get a heal that heals less then what we needed to be a second-class healer in GoD? Unless Omens MOBs are going to hit for less or be more slowable we will be a worse healer then we are now.<br />
<br />
5.) A whopping 33 point regeneration? I could cast a 10 point regenration back when MOBs hit for 100. Now I am going to kill 1500 hitters for experience that are less slowable, have a faster base delay and I am doind it with less downtime. Is this spell line supposed to become more useless with every expansion?<br />
<br />
Things I like<br />
Uuuh . . the new Poison looks nice if we can get DoT aggro fixed. The Cannas look ok. That is a depressingly short list, especially considering we have gotten the short end of the stick for a long time now.<br />
<br />
What was wrong with buffs that actually matter? I actually looked forward to the damage / avoidance effects. Stats, even past the cap really do not do much in this game, especially past the soft caps at 200 / 255. They are going to be a lot less useful then the effects that were removed from the spells, and those were not earth shattering to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like all the damage/defensive modifiers have been removed, and &quot;unknown&quot; entries added in some cases. I guess they were concerned about the collective effect all those modifiers would have on fights.<br />
<br />
There are some other odd entries as well. The single target STA buff give 75 STA + an unknown modifier, whereas the group version gives 150 STA and no modifier. I'm guessing that these are just early stages in spell development and we'll see a lot more changes going forward.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and the scope of the unknown effects matches the stat increases, which strongly indicates they are going to increase past the cap. It is conjecture but it seems pretty likely.<br />
<br />
And these stats, even past the cap, are flat out worse then the previous effects.</div></div><hr />

If you load up Lucy you will see that there is an upgrade to Bane called Ancestral Vengeance for 546/tick(69). <br />
Blood of Obkin(70) looks like a logical upgrade to Blood of Saryrn, which is a level 65 spell(Bane is a level 64 spell) and does 320/tick.<br />

If its a direct upgrade with the same ratio, for the mana cost it would come out to about 400 dmg/tick, or a 25% increase. I expect that 709 is a typo.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt that IV items will only effect level 60-65 and you need a new set from 65-70.  Look at the level range for I II III..all much larger than 5 levels.  Spending 3k+ ldon points for IV augments for them to not be usefull on any new spells would be...bad.</div></div><hr />

Now they need to scale the bane upgrade to do around 750 a tick for 5 ticks, and the necro DoTs accordingly. Scrap the disease one unless it's gonna do other stuff than just damage... some sort of &quot;Debilitating disease&quot; style DoT would be sweetness.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Diablo 2 was like this as well, for about 2 minutes then it got boring as heck.<br />
<br />
DAoC was great too. . . same story.<br />
<br />
CoH is already running out of &quot;newness&quot; and lots of folks in my guild who tried it are back already. <br />
<br />
I will take a wait and see attitude on ANY new game. I didnt buy CoH, because I kinda thought it LOOKED like a shooting star (had it panned out, I would go buy, thats always an option, but its hard to put that 50 bucks back into my wallet once the box goes up on &quot;The Shelf&quot;)<br />
<br />
You could always cancel CoH after the first free month. I bought it with this in mind but I dont seem to have managed to burn out before the free month was over :-)<br />
<br />
And 50$ for being entertained for a month is far better than 25$ (2 accounts) for EQ for a month as EQ is right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">SoE can still go back to their copy.<br />
<br />
Numbers changes but not our situation.<br />
<br />
Look at all the spells...<br />
<br />
Shamans = not even a good back-up healer, not even a good DPS, not even a good debuffer (the new cripple ? sure, statts debuffs does affect the game).<br />
<br />
Well, welcome to GoD2, same crap but higher numbers...<br />
<br />
Not coming back for now, that's pretty sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">&quot;Oh, and there's also a non-ancient Canni in the lineup&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, there is, but the big question is WHERE will it drop? Right now unless you are Qvic flagged you have no chance for the Ancient Cann we have now. <br />
<br />
Our new cann spell for OOW says ' you feel the pain and knowledge of your ancestors'. Well, we have been feeling that pain since the beginning. I suggest a verbage change to 'bend over here SoE comes again'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Sir Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Amen. Why does an entire expansion have to have the same fight length? Long fights are not boring. Every fight having the same length is boring.<br />
<br />
I see no problem with placing some lvl 90 MOB (so it gives appropriate experience) that is a hard fight for a serious group in between normal MOBs.<br />
<br />
Or, just vary mobs more.<br />
<br />
In a zone, there are 5 types of mobs.  They are all mixed in.<br />
<br />
The Councillers have 10 k hps, and cast wizard spells with a 100% damage focus and 50% haste effect.  They melee for 100 to 900.  Councillers are uncharmable, and non-dot spells last for between 1% and 50% of their standard duration on them (each Counciller has a 50% to 99% spell immunity: what amount they have is random).<br />
<br />
The Warriors have 50 k hps.  They melee for 200-300, and quad/flurry.  Warriors are unsnareable, unstunnable, unrootable, unmezzable, are immune to slow, but are charmable.<br />
<br />
The Warbeasts have 20 k hps.  They melee for 400 to 2000, but do not Quad, and rarely double-attack.  Warbeasts are Uncharmable, and mitigate slow somewhat.<br />
<br />
The Scouts are invisible and see invisible, and spawn off traps.  The traps trigger scouts not at the trap, but near the trap (generally ahead/behind, but not in aggro range).<br />
<br />
Scouts have 30 k hps and melee for 300 to 700, backstab, and are fully slowable.<br />
<br />
The Guards are like Scouts, but have 35 k hps, and no special abilities.<br />
<br />
The idea is, mobs which vary in HPs and DPS mixed in with each other.  So it matters which ones you attack.  Fast-burn damage gains utility (kill that Counceller *now*)<br />
<br />
Or, mobs that respond to debuffs differently.<br />
<br />
Imaging a mob type that loses 1 point of min/max damage for every -str you debuff it?</div></div><hr />
