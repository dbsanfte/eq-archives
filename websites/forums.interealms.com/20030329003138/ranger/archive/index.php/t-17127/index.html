<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jaguar675</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
     I just dinged 35 last night and was wondering where I should head to now or if I should just stay in Stonebrunt.  Would Crystal Caverns be too high for me?  My gear is not that great so I would be willing to trade a bit less exp for a place with more money.  I prefer soloing due to time constraints and just too many experiences with lewt whores and d00ds in HHK and PC.  Any ideas?<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

Great spot near TOFS next to Balix (who drops free food and drink btw).  Loot is pretty much non-existant; but while you're there you can do the Cougar Skin Mask quest which is pretty easy for a decent mask.  Link below...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Freedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Has any one tried Iceclad recently?  I tried to kill some cougars and they were pathing straight to the water and then they would drop aggro.  Since they were running in a really weird pattern I can not follow them and melee them either.  They would just run away without being feared.  It was really strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ailwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I stayed in Stonebrunt till 39, then hung around to farm the highland kobolds.  It is a ranger heaven, with plenty of animals to hunt, it's fairly spaced out, and you get the occasional loot like a mithril amulet or some other gem to sell for plenty of cash.  Just keep on your toes about gorilla and panda adds, and keep an eye on your health.  I learned to fear-kite fairly effectively there.  Not sure what I'm going to do now at 41 though, lol.  Good luck with whatever you choose to do.</div></div><hr />
