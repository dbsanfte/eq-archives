<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I received an email from Gemdiver today, Chutoi's report was posted.<br />
<br />
Here is the link:<br />

<br />
I would once again like to commend everyone who volunteered their valuable time, class expertise and passion/love of the shaman class to write such excellent summaries - they were all a joy to read.<br />
<br />
Volunteers:<br />
<br />
Blazz <br />
Korelen <br />
Samanna <br />
Snoww <br />
Tordail <br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
I closed the thread and moved it to the Medicine Cabinet - those posts deserve to live in a place of honor.<br />
<br />
Thanks again - to the writers and the voters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe I missed a post (very possible) but do we want the last two paragraphs in there? Ignoring whether or not they are factually correct, they are rather inflamatory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LoL, those are the TONED DOWN.. heh.... paragraphs.... GJ all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The last 2 paragraphs are the best part of the whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very well said. And what was said in it is what I have been saying for a long time now, though, the way it was said was better thought out then mine. What can I say, I get too emotional over my char/class when discussing it and all the 'cute' words start to escape me then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool,<br />
<br />
grats Chutoi. Nice to know that other folks will see a true representation of our class. Maybe a few of the myths will get dispelled. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks to all the volunteers, with a special pat in the back to Chutoi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Chu is the man, and I /bow to his infinite wisdom and his articulate writing style. Snoww was a strong second, but I think his &quot;State of . . .&quot; deserves a special place in the halls of this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Exceptional read Chutoi.<br />
<br />
Browsed Casters Realm after reading your post and came across this which i found kind of ironic considering the dates of it.<br />

PS<br />
Its about time someone actually said what we all think of Rytan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you, guys.  Of course, after I reread what I'd written, I noticed a rather glaring spelling error (man instead of mana!).  /grump<br />
<br />
I hate errors!<br />
<br />
Someone either sent me an email or posted a response to the post (wasn't sure which), but I got a copy of it in email and I couldn't find it on the boards.  It was an interesting read, and he pointed out some things I hadn't addressed--one of which was the effect of malos/tash on root parking, which was something I neglected to address.  Heh.  Maybe in version 2.0 in 2006 when Rytan screws us over again. . . <br />
<br />
Thank you again for the votes and the congratulations.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The general shaman consensus, however, is that the lead spell designer is so wedded to his self-delusional notions of godhood, that he refuses to admit any error unless someone up the food chain from him stuffs a change down his throat. <br />
<br />
Haha, I really love this report =)</div></div><hr />
