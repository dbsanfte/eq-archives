<br />
I'm specifically looking for kunark dragons and whether people have been able to slow them.  Quick question has anyone tried using insid decay/plague of insects of slow this mobs?  What was the sucess rate and did you get eaten after insid decay? hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
The consensus when we discussed it pre-luclin was that they have been slowable but that it is very hard to. I don't recall anyone reporting results with PoI/ID since.<br />
<br />
Personally I've never slowed a Kunark dragon, I give it a half hearted try now and again but they don't tend to last long enough to make it worth the effort, I'm better off doing something else.<br />
<br />
I'd be interested to see what the results of the discussion are with recent testimony.<br />
<br />
Edit: oops my bad, Viscerator posted some very nice info in that thread that I havent got round to adding yet.<br />
<br />
Unless someone can provide me with a screenshot I'm leaning toward marking Kunark dragons unslowable (with the exception of Ragefire, hes an easy slow).</div></div><hr />
