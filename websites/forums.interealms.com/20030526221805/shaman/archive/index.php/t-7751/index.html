<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for some clarification of how DoT stacking works now.<br />
<br />
I don't even know if I can explain my interpretation now, when DoT's from multiple shaman became stackable...I became a little less then confident in how I thought they worked.<br />
<br />
If more then one shaman are casting DoTs on a single mob...does the dot have to be the exact same one?  Can additional DoTs stack as well?<br />
<br />
If you are soloing or only shaman present, what stacks?  It seems that the shaman I group with can land BoN (Poison), Pox (disease) and Epic (Magic?)....would anything else stack?<br />
<br />
In reading the threads here I see most people recommend a combination which includes EBolt or Plaque instead of Pox/BoN, is this only for mana reasons?<br />
<br />
What about other manafree clickable items?  I have seen items that click Envenomed Breath or Rotting Bile how would itmes like these fit in the mix?<br />
<br />
Help clear the confusion!<br />
<br />
Thanks all,<br />

<br />
Let me see if I can answer your question about shaman dot stacking.  The first thing to know is that shaman can stack multiple dots of the same line.  So, for example, I could stack level 56 bane of nife with the level 49 ebolt.  One shaman can not stack the SAME dot on a mob, so I couldn't stack bane of nife and bane of nife.<br />
<br />
Now multiple shaman can stack the same dot on a mob.  I could land bane of nife and a guildie could land bane of nife and another guildie could land bane of nife. (each mob only has 15 slots though).  In a group, you can both stack pox, or both stack bane, or both stack epic.  <br />
<br />
Multiple shaman can land the same dot, single shaman can not land multiple casts of the same dot.<br />
<br />
In reading the threads here I see most people recommend a combination which includes EBolt or Plaque instead of Pox/BoN, is this only for mana reasons?<br />
<br />
Perhaps they aren't the correct level to scribe PoX/Bane? Or maybe due to rarity, they don't have them yet.  I usually stack pox/bane.<br />
<br />
I can't answer your questions about the manafree clickable items, I don't have an poison/disease clicky dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or for a really pissed off mob w/ 2 shaman + pox, plague, bane and ebolt i guess pox and plague stack but im a cheap sob but i bearly see pox for sale also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mostly right gloriana.<br />
<br />
Mobs got thier slots upped to 30 at the same time the dot stacking went live.<br />
<br />
Another possible reason for not going pox/bane is that the mob might not live long enough for pox to be effective. Personally I prefer to use bane and ebolt and only use pox if the 2 of them can't kill a mob quick enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can a single shaman stack multiple lines (poison/disease) at the same time?<br />
<br />
Does casting order (based on level of spell) matter or just cast the longer duration spell first?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick and beneficial responses so far!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nruter, yes 2 shaman can cast and stack multiple lines or even same lines of DoT,each can only cast the spell one until the duration expires.<br />
<br />
Casting order is irrelevant.  It all stacks regardless of order.</div></div><hr />
