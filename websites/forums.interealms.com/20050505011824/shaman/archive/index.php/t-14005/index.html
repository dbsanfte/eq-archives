<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if RC has any affect on the dot from the Manaetic Behemoth ?<br />
<br />
Just curious as knowing beforehand would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">umm behemoth has 4 or 5 dots, I'm pretty sure they don't have counters so I imagine RC would get it off, higher lvl of RC the better of course</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">RC1 is enuf to cure the nasty skull-pic dot from Grummus, and also stuff like snare, necro dots . . etc.  <br />
I have RC2 and I really like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MB I believe has 1 dot, and then an AE that goes off whenever a spider gets in the room.  I could definately be wrong though, and I have no idea if RC gets rid of it.<br />

RC is kind of wierd.  Sometimes when I accidentily malos myself, RC will remove it, and sometimes it will not.  Ditto for blood of saryrn, breath of ulthor, druid dots, sk dots, and just about everything else I get casted on me on a regular basis.  This is just with RC1, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RC2 is a lot more reliable than RC1, not got RC3 yet though but I presume its as much of a increase in reliability too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the tips everyone. Looks like RC has at least a chance to give a hand. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">RC is kind of a strange beast.  It has removes poison counters, disease counters, and curse counters--though even at level 1 it seems to remove curses that have more counters than it is supposed to cure.  However, in addition to the counter removal, RC has a chance to remove a detrimental effect--ie, some kind of bad effect that doesn't have counters.  A good example of this would be the plasma decay DoT that is cast occasionally by grummus, or malo/malos.  Basically, any damaging/debuffing spell icon that doesn't have counters (and that you would normally remove with the dispell magic line) is a detrimental.<br />
<br />
RC1 has a chance of removing a detrimental effect.<br />
RC2 has 3 chances of removing a detrimental effect.<br />
RC3 has 6 chances of removing a detrimental effect.<br />
<br />
Thus, even 5 casts of RC1 are not as effective as one cast of RC3 for detrimentals.<br />
<br />
Since malo/malos isn't cureable (ie, only dispellable), it falls under the check for detrimentals.  It's a crap shoot as to whether it will be taken off with RC.  I've failed to strip a malos off myself with RC3 before, too.<br />
<br />
Dunno if that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing regarding RC removing stuff with more counters than it should be capable of clearing, it doesnt always seem to work.  I noticed that against the Aoe slowing rat nameds in CoD, RC2 would nuke the icon for the slow, but not actually cure it, I still needed to do a round of dr cures.<br />
<br />
*Edit* not tried this lately though, it may have been fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes RC removes the dot from MB.<br />
<br />
Also, if someone gets mezzed, RC will remove the mezz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Plasma decay is not a detrimental, its a curse.  Radiant cure 1 removes 9 curse counters, so it will always remove plasma decay if your targets are in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">MB I believe has 1 dot, and then an AE that goes off whenever a spider gets in the room.  I could definately be wrong though, and I have no idea if RC gets rid of it.<br />

<br />
he only uses one at a time, but it can be a different one each spawn from my experience, he also has a silence he uses sometimes, and well, the spider DD too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks everyone, this is incredibly useful information. Hopefully we will take him down.<br />
