<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The enchanter BotB isnt much a test of your enchanter skill. I came in with a stragedy but because one fatal miscaculation, I lost in the first round.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the other enchanter drain all my mana. He was casting mostly Mana sieve and occasionally chaotic feedback. Those CF pushed me back and I aggro a skelly and I was oom so I couldnt actually do any enchanter skills and was beatten. It was no where near exciting. Thanks for all your support!<br />
<br />
I may not be the best of the best enchanter, however...<br />
<br />
Sinfutura = Best enchanter in a  group :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I heard about some of the tricks used on other servers.<br />
<br />
Some just dispelled  a mob on the opposite side so they would aggro into the other enchanter.  The brilliant minds at Verant made the mobs undead so the AI of attack the closest thing if not damaged allowed many to advance using this cheap ass tactic.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that cheap tactics were still used and it was not a test of enchanter ability.<br />
<br />
The real test would have been if no spells were allowed to be casted on the other enchanters.  Only on the mobs.  THAT would have been a test of enchanter ability.  Not who can nuke and sieve faster.<br />

BS!</div></div><hr />
