<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told this could be soloed by a 65 shaman. i tried it and it seemed to take a lot of mana per mob and the elites i think it was just sucked. chewed up wondermutt in a couple seconds. then it was dot/get summoned/Q rinse and repeat. Am i missing some tactic or is it just pretty mana intensive? i did a search and they didnt really help. thanks in advance.H</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think gear and AA will really determine how well you can solo comm 1. CA3 and LR5 especially would really help to make it easier by mitigating a lot of the damage you take.<br />
<br />
I would think the best spot to solo would be taking the lower right door (seen facing out from the top of the zone in ramp) and camping in a corner of the room with the tube. Everything should come single except for maybe the two temple guards when you first enter the room.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow (maybe malos if you find resists are a problem), tank in teh face and lay on epic, Ultor and Saryrn. Have hasted, dual-wielding doggy up as well.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.<br />
<br />
P.S. grabbing a KEI and possibly hp buff would make it easier as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, C1 is easily soloable at 65. I did him at 60 with kinda crappy gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">C1 is soloable by mages. Piece o' piss he is :) Clearing to him, and getting adds would be the only problems.<br />
<br />
Edit: Seplling!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">C1 is easy, pops in the room before the locked door, straight and then left, then left door.<br />
3 Spawns in room, they come single, middle spawn is the C1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">C1 can pop behind locked door as well. Will need a rogue then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">C1 is easy, pops in the room before the locked door<br />
<br />
Comm 1 can spawn anywhere an Elite can spawn (I've also heard anywhere a Temple Guard can spawn) on the first floor. Therefore, there are several places to camp him. Choosing the room behind a locked door as your solo camp would be difficult seeing as how shamans can't pick locks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jkana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Easiest room is the AL/HP/XtC well room through the right door from ZI.  He can pop on either of the two door spawns and I am pretty sure any of the other seven spawn points in that room.</div></div><hr />
