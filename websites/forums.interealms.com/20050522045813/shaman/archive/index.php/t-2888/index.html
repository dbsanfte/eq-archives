<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having hit 60 recently and reviewing which spells i have and need, I just looked at which I get from the vendor<br />
<br />
56 - Celerity and PE, very nice spells, well worth the level<br />
<br />
57 - Str buff, ok not too bad.<br />
<br />
58 - Dex buff, ok not too bad but slightly limited in who needs.<br />
<br />
59 - Charisma buff, erm not going to comment on this being the only 59 vendor spell<br />
<br />
60 - sweet FA<br />
<br />
Just seems weird that I ding 60 with my monk and go yippee i get to be a slightly better puller and I get a dmg increase combined with a new disc (even if it is crap). I ding 60 with my shaman and go oh this means I get slightly better resists on slow and Malosini.<br />
<br />
Clerics get generally decent spells though no 60 one either<br />
<br />
Druids get decent spells and an excellent 60 spell<br />
<br />
Enchanter get half decent spells and no 60 one<br />
<br />
Magician get decent spells and no 60 one.<br />
<br />
Necromancer get decent spells and no 60 one.<br />
<br />
Wizards get half decent spells and no 60 one<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords get decent spells as such and a decent 60 one<br />
<br />
Paladins get very decent spells and two great 60 ones.<br />
<br />
Rangers get very decent spells and 2 ok 60 spells.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights get very decent spells and two great 60 ones.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind though Hybrids spells dont often stack on raids with the main classes.<br />
<br />
Not meant really as a whine as I dont have any suggestions to offer but seems a bit mean when spells at the high level and it seems espically shaman ones are so slim to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nevermind, re-read your post. Yeah Shaman get jack for vedor purchasable spells after like 57. Gotta get the drops. :(</div></div><hr />
