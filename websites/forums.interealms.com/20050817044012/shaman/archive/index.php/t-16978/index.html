<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Canni IV message brought up that people are not farming old world stuff.  It was suggested that farming WW would be a way to get Canni IV, as well as some good cash.  Does anyone have any words of wisdom for the area?  I'm looking for things like which names to pull, which are soloable, which might be doable with a single tank.  <br />
<br />
To give you some perspective, I'm 1 for 3 on guardian wurms.  Keep that in mind with your evaluation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming you have 2 clickies, and can get resists over 200, they shouldnt be a problem for you to solo. Only ones to watch out for are any of the Saparas, Cargalia, and there's one of them in the canyon that silences (though I don't remember who).<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />

I think the one that silences is either Entari or Ionat.  It's on the north wall of the canyon, west of the ToV entrance, I know.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
Stick to the nested (sitting on eggs) dragons at first.  Avoid the scar (AE'ing) dragons until you are more experienced.<br />
<br />
You can solo the nested easily as long as you can keep from getting adds.  Even with a single non-dragon add you can usually pull it off if you are careful.  I recommend binding at the ToV entrance, and keeping Gate up if you are worried.  If you have to evac, immediately zone into ToV to clear aggro, then gate back.<br />
<br />
If dragon slaying solo still has you worried, bring a single Mage friend, or heck, a single friend of ANY class.  Magician/Shaman combo is pretty deadly for dragon slaying though.  Mage gives you all the pet toys &amp; summoned stuff you could want, and with pet &amp; nukes makes the kills much faster.  Your tanking in the face with poison DoTs pretty much assures the Mage won't ever get aggro, so he can nuke pretty hard w/ his bolt spells.<br />
<br />
A single solid group for the scar dragons should be plenty in my estimation.  Look up the quest pieces beforehand.  You can have a wizard with the right faction shuttling back and forth to do the weapon quests, which can still net your group a decent amount of money in bazaar sales.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take a group of friends, you can wipe out all the nest dragons in an hour, probably get at least 1 copy of can4.  <br />
<br />
Yeldema is easiest, with no AE.  Then any other nest dragon is equal, some have fire ae, some have cold, but all hit exactly the same otherwise.  Valley dragons are another step up from that.  Ionat is the one that silences, the rest are just more resistant and have stronger ae's (some are wizards too).<br />
<br />
Pulling is interesting.  There are very few safe spots in the zone, and all the dragons will run at low health.  It's mostly going to be trial and error until you can find a spot, best bet is to sit down and watch the area around a nest for a while and get the hang of it, then kill as fast as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I havent soloed any of thses but I 2 manded Yeldema and 1 other with a druid buddy of mine before we turned 60 and it was a blast. Im now 65 and really need to  get back overthere and play a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You don't mention what level you are or what spells you have access to. As was already mentioned yeld is the easiest. He's the lowest level, 55 i think, and has no ae and basically no special abilities. If your 60+ with torpor and preferably malo you should have no problem doing him now a days. If your sub 60 or don't have torpor it is still doable but it's alot harder just because you don't have an efficient heal. It also helps alot to be non kos to dragons initially so you can scout and watch pathing and such with out having to worry about aggro.<br />
<br />
If your sub 60 or with out torpor I'd recommend bring a friend or a couple and then you should easily be able to handle yeld or any of the nest dragons.<br />
<br />
As was said avoid the obvious of klandicar, sontolak, any sapara (proc 1k gflux) and cargalia (same ae). There's also a named wurm that can spawn and is pretty mean since he's pretty resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i found this info a while ago on this board,  think itmight be of some help.  Personally i've only done yeldema at 58 w/ kraggs, died the first time b/c i fell off the ledge into the water and spent to long getting out and slow wore off, coulnd't rechannel it and died, lessen learned and i added levi to my buff slots to remove that chance.  also might want to alpha your pet with serrated bone dirks to snare the dragons and limit they're running.  <br />

if the link doens't work search google for ww dragons, should be the first link</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do any of the WW dragons give positive tormax faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Do any of the WW dragons give positive tormax faction?<br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its sounding better and better.<br />
<br />
I'm 62 with both malo and topor.  I'm thinking of starting with at least one tank to help out and see what happens. <br />
<br />
Someone also mentioned going to PoG for a bit of fun.  We'll see how that goes as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">one word of warning, while Yldema does not have any special effects he does see invis.  Very bad if you're setting up to kill a dragon and find out you allready have one in tow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Esorpa of the Ring also silences, tho it's resistable.<br />
<br />
My only WW Dragon solo kill has been Crial, I was bored waiting on CoH to get past Sontalak and he just walked in front of me... how was I to resist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Scar dragons are very soloable at 65.  I've done all of them, cept for Ionat (the silencer) whom I didn't attempt.  I was actually kinda disappointed at how easy they were at 65.  I only had Malo at that time tho, so even with my tash stick it made landing Slow a bit iffy.  That made it more interesting.  Now with Malos it would be even easier, and kinda boring /yawn. <br />
Those kinda drop pretty ok Talismans tho, and various lewt that may or may not still sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I tried Ayillish with a wizard friend - pulled with Malos, and had to get evacced out after the third Turgur's bounced.<br />
<br />
Would it seem that I was just hella unlucky with resists that time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, it happens.  I think the most Ayillish has bounced slow on me is 4-5 times after Malos.  Q yourself before the pull.  If you don't have a tash stick, get one.  Beat on her with it while alternating turgurs and malosinia, tnarg self if needed.</div></div><hr />
