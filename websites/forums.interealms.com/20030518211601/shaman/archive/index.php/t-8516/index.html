<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gerlach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, I did try that....still no dice</div></div><hr />

I know you probably already did this, but I would just delete the whole Macro and do it again and it would work... probably not your problem since you are looking for help, but just wanted to add my extra 2 cents ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">try /sit on<br />

/sit<br />
/Cast (Whichever is Canni)<br />
/Pause 12<br />
/sit<br />

You have no pause after you start casting the spell, so you will try to sit down instantly after you begin casting canni, which ofcourse fails.<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 7<br />
/cast 7<br />
/pause 14<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
Not only will you attempt to cast canni twice (in case you fizzle the first), it also got the pause while canni is casting after which you sit down again.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use :<br />

/sit off<br />
/pause 15,/cast 3<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had the same problem as you in the past. In order to make macros like that just make sure the pause is after the cast and play with the time. I have had macros where the pause is set really high. The problem is that since you can no longer interrupt a cast by sitting, if the pause is not long enough then the sit command gets rejected (you might read real fast the message this command cannot be used while casting). So just play with he pause time and it will eventually work. BTW dont follow the time settings mentioned up above as it will vary wildly from pc to pc based on the system performance and the connection speed. I use both a pc and a laptop to play and the pause times are different on both.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have 2 Canni Hot Buttons.<br />
<br />
Horseback :<br />
<br />
/cast 7<br />
/pause 24<br />
/cast 7<br />
/pause 24<br />
/cast 7<br />
<br />
This gets me 3 canni IV's for one casting. Saves me mashing that button between pulls and during down time.<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/cast 7<br />
/pause 24<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
Just remember the pause is in tenths of seconds. Three seconds is 30. One point five seconds is 15, but you would probably want 17 due to lag issues in some zones.<br />
<br />
Another hot button I use alot is :<br />
<br />
/assist (name)<br />
/cast 2 (malo)<br />
/pause 40<br />
/pet attack<br />
/cast 3 (Turgurs)<br />
<br />
I use this alot when I am two box'ing with my warrior, as the pull comes in. The pause before the pet attacks gives me long enough to get the mob positioned and a bit of agro built up before hitting it with the slow. It works great for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kinelory Opiates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my canni has a fizzle check in it<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/cast 4<br />
/pause 5, /cast 4<br />
/pause (bleh, cant remember my pause for canni 4 atm)<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
you'll get a message saying you cant use that command while casting. thats just the fizzle check.</div></div><hr />
