<br />
let's hope they wised up and are trying to make highlevel tradeskills more useful.</div></div><hr />

Most likely they will be tradeable like other cultural items. Hey, I can buy arrows from druids and use them. Yippy.</div></div><hr />

Dangoon, I'm right beside you if that happens, challenging you to a who can puke the most, the farthest event.  Totally unfair to all other fletchers.</div></div><hr />

Im going to laugh so hard as I run around with my 20dam mithril arrows that are wood elven only, wearing my Helm of the tracker just to piss off 99% of the halfelven/halfling community!</div></div><hr />

Personaly if I had seen that there was culteral fletching prior to making my charachter I would not have made  a half elf.  I would have gone with my second choice of wood elf.  but there was no culteral, no sign of culteral anywhere in sight.  To get left behind on this one, the only skill I could find where I could be just as good as any other fletcher if I worked on it, because they only NOW decided &quot;oh! we need culteral fletching!&quot;. . . more than ticks me off.  wether it was a rumor or not, the ranger only fletching made far more sense than culteral wood elven.  One needs only look at our AA skills to see why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benji</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My bet would be that there is half elf and MAYBE halfling cultural fletching. We just havent found it yet.. i doubt that they would screw over 1/2 the rangers(a second time, that is) by giving only wood elves the player made arrows.</div></div><hr />

and I hate to say this, but Sony/Verant has said Half elves have no culture (as much as I find it impossible for ANYONE to not have one)and so have no culteral crafts.  Oh we can WEAR all sorts of em, but I really would rather make it personaly lol  I would trade my being able to wear all sorts for being able to make some any day hehehe ;)</div></div><hr />

Half elfs are presumed to not have a culture of their own (they don't have a half elf city), and are not accepted by either parent enough to learn their cultural.</div></div><hr />

Fits into my tiny RP Perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no word yet on what the results are, what the trivial levels are or whether or not other races have cultural fletching. :(<br />
<br />
It seems there are mithril bows and arrows. The arrow heads can apparently take an imbue, so there is reason to think we may have a new high end arrow, though it will be costly. The last person to post at eq traders reported 0/2 on arrow combines but at 130ish skill, surely there is a wood-elf grandmaster fletcher here at the Glade who can whip up of a few of these, no?  :)      <br />
(waiting for 55 before attaining, or attempting to attain, grand master myself)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowshot</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like I'll be going for grandmaster in fletching after all.  There's a reported failure 2 out of 2 at 202 skill on the arrows, bows probably don't trivialize.</div></div><hr />

All wood elven rangers point and laugh at the karana gimps!<br />
<br />
Im going to laugh so hard as I run around with my 20dam mithril arrows that are wood elven only, wearing my Helm of the tracker just to piss off 99% of the halfelven/halfling community! <br />
<br />
Laugh all you want about helm of the tracker.. I will laugh harder because that helm is gimpy compared to my helm :)<br />
<br />
But yeah if wood elfs get uber arrow that is no drop then that will truely suck.. I bet we can just have a wood elf make us one though and with endless quiver all i need is one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dangoon</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I have said.. the dam arrows they make better be dropable :)<br />
<br />
But yeah sucks I am very skilled in fletching and can't even make them myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what if a Wood Elf Bard can make better arrows.  They've also stated in passing that there will also be Ranger Only Fletching as well.  But seeing as it's taken a year to get our fletching upgrade, I doubt we will see the Ranger fletching up grade any time soon.</div></div><hr />
