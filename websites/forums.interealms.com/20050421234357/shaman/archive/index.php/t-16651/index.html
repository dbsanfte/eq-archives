<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi - I am new to reading the boards here and I have been learning a lot, but much of it is still WAY over my head (JBB - and other spells you all abbreviate)  But anyways...  I have been reading posts about killing the guards in HK and the corrupt guards at the docks in Freeport.  Will these cause any faction hits outside of the HK guards always trying to hack at me?  I am in a guild that plans on going for skyshrine armour and we are working the coldain faction.<br />
<br />
Is this a good thing for a level 40 shaman to be doing?<br />
<br />
I will be getting a Magelo page for my char as soon as i get the chance.  Is there a file on my computer(Mac) that has all of my equipment listed nthat I can print out or anything like that?<br />
<br />
I am sure that my char is very underequipped just from reading other peoples magelo listings.  I am DEFINATELY not a twink.  There isn't much uber stuff to buy on the AlKabor server yet(Mac server). Soooo - i am going to have to get my stuff the hard (but fun) way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help - and any other tips for level 40 is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">High Hold Keep and Coldain are totally seperate entities...and are seperated by two expansions...so no, you wont hurt yourself by killing them, nor will it hurt to kill freeport guards for the same reason.  If you mean will other cities in antonica attack you for killing guards in HHK?  Yes they will..you lose quite a few human factions by killing guards in HHK.<br />
<br />
Is it good to work on coldain faction?  Sure.  Then you hunt in kael and collect chain pieces for the thurgadin quest armor (need three gems also).<br />
<br />
There is a way for magelo to automatically generate a profile of your gear, but i dont know how it works.  Of course you have to sign up for an account to make this aspect work in the first place.<br />
<br />
Finally, for skyshrine armor you need to raise CoV (claws of veeshan) faction, which you will usually get with +Coldain faction, but its the CoV faction not the coldain for skyshrine quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vyreanice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">to update your gear in magelo you have to download the program and be a premier member.  Otherwise the gear will only show on the program screen on your PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kill it all ... buy player made stuff instead of Thurg and then jump to ToV for the good stuff.  Then again player made stuff is pretty darn close to SS and Kael stuff.  Heck the LDoN stuff is better than Thurg stuff.<br />
<br />
BTW if you are going for SS stuff ... why would you need to work Coldian faction?  You working SS faction by killing in Kael, which also gives ya Coldian.  I dont believe you take any SS hits for kill the Coldian and unless you need your shawl - kill them all.  My main is KoS to all of them /old world crap =)</div></div><hr />
