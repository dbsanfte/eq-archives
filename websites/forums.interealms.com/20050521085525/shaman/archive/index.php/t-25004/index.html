<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman can be split pretty evenly into 2 factions.<br />
Shamans who prefer to heal<br />
And shamans who prefer to deal damage<br />
<br />
Arguably, we can do both at the same time.<br />
Regardless, we can only do them poorly<br />
<br />
Still with me? dopn't neg-rep me yet please...<br />
<br />
We've all seen our OOW BP with a clicky buff that reduces resists by 40% and is reusable once every 5 minutes.<br />
Spiritkin tunic (http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=32179) <br />
<br />
And the cleric one<br />
Cleric tunic (http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=32293) <br />
<br />
We know sony can create nifty little effects on buffs.<br />
<br />
What about 2 new self buffs for shaman.<br />
Long term buffs, mind you, not short 30 second craps.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking a recast delay of 3 minutes, and a duration of 40 or so.<br />
Target type self only.<br />
<br />
These two buffs should of course overwrite, or block eachother.<br />
Wouldn't do to have both these buffs stack. =)<br />
<br />
No, on to some details.<br />
First buff,, eh,, no real name for it, but &quot;Heyokah's Healing&quot; comes to mind.<br />
Focus effects of the buff, increase base healing by 30%<br />
Chance to Crit Heal over Time<br />
Spell haste(beneficial type only) (15%)<br />
Mana preservation(HP type only) (10%)<br />
<br />
<br />
Second buff,,, eh,, &quot;Horrors of the Heyokah&quot;<br />
Focus effects of the buff,<br />
BA5<br />
AE5<br />
AH5<br />
Reduce resist rate by 30%<br />
Reduce agro effect(similar to the effect on epic 1.5 for shaman and necros)<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, neither spell should stack wiht the other.<br />
They should have their timers linked(like Pained memory and canni4)<br />
0 mana cost?<br />
What would be a good minimum level? 60?<br />
AA or spell? <br />
<br />
<br />
Basicaly, ,I came up wiht this last night in my dreams.<br />
<br />
Yet another solution,, but how sucky is it? tell me please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, Id have much rather had the cleric effect for heal focus, even if they knocked it down a few %.  Reducing hate is why I maxed SCS and why I dont use DoT's anymore.<br />
<br />
Regarding your suggestions, I really dislike the idea of having stacking issues with ourselves.  Additionally, while the ideas presented are nice, I think that anyone but a shaman would see them both as ridiculously overpowered. &quot;IH (30%)&quot; they say, &quot;and an improved chance to crit heal?  All they need now is Defensive and they will be the best class in the game!&quot;  I dont think that Rytan would even take a second glance at them...<br />
<br />
Sigh,...all cause we had to solo dragons when velious was still current.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes, and stacking both of these buffs at the same time upon ourselves is cleaarly overpowering.<br />
<br />
And aye, they will probnably be viewed as quite overpowering, because every class will look at the buff and think, if I could cast this on myself with my own healing abilities ...<br />
Instead of comparing it asa a boost to our own underpowered abilities.<br />
<br />
And that's an improved chance to crit heal over times, not crit heal ~_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's sad that they put an affect on the cleric BP which is pretty much what we need to fix our inability to deal with emergency situations. Clerics don't need more healing, this just widens the gap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like our BP effect and I wouldn't trade it for the bigger healing.</div></div><hr />

While I dont have the Bp in question, I can see where it would be useful for a raid or a particulary resistant mob. The cleric Bp effect would be more useful on a day to day basis, but really I have never seen a cleric say, &quot;you know I just cant seem to heal enough&quot;. I see clerics crit heal 11k BLAST heals...pretty humbling when they do that just after I crit for 4k and change and I have all the heal AA I can get.<br />
Only real question I have though is why our arms and the druid arms from OoW have Improved Heal V on them and the cleric arms have Boon of the Pious. 25% bonus heals to heals already the cutting edge? And I get stuck with a bare upgrade to my ornate arms. I mean come on, at least Marr's Gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heh,, thread hijack? ~_^<br />
<br />
I only linked the two clicky buffs to show what we already know that Sony can do, not to ignite another armor/focus war  /tease<br />
<br />
I just was intersted in being told I am either insane or just asking too much, or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">not insane but that would be too cool for sony to allow it <br />
<br />
Cast dots ... change DB (or what ever clicky was on) change click effect and heal ... when longer dots wore rinse and repeat. ID use it like that anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">erm,, the point here is that you can't jsut swap the buffs back and forth that easily. Because that WOULD be overpowering.<br />
<br />
/sigh <br />
<br />
The two buffs I am suggesting are not something you can click and swap between instantly.<br />
3 minute recast timer</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently the cleric arms are being changed to healing V. Boon was probably meant for the tier 2 armor, not tier 1.</div></div><hr />
