<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chasim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I apologize in advance since this question has probably been asked many times before... but I'm a newbe Troll Shaman and have no information about the quest (where it starts, item name, etc.).<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me the details on the snare necklace quest... all I understand is that it's available to Troll Shamans worshipping Inny.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=170</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've never been able to understand if someone has the time to stop and post on a thread why they feel the need to be sarcastic or condescending...seriously no offense Ogrym, nothing personal at all. I see this all the time though, someone asks a question thats been asked a million times and theres always -someone- that has to get all up-ity about the search button...so theres a search button /shrug<br />
<br />
Now onto the matter at hand, the link Ogrym suggested is for the last part of the quest....it has three parts. First is the initiate symbol. Start it by talking to the dark elf cleric on top of the shaman/beastlord guild in Grobb. She'll hand you a note to deliver to her brother in the Neriak clerics guild. I had to do this twice to get the proper faction to even start the quest.<br />
<br />
Once you have the faction you can try this link http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=169<br />
<br />
although no walk through is really needed for this quest as it follows along pretty well with the npc text. In fact, as Ive said many time when giving advice on this quest, its one of the most original and cleaver quests Ive been through....enjoy, good luck, and dont be afraid to come back and ask a question that has been answered many times before ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not everyone wants to pay to look at stuff at Allakhazams as well. For me the quest has been easy to far; this is what I can recall:<br />
<br />
1. Find DE near beastmaster trainer in Grobb, get Perrin Zexis note quest<br />
<br />
2. Deliver note to Perrin in 3rd gate cleric guild<br />
<br />
3.) not enough faction yet so kill halfings in nektulos and get four beads and as many leatherfoots caps as you can. It took me about 10-13 caps to get enough faction to do the quest.<br />
<br />
4.) Turn caps into Perrin until faction lets you get the initiate symbol quest from him. Then turn in 4 beads for the necklace<br />
<br />
5.) Go to Dran N'Ryt (spelling?) in the Neriak caster guild and get the halfling mask quest. Kill master whoopal in Nektulos at halfling shrine and take head back to N'Ryt for halfling illusion mask (save it you need it)<br />
<br />
6.) Talk to Ithvol in cleric guild he sends you get get a note from wallin slyfoot in WC, use mask to talk to him and get note. I can't remember the exact phrase. <br />
<br />
7.) Take note to Dran N'Ryt to spawn halfling spy in Neriak tunnels. Kill spy and turn head and initiate necklace to Ithvol for disciple necklace<br />
<br />
8.) Tell Ithvol I will deliver provisions to get last part of quest<br />
<br />
9.) See slug Rembor in Neriak Foreign quarter to get next part, say Ithvol sent me. He wants two steel bonings to make crate<br />
<br />
10.) take crate to Dragoon Sszorn in LFay for reciept, he sends you to Steamfont to take to Ennixy (sp?) who gives a voucher and who spawns a paladin. Kill paladin. Take receipt, voucher and head and disciple symbol to ithvol for Regent necklace. <br />
<br />
Double check all this at some of the online sites, but I am pretty close (recalling it all from memory, not notes). I have not finsihed the quest...waiting till 24 and new DoT before trying the Pally in steamfont. I also need to work smithing up to make bonings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I fought Crusader Swiftmoon, he was Level 30 (even con to me) and a very tough fight as he has Lay on Hands and hits really hard (I had to Root/DoT). I would bring a decently sized group (that doesn't care about pinky faction) if you plan on killing him at Level 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I finally got my necklace. I was 26 before I got around to going to Faydwer, but I am glad I waited. Swiftmoon conned yellow and was very had at 26 and I had to zone twice. The only assistance I had was a skin like steel from a druid hunting gnomes. <br />
<br />
Fight 1: did not know where swiftmoon would spawn. Ran around like an idiot for 5 minutes until he arrived at ennixy. Started with malaise + root + drowsy + affliction. Root broke a lot. Finally got EB on him. He was hitting in the 52 range. At 25% health he did lay on hands. I had to zone.<br />
<br />
Fight 2: repeat first fight after medding and buffing<br />
<br />
Fight 3: Got SLS, started over. This time Swiftmoon did not lay on hands for some reason. I root rotted him to 30%, cannibalized half my health for mana then nuked him the rest of the way. <br />
<br />
FWIW, the necklace is really handy. When grouped, I will typically use the necklace to snare if we lack a snarer or as a little extra mana free damage when I am main healer. I hardly ever use it solo since the cast time is 6 seconds, but being able to snare does help getting into some groups at my level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Congratulations on the necklace, and on having the guts to take out Crusader Swiftmoon at that level. I still use the necklace regularly at Level 55 (all the time when soloing, and whenever my group doesn't have a snarer), so you should get plenty of use out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah Grotte,<br />
Thats a great accompplishment solo at your level. If he didnt lay hands I would assume that npcs are under the same or similar rules for Lay hands/Harm touch? Im not 100% sure, but I would imagine they have some what of a re-use timer for npcs as well.<br />
<br />
I have to tell you that I use my necklace -all- the time solo....You will love it on mobs that turn to run. Its really not an option to go drood style and try to kite with it as its duration is just to short, but on the running mob(in dungeon or outside) its invaluable. No need to root and have him turn back on you wasting HPs.<br />
<br />
<br />
At any rate, good work bro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup at 26 I had to kill swiftmoon with magic. He hit too hard and too fast even with drowsy on. Without malise he resisted me all the time. The only reason I killed him in the 3rd fight is that he did not LoH, otherwise he would have driven me to zone again. I was at 10m at fights end and half heath from cannibalizing. 28 or 29 would probably be a better time to kill him. <br />
<br />
FWIW, its a blast being in groups with no snare classes and calling out &quot;SNARED&quot; and seeing the other members go &quot;***&quot;.  Seems very few people know about this quest.</div></div><hr />
