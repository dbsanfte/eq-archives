<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">shamans get a duration invis!! Rejoice!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was regular invis a problem?  Heck, you even get a warning before it wears.  <br />
<br />
A fixed duration invis might be handy for clerics I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes it is a problem, especially when you're responsible for invising your entire group and it lasts all of 3 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was regular invis a problem?  Heck, you even get a warning before it wears.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh hoping this is a joke :)   Invis lands... start to run and it blinks while you are surrounded by 50 mobs and no where to run and reinvis = problem.<br />
<br />
Worse yet is when it just drops w/o warning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats why I allways carry a backpack of invis potions. Icon starts to flash, right click one of those and invis is instantly recast. You never actually drop invis, and, unless you encounter a see-invis, it should be very rare that anyone dies from invis dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never had an issue with it except where potionless characters were concerned or people who like to hit &quot;attack&quot; in the wrong spots.<br />
<br />
I would rather have an improved invis or something along that line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">let me get this straight....we get a new duration invis..no more breaking in after 3 seconds....and some of you are..complaining..now i thought i was a negative person.<br />
here have some cake to remember the day you became more negative than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Naagruz, what exactly do you mean by improved invis if not increased duration?<br />
<br />
Lower mana cost?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now -- MORE INVISIBLER!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Improved (not talking about the spell Improved Invis, talking about an &quot;improved&quot; invis) = kyvs, ukuns, etc cant see through it.  More effective v.s. mobs that usually see through invis.<br />
<br />
Fixed duration doesn't do me any real good, but I'm happy someone is getting excited about it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm...You guys must have some leet exploit I dont know about, but kyvs and ukuns that see thru normal invis still see through improved invis everytime I have encountered it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What is this new invis?  Dont see any invis in the new lineup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spirit Veil</div></div><hr />

So basically you are upset that we don't have a spell to duplicate Shroud of Stealth, the ROGUE CLASS DEFINING AA!  That's not ever going to happen.  I really never thought anyone could be as unapreciative as to not be happy about a fixed duration invis, but you have proved me wrong.  Wow.</div></div><hr />

Hmm sarcasm doesnt come across well in written form which i hope this is.<br />
Yep i too carry a bag full of invis pots for when invis breaks but when im on a cr i have to go to bank before i actually start my cr which means that im kind of restricted to being bound near a bank or just foregoing the invis pots for cr.<br />
I take it youve never been the invis in your group and had the group keep saying invis popped etc ?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Don't know about you, but have died 4 or 5 times when invis dropped at wrong time going to sewers or vxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Delighted that we're getting new invis (even if it is self only) That actually stays for a fixed amount of time. Makes travelling around sooo much simpler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not upset about anything Lor, and certainly not suggesting a SoS clone so even more peeps can afk at zonelines.  That might take some kind of IVU component anyhoo.  I just think slapping in a fixed duration on invis is kind of moot, and the benefit marginal, where you have non-undead see invis mobs sprinkled around with regular mobs.   <br />
<br />
You can already get through a regular zone (Barindu comes to mind..) easy enough with a potion macroed in an open slot and the old spell.  If you had problems getting around KT before, I'm not sure this is going to help you much. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've died because invis faded while checking nameds in Inner Acrylia, and also in Drooga.  I've died in Trakkanon's Tooth because invis faded while I was nekid on a corpse run.  I've died in BoT because invis faded while running to a group.  I've also died in BoT because my groupmate's invis (that I cast) failed while we were moving camps, and I made the mistake of trying to heal him.<br />
<br />
The point is, I've died (a lot) because of our crappy invis.  Maybe I could have prevented some of them by carrying around invis potions, but that's a waste of time, money, and inventory space that I don't want to bother with.  Even if I did, I still would have died in some of those situations.<br />
<br />
We all know that SoE never reads this board, so it's not like I'm afraid someone there is going to read your comment and decide that shaman would rather have a random duration invis that affects five more mobs instead of the current spell.  However, I do think that this is a rare (and by rare I mean rarer than Lord Englebub and the Gnoll Brewer spawning at the same time in Blackburrow) example of SoE actually getting something right.  If all you do is solo with cloudy ptotions in your inventory, more power to you.  But I'd go so far as to say at least 95% of the shaman community will be happy to have this spell, and I count myself in that 95%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks Graal.<br />
When I read the spell details on Lucy I thought this spell was to help us resist debuffs or cancel magic not an invis.  I'm excited about the idea of a fixed time invis.</div></div><hr />
