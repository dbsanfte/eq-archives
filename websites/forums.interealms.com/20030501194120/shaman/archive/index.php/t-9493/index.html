<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>noober</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi i been hearing about getting flags in POV or POS and stuff like that, may i know what exactly does that means? Is it a quest to complete so that u can play in some of the planes or what? <br />
And what does 1 tier or 2nd tier and all that means? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The whole pop expansion is divided into what is called &quot;tiers&quot;.  Mostly it's just a progression, each tier is a little tougher than the previous.  Character flags are a new feature instead of keys to get around in PoP.  For example, you have to do the trials in PoJ to get a flag that says you can enter PoV or PoS.  Think of it as looting a key to the zones that you don't have to bother using.  There are dozens of different flags to get, some are simple little things, but most are for progressing further into the more difficult planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>noober</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok bud, so you are saying that if i want to go to POV or POS i must zone to POJ and go through the trial there?? So in order for me to be able to zone into POV or POS right?</div></div><hr />
