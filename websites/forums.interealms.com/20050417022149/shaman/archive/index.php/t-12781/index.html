<br />
I'm a 50 shaman and I had a hard time reaching it from 44. Yesterday I went to echo caverns and I've found this place to be crazy xp. I didn't hunt the Taskmater as his place and the surrounding are always camped on my server. I went to kill the gnomes. When you enter EC from SH (same entrance as if you wanted to go to TM), get the first tunnel on your right. Here is the place. I could single pull the guards with slow. Dogdog (the level 49 one) could go through then really easy once he was focused (or taliisman'd) and hasted. I did had incapacitate for pleasure, but it wasn't needed. Didn't even bother alphaing Dogdog. I'm sure this place can be done at 44 since it was really really easy and mob gave me around 1 pct xp per kill (I'm an Ogre so I have a 15 pct xp malus) and mob dropped fast (really fast). Wish I had found this place before.<br />
Faction wise, this gnomes are on their own faction (started indiff.) and I read on Allakhazam that they are the only one using it so don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
Here is the setting of this place :<br />
<br />
When you arrive in the tunnel, you will see 2 guards. I pulled the one on the left first and always had a single pull. Don't know how it goes if you pull the one on the right first. Once you kill them you will enter a cave with a tunnel exiting this cave and leading to another one on the left and huts on the right. In front of the hunt are 2 gnomes around a fire (LB to me at 50). These are casters : wizard and enchanter (remember to cast a low Disease dot on yourself to brake mez as the little bugger will try to chain mez you adn think to boost resists, especially magic, fire and cold). In the huts are the chief who is a warrior and another wizard. Both were DB to me. In the hut which is the nearest from the entrance is a merchant. He is on the same faction, but won't give you xp (like all merchants) so let him be. This place is a bit hard to brake (first time I did nothing good and had to zone after having killed one of the two DB. When I came back it was easy). Method I used was to pull the chief with slow. Other casters will stay at their place trying to cast on you. Send Dogdog on them. They seem to assist their chief and almost always cast on me despite Dogdog was hitting them. Root the chief in the entrace tunnel and let him here. Now go fight the 2 casters around the fire. I think at level 44 you would have to zone twice to brake this place : kill 2 around the fire, zone, kill one of the remaining DB, possibly zone, kill last DB. Now head to the tunnel leaving this room.<br />
I think that if you have to zone twice, it is possible that one of the guards at entrance will have repoped the second time you come back, so try to drop him fast to have the hut camp broken, this is your priority, once this is done, you will do fine.<br />
<br />
Then, the exiting tunnel contains 2 other DB guards (still single pullable with slow, pulling the one on the left first). The last cave (after this tunnel) contains the king and all his friends (all DB to me at 50). DON'T AGGRO THEM ! They will rush you and King is flagged as being immune to movement alternating spells (something like that) and the King hits hard.<br />
Once you've killed them all, I advise you to meditate in the main tunnel of EC where you are safe and can see the first two guards repop, then you can start again. Note too that I once aggro'd the king (just wanted to pull someone else, but the whole room came and dropped me before I moved an inch. When I came back, the king was still near the two guards in the second tunnel : he didn't went back to his spawning place and he aggro'd me (and killed me a second time) when I pulled the guard in the second tunnel : DON'T PULL ANYTHING IN THE LAST ROOM !<br />
On a side note, I managed to single pull the first mob on the right in this room. But I made it only once (before I tried to pull someone else and had the king on me) so I don't know of I was lucky or if this can be repeated (if it is the case, then this guy on the right of the entrance of second room is the only one that seems to be able to be single pulled in the whole room).<br />
<br />
As I previously told, I didn't try it at 44 though I'm almost sure it can be done (only difference in spell used is that I used unalpha'd 49th Dogdog, so alpha yours if you are below 49). I didn't use Ebolt (well, once or twice, but just because I had a KEI the first time I came and wanted to use some mana, I wasn't needed at all). I was self buffed the second time I caeme back and did ok mana wise.<br />
<br />
Oh, I forgot to mention loot : it is unexistant but for a few pp on average each kill (but LB who usually drop a few gold coins).<br />
If this place can effectively be done at 44, thank you for confirming this :)<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

BEWARE : IF YOU ARE ON FV SERVER, THESE GNOMES ARE NOT THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 42, you get both guards if you try to pull with slow.  Dinged 43 last night but haven't tried again.  Will post again when I try it at lvl 43.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ajgala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes.  It is an excellent spot.  I used it to help me level from 48 to 51, on and off.<br />
<br />
I have a little different take on the zone.<br />
<br />
I leave the casters alone.  To me, they were more trouble than they are worth.  As far as pulling, you can single pull the Harold and then the Jester inside the throne room.  Lead each out and fight.<br />
<br />
When you are ready, I have a strategy for killing the kings.  Target the king of below and pull him with something simple.  Both kings will follow.  When you get to the hallway, root the king of below to get him to stop.  (Only the king of above is immune to root.)  This will separate the two as you zone.<br />
<br />
Zone back in (invisible), bring up your dog in a safe spot, buff the tar out of the dog, med up and get ready to fight.<br />
<br />
The kings are tough, but can be taken if done one at a time.<br />
<br />
With the kings out of the way, the throne room will single pull and can be emptied.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Me did dis at 44 to 46 tanks to yur post.  Yoo get both guards at 44.<br />
But Dogdog tied up one and me root/rotted da udder and den helped Dogdog spank da first.<br />
<br />
Only had to zone out once because me gots hit and spun and got tooooo close to da casters near da fire pit. Udder den dat, was gud camp fer xp and if no one was at da bug camp just up from der, with KEI / Canni dance it was non stop killin.  Great spot for 44 - 46  :D <br />
