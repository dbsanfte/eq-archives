<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There will be a patch on 10/9, according to Sony.  The upcoming updates section has not been updated since 9/1, however, so I thought it might be fun to speculate on what this five hour patch will contain.  We know already that it will feature:<br />
<br />
1) new restrictions on HP augments<br />
2) reduced cash drops in LDoN dungeons<br />
<br />
What *else* will it contain, though?<br />
<br />
I am (optimistically) hoping that it contains a change to the affliction efficiency line to allow it to work with (duh) our new afflictions.  I've not seen such a change on lucy yet, though -- so I may be disappointed.<br />
<br />
What about you?  What do you think will actualy be in this next patch?</div></div><hr />

Supposedly some PoTime items are receiving an update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heard a rumour about the cash drop nerf. Hows that make any sense? We'd rack in a good 150-200pp each for a 6 man group per dungeon.<br />
<br />
Good money? Yes<br />
<br />
Unbalanced? Not even close.<br />
<br />
I fail how to see it's an issue. /shrug<br />
<br />
I kinda hope they make the difficulty of the dungeons based on level average a little spread out. As it is now a group average under 63 is easy, which can be fun especially with all pet groups. 63+ is not just a bit tougher but a lot. Tried doing one with the same pet group minus one person plus a 65 chanter and we couldn't do it. Whenever I go for 63+ a healer and tank is always needed. <br />
<br />
Just be nice to see more of a variation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I hope they bump up the number of adventure points awarded.  At 58, and grouping with characters between 55-60, I get between 21-24 points per adventure.  At 65, supposedly you get 51.  I personally think that gap could afford to be narrowed a bit, without being unbalancing.  This would also make the dungeon a little more rewarding for the mid level characters.  As it is, I would never send my 40 warrior through it for the measley 5-8 points he would earn.  <br />

<br />
I've only done about 40 adventures too. I'd at least understand if they nerfed the drop rates of augs, but not cash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HEHE, they dont need to nerf aug drops, but rather change the percentage of resist augs vs. Stat augs.  I agree, Ive seen more CHA augs than ANY other type.  <br />

and all the fun nerfs..and maybe some spelling corrections, and i think a door in POK opens wrong..so they better fix that!<br />

POM to all servers is probably the other bit.</div></div><hr />

Go to megus at any of the camps and buy Solvent. Combind solvent with the charm. Presto no more adventur stone. Go back to the NPC you got it from and hail them to get a new one. Then combind with the charm you want it on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They've been working on collect missions on test, asking us to do them and report our impressions, so it seems they know they are broken and they are attempting to fix them.  They just haven't gotten there yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Either let people 'Choose their own Adventure' or reduce the time it takes for a declined adventure to time out.<br />
<br />
Can be quite frustrating trying to get a decent mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have only seen 2 CHA augments drop, but about 15 WIS augments have dropped during my 40 or so adventures.<br />
<br />
If they made us able to choose which type of adventure to do, I think it would be pointless because I don't know of ANYONE that would pick something besides slaughter.  <br />
<br />
The other adventures add difficulty by making you have to go a certain path.  Wrong turn and you might not have enough time to go back the correct way.  If they up the drop rate of collections, then they will be no different than slaughters.  As it is now, the only difference between collections and slaughter is that you HAVE to kill very quickly in collections to ensure that all the items are collected in time.  Slaughter allows you some down time.  The only thing I could see to make them more balanced is to up the total needed to kill in slaughters.  That would remove the slack time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just a tip about refusing adventures.  If you hit decline, you have to wait like 15 min to be able to get another, but if you let the adventure time out on its own on the Accept/Decline Screen, it only takes like 2 min and you can choose another.   Probably be fixed soon anyway, but you'll have a few days of use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
15 minutes after you decline an adventure offered? I don't think so. No idea where you came up with that. Seems to be the around 2 minutes, the same for if you just let it time out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The quickest adventures I've done have been Assassinate ones. I've done a few that we completed in around 30 minutes. However, depending on the map and where the mob pops, they can take longer. The only one I've failed was also an assassinate (although we seemed to have very bad luck, and I was link dead for around 30 minutes too).<br />
<br />
Slaughter ones are more reliable - just go in and kill. A little boring, but you can't take the wrong turn or anything.<br />
<br />
I have done a few collect ones, didn't have any problems with them, but typically other members of the group won't touch them with a bargepole.<br />
<br />
Rescue missions are much the same as assassinate, only you do need to clear the way a little more carefully, and you can track the mob right from the start.<br />
<br />
I think it's only the collect ones that are problematic, the others seem to work fine, and give a bit of variety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">One of the broken things in LDON deals with augs on diety restricted armor. Currently you cannot stick an aug to diety restricted armor. (IE I wear Thunderous Heraldic Plate on my paladin, and I cannot put augs on it) The message is returned as &quot;you would create an armor that noone can use&quot;<br />
I have /bug reported it. Hoping that is fixed. I wear about 4 pieces of cultural plate and I cannot put any augs on them.</div></div><hr />
