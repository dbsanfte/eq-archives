<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think this case along with a few others should really show that postpartem depression is a very serious thing and to not take it lightly.  The fact that she knew she was one of the small percentage of women who have the very severe version of PPD and didn't actively seek help especially after being off medication and having another child knowing she could very well go off the deep end again.  There have been other cases of PPD causing deaths of babies and most of them unlike this one the women and their families didn't know the signs or didn't think about them when odd behavior happened.  For years the PPD issue was dismissed as just a womanly thing but it is a very serious and preventable issue.  Ehren and myself when we decide to have children have talked about watching for signs of it since she has a thyroid disorder which already throws her hormones out of whack sometimes if she doesn't take her medicine for it.  It is saddening children had to die IMHO because of some selfishness.  If they wanted another child that bad they should have adopted. My 2cp</div></div><hr />
