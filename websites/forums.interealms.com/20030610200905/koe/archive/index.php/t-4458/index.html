<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nerfed Big time. The caveman guys that were blue at 54 are now light blue. They now also have faction hits on them. The little beetles that con Indiff will all agro now when you pull one. The Shrooms have a bigger agro range. I was in here right after the patch and the trains were starting already. Well I guess I can't complain too much, my cleric went from 46 to half way through 50 in 2 days and tank got 54 and then 4 yellows in. It was fun while it lasted.</div></div><hr />
