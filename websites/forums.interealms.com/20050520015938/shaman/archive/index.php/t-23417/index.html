<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The biggest problems with racing to 70 for me (in a family guild with occasional raiding thrown in) are as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Spells or lack thereof.<br />

2. LDON level range, won't be able to group with my level 58-63 friends any more.<br />
<br />
3. Focus effects weakening.<br />

4. XP mobs greening out, although we don't know how significant it will be or whether new XP zones will be opening up.<br />

5. It;s harder to tank level 55+ XP mobs than level 50+ XP mobs, and I like to tank in Hate and such.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A lot depends on what level some of the new, more attractive OoW aa like rez, spell gem, more buffs, etc are.

<br />
I am shooting for 30 banked, on top of the 240 I have now. Then I will likely shoot straight for lvl 70. One disadvantage to being a penalized race XP wise, its gonna be an extra PITA, and putting up ratios like 90-10 or 80-20 doesnt work. Its 100 one way or the other for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just want to point out that focus effects will not change unless you actually have your new spells.

<br />
Honestly, though, level &gt; all for all the usual reasons--you will resist spells better, you can use new spells (if you want to, thanks to that stupid-ass decision on focus items), more hp, possibly more AC, higher skill caps (I've read about specialization and weapons stuff.  not sure on stuff like dodge, etc.).  Further, I know I've read somewhere about certain AA being tied to levelling.  I'll try to track the post down.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, unless you level, you can't get certain AA skills, I think.  (some are 66, some are 68, etc.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Going to level all the way, then gind out the AA's (flash back to 60-65). I have to deal with the Iksar uberness level exp so I'll still be 66 when others are 1 yellow into 67 =)<br />
And I think Chutoi is right, the nice AA's will prolly be lvl 70 anyway so whats the point in grinding AA's when you cant spend them where you want...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well.. at least our defensive skills raise up with levels.  Not sure about much else.  Honestly I'll prob bank my 30, decide what I want from there to go after first, and as soon as Omens is released hit the grind to 70.  I think at least the summon is level 70 so I'll save the AAs to get that as soon as I ding, and just spend the rest at that point till I get 70 and able to get the summon.<br />
<br />
But, yeah.. Levels &gt;&gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">lvl &gt; all<br />
<br />
Well, levels are normally more important than AAs, no question about that, and you can usually get by without having a few spells. However, there are certain class-defining spells that make it almost pointless to level up if you don't have them. Thinking back to the first day of PoK, do you think you would have gone to 65 if you had been, say, guildless and relying on the Bazaar for your spells? Especially if ALL 61+ spells had been droppable and none purchasable? Wouldnt' it have made sense to wait until you had at least the essential level 61+ spells before leveling up?<br />
<br />
Of course, if you are in a raiding guild and/or have access to the new spells, then things are different, but I tend to think that the all too common &quot;lvl &gt; all&quot; adage is a bit too broad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK, I am just making up numbers here.<br />
<br />
But lets say that right now you kill a lvl 60 mob for exp and it is worth 6,000 point of exp.<br />
<br />
If you hit lvl 70 and are now able to kill lvl 65 mobs at the same pace as when you were killing lvl 60 mobs and the lvl 65 mobs are worth 6,500 exp points. It will be a whole lot easier to grind AA's after hitting lvl 70.<br />
<br />
Say it takes 1,000,000 exp points per AA. killing lvl 60 mobs = 167 mobs.<br />
Killing lvl 65 mobs = 154 mobs per AA. If your killing at exact same rate of mobs that is 7% faster per AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On the other hand I would have at least a few AA's banked for the Extra spell gem AA. I pray it is not an ungodly cost like the GoD AA's but it is definately on my must have list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1. Spells or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
3. Focus effects weakening.<br />
<br />
That is kind of contradictory. If you don’t get any spells then your Focus effects are not going to lessen any. They will still work exactly the same. <br />
<br />
The only discussion I know of was that if you have a focus it might or might not work on 66-70 spells. The current discussions eludes to that if they do work they will do a reduced amount for 66-70 spells but work just like they do now for spells up to and including lvl 65. I don't have first hand knowledge of this but read a lot of mssg boards ;)<br />
<br />
The Devs have stated how ever that Focus will not change for current items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">3. Focus effects weakening.<br />
<br />
That is kind of contradictory. If you don’t get any spells then your Focus effects are not going to lessen any. They will still work exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Well, that's true, I wasn't particularly clear :)<br />
<br />
What I was trying to say was that the allure of the new 66+ spells is not as strong as what it might be otherwise since I won't be able to take full advantage of them until I get focus items comparable to what I currently have. I don't have much since I am mostly Bazaar-LDON-hard LDON-quest equipped, but I do have IH4, MP4 and ID4 (1K+ nukes inc!).<br />
<br />
Unless level 5 focus items drop in a readily accessible place like LDON, I won't be able to get them for a while, presumably until Bazaar prices drop to a few dozen K. And that's assuming that the first generation of level 5 focus items is even droppable. Plus factor in the likelihood of OoW spells being very expensive at first, and the end result is that I won't be able to upgrade my tools, i.e. spells + focus, for some months to come. Until that happens, I am probably better off staying 65 and working on AAs, especially considering the fact that I have my work cut out for me in that department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, levels are normally more important than AAs, no question about that, and you can usually get by without having a few spells.

No, because like it's been said.. the higher the level the easier it is to resist stuff and land spells on mobs.  At level 60 you will have a much much harder time landing a spell on a level 62 mob than you would at level 65.  You don't know the difference a level will make until you get there.  That's why having level 65 was such a huge differnce than having level 62, even without the spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Straight to 70. There are apparently level limits on some of the AA abilities, if you want the cool new rez or the group AA heal, 70 is the ticket.</div></div><hr />

That is certainly true and I don't think anybody is trying to dispute it. If you are in a raiding guild, then extra levels will make the content that you are facing significantly easier even without any new spells. Things that were not possible at 65 will be possible at 70. Being able to win an encounter that you were not able to survive previously is a good thing.<br />
<br />
However, that's the raiding aspect of the game. To some, it's the most important one, to others it's almost irrelevant. (In the interests of full disclosure, I am much closer to the &quot;casual&quot; end of the spectrum although my alliance raids low level PoP, Epics and such.)<br />
<br />
The other aspect of the game is regular XP hunting and that's where leveling a caster character to 70 before getting his spells becomes problematic since your new level 66-70 XP zones will be balanced for characters with full spellbooks. Think of LDON as the ultimate manifestation of this phenomenon.</div></div><hr />

reading comprehension is your friend<br />
<br />
And so is free speech, buddy.  Someone posts a controversial topic, and then an incredibly vague sentence that, upon further examination, could imply that we add these so called &quot;stupid&quot; questions to a list without analyzing them at all.<br />
<br />
General consenus?  They are NOT stupid comments.  If i posted a thread that said...<br />
<br />
&quot;Abortion...<br />
<br />
And other nouns.  Please feel free to add to the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
And someone posted ABOUT the aforementioned issue, they are immediately people worthy of ridicule and sarcasm?<br />
<br />
Pffft.<br />
<br />
Anyway, allow me to add my incredibly moronic sprinkle of thread hijackery...<br />
<br />
Unless they retroactively implement Focus V's on LDoN, then they're going to, equipment-focus wise, trivialize a LOT of old content (and I call it 'old content' not because it's old, but because it's from one or two expansions ago.  At the rate Sony is churning them out, said content is by no means 'old' yet).<br />
<br />
Also, they release GoD at a difficulty geared too high, do a retune, and now, a mere month or two afterwards (after retune, that is, not launch itself), the general mass of 65, 200+ AA people are FINALLY scratching the surface of it, and what do they do?<br />
<br />
Raise the level cap to 70 and give out all our GoD spells, with the exception of Nihil (which is one of the easier to obtain) as 66-70 spells.  I am not saying that I do not welcome alternatives, but what I AM saying is that they are semi-trivializing an expansion that was released mere months ago.  Why work your butt off for an ancient canni that you can get with non-ancient difficulty a mere 2 levels later?<br />
<br />
Also, Ornate is the current top of the line armor for casuals.  If this is rendered useless, or nerfed severely, where does one turn?  I'll agree that higher percentage effect (as in EP/Time/GoD level focus percentage effect) focuses should be out of reach, but the standard, already established 15's and 20's should NOT be trifled with.  And it's obvious that the previous focuses will work for 65 and under spells.  The point is, there's such little difference, number-wise, in the numbers of the effects for our 66-70 spells than there are from our 61-65's that one will see basically the same result casting the 925 DD with a focus IV as he will casting a 1200 DD with a focus IV (give or take a negligable amount).  This makes attaining new focuses necessary to gain any benefit out of new spells, due to the higher, Shammy-Cannibility-Inflated mana costs of these higher level spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'm just making up numbers here, but,<br />
<br />
The level 65 mobs have 10% more HP than the level 60 ones, so take 10% longer to kill, so you can only kill 167-10%=151 mobs in the same time, so you're getting XP at a 2% slower rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not how it has worked out in previous expansions. There used to be a site that listed out how much exp mobs gave and the numbers definitely did not jump up progressively as they leveled. A higher mob was worth way more than a lower mob and the kill ratio has always been about the same, that or higher ZEM’s for the new zones!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The way I understand it, mob xp is based on your level vs his level.<br />
<br />
People would wait at 60, because the mobs they would fight were close to their level or white (pod cy crawlers). They did not have access to bot/pov.. now with pov/bot access it would be foolish to stay at 60.<br />
<br />
With the new focus effect nerf, until my alt wizard can get new focus effects, even if he gets new spells, sos is much efficient/effective. So most likely I'm going to level my main to 70, xp in high level zones, maybe still KT or prolly in oow once I get in the upper 60s.. my alt will be raking in 20%+ more AAXP compared to my Shaman, while doing the same dps as if he was level 70.<br />
<br />
Things like that you got to consider. So a level 70 killing a 68 can give the same xp as a level 65 killing a 63, aaxp wise. Things like this should also be considered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No this is not true. If you are killing the higher level mobs then you are going to be getting more exp. Mobs have a set exp value and it dramatically increases with their levels.</div></div><hr />
