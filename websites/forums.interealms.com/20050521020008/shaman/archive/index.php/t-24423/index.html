<br />
I'm a male barbarian shaman.  The pics were taken while I was playing in Grieg's End with some friends.  Some of the nameds will change your graphic to just about anything (opposite sex included).  The entertaining part (at least to me) is that each player / computer can see a different model when the effect is on.  For example, the female high-elf pic was what the bard in the group saw, however from my perspective, I looked like an pre-luclin graphic earth elemental and a female dark-elf to the mage in the group.  It's only a short duration (30 seconds I believe) but can have lots of entertainment value when hanging out with friends or when it's near halloween.  :)<br />
<br />
While I was getting a key to check on Servitor of Lucling tonight, I was turned into a grimling (see attached image).  The zone may not be the best AA exp, but it's reasonable for the effort and I'll usually make a quick run through looking for any nameds to feed the tribute monster.<br />
<br />
I hope that cleared up the confusion Loramin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup :)  I've got nothing against cross-dressing, on Halloween or otherwise, but I wasn't aware until now that one could do it in EQ.  Having been in Grieg's End maybe twice if that, and not really remembering anything about it (or most of Luclin for that matter at this point), I didn't even know that the zone had illusion proccing mobs, let alone ones that could change you to any model.  Gotta love learning &quot;new&quot; things that have been around for years.<br />
<br />
All this got me thinking: I wonder if we could sell the dev's on the idea of gender changing potions?  They would no practical use whatsoever, unlike the illusion ones which have at least a small amount of practical use, but they would be a lot of fun.  On the other hand, I don't know if such potions would be family game appropriate: if you need halfling parts to make an illusion: halfling potion, then to make an illusion:male potion you'd need...</div></div><hr />
