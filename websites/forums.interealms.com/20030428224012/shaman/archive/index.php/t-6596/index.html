<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im done with alchemy, it just isn't worth it anymore. Nobody wants to pay the cost of making the potions. As far as im concerned let the other classes whine to verant to fix it if they want the potions i sure as hell wont make them for anyone but myself anymore. Not that i actually make many for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Slightly angry, my friend? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only slightly hehe, but hey im seriously done with alchemy. There isn't anything there but maybe 2 potions anyone really would want. The rest are convienence or completely worthless. Only ones i see anyone could really use and it would be probably for a raid are <br />
<br />
1 damage shield<br />
2 2700 hp heal<br />
<br />
of the rest there are about 10 that are convienant and the rest are worthless. They all cost way more than anyone wants to spend on them. Truth is if there is a shaman in the zone there is no need for about 99% of our potions. <br />
<br />
The stat potions are truely terrible no one wants the hits they give for the rewards they offer, let alone at the cost they are to make em.<br />
<br />
At this point i wont make a potion unless someone pays for it up front, or its something i need or a guild request. The rest of you still working alchemy can have at it. <br />
<br />
Alchemy 155 absolutly no reason to continue unless verant makes some changes.</div></div><hr />

There there, I had a bad skillup day too. I did 40 titans and not a single skillup. It happens in all tradeskills. It just sucks to happen at 157.<br />
<br />
I agree, I wish we had something useful. I'm tired of being sow-potion-boy for friends and guildmates.... I'm just sick of that one tired old potion that everyone sells, and people dickering over &quot;well, so and so gives them to me for 40 plat!&quot;. Then go get so and so to make them. &quot;But they're not on!&quot;. Tough.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is a toy for the hideously rich, who like having the ability to do stuff as a tank without needing a caster. Those are the guys who buy my shrink, lev, sow and ds potions. <br />
<br />
But those people are in the minority... and your friends and guildmates just don't understand why you charge 120 plat for a lev potion (that's at cost folks!), when &quot;I'm broke but I need this&quot; they cry....<br />
<br />
Please, Verant, revamp alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well for a while i was selling at any cost just to make something back so i could try for more skill ups, but screw it. It just isn't worth messing with. I will make ones I need or if for a special guild need but the rest can go to hell, and they can complain to Verant if they dont like it. If the all the other classes didn't get their SoW potions maybe, just maybe verant might take a look at the stupid skill.<br />
<br />
On another note it was mentioned that skill increases for Alchemy have been increased with todays patch. Too Little too late in my opinion. IT still is not worth it to work on this skill.</div></div><hr />
