<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">script totally bombed, kerafym never even made an apprearance..   after about an hour of trying to make it work, the lead GM told us we were SOL and to move along  <br />
<br />

/rude Verant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think he decided that he didn't want to work that day.<br />
<br />
<br />
No rules and all ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
(Seriously, sorry man that sucks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea that sucked, i wanted to see the script :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same thing happened on Vallon a few weeks ago. I wasnt there, but when my guild popped the last warder up (was not 4th) nothing happened, apart from the Sleeper poofing. People in SF and SS reported nothing happening at all. GM's didnt know what was up.<br />
<br />
All warders respawned on time during the next cycle, but the Sleepers bubble is now empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Har Har! It seems that it either:<br />
<br />
a. was fixing and now the sleeper will not spawn<br />
<br />
b. was nerfed by a watchful gm (good thing too)<br />
<br />
c. is working as intended and countless hours of time was wasted<br />
<br />
I pick c. as the answer.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well, after the GM couldnt get sleeper script to work he just told everyone to get out of ST and set it to post awakened dataset, so no more warders, but we got jipped on the script :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry to hear the script didn't fire.  The little bit of what I do know about it (the whole Sleeper thing was long before my time) comes from the BotS report from waking him on The Rathe.<br />
<br />
I wish Verant would post some of the storyline stuff that halfway happened or was supposed to happen.  I'd really like to know what they were trying to do with Kerafyrm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, they have been busy testing Luclin before release and making sure everything was working so they probably didnt have time to fix the script behind one of the biggest events in EQ even though its more than a year old now. :)<br />
<br />
Atleast everything else is working as intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">working as intended my arse lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dannin, as long as that ain't working, can you do me a favor and work Dorkenbane over a few times for me? I'll give ya a few hugs if ya do. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm thinking it's working as intended so that all the other servers that spawned sleeper won't bitch that theirs didn't work and want VI to repop the sleeper.</div></div><hr />
