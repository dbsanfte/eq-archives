doing a raid or just doing the entrance but dont have any real exp in there...<br />
<br />
Do you all have any tips ?<br />
Things I shouldnt do? [ I like to learn from others experiences  :) ]<br />
Good spots for exp ?<br />
Good spots for spell drops.. I know about the Emperor.. (printed that and have it) <br />
Good spots for loot?<br />
Any kind of walk thru out there?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your information..  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't spent a whole lot of time there since the release of Planes of Power but I did go back a few weeks ago for a 4d group. (was 58 at the time now 59)  I wouldn't say to plan on leveling there really.  I did get xp but nothing too great and there were several light blue cons here and there.  I wouldn't mind going back there though to take on some juggs and I've gotten a few invites to go to the spore king guy.  I see quite a few people soloing in the pyramid area and the bugs.</div></div><hr />

Don't know how experianced you are in Sebilis, so you might know this already, but here goes.<br />
I've been 2boxing my 53 shaman and 61 beastlord at NG (Necrosis scarab/guardian, the 3-bug spawn across from building to zoneout) with good results. I can see that you have both epic and JBB, so you should be well able to hold the camp. Its no spell drops, but its good loot as the bugs drop gems often, and the Necrosis scarab(the named rarespawn of the camp) drops decent loot to sell in bazaar or to a vendor(Cane of the tranquill sells for 150ish pp to vendors, rest of loot should easily sell for more in Bazaar).<br />
Its a fairly straight forward camp, 3 bugs and a Krup-roamer. When you pull the nearest scarab, #2 will add, but as they are easily rootable this shouldn't be much of a problem. Slow, dot dot pettank and you're fine. Rinse and repeat. You want to kill the krup-roamer first. They are high level frogs, and can come as shamans, warriors or wizards. They DO hit rather hard, but they dont have unreasonably many hp, and nothing the above cicle wouldn't be able to handle. <br />
Now for a final note, the rare-spawn on the camp Necrosis scarab DOES summon, but with it rooted, slowed and hard dotted you should be able to let pet tank it while you heal up whatever damage you get when you get summoned. I've seen this done by lesser shamans, so you should be able to do it aswell.<br />
Can't tell you what kind of xp you would get, but the xp i got on my duo was good enough. Solo should be significantly better.<br />

What was failed to be mentioned.... NG is usually camped 90% of the time, and if you tried to take it solo and didnt keep the entire place clear, people would move in on you :(</div></div><hr />
