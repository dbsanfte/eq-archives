i play in the sewer better known as Sullon Zek.  we have no one with trade skills (other than jewel crafting chanters and a few tailors) and all our equipment is styled around resists that you will never need.<br />
<br />
i carry more gear than you can imagine so that i am constantly prepared for whatever situation pvp might bring up.  wis gear, ac gear, resist gear, focus item gear, and even dex gear for the proc on my barb spiritist hammer.<br />
<br />
at lvl 51 i still wear a totemic BP and carry a BS Tunic for some extra wis in a group.<br />
<br />
as we are a team pvp server, a lot of our gear either comes from trades or the zones we control.  it isn't until you hit the the 60's that people start to get 'uber' gear.<br />
<br />
till then i guess i will just drool</div></div><hr />

I hate red servers and always have. If I wanted to get &quot;pwned&quot; by some PK on a regular basis, I'd just play something mindless like Quake.<br />
<br />
I know &quot;carebears&quot; don't play a real game, but we have quite a bit of fun doing it and have the fun of getting to kill mobs that drop nice loot and take team work to get.<br />
<br />
If you really want to get into tradeskills, start a toon on a blue server and give it a go. It'll be just as much fun as PvP, but you'll actually be heading toward a goal of getting ready to take on mobs like CT and Inny, rather than trying to keep outta the next l00zer PKer.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played on a pvp game for 7 years. It gets boring fast. The days you just want to hang out with your friends, only to have some jerk decide he wants to brag about killing  you.<br />
<br />
We held a 100 days party for one guy who had gotten 100 days played on his char. At his own party, someone pk'd him. Nice! &gt;:&lt;<br />
<br />
I play on a blue server for a reason... I get enough aggrivation from the game to worry or desire aggrivation from l33t players who think pk'ing everyone is fun.<br />
<br />
My advice to you is do stormhammer... since you can't move from a red server to a blue server, stormhammer is your only way out with this char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greakan_VF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it takes guts to play on a red server, not sure how you all do it. Definitally a differernt chemical make up of your personality than mine. /salute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes, Sullon is the game on acid.  been a smith on VZ, but the rush you get knowing anyone can take a swipe at you is the reason we all play there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I could start over, I would play on a Red Server.  In fact, when EQ2 comes out, I am going red.  PvP adds a much-needed factor to the now boring blue server grind.<br />
<br />
Your post even points out the problem with blue servers:  Equipment = Everything.  I would rather level slower, wear crappy gear and have the added excitement of PvP.<br />
<br />
Speaking of crappy gear, I am 59 and only gave up my Totemic BP two levels ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PVP is what keeps me playing this game. High lvl PVE is a really nice added bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your attitude is crap UbercyrusForbeis. Fighting another player rather then AI is called fun. PvP has nothing to do with hiding from other players. Anyone who is afraid of fighting another player must really lack in game ability, else why fear?<br />
<br />
Some people act like there is something to lose about being killed by a player. Big deal. Die and move on.<br />
<br />
The only thing I will grant you is that EQ PvP is also pure crap. Becasue if you don't get in a top guild, you don't have gear, and gear = PvP skill in this game.<br />
<br />
As for the first post, what you say is not true. In PvE resists are extremely important. Most &quot;blue&quot; players have tons resist gear, not to mention the resist totals themselves being MUCH higher then on any PvP server. The reason is that gear is a lot easier to obtain in a non-PvP environment.<br />
<br />
I lived on TZ for two years and then some. Recently I moved to SH. But now, I am retiring. This high end, guilding and rading stuff is BORING. I do not like this guilding thing. This is why I left TZ in the first place. I do not want to be a part of any guild in order to acomplish anything. Raiding with a bunch of people is not as challenging as breaking a dungeon solo or with a trustworthy partner. EQ has completely lost it's fun factor.<br />
<br />
EQ is not a game for me anymore. My sub-50 Alts are still fun sometimes, but my Shaman is utterly boring as I have peaked his development from a non-guild standpoint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Every game gets boaring at some point.  I personally just started playing EQ a few months ago.  Once you powergame through levels and rack up a grip of uber items the only thing you can count on is player interaction to keep interest.  V is scraping to hold interest with expantions and for good reason, once Starwars or SB or EQ2 comes out EQ will be nothing more than another Ultima Onine (which I played for 5 years, this is where I am getting my view :) )  If yo ulike PvP go for it, if you like D&amp;D play a blue server, if you dont like EQ just move on, it's all just coded info anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I don't care for PvP at least not in the sense that eq has it on any of thier servers. DAoC seems to have some really good ideas on pvp but lacks any real game content out side of pvp.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd never play on a pvp server in eq. The game wasn't made for it and its a second thought if even that compaired to PvE. No need to look far to see this even. Mana burn, true shot, ht disc. All things that have places in PvE and are fine but just compleately suck in PvP. Any half way descently equiped wizzard with mana burn can take out all but the best equiped fully buffed tank in one shot with no chance at resist before they know what happened. PvP can be fun at time but no way would i even consider it in EQ. Game wasn't made for it, still isn't made for it and never will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">While I have never tried PvP, and likely never will, I can say that I just dont see why in the world I would want to make this game harder on myself than it already is.<br />
At level 30 it wouldnt be too bad, most people are wearing crap gear anyway, the exp loss no big deal. All it would be would be a time sink.<br />
At level 50+ the time loss and the exp loss would be tremendous.<br />
Also I would think that it would make tactics much different, limiting AOE anything, watching who's targeted better...make sure to not tick off the heavy nukers/dotters for all the right reasons etc...not that this would be a bad thing...I can see some good there.<br />
If its your bag, more power to you and have fun, I like my blue server just fine.<br />
Bonestomper, come to any server you want and start fresh, being a noob again is a pain, but you might be able to enjoy the game more. FV appreciates its tradeskillers as does any of the newer servers where tradeskills are still at a lower end.<br />
Its your monthly fee spend your time as you wish, don't torture yourself on a server your not happy on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I play on a PvP server, and it is not, in general, the all out, 24/7 PvP fest that people seem to presume that it is.<br />
<br />
Basically, you PvP as much or as little as you want to. If you like to PvP, it is not hard to find, and you soon get to know where to go looking. If you dont like to PvP, you soon learn where to stay away from.<br />
<br />
If you want to be &quot;uber&quot; in PvP, yes, it helps a lot to have really good gear, and to get the best gear you need to be in one of the uberguilds, however, as a shaman, even without hugh end gear, we are a hard class to kill. I am a relatively low level shaman, with very ghetto gear, but I very very rarely get killed in PvP (I don't win many either tho heh heh). I got jumped by a ranger who is in one of the top guilds whos mimimum entry level is 4 above my current level, and he couldn't kill me...ok, so i gated in the end, but I think it annoyed the crapola out of him that he couldn't waste the ghetto shammy<br />
<br />
I must confess that the PvP aspect helps to keep the game exciting for me. I could play on a blue server, and it would, for sure, be easier, and I would free up about 10 slots in my bags that are currently taken up by various crappy resist gear, but it would not have the constant extra edge of knowing that you can get jumped and lose all your hard earned plat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't PvP outside of the occaisional arena bash.  PvP is fun sometimes with friends, but overall, it's not for me.  My guild has a bunch of folks who played on RZ and who now play on BB with us.  They're skilled players and fun and have contributed much to my guild.  That said, its fun to sneak up behind them and start casting my JBB just to mess them up ;)  Sometimes they still jump :)  These guys still love PvP, but its broken in EQ.  If you don't think so look at morons like Fansy or Pansy or whatever its name was who exploit broken PvP game mechanics.<br />
<br />
BTW, resists are still important on blue servers, and the best gear is still attained by the uberguilds.  Those distictions are not unique to red servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tarthug,<br />
<br />
The difference is, even with ghetto gear on a blue server, you can still play the gamejust fine. Ghetto gear on pvp means that you're going to see more red text on your screen than yellow.<br />
<br />
The worst part about PvP is very definately the low-level on it. I've repeatedly tried to claw myself up to some level of dignity on Rallos, only to be repeatedly stomped into nakedness by someone's invincible twink. And the worst of it? At level 13, being killed by a level 9 twink... Even if you win the fight, you can't loot their corpse. It's just another exploit that becomes glaringly obvious on PvP.<br />
<br />
I guess I could try Sullon or Vallon / Tallon... But, somehow, a larger pvp range combined with less reward if I win (yay... money) doesn't seem as fun to me :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
PvP would be great in this game, except for one thing - Jerks that exist only to cause grief to other players. I actually like combatting other players. It's a challenge, even if I've never stood a chance with my untwinked pansies. But a few d00ds can ruin the whole thing.<br />
<br />
So, I'm blue. Yeah, it's boring, but I installed and pay for Everquest for my entertainment, not someone else's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I bought EQ I didn't know anything about this game. I went to the chat to try and get some help on picking a server. Someone said Vallon Zek was a new server that just opened so I should start there.<br />
<br />
I played for 3 months before someone told me most of the other servers weren't pvp servers. I thought they were all the same  :confused: <br />
<br />
So now it's 3+ years later and I wouldn't change a thing. I'm glad I made Vallon Zek my home. I wouldn't know how to play if I wasn't always waiting for the pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My problem with PvP is the disperity of focus between people who just want the AI aspect of PvP available and the folks who get their jollies off destroying others' play experience.  While I'm a &quot;carebear&quot; player - my home is Druzzil Ro - I have played on both Rallos and Sullon, so I do know what the worlds are like.<br />
<br />
Rallos was a lot of fun - for about 2 days.  Then I started to run into the problems the system has.  About to win a PvP encounter, my opponent stopped fighting back.  Why?  To take the time to bag all their tradeable gear.  Then of course there were endless, senseless assassinations by insane twinks.  I came back to my Rallos character after a long time of neglect - and was killed within minutes by a level 24 in full Thurgadin Quest gear - including BP and legs - the self-acknowledged twink of a then-60 character who simply &quot;wanted to be able to destroy others uncontested.&quot;<br />
<br />
I played on Sullon, also.  I knew some of the people that founded Hate.  I was well prepared for what was going on.  Heck, I was an iksar on the dominant evil-team when being an iksar meant power.  I had full Cabilis Scale by level 10, a gift of the dark powers.  And yet I had a growing disdain for people around me.  When the point system was modified to give negative points for repeatedly killing (ie corpse or bind camping) one person, I was disgusted when those around be bragged at how negative they could drive their point totals.  Asking why ... they responded that in their minds, that was real victory.  PvE monsters just respawn ... but deleving a guild ... camping a corpse in shifts until it rots ... forcing someone to quit their character because it would be hounded, harrassed and slain forever ... that was victory.<br />
<br />
But its not the kind of victory I want.  I don't play Quake.  That's not about being a carebear - or about &quot;fear.&quot;  Its about not wanting to deal with the kind of power that the jerks and powergamers can weild.  On blue servers, players will see someone rooting mobs in a planar GY, and say &quot;I sometimes wish I was PvP ... then I could give that player what they deserve.&quot;  But, in my experience ... on red servers, its THOSE players that are the most active PvPers.  They are the ones bind camping on Sullon ... or, like ambulance chasers, stalking raids and waiting for wipeouts for the &quot;thrill&quot; of PKing the clerical CR team or nuking down the newly-rezzed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well I've never played on Sullen, Vallen or Rallos but TZ is NOTHING like what many of these posts describe a red server to be. Sure you have the occasional twinkies doin run-by slaughters but generally this is only possible at lower levels, and pre 30 who cares if the twink takes your 6pp, the worst she/he can do to you is CC you. 9 times out of 10 if you /shout that so and so is CCing you there will be a swarm of people coming to your rescue in no time(unless of course you are a jerk in which case a good CCing might be just what you need). And as was stated earlier, being a shaman I almost never die. It is generally pretty easy to get away from people in range to me (8 levels on TZ) and if they do somehow manage to kill me...good for them, Grats Bro! You just accomplished a rare thing and deserve props for it. Because I guarantee that fighting another player is 100 times more difficult than any MOB in this game, especially at higher levels when gear differences are less dramatic and less relevant. <br />
<br />
I recently started a new char on EMarr at the request of some RL friends who want to go blue and I discovered upon reaching level 16 that I cannot xp in Paludal Caverns. Not becuase a bunch of twinks are PKing me everytime I set foot but because a bunch of twinks have the zone perma camped and since I can't PvP there is simply nothing I can even do about it except go somewhere else to xp. At least on TZ I could organize a posse and try to run the twinks out once in a while so I could at least hunt there occasionally. I have a feeling my time on EMarr will be shortlived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimjakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I played TZ from launch through Oct of '01.<br />
<br />
When the game was a true TEAM pvp server, it really shined.  Even as the Good vs. Evil server it evolved into when the three &quot;light&quot; teams banded together to fight the overwhelming Dark team dominance of certain zones it was still fun (though occasionally frustrating, at least the roleplay element was still there).<br />
<br />
But ultimately a group of folks decided to play the high-end game as designed and screw the rest of the community.<br />
<br />
Once that happened, the TEAM part of team-pvp broke down fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
Now except for a couple of mid-level dark guilds and one human-only guild, they're all cross-team guilds that concentrate on PvE and guild fueds...  might as well have stayed on Rallos. :/<br />
<br />
All it would have taken to rescue the original concept would have been a &quot;hardcode&quot; of the teams... preventing crossteam grouping/guilding/buffing/and healing.  That's the game I signed up for and put 2 years into.  And yeah, I'm still kinda ticked... heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grimjakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ah... almost forgot my point. ;)<br />
<br />
The problem with the PvP servers isn't PvP in general... I've had some of the best times on Tallon...  it's with the game design in general.  <br />
<br />
The endgame funnels folks into a cooperative mode that's really kinda inconsistant with roleplaying a conflict, and the gear that the endgame gives you totally overbalances the pvp that does occur in that endgame.<br />
<br />
So... do yourself a favor.  If you want to start a secondary on one of the war servers, just level to mid 40's and stay there.  Don't play a main there expecting to enjoy the endgame.</div></div><hr />
