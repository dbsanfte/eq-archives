<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loudoom Trueheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please allow me to introduce myself,<br />
I am Loudoom Trueheart.<br />
Shaman of the 53rd circle.<br />
I've been playing EQ since it went commercial. 2 weeks into the game, I was asked to join Order of the Crimson Dragon. I was made an officer 2 weeks after that. Unfortunately, that didn't last very long. I never felt the family atmosphere I was used to, having a long history of RPG's and Guilds. <br />
I had beta tested for Sierra's The Realm, and became a guide. I had also beta tested 3DO's Meridian59, and became a guide. I worked with their customer service there for over 3 and a half years. I was one of the first centurians (level 100) on server 100, and helped found a pk hunter's guild named The Avenging Knights. I beta tested Ultima Online, and Acherons' Call. <br />
I ended up staying on EQ but had decided not to become a guide. My reason was Verant had no clue as to what customer service was.<br />
After leaving OCD, I became one of the founding members and officer in The Honorable Few. When the Veeshan Server split for the first time, I had inherited the Guild Leader's Position which I held up until almost 4 months ago. I had decided to leave THF but did not want to disband the guild, so I transferred leadership. In my years of service, I had supported almost every raid, given of my time, all my money and extra equipment, to the guild and it's members. Yes, I still look like a newbie! I was also their Webmaster.<br />
Now that I've taken some time away from being a GL, I am once again missing the family atmosphere I am so used to having in a guild. I would like to offer my services and friendship to KoE.<br />
I have in the past hunted with and developed good relations with current members of KoE.<br />
Vhela, Vesparian, Arborealus, Seraphima, Coatlicue, and Larain just to name a few.<br />
I am hopeful they would vouch for my reputation as an honorable man.<br />
Please feel free to contact me in game if any of you ever need any help with anything.<br />
Please be safe, and good luck to you all.<br />
Est Solaris, Oth Mithas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to give my 2 coppers worth (not that it means anything hehe) This is a great guy! He is one of the most honorable men I've had the pleasure of meeting in this game. He is wonderful and very giving and well basically he is just GREAT :) <br />

I remember one of my first trips to Runnyeye with 3 other adventures.  We were on our way down to the Warlords room.  Well to make a long story short we made a wrong turn and ended up with the Evil Eyes and the Dazed Shaman.  2 of us were charmed and ran off deeper into Runnyeye to die.  Chmee was able to find his body but we could not find Shambuls.  The Honorable Few were there raiding and Loudoom and several others jumped in to help with CR.  This was the first time the 4 of us had an interaction with a guild and it was a very postive one. <br />
<br />
Its good to see you applying for the guild Loudoom.  The best advise I can give is to group with as many Keepers as you can.  The process of join KoE is not a short one, but it is worth it.  As large as we are, we still are a family type guild with people who care and help each other.  I would not trade it for any other.<br />

Hi Lou :)<br />
<br />
Does this mean I can request recruit access for you now? <br />
<br />
I've known Lou almost from the beginning of my EQ life as Vhela.<br />
He was the cool High level Shaman (19) that gave me advice on spells when I was a lowly level 9 or something :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
