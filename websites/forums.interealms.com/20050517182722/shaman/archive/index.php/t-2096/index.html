<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, thought I ask a question before going to bed and read up on it tomorrow. :)<br />
<br />
I recently started killing giants, we mostly go to the Arena and chances of chain dropping seems to be rare.  The Raid leader who does these raids doesnt know if their is a better spot for drops other then the arena, in fact no one does.<br />
<br />
So my question is, which camp spot drops chain more often or is their a specific spot that drops chain only?  Like for example go to the plate house for plate drops.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm, I got a full set of Thurg chain (minus bp) in about 2 weeks camping the arena.  I never did see a thurg chain bp drop!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I fought frequently in the arena (from once a week, to everyday of the week) from about June to November of last year.<br />
<br />
Never saw Chain BP, Chain Pants, Leather BP, Leather Pants, Leather Sleeves, Silk Robe...probably 10000 of them damn giants dead.  :p<br />
<br />
Plate is/was really the easiest to get in the iceshard keep area cause you can do the 9th ring cycle over and over.  Never seen anything but plate drop there though.<br />
<br />
Arena seemed to be the best bet for drops of all types though.  You can also do some of the inner arena to get drops for your tunare worshippers - clerics get good bracer from PoG and I the helm of the tracker guys are in there.   Also the guy that drops the Scepter of Mastery which is a decent monk weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah I was hoping for some other place other then the arena hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks friends :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, there is another area.  It's called PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The drops in kael arent great anywhere.  I have seen 1 bp drop.  Never saw any pants.  Hrm, I guess probably 25 raids to the arena.<br />
<br />
I did get in a group near the bank.  Had a couple peices of chain drop there, off Lieutenants (or Sargeants?  something).  Of course, I was playing my cleric at the time, so yay, lucky me :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Best bet is probably a single group near the bank, or a raid at the arena for drops I imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fenwyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Single group by the bank is a nice spot.  Lieutenants seem to have a decent armor drop rate, and you can pull the noble house while you wait for the bank to repop.<br />
<br />
I have been told that left arena is better for chain and leather, while right arena is better for plate and silk, but that could just be urban legend.<br />
<br />
Either way, I have hunted in Kael more times than I can count, and I have seen 2 pieces of chain drop.  Lost both rolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hate kael drops.  Wasted to many hours of my life in that zone to see such pitiful armor drops, for such minor upgrades to kunark armor.<br />
<br />
Arena is in north kael, try heading to south kael and do the tormax throne room.  I hear the sentinels can drop up to 3 pieces of equipment, and there are alot of sentinells there.  Its much harder than the arena, and I wouldn't recomend doing it if tormax is up.</div></div><hr />
