<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read a post way back when at castersrealm i think it was.  A shaman an a Rogue duo'd the entire toiler camp in ME before any new ones popped.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering, how would a rogue and a shammy duo? i would guess that the shammy would try to keep aggro so the rogue can BS, but i wouldnt think that would be the most efficient way.  Or maybe the shaman would root, but then if the rogue got to close the mob would hit him, so that wouldnt work.<br />
<br />
how exactly would this duo function as well as it did for these guys??<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman goes into &quot;solo-mode&quot; by slowing and dotting the mobs (if they'll live long enough heh) then the rogue joins the pet as living-DoT.  I've seen this used very effectivly many times.  Rogue/shammy is a great combo (but then shaman+anything is a great combo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that makes sense i guess =-D<br />
<br />
and your right about shammy+anything too.  even pre-pet ive duo'd w/ a chanter, monk, cleric, sk etc very efficiently =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman slows and tanks mob.<br />
<br />
Shaman keeps mob rooted.<br />
<br />
Rogue chain backstabs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">also, if needed rog can tank while sham regens mana/hp since they have better defense skills and damage avoidance.  sure max damage is not being done but a sham at 10 percent health/mana and a full health rog dont do any damage.  rog can also bind wound sham while he canni's between fights.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pure speculation but if it was a Troll I'd imagine they just snare kited around with the Rogue and Dog 'O Doom killing.   Otherwise the only way I'd see is using both kiting and root and tank while the rogue back stabs.  At least that's what I do when I'm duoing with a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been partnered with a rogue for around 50 levels now. My GF made her rogue when I was level 15 and I'm 55 now. She's 59 :P.<br />
<br />
Whenever we decide to kill something. I Slow then DOT with EB or Epic or Both depending on mana. Make sure she has haste and wait for it to die. She has an unbuffed AC of 1100+ and 2000+ HP so she can tank a bit if I need mana or need to back out and heal some. Even in toe-toe she scores great damage using Rage in primary and Long Sword of Ethereal Energy in secondary. Rooting is a great way for her to get a few good BS in and as we all know shaman can take a few hits. <br />
<br />
I've never really tried Snare/pet kiting things with her, because we're usually indoors and it's tough to do, but I imagine it would work fairly well. Might use more mana that way though. Especially with recasts to keep aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've duo'd with a rogues a lot, they're one of my favorite duos. Just slow / dot and tank. If the dots aren't enough to hold agro use insidious decay, its a great taunt and doesn't use a lot of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, thanks for the info =)<br />
<br />
At the moment it doesnt seem like this duo would be great for me, cause im stuck in the terrible levels of 30-33(32 now :()<br />
Once i get puppy and scourge i think this duo might become abit more viable :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sometimes I 2box a rogue.  It is always in a dungeon, like seb or sometimes I make poor roguebot camp Verix with me.<br />
<br />
In Seb I use Root religiously.  Root keeps agro on me and since I can't snare (rogue has no snare items /spank) it controls runners.  Easy to see when root is off cause mob starts hitting rogue.  Using root you also dont have to worry about using evade much, if you get agro it's just cause the rogue is too close, back up a step.  Spam backstab...<br />
<br />
I was once in a group with 4 rogues and myself.   It was at like 3am and we were the only ones in the zone (maidens eye) we were doing the tree gorgangas.   I used insidious decay to keep the mob agro on me there rather than root, it was a mega taunt.   I think now that they fixed/nerfed/changed the disease counter thing it might not work so well though.  <br />
<br />
Rogues are very fun to group and duo with.  They do amazing damage and as a shaman you should be able to tank many of the slowed mobs we kill for exp (froak!).  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Or maybe the shaman would root, but then if the rogue got to close the mob would hit him, so that wouldnt work.&quot; <br />
<br />
Far as i know root works because the mob will hit the closest person regardless of the hate list. So as long as the rogue backstabs from the right distance away the slowed mob should be hitting the tank capable shammy. <br />
<br />
  As for shammys tanking there have been some mobs i swear my shammy takes the damage better than my 2nd account warrior when i get an add. Just slow the mob let the shammy tank it while the warrior finishes the first one off. My shammy doesnt do alot of damage while tanking but he can take some hits.</div></div><hr />
