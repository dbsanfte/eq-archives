<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I dinged 45 two nights ago, and now I'm looking for some upgrades. I have 8k saved for a JBB, but can spen *some* of it on upgrades. I was thinking about dragon raids, which I really want to go on, and the only thing I would roll for is the Bladestopper off naggy. But should I? Its and upgraded Clay Gaurdian Shield, the stats are ac: 25, sta+15, hps+50, 10 charges of Rune 4 I think, should I bother with this, or try for a haste item to sell? I use Shield of Falsehood, but was also thinking of getting a SBS, so which would be better. I have also gotten a Ivory Imbubed Collar for a good price (400, as oppsed to the druids who this that stats make it worth 1.5k :/ ) Or i could re-sell it for 600-1k. Also any other upgrades would be great, and my bracers need work, I've been looking for a sentry bracer for a looong time now, still no luck. Also are RE legs and bracer super rare, or could I get them on a raid to PoH? I know i have to be 46+, but there is a raid there the 20th, should I get 46, and 2 yellows into it, and see if i can come along, or work on getting money? One last thing, should i buy resist gear for naggy/vox raids yet, cause my resists are very low. Thanks<br />
<br />
Profile(attk and ac is off, but my defense is at 198, and my ac is around 820-830)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can anyone help me? Not sure on what i should do, and i need 3k more for JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Still using a bladestopper at 60 here. <br />
<br />
From what all the softies say, a jbb will help you fly from 45-52 so might as well hop along with the crutch, so to speak =)<br />
<br />
Go to every hate raid you can. Learn to love it, and you will get armor. <br />
<br />
I never got to raid vox/naggy so I have no idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry, burnt out with armor upgrade posts.  It's very hard to suggest upgrades for people that don't want to spend any money, especially at level 45 when it will be difficult to obtain the items via camping.<br />
<br />
As far as resist gear, if you plan to raid, BD jewelry is an investment that you will use for a very long time:<br />
<br />
* 2 BD earrings<br />
* 2 BD bracers<br />
* Froggy crown<br />
* Stone of Morid<br />
* SBS<br />
* Crested MM shield<br />
* Sabretooth amulet<br />
* velium diamond rings<br />
* velium jacinth rings<br />
* Gold/Electrum diamond masks<br />
<br />
MR &gt; other resists, nearly all the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Overall your gear is looking pretty decent. I would go for the jbb to replace the drood bracer. Then work on resists. Bds drop pretty frequently from hate so possibly you could get them as you get your drop armor and save some plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, i bought my JBB today, w00tage!!!! 12k and a Chipped Bone Bracelet, now im 1.6k in the hole :( Also i went on Naggy raid, AND vox raid, kill naggy (orb, koshinagta, rune, BD, vendor bait jewerly, 2x paly books) and we got wiped out on vox. Anyways, I'm still 45, but have my JBB, i NEED 46 by tomorrow, so whats the best place for exp with a jbb? My ac is now around 850. Defense is also maxed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe that would be loio bloodgills...gratz on your jbb :)</div></div><hr />
