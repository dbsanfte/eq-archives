<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toein Athkatla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm curious if anyone who has killed Grummus has any perspectives they would like to share concerning Shaman Strategy for said fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming you are Torpor equipped... during our Grummus encounters, my main duty was to keep our Cleric rotation alive. I was in one CH group and I rotated Torpor on them throughout the battle to ensure they lived through AE damage and they just made sure they kept in range of the melee classes. All was good and no cleric deaths.<br />
<br />
EDIT: On another side note, I also use this rotation in Ranger groups during major encounters. I need to re-verify if this affects archery attacks as I was under the impression it did not. See note from Meecham below.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Uhm who told you that?  Torpor definitely slows my archery attacks.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hrmm.. that was coming from various Rangers I group with. I will re-verify with them... assuming you are correct.. I will revise my strategy. Thanks Meecham.<br />

Grummus is all kinds of nasty.  Hits hard, has a nasty AOE dot and has a nasty AOE curse too.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Get as many people as possible with Radiant Cure 1 - it cures Grummus' curse (a couple of clerics with MGB elixir or druids with MGB spirit of wood are also really good)  <br />
*  Mem abolish disease NOT disenfecting aura.  Shaman are the only folks that can cure Grummus' dot with one cast.<br />
*  Keep Grummus far enough way from casters/clerics that they aren't hit by the dot OR the curse.  We always pull him to the long, rectangular room past the spider.  Melee pin him in one corner of the room away from everyone else.  We failed once, because Grummus ran over the casters and cursed everyone, they just started dropping like flies, that curse is MEAN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toein Athkatla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks folks appreciate the info. And btw Glori you still are one sexy beast of a Barbarian woman. /hugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So where did you pull him to?<br />
In his room or at the top of the stairs...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lately my guild has been pulling him outside of the castle..dont ask me how (monks are wonderful mysterious people). We set up at the corner of the castle taking a right when you go up the stairs, fight and pin grummus to the wall, casters stay near the edge of castle and mainly i just nuke to hell and RC people when needed...pretty easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman strategy for us was one shaman assigned to main tank spamming abolish disease to keep him up.  With torpor the shaman can stay up.  Chan healing torpor on clerics and other healers like druids and clerics using AoE group heals like elixor. <br />
Get as many other people to get Radiant Cure, I believe classes such as paladins get it as well.  Have main tank back into a corner and hold aggro on him like AoW.   Casters move out of AE range if possible. <br />
<br />
Wow I am a tard, what Glori said.....<br />
<br />
:) Hope that helps some....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another tip for pulling....<br />
<br />
That curse on him is a 4 min recast time for Grummus.  You need a 'sacrifice' if you will...a person that will take the first ae curse alone, then take the pull to the raid.<br />
<br />
It saves your group a lot of hp and mana right off.<br />
<br />
After that, AoW positioning, shammys spam abolish disease, and clerics/pallys on radiant cure.<br />
<br />
Grummus down. Next :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grummus AE is cone shaped, if you can reverse pin him facing a wall in a corner with his back to another wall (like sideways in a hall) and all casters on a side of him, none will take AE damage.  shaman job on raid to spam cure MT with abolish so he can hold aggro.  If grummus moves around your dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How do you do a reverse pin against a flat wall?  Doesn't the MT eventually end up to the side of the mob, causing it to face parallel to the wall surface?  Or is that the idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>hartmut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">zerg him and keep trying , no mob easy at 1st attempt  ;)</div></div><hr />
