<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple of thoughts.<br />
     I was thinkin the other day while driving what would be a nice improvement for my shaman and this is what I though of. I want buffs compleetly reworked- I hate buffing,, but I love being a buffer? Odd huh. But in all the games I've played I enjoy being a class that improves the other classes I play with. I just barely hit 65 and got avatar,up to this point my biggest pain was haste, and I have an ornate Bp so it was just a pain, not a mana thingy. But as has been said before FA= da debil.<br />
    <br />
     Anyways so heres my plan, this will be easier to understand if you have played daoc. In daoc you had some spellls that just required consentration but no mana, you could only cast a certain number of these but you did not have to keep refreshing them if I remeber right. But what I want is all my spells to be this way. I want to pick what buff I want to have on which charactor and have it be applied to him, I want it to take the same mana that it used to, but do it over time. I want all buffs to be like this. 1 hour buffs are a pain, anything less is torture. Some aspects of the game would have to be redone for this but generally I like it. Personally I think you should only have the buffs your current group can give you anyways, I hate it when your groups wipe and all the casters go running off lookin for kei, personally I think all casters should be given a 15 pt improvement to mana regen anyway and get rid of kei, you cant tell me the chanters dont have enough to go on with out it and who past 45 goes anywhere without kei on in the first place. Oh ya before this our buffs need to be fixed. <br />
<br />
This might not be to coherant but its late and I wanted to see what everyone thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome to the boards. That is an interesting idea. I think it would be too much of a change to mechanics. Still, I hate people running around for buffs before they can hunt. <br />
<br />
I like the idea of getting buffed by whoever is actually there. If that were the case, perhaps you could refine the buffs so that all intelligence casters had essentially equal mana regen buffers that overwrote each other, all priest classes had essentially equal hit point buffs that overwrote each others, all melee dps had essentially equal attack and haste buffs which overwrite each others, or could be dualed (since there are 6 melee dps classes), and all plate tanks had a/c and shielding buffs which were essentially the same and could not stack. Thus, each group would want at least one of each type of class and two melee dps. Each &quot;buff&quot; supports that class's essential functional class. <br />
<br />
Furthermore you could have raid buffs where each class can supply one of perhaps three buffs for raid, making the attendance of every single in game class be helpful on every single raid. Nothing you could not do without, but something where you would say, cool we have a berserker raid buff, I am glad she came tonight. Thus with three of each class you would have the maximum 39 raid buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When Sony went to the paradigm of HPs &gt; *, then the game irrevocably went down that path (as opposed to Resists or other factors) forever.<br />
<br />
I would like my buffs to MEAN something. I think it was Gikk who did a parse where a 67 point STR buff resulted in a 7% damage increase.<br />
<br />
Woooooooooooo.<br />
<br />
How about an END regen buff?<br />
How about doing away with some of these stacking issues? (Somebody enlighten me if I am missing something obvious)<br />
Does AC mean anything anymore? (Warrior alts help me out).<br />
<br />
I mean if I buff AC by 55 and the MA's AC goes from 1446 to 1501, do I see a NOTICEABLE decrease in damage?<br />
<br />
Does anybody remember the resist hoops we jumped through in TOV? Granted, with levels, the need for &quot;resist gear&quot; changed, but at least you had to make some decisions.<br />
<br />
And speaking of resists - anybody parse a difference between a 300 FR and a 455? Or do we just not care, slow the MOB, act as a secondary healer and move on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Resists matter a lot when you get hit with AEs with negative resist checks. I wish they weren't capped at 500 though.</div></div><hr />

I want a line of dd spells that check for slow mit, if something mitigates my slow I turn into a dps machine. On a full imune you could even have turgurs do dd, problem is what to do for partial immune? Maybe a partial pisses doggy off so he does propotional dps to the mitigation?<br />
<br />
How about this for dots, works for all doters cause we all got pets, prolly have to pump up the druids bear though. I cast my dots on my pet. Instead of hurting my pet, when my pet hits the target the dots start to be aplied to the target. When the target dies what ever is left of the dot stays with my pet for application to the next target. This would probably have to be complicated with restraints. Things like: 3 dot on pet max, dots dont apply till 75 health... you know what ever just seems like kinda a fun way to make dots usefull again.</div></div><hr />
