<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hertome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend plays a lvl 56 Troll Shaman, and we thinking about teaming up. Now is my question, what is a good partner for a shaman? We would prefer a caster like Wiz Necro Mage. A Partner with you can go easily to lvl 60.<br />
<br />
Thank for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would advice against starting a caster as a partner. Instead start a monk, feel the power and live the dream :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monk + Shaman is hands down the best duo in the game.<br />
<br />
Out of the int casters, I would pick a mage as a partner.  It works surprisingly well.  Slow the mob and let the pet destroy it while throwing on the occassionaly dot or heal or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't really think pure casters are that great of partners for shamen, as they dont go to gether as well as say:<br />
Shaman and:<br />
ranger<br />
monk<br />
shadowknight<br />
warrior<br />
rogue<br />
paladin<br />
........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, I don't like partnering with any melees besides a monk.  They take too much damage and kill too slow.  A fully buffed and decently equipped monk will rarely or never need a heal, thanks to mend, and will kill faster than all of those other classes.  Plus, he doesn't need mana to be at his maximum efficiency (like an sk or pally does) which means he'll never have to med, so no down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hertome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I already partnered as a monk (lvl52) with a shaman, and i must say its not as good as lot of people sayin. sure it rocks, you can kill things very very fast, but you are very limited in the things you can kill. i.e. Shaman/Druid both 52 can easily hunt for Centi Swords, while the Monk gets his ass handed to him. in higher lvls you get a lot of probs in melee, as the new mobs in luclin i.e. hit very hard so that the shaman gets probs healing the damage up. sure the monk could FD and stay away till the shaman soloed up the mob...but thats not the playstyle im thinkin of.<br />
<br />
but thanks for the suggestions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe obviously u played with a poor shaman, shamans get the exact same heals as druids till 60.  and we can slow mobs, which means less healing.  but if your shaman was having problems slowing the mobs maybe they are a little to hard? dont really know the circumstance but I have no clue how that can be true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I havent had any problems fighting in ME (53mnk/52shm) , well if you discount the Xi that tends to sneak up on the &quot;safe&quot; hill to the right of the dawnshroud ent and nuke me during fights.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Paladin still the best partner I've ever duoed with.<br />
<br />
I'd have to say ranger next.<br />
<br />
Monks?  Eh, they are so-so, but granted that is only from a somewhat limited EXP.<br />
<br />
Do some experimenting of your own and see what you like best :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I do a lot of duoing with a 54 Ranger (has offhand epic) and a 52 Ogre SK. Of the two, the Ogre SK is prolly the better... more HPs/AC, can bash, taps, etc. Does less damage, but needs WAY less healing (1 Sup Heal per every 5-6 mobs maybe).<br />
<br />
If you've got to choose a caster, go with a Necro. The dot stackage between the two of you would be absolutely sick.<br />
<br />
And I'll have to ask you to take back the comment about the Pally, Rodahn... especially if it was Ethon ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only problem with a hybrid is that they eventually run out of mana. Whether it's 2 mobs or 20 mobs. Sooner or later they have to sit down. That's not so much a problem if the Shaman is pulling, but that's not really a good idea until post 50 and you've got a fungi, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
If your monk needs to sit down then you're doing something wrong. Their damage avoidance is WAY above par compared to the other classes and only a rogue can beat the damage (and then only from behind).<br />
<br />
A monk Shaman duo is insanely effective. Sure, the other classes are good too but they'll always be compared to Monk+Shaman because that's the &quot;par&quot; they have to live up to.<br />
<br />
And if you have to play a caster, play a Necro. You get virtually the same pet as a mage in addition to fear, snare and increased mana regen. Necro could pretty much solo anything that a Necro+Shaman duo could though.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If these are the classes you want to play, I would definately go for the Necromancer.<br />
<br />
Wizard - no. Awesome class, but not very efficient in gaining experience as a duo with a shaman. Expect much downtime. You could however do some rough encounters together, but the wizard getting aggro will probably cause you two problems.<br />
<br />
Mage - maybe. With the new changes to pets, I could see this work. But your haste is wasted on the mage pet since they can do it themselves. They have nice pet heals, so not too much need for that either. As you have not too much to offer to the mage besides slow, the mage does not have much to offer to you either besides his pet. Again, not saying anything bad about mages, but I don't think it will be the best duo you've ever played.<br />
<br />
Necromancer - yes. Granted, monk or shadowknight make a nice partner for a shaman because you can unleesh all your uber melee buffs on them, but I know from personal experience that a necro-shammy duo should not be frowned upon. Basically the shaman can stay alive and the necro can throw all the dps he can scrape together on the mob. Aggro is not too much of a problem, because a necro can always fd to lose aggro. The necro can heal you when you are in trouble, and vice versa. Necro and shaman spells complement eachother very well. Even though some dots are the same between the classes, you can usually work something out that leaves you both with a good set of dots to cast. A necro will add mez, snare, fear, fd pulling and awesome dps to your duo, all things a shaman does not have. A necro will not cause you to have downtime like other casters might, because their mana regen is as crazy as a shamans. You will be amazed to see what a good necro can do to a couple of slowed mobs. I do not agree with the above post that the shaman would have not much to offer to the necro. Mobs that would be nearly undoable for a necro alone simply become doable because of slow. Malo/malosini will help a lot, especially for spells like mez. Regen/torpor will help dearly not only in danger but also for mana regeneration. HP buffs will always make necro's happy. Also, the recent change to pets will make this duo become even more powerful for gaining experience.</div></div><hr />

Shamans are freakishly overpowered defensive soloists.<br />
<br />
Do the math :)  I am not sure  what your monk's problem is, but I duo in acrylia, akheva, me, seru, etc with a monk all the time and I basically never ever heal him.  If monks has a weapon that procced slow, you might as well delete every other class for the non-raiding game.<br />
<br />
Among casters, a NECRO is a excellent idea.  regen/lich series is monsterous mana regeneration.  Necros do great damage, the new pet changes help them a lot, and have amazing utility value (FD! fear!, snare!, mez! wow!).<br />
<br />
Mage/shaman might compete with shaman/necro, but I doin't think so, at least until level 60 with an epic mage with god rods and a shaman with torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just to be different I would suggest a Beastlord.<br />
<br />
Now that pet's dont take any xp, why not have a pair of them banging on the mob?  Basically you have 3 melees and you.  <br />
<br />
I can't speak for all the way to 60 but for the first half of the game (1-50) it's a nice combo.  Plus the Beastlord can ALSO be a troll.  *regen*, same faction, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Do joo just plan on duo 95% of da time?<br />
<br />
Den mez like da FD choices....  all of dem Monk, SK, and Necro.<br />
<br />
If joo plan on adding other friends from time to time den<br />
mez like da SK da best.  A 60 sk is da best puller in da game and<br />
a better tank den then da monk.<br />
<br />
Out of da choices joo give Necro is da clear winner for lots of reasons, most of wich Athame talk bout.<br />
<br />
Shaman wid Torpor is king of da mana recovery.<br />
Necro wid Shaman wid Torpor is very close second.<br />
<br />
Lots of Necros have more trouble indoors because da loose da fear kiting ability and have no room to operate.<br />
<br />
Shaman guud solo indore and remove dis handicap from da necro.<br />
<br />
Necro Dark like of snare dots is great addition to Shaman tanking indoors.  Just look at how da trollie shaman love da little snare neck that has the first spell from dis line.<br />
<br />
Necro pet alone is lots of additional DPS but Necro dots will add lots of addition DPS and because of shaman like mana recovery, this will be sustainalbe damage output.<br />
<br />
Of da 3 choices joo give mez like da necro da best.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you can use fear... Fear &gt; Slow. <br />
<br />
Slow may reduce the damage you're taking by 50-70% but Fear brings it to zero. Once you've got your spawn nice and broken it's pretty safe to use too.<br />
<br />
And you made my point for me. All you have to provide the Necro is health. You give them Regen and Heals and they go to town. Being OOM is an Int caster's enemy. All you have to do is stop that happening and pull to save time.<br />
<br />
- Beeg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The question was wizard, magician or necromancer. But talking about monk vs necro as partner: if you fight big nasty's with huge dps your monk *will* need healing. In a monk/shaman duo, the monk would be tanking, you would have to torpor him sooner or later (probably sooner), reducing his dps to but a poor shadow of monkeyness. In a necro/shaman duo, the shaman would be tanking, reducing the shamans (chain channelling) melee dps from nearly 0 to even closer to 0, and the necro dps would be unaltered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To answer the question. Nreco. Period.<br />
<br />
They are everything that a shaman could want from a partner.  With pets you have 2 melee and 2 casters.  From an exp view they are a great combo.  In areas that you can fear :drools: you have 0 damage. <br />
<br />
My 2nd box will have a necro.  If my guild didn't need a more raid friendly class he would be my main on box2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Of the choices you listed, I'd say a necro.  Of the choices everyone else is adding, I'd still say necro ;-)<br />
<br />
Necros are my favorite partner when duoing, and it's the class that I use when I'm 2-boxing with my shaman (although I also sometimes 2 box with my monk or SK).  Just in terms of raw damage dealing,  a necro / shaman team is pretty incredible - Tons of DoTs stacked on, pets flailing away (in situations where pets are easily managed - even more now with the new changes), necro FDs if he draws aggro, all while the shaman melees / JBBs away.<br />
<br />
This combo makes for very little down time also.  You almost never have to wait for mana since the necro has lich / demi lich / arch lich on throughout fights, regrowth drastically reduces the HP drain, necro tosses a BoD / Vexing when needed and the killing continues.  Other benefits - if things totally go to ****, the necro can do a decent job of emergency healing, or he can pump mana in a pinch.<br />
<br />
In my experience, there's very little downside to duoing or 2boxing a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've leveled up with a Shadowknight and I wouldn't trade him for anything, even a Monk. Snare splitting is wonderful.<br />
<br />
If you're going to go pure caster, Necro without a doubt. I love those little guys, when played well of course. The two I play with are incredible. So good, in fact, that I become a damage dealer while they take care of the healing (thanks Vexing Mordania). They're incredibly sefl-sufficient and really low maintenance which is nice. You can duo indoor or out with them and take on some pretty mean critters if you want to (fear, pet, dots up the wazoo). They, also, can FD/snare pull when needed. And their pet is so cute when you shrink it *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i like mages ... welll i like pimped out mages ....<br />
