<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What level is good to start hunting here?<br />
<br />
I heard the stables where good, low 40s or so, but i cant remember, and couldnt find the post where i sawthat(searching gave me nothing but epic stuff)<br />
<br />
and as to epic, what mobs drop all those random pieces that i need for the epic.  Also, what mobs drop the piece for the canni2 quest?.  <br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know the piece drops off of army behmoths. I am planning to start my canni 2 quest at 45. I am 42 right now. so next week probally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">army behemoths can spawn anywhere golems can, but its not that frequent, i went on to reaver raids and never got one to spawn. I ended up geting it and the greyish bone chips from a friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The epic pieces drop randomly off anything in the zone except for Student's Log which is random drop off of Spectral Courier. Spectral Courier only spawns in the stables.<br />
<br />
Strange Ochre clay drops from Army Behemoths and your best bet for Behemoths is the Temple area. Just go past broken bridge and hang a right at the courtyard and go through the doorway the temple is on your left. Also the high-scale icon for the Hole is ground spawn in the Temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level is apropriate to fight at the temple w/ a group or strong melee partner?<br />
<br />
same question for stables.<br />
<br />
Also, i know alot of people solo here around 53, but forget what part of the level.  Is it possible to solo around the stables? and if so, at what level.<br />
<br />
thanks :)<br />
<br />
<br />
oh wait, one last question, is it possible to MQ the quest? i have a friend w/ the greyish bone chips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The grey bone chips (from KC) are the only NODROP part of the cann2 quest. The easiest thing to do, is to give your friend all the other quest items and have him do the quest for you - the spell reward is not NODROP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok, that works :)  Ill just do that whenever he gets back from hes vacation(next week i think)<br />
<br />
BTW, whats the easiest way to get to the golra island in tim deep?<br />

K, well, alot of good responses on the quest, but what about hunting in CoM?<br />
<br />
what are good levels to do all the stables/bridge area? <br />
and what are good levels to try soloing those areas, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">39 - 51 is good hunting in CoM.  In fact that's about the only place i visited between those levels =)  Stick to bridge/stables (with a monk or higher level puller) until your mid 40's, then you can move back further to the back alleys or goo house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wonderfull, as i plan to hit 39 tonight, or tommorow(if i dont play tonight) i'll be sure to go w/ my friend whos currently leveling over there :)<br />
<br />
Hes a pretty uber 45 Warrior, complete w/ some uber like 10/19 sword, and a frostbringer and stuff like that, so w/ torgors and chloro, i bet we'll be able to handle alot of the stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Careful, COM is not THAT easy.  39 shaman and 45 warrior is really pushing it, I think.  Meaning that if you can do it, you'll probably get great experience.<br />
<br />
But by comparison, my iksar monk with a fungi sometimes found it difficult here and there.  Fungi'd monk is pretty strong.<br />
<br />
I'd definitely try to fill that group as full as possible.</div></div><hr />
