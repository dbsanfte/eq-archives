<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How reliable is it?  I almost never user him in xp groups or raids or anything, but I was toying with an idea.<br />
<br />
getting pet disciple and having dog dog just hold and follow me around while raiding, thus if i get beat on he may shield me.<br />
of course with elemental trash mobs if i'm below 30% health chances are it won't matter much but I'm curious how reliable his shielding is.<br />
<br />
also does anyone know if we will even shield if he is on /pet hold?</div></div><hr />
