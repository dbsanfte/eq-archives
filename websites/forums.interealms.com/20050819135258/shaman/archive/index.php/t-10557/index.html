<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We all know the golden rule.  Don't sit down.<br />
But I ran into a point in which i guess it helped out about 2 levels ago.<br />
I was in kith i think they were doing general.  The pull brought the general and a DE cleric to boot.  Everyone was on the general but cleric would run around interrupting casters and healing the general.  <br />
Everyone one was focusing on killing off the general soon as possible, and everyone was calling for someone to pull away the cleric.<br />
<br />
Guess its one of those miscommunication things.  Melee thinks someone else is going to do it, so they stick to what they're doing.  Multiply that to an entire raiding party and no one is getting the command.  So I took it upon myself.  Whether it was a stupid move or not I can't say.  But there were already other shaman there higher level than i to handle the slows and malo's and what not.  <br />
<br />
So I cast my agro spells, younger version of cripple, insidious decay, nuke. She still wasn't looking my way until. I remembered to just sit down.  Bam immediately she was running towards me.  But as soon as I got up she went back.   So i'd pull back further, and sit down, she'd chase, come close, i'd stand she'd start to return and i'd sit back down again, until she was far enough from everyone else where she didn't seem to want to return.  So thats when I ran.  Ran her all around kith, healing myself while the finished up the general. <br />
<br />
Would have been more heroic had i not gotten lost and started running around screaming like a reject from a bad blair witch knock off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rydaark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you want to know some good pulling techniques..check out monkly-business.com...Monks have been using sit agro  for about as long as there have been monks  to single pull one mob without agroing  others. but glad to hear it worked for you too in your situation..good thinking )</div></div><hr />
