But i do have a question for Huntress Shooten from the<br />
TT server!<br />
where are u grouping, what plane and what CAMP<br />
 &quot;to get 1aa point in 2 hours or even 2 complete lvls in a day&quot;<br />
I have been in pon mostly but i have gotten 2 yellows for aa'a exp but definetly not 1 AA in 2hrs hehe, btw this is NOT a flame!<br />
I just would love to find those places hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your reply  Shooten :D .</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I didn't mean anything by the geek thing...I just thought it'd be funny joke by verant.     I mean for real, if you get 65 in under 2 weeks, your telling me they actually have a life outside of eq?     UNLESS you are on vacation or between jobs, then I could understand.     I mean nothing by it, but I do know that the people they made the EQ special on 48 hours is pretty much on everyone who's 65 atm.  Do a /who all 65 right now and they could all star on the next eq special about being an insomniac and an eq addict :P    anyway, grats again on 65, glad we got another ranger up there :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
so the real question is what have you noticed parse wise ? <br />
<br />
as to the h8r , chill doesn't matter if it takes ya 1 day a level or 1 month.<br />
<br />
the guy that did this first took 72 ? hours the first 2 levels 3 boxing, the next 3 grouped ?<br />
<br />
So that's not that much time all things considered to sink into leveling ? <br />
<br />
how long did 55~60 take you ? took me 2 weeks after i decided to actually do it.<br />
<br />
xp isn't that hard to get if that's your goal don't h8, just do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell ya these people have lives. Screw you for saying otherwise.<br />
<br />
Friend calling: &quot;Hey man, up for coming out tonight?&quot;<br />
Level 65: &quot;Nah thats cool, think I'm gonna stay in tonight and just chill&quot;<br />
Friend calling: &quot;Ok cool, I'll call you in a couple nights or something&quot;<br />

Just because someone made levle 65 in a few days does not mean they dont have a life.</div></div><hr />

Yes, &quot;Screw me for saying otherwise&quot; for the fact that it's only for a few days, but if they are that hardcore into it, chances are they are that hardcore most of the time as well.    I only said it as a joke, so I dont see where there is the problem and why you need to run your mouth about something that isn't even a problem...</div></div><hr />

My friend went from 60 to 63 in 4 days, and he isn't one of those &quot;hardcore&quot; players, just a casual guy. And, how you can define a &quot;life&quot;? Everyone's lifestyle is different, just because they don't go out partying every night and getting piss drunk doesn't mean they don't have a life. Lol.<br />

I've been on the top of the aggro list when MTs die lately.. when before I was usualy aggro to control my aggro a bit easier.... once the MTs get 65 i'm sure it'll be a lil' easier/back to normal.<br />
<br />
As for my life... i spend it playing EQ, i'll admit that, but i'm happy, i do what i love, i have my guild that is like my family.. whether that is &quot;wrong&quot; in your eyes... well, it's my choice.  And i'm sure everyone who might criticize me is just jealous that they can't quit their job! =p<br />
<br />
I will have to get a job soon though, i can't live off all the money i saved up during High School forever 8(<br />

I understand that even if you dont have a life outside of eq, you can be very happy, and at one time, that was me too :)   EQ is enjoyable, so it is definately worth it.    I'm sorry for anyone who took offence to this, I was just trying to be funny but I forgot how many people enjoy eq as their life, so it's not right to say otherwise.  I should look at myself before I talk considering I have 170+ days playing time between my 2 main characters lol!  <br />
<br />
Anyways, Grats again on 65, glad we have another Forest Stalker instead of those Wizzies :)   hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Werin</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LIKE i said in earlier post grats on 65 Seph, now i have a question for you, I was wondering, do u think the exp, u gain in 61is  the same as in 62 , 63 or was 61 a harder exp gain like 59 was before curious they changed it!<br />
<br />
Also any spots that you felt you got great exp, for  the time u put in!<br />
<br />
thanks Seph!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SephrokThePathfinder</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">61 is the equivelant of 5 AA points, while 64 is the equivelant of 10 AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think I can agree with ya on that one Seph.  I was making ~1.25% a kill doing Undead Vassals at 62, and ~1% doing the very same mobs in 64.  It was a very gradual increase in the amount of xp needed, certainly not a doubling from 61-64.  Couldn't say how much it was in AA terms, but it went from about 6 mins per % to about 8 mins per % at 64 on the same mobs (averaging it out per orange).</div></div><hr />

<br />
My dps went from like 70-75 to 90-95.... from lvl 60 to 65.<br />
<br />
And if you dont believe me about 64 being 10 AA points, check show EQ forums =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vash</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats man on 65!!<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get there... getting 60 was great no one was higher than you lol =p<br />
<br />
<br />
But as far as lvling goes, my friend did all of lvl 62 in less than 15 hours the other day in PoV and i knocked out nearly 4 aa's in about 9 hours... the exp is just insane if you can find a group lol<br />
<br />
<br />
i was talking to an enchanter who when she just dinged 62 had someone who was also just just hit 61 and was about 1 blue into their level and they were grouped for like 12 hours straight or something and they nearly dinged at the exact same time... so assumeing the 62 is getting slightly more exp... their isn't must of a differece between 62 and 61.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still getting nearly 2 blue an hour in a good group... which is exp that i havn't seen since lvl 51... its just great... <br />
<br />
<br />
so where are these red mobs that you are hunting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">got 3.6 aa points yesterday in 7.5 hours ush in a guild group in PoV :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got 65 2 days after Sephrok.  This is with ONE day of hardcore xp a week.  Just one, and very little xping during the rest of the week.  So it can be done and still &quot;have a life&quot;.  In the right zone with the right group, the exp is far beyond anything you have seen previously between 50 and 60.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorant</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget there's an amazing difference in a group of 60's with 100 AA points heading out into PoP than Lorant and friends with 3 AA points.<br />
<br />
Sean (for example) is roughly twice the ranger I am, in and kill/defense power..  Add 5 others of the same level, they can kill things I need 2+ groups for.  So getting to 65 for them was easy.<br />
<br />
For me?  Well, I'll be around :)<br />
<br />
Grats though, meeting goals is a good thing</div></div><hr />
