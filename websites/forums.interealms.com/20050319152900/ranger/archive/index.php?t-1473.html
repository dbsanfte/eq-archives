<br />
However there is something wrong with this statement:<br />
All were Canadians from the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.<br />
<br />
What kind of name is that for a military unit!?  I would say they were doomed from the start :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Locz</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard the story in detail on the radio this morning.  Don't blame the pilots.  Blame the management and headquarters.<br />
<br />
The facts are this:  The Canadians were legitimately practicing nighttime weapons training on a listed weapons-range (mostly small arms and machine guns).  Two US F16s on combat patrol saw the tracers below against the dark rocky scrublands and thought they were being fired upon by Taliban irregulars.  The pilots then radioed headquarters, relayed their obervations, asked for advice.  Headquarters gave the two pilots permission (ordered?  not sure yet) to drop laser-guided bombs on the &quot;enemy forces&quot; below.  Unfortunately, the high-tech bombs were unerringly accurate and several Canadians died and a dozen more are badly wounded.<br />
<br />
IMO, this freindly-fire error indicates a breakdown in comman-and-control, poor communication, inaccurate deployment maps for pilots and controllers, and poor communciations between US and Canadian forces.  These errors do not need to happen, and I hope that internal military investigations find and fix the problems.<br />
<br />
It's a real tragedy, and my sympathies go out to these brave soldiers and their families.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not sure the exact details of the incident but it seems to me training grounds should be well marked and made known to others.  At least to the point where if you see troops in a certain area, you double check before you murder them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you double check before you murder them. <br />
<br />
The term &quot;Murder&quot; I think is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
The line of communication broke down somewhere and so yes someone will need to be held accountable however I doubt it was the pilots who made the mistake.  They have to rely on eyes on the ground and from other sources to get correct info.  If that info comes in bad it can be dangerous for the pilots (most often) or for allied units (in this case).<br />
<br />
But don't call it murder cause I'm sure the pilots are going to have a hard enough time ever pulling the trigger again.<br />
<br />
As for the Canadian soldiers... They have my utmost respect and their families have my prayers.<br />
<br />
Yes its tragic when these things happen and yes someone needs to be found remiss in their duties (who yet I don't know and it might end up being a Canadian or possibly British officer who didn't relay information to their American counterpart but an investigation is needed all the same.)<br />
<br />
But here is a startling fact for you all.  An average of 33% of casualties throughout modern conflict (wars starting with Civil War are considered &quot;modern&quot;) are due to friendly fire.  In some wars friendly fire can make up 50% of the casualties.  That sampling of wars includes wars from other modern nations aside from the US as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everything on the news is saying that it looks like a misidentification, that the Canadians were engaged in a live fire exercise and the pilot flying in the area thought he was being fired upon and responded in kind.  If he were being fired upon it would have been the EXACT CORRECT THING TO DO.  Unfortunately, it sounds as much of a case of a lack of notification to the pilots flying the route that the exercises would be happening.  Either way, that pilot's career is now effectively over, his commander is going to have some light stepping to do and we're wearing a big black eye.<br />
<br />
Four Canadian soldiers are dead, a fifth might die and seven others are hurt.  We got off easy.  Condolences to the families and friends of the dead and seriously injured.  A gesture from the United States awarding support to the dependents of the deceased would be appropriate.<br />
 <br />
Yes, friendly fire does happen, it does kill people, and it is always a tragedy.  <br />

<br />
Murder is the intentional killing of another.  Sometimes this definition is broadened to include willful negligence (such as a drunk driver killing a pedestrian).<br />
<br />
Accidental deaths are never &quot;murder&quot;.  I am certain that investigations will show that these pilots were not &quot;willfully negligent&quot;.<br />
<br />
We must always be careful that we carefully choose the words we use, lest we diminish their meaning and impact  (an approximate quote from Churchill).<br />
<br />
The pilots who were misled into making this mistake by headquarters are victims too, and will have scarred conciouses for the rest of their life.<br />
<br />
It really bothers me every time I see emotionally-laden words misused by the ignorant.  Examples include:  murder, rape, slavery, genocide, holocaust, bitch and terrorism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im assuming when the pilot dropped the bombs he was intending to kill them no?  This would make it the intentional killing of another. <br />
<br />
Thanks for proving my point.<br />
<br />
I dont doubt the pilots are scared and the families of the deceased are mourning.  I feel sorry for them and i would hope there is a way to fix friendly fire which happens all to often (as someone else pointed out).  Seems like you could have the planes fly over a different area then the training grounds or at least come up with something.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more.  The word rape especially.  Everytime I read on a msg board or online game and see someone say &quot;You just got raped&quot; or &quot;I just raped your sorry ass&quot; I want to do bodily harm to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me say a few words on it, being a Canadian and all.<br />
<br />
Unless the commands knew it was Canadians and ordered fire, it is an extremely unfortunate miscommunication.  Unless the pilots knew it was friendly forces and still land the bomb, it's still an unfortunate miscommunication.<br />
<br />
The fact here is, as stated, is an indication of problems with knowledge sharing and intelligence sharing.  Hell, it's not like it's a secret training ground for Canadian troops, it's a known range.  So either the commands never borthered to check, or they did (I have no idea who is responsible for knowing these things, I'm assuming the command centre) and still ordered fire.<br />
<br />
In the latter case, then it's murder and it means war or at least court time for the commands in question.  If it's the former (more likely IMO, I /very/ much doubt US government wanna start a war on Canada.. why borther? &gt;:-) ), there's something wrong with the commands and should be investigated.<br />
<br />
I do mourn the loss of Canadian lives, but I do not believe there's any ill intent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Canadian, there is no doubt that this will be viewed as an accident up here.  The only twist in this story is that it involved another nation.  Military accidents are not uncommon but usually the disaster is at the hands of your own military.  <br />
<br />
Either way I see it as just a huge reminder that these guys are all still over there in dangerous enviroment.  I listed my post as the forgotten war cause with the Middle east going to war for the one thousandth time it seems the fight in Afganahstan disapeared off our radar.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't care whats happening in the Middle east I care whats going on in afganastan cause thats where Canadians are with there lives in danger.  Just sad that soldiers need to die to bring this war back to life for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simas firstly your calling the killing in war &quot;murder&quot; does a HUGE disservice to the men and women who defend your right to misuse words.<br />
<br />
Show a little respect by calling what they do the correct name.<br />
<br />
Defense.<br />
<br />
Yes it involved killing and yes its done purposefully but its a far cry from murder.  Murder is the senseless killing of another for personal gain, enjoyment, and supporting of an evil purpose.<br />
<br />
I'll take a real glaring case in point.<br />
<br />
The Nazis who ran the concentration camps murdered the Jews.<br />
<br />
The Nazis who were on the front line fighting for their country were not murderers... they were soldiers (soldiers we disagreed with but soldiers all the same)<br />
<br />
Frankly Simas you dubbing actions in war as murder is the biggest slap in the face you could hit a soldier with and franky since you pretty much owe your life and your freedom to said soldiers I would be a little more respectful.<br />
<br />
Yes this and other incidents involving soldiers need to be investigated and yes we need to keep a close eye on our military but keeping a military in check is a FAR different cry than being disrespectful to them.<br />
<br />
We are an exception in the US and Canada and Britain and other allied nations.  We have an Army that serves the will of the people.  MOST countries have the other way around where the people serve the will of the Army.  Be respectful to what you have in this country cause all you have to do is hop one continent south to see the exact opposite situation.<br />
<br />
Also my friendly fire stats were not meant as an argument to bolster your disrespect but simply point out the REALITY that war is HORRIBLE and that war is hard.  Frankly considering the casualties we have had in our last several military operations the US is doing a FAR better job than the historical average with somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% average in casualties  due to friendly fire.  So before you start spouting off information you have no clue about go do some research and learn what the numbers mean and learn what the trends are.  as of the passed ten years friendly fire is on the decline thanks to our technology and our improvements in how we run a command and control line.<br />
<br />
Yes that line broke down for the Canadians and those pilots and I'm sorry for them all but people need to realize even the doctors in the back lines can be hit by both enemy and friendly fire.<br />
<br />
Soldiers have some of the most dangerous jobs in the world and we pay them so little both in money and the proper respect deserved to them.  The money we could never pay them enough as there isn't enough wealth in the world... the respect however is fully in our control.</div></div><hr />

Im assuming when the pilot dropped the bombs he was intending to kill them no? This would make it the intentional killing of another.  <br />
<br />
&quot;them&quot;  The pilots and headquarters had misidentified the target.  The pilots did not intend to kill &quot;them&quot; (meaning the Canadians).  And &quot;them&quot;  can only mean the Canadians, since they were the victims.  The pilots had intended to kill Taliban soldiers...however this event never happened.  So enemy fighters were not killed (or murdered, to use your misuse of the word).  <br />
<br />
Did the pilots intend to kill someone?  Yes.  But not Canadians.  The fact that Canadians were killed was accidental.  Hence, the use of the word &quot;murder&quot; in referring to this friendly fire incident is wrong...very wrong.</div></div><hr />

If you are a criminal shooting at a police officer, but miss and hit a bystander, who dies, did you murder them?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Locz</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from Simas, and wrong again: <br />
If you are a criminal shooting at a police officer, but miss and hit a bystander, who dies, did you murder them?  <br />
Yes.  Intentionally firing into a crowd is willful negligence.  Firing at a police officer proves criminal intent.<br />
<br />
The pilots did not intentionally drop bombs onto a &quot;real&quot; target and happen to hit innocent bystanders.  Their intended target was NEVER there.  And, dropping bombs during war on intended enemy forces is *not* criminal intent.  It is their legally-sanctioned job, as ordered originally from the commander-in-chief.<br />
<br />
If you are a criminal shooting at what you think is a police officer but it turns out it was really joe the crazy guy dressed up as a police officer, and he dies, did you murder him? <br />
Yes.  Intentionally firing at what you think is a police officer, who wears a badge of authority of our government, proves criminal intent.  The fact that a gun was fired at an individual with crimal intent who happened to be a misidentified target is willful negligence.  So this would be murder.<br />
<br />
Again, the pilots did not drop bombs with criminal intent.  The intended target did not wear a badge of authority of our allies (the Canadians).  Not murder.<br />
<br />
Simas, I'd suggest taking a reading on law ;)</div></div><hr />

Even that is a bit tenuous, considering it was a live fire excercise.

A police officer that kills a suspect in the line of duty (a gunman in a middle america mall for instance) didn't murder  the suspect. He used justifiable force to defend society. Soldiers use that same force to defend the ideology of their governments.<br />

Killing with no justification is murder.<br />

Murder is killing someone.<br />

Like kahla said allied forces are trying to murder the taliban, They screwed up and murdered some canadians instead.<br />
<br />
Use any euphamism you want, they were trying to murder the enemy but screwed up and murdered friends instead.<br />
<br />
If they didnt &quot;murder&quot; them what did they do?  Terminate their mortality? Accidently killed?<br />

<br />
Our soldiers however are killing enemy forces with moral justification and backing of the people they represent.<br />
<br />
They are legally allowed to kill Taliban because the Taliban and their allies were illegally trying to kill us.<br />
<br />
More over the accidental death of the Canadians is just that.. accidental.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone will be held accountable and demoted/courtmarshalled over this so yes despite the unintentional killing of allies a price will be paid for the ones who were negligent.<br />

At any rate it still doesn't change the fact that you are able to type and say these clearly wrong things due in large part to people like those pilots or those Canadian ground pounders who died.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/04/18/afghanistan.canada/index.html<br />
<br />
The F16 pilots thought they were fired upon<br />
They communicated this<br />
They were advised to mark the location<br />
They returned and did so<br />
They thought they were being fired upon again and asked permission to fire back<br />
They were denied permission except if they felt they needed to defend themselves.<br />
They felt they needed to defend themselves<br />
The pilot dropped a 500lb laser guided bomb onto allied troops <br />
<br />
Some other facts:<br />
It was 1:30AM in the morning, so Visual ID of the ground troops was out of the question<br />
The area was a &quot;recognized training area&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
When you deal with an opponent that fights in an unconventional manner (read - no solid battle lines anywhere), no location can be considered clear and safe. This is one of the objectives of terrorism.<br />
<br />
I'm live in Canada, and this was really sad, because the Company is based about 3hrs from where I live. What made me cringe was hearing a 'sound bite' of a US forces guy saying &quot;It's dangerous out here. We play with stuff that kills people&quot;.  I don't believe for a minute he meant it to sound callous, but when his comments were reduced to a 3 second clip, that sounded terrible. I hate it when the media does that, especially since I'm sure the family of these men heard that several times.<br />
<br />
This is a war.  We will lose people. If we didn't understand that this isn't like a movie, we will be forced to the longer it goes on. Some people in the world live in this type of situation everyday (I grew up in something like this). These people sacrificed their lives so we don't have to even if it was a friendly fire incident. It's a sad day for a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

It's terribly sad, but as I understand, the Canadians are no more blaming the US than we would blame ourselves if the casualties were American.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So a pilot is flying home, thinks hes taking ground fire.  THERE WAS NO MISSCOMUNICATION. He asked whoever you ask if he could return fire and they said NO. You are over a training area.  He then saw fire again and disobeyed his orders, dropping the bomb.<br />
<br />
I dont know much about planes or guns, but it seems to me pretty unlikely ground fire would hurt an f-16 if it could hit it.<br />
<br />
I think i remember something after the gulf war where a reporter asked a general why he thought we didnt lose many planes. Was are radar supperior, were are pilots all aces, were the iraqi weapons just not good.<br />

Well the sky is big, the planes are small, and the bullets are even smaller, making for a very small chance a bullet and a plane will be in the same place at the same time&quot;<br />
<br />
Are you serious?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
It was a murder.  Also had willful neglegences and all that other stuff you guys were talking about (not that it matters was murder without it).<br />
<br />
As for &quot;oh well if the military wasnt out doing all this stuff then you wouldnt be free simas, etc etc&quot;  that does not make it right.<br />
<br />
If our country hadnt murdered (yes murdered) the indians would we have our land, our freedom right now?  Does that make it right?  Does that make it not murder?<br />
<br />
If our country hadnt supplied the taliban with weapons, would we be in this situation? Maybe, maybe not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiphro</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, do you know exactly how fragile a fighter plane is?<br />
One small piece of metal (bullet) moving VERY rapidly through an engine or (God forbid) the ****pit could destroy the entire plane and/or kill the people in it.  Having a plane get 'shot up' with no consequences generally happens only in movies and video games.<br />
<br />
Your 'big sky theory' is assinine.  If bullets and planes were random objects, you might have a case.  But when the bullets are being aimed at the planes your theory is worthless.  That's like saying: &quot;The desk is much larger than the paper and the tip of the pen is very small.  It's just a coincidence that these words appeared on the paper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, it is your simplistic definition of &quot;murder&quot; that is getting you in trouble.  There are different words for different things, use them.  Using the wrong word to describe something causes confusion.  If you choose to say that the ending of every human life at the hand of another human is &quot;murder&quot; then you are using the wrong word.<br />
<br />
A patient dies during surgery.  The actual cause of death is trauma inflicted by another person (the surgeon).  Did the surgeon 'murder' the patient?<br />
<br />
A small child runs out into traffic.  A driver swerves to avoid the child but instead hits another car and kills a passenger.  Did the swerving driver 'murder' the passenger?<br />
<br />
In both cases, the deaths were the result of another's concious actions.  In neither case would the person whose actions caused the death be accused of &quot;murder&quot;.  People died and it was tragic.  Their deaths were caused by another's actions and it is also tragic.  It is not murder.</div></div><hr />

So a pilot is flying home, thinks hes taking ground fire.  THERE WAS NO MISSCOMUNICATION. He asked whoever you ask if he could return fire and they said NO. You are over a training area.  He then saw fire again and disobeyed his orders, dropping the bomb.<br />
If you're going to tell the story, at least tell it right.<br />
During the subsequent fly-over, the pilot requested permission to drop his weapon. A Pentagon official said his superiors denied permission unless the pilot felt he would be acting in self-defense. At that point, the pilot again reported ground fire, invoked his right of self-defense and dropped the laser-guided bomb, military officials said. <br />
He did not disobey orders. He had orders only to fire if he felt he needed to do so in self-defense. He felt he did, so he fired.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can call that murder anymore than you can say any person who causes an accidental death murdered someone. When a plane crashes due to pilot error, is that murder? When a bee stings someone and they go into shock and die, did the bee murder that person?<br />
<br />
Not all killing is murder.</div></div><hr />

You are once again over simplifying a situation that you have no training in and no concept of. <br />
<br />
As for your use of the word murder and your brush off of the opposition to your use as simply semantics.  Semantics are very important and the reason that spoken English is eroding in the United States today.  Words have meanings and when you use the wrong words to mean other things then you break down the very language that you use. Please use the right word for the right topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure that is relevant for this discussion.  If Simas is so against killing that he wants to play semantics with the word murder, fine.  But don't use non-truths to do it.  All reports at this point indicate that the pilots thought they were under enemy fire, asked for permission to defend themselves, GOT permission from their command to defend themselves and then did so.  It was NOT a case of them disobeying orders.</div></div><hr />

Not sure about the ground fire and the plane, ill ask a pilot in my family.<br />
<br />
What i read said the pilot asked radio to command of whatever pilots radio too and said he thought he was taking fire and wanted to drop his bomb, control then said no your over a training area, the pilot then thought he was taking a fire again, and dropped the bomb in self defense, i never read they told him he could drop it if he felt like it was self defense<br />
<br />
This thread has nothing to do with marxism or communism<br />
<br />
I agree not all killing in murder, if someone just jumps in front of your car then you did not murder them, if you drop a bomb on someone they are murdered, in this case the pilot did not murder who he intended too, but he was attempting to murder someone, just got the wrong one</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only ask cause your grasp on the proper concepts and meanings of words is extremely simplistic almost to the point that I would have to think that you either<br />
<br />
A) failed English horribly in school<br />
B) are not a native English speaking person.<br />
<br />
If its B then might I suggest you go relook up a more suitable word cause your current definitions are SO far off the mark that you got normally long standing rivals on this board ALL agreeing in saying that you have no clue what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
Its pretty bad when you got me, Nitefox, Aizle, Myrea, Smoki, Kullaas, Locz, Jaraxel, and several others ALL telling you that you are WAY off base on your usage of the word.<br />
<br />
That list of folks normally can't agree on what color the sky is but we are all agreeing that you are WRONG in your usage of that word.<br />
<br />
So unless you can give some moral justification for your stance that:<br />
<br />
wartime killing = murder <br />
<br />
then I suggest dropping this as you quickly losing any sort of credibility for debate and are quickly getting tagged as a troll to be ignored.<br />
<br />
I'm normally pretty tolerant of people and have NO, NONE, ZIP, NADA, people on ignore but you are about to make the list.<br />
<br />
I'm essentially offering you the chance to back up your use of the terminology but I somehow expect you to throw up more nonsense and downright falsehoods to aid you in the distortion of the English language.<br />
<br />
(btw Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, and a host of other dictators and generally considered evil people used to distort their language as well to push their &quot;points&quot;)</div></div><hr />

Murder has everything to do with &quot;illegal&quot; killing, and *nothing* to do with &quot;immoral&quot; killing.  You may think killing in war is immoral, but by the definition of the word, it is not murder.  Semantics, pure and simple.</div></div><hr />

I don't think most people are saying that in general soldiers are morally superior. What I see, boiled down to it's most salient points are:<br />
<br />
1) We who do not fight owe a debt to those who do fight that our lives, families and our way of life will remain secure.<br />
<br />
2) The killing that a soldier does on war is not the same as killing outside of war.<br />
<br />
3) Those who make tough decisions under fire deserve the respect of those who have never been in a combat situation, and a little leeway for being human. Other than doctors or emergency workers, their decisions have a lot more weight to them than what most of us deal with daily.<br />
<br />
4) Those who die in combat deserve our respect because unlike some guy dying in the car on his way to work, the soldier actually knew his life could be put on the line in a very real way, and chose to go into the situation anyway.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make them better people than us. It just means that we do owe them respect for the job they are doing. I can have respect for one aspect of what a person does without feeling that on the whole that person is better than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kullaas soldiers are not any more or LESS superior to the average citizen.<br />
<br />
However soldiers do a job that is generally underpaid(the average family living on a E5 or lower salary is living below the poverty line) underappreciated(dubbing soldiers as baby killers and murderers when they nothing even remotely close is inexcusable) and in general taken for granted(when was the last time you did something for our servicemen?  there are plenty of programs such as the one my church ran that simply gathered candy, razors, magazines, books and shaving cream, and other home niceties and shipped them to an aircraft carrier over near Afganistan) while in exchange they offer up something most people who have &quot;normal&quot; jobs don't have to... their lives.<br />
<br />
Sorry but its not bloody likely that I'm going to be sitting here working on my computer and get killed by it.  Or you at school at your desk (even with school violence its a far cry behind the odds of death in wartime) and yet some people who enjoy the benefits that these soldiers risk their lives for turn around and take EVERY oppurtunity to berate and put down our service men and women.<br />
<br />
Like I said before there is a difference between holding your military accountable and making it sure it works for the people vs beating your military up for a job they perform selflessly on our behalf.<br />
<br />
I respect my military greatly and part of that respect is giving credit where credit is due (something we as a nation don't do enough of) and holding accountable that same military when they screw up (but doing so with the intention of correcting the problem not using it as an excuse to cause harm to the people who serve).  <br />
<br />
In otherwords we as citizens are in a sense the ultimate officers and its our job through our congress and our choice for president to make sure our defenders are properly cared for and prepared to fight for our defense.</div></div><hr />

Hey Kullaas and Nitefox and folks from now on what we used to call &quot;red&quot; is now called &quot;car&quot; and what used to be &quot;car&quot; is now &quot;salad&quot;.  That ok with you guys?  I know its going to be a tough job rewriting the English language but I'm sure we can handle it.  I think if we cooperate in doing this we may make sense to Simas here.  :D<br />
<br />
However we are not currently fighting terrorists, we are fighting a country. Now i will agree i dont know how we fight terrorists <br />
<br />
I thought the definition of goals for this campaign were pretty straightforward AND Bush was gracious enough to give countries PLENTY of time to comply with these demands.<br />
<br />
If you provide infrastructure or support to terrorists then you subject yourself to the same punishments as we will take out on the terrorists.  The leaders of those countries if they value their citizens (of which most leaders don't) will make sure they are not hiding or supporting terrorists or else they will soon be hearing a knock on their door from US forces.<br />
<br />
Somalia and its crime lords err sorry they call em Warlord leaders there are haarboring terrorists and other infrastructure related to terrorist organizations.  So we will go in there and tear them down like we did in Afganistan and hopefully in the process remove these long standing warlords and replace them with a friendly government to our interests like we are doing Afganistan.<br />
<br />
If a country DOESN'T want US attention then DON'T HARBOR OR SUPPORT TERRORISTS.  This isn't that hard to do.<br />

 It looks like you never excelled in English or attempted to find a deffinition of murder.<br />
 Murder/ n (meaning a noun) 1: the crime (meaning an illegal act) of unlawfully killing a person esp with malice afterthought.<br />
<br />
 So how does that make Capital Punishment or war fare murder? Both are made legal by our government.<br />
<br />
 As for you pity. I don't want it. Save it for yourself. I do what I do, because some can not do it.<br />
<br />
 As for coming to an agreement with a government, person or persons who attack our country, what the hell are you talking about? I'm guessing you want us to say... &quot; Please don't bomb us again, you might make us upset enough to discuss what happened.&quot;<br />
 If that's your oppinon then ****! Damn! you're the type who would sell us out to terrorist, Communist and Fascist because you don't want any trouble.<br />
 Back to your &quot;mastery of English... It's Somalia, not Samalia.<br />
 As for you thoughts about us not being there. What the hell do you know about  the world? Somalia is a safe haven for Terrorists. Those who want to kill Americans.<br />
 and how was BhD(Blackhawk down) propaganda? that movie showed the U.S. getting it's ass handed to it. Oh wait. Maybe that's the propaganda you want.<br />
 Crap like this pisses me off! How can one who has not lived long enough, know enough to tell us how the real world acts? Before you judge me and my &quot;murder&quot; of enemies of my country. Then get some stroke and try, just try to walk a mile in my jump boots.<br />

You have found merit in his ideas??<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I think what they are pointing out is that he is creating his own deffinitions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its like Windows trying to talk to Linux they just don't do it very well without some third party help.<br />
<br />
So if Simas is willing to use the agreed upon language (in this case English) I'd be glad to take him on in a debate.<br />
<br />
OR if he believes his definition is correct for the words he is misusing then convince the rest of us WHY his definition is correct.<br />
<br />
So far he has failed miserably at doing that and has even tried to promote falsehoods and downright lies as valid arguments.<br />
<br />
I've specifically in a post above INVITED him to prove to me why his view of wartime killing in ANY form should be called murder and he has completely ignored that invitation... well I'll give him a benefit of a doubt.. if he hasn't ignored it he has failed SO miserably that nobody is able to understand him at all which means that unless he is able to change his communication patterns that everyone will dismiss his ideals as nothing.</div></div><hr />
