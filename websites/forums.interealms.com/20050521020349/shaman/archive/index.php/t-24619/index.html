<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I cant say much about the US merge of server, but i know that it is on work for the european now. <br />
The big changes was made a month ago with a long patch. <br />
Mobs toughter and with a little higher AI. <br />
Mobs that move on groups.<br />
Added and changed all the item for the technics and changed thenumbers of reciples for formula.<br />
Lots more plot ready to built.<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
Still flaws are that 2 level 50 can easy kill a level 75 mob if the players are skilled (or even in solo). <br />
Not much velocity on solving tech problems.<br />
Lag problems on groups hunts (dragon cause to lag a lot for my experiences)<br />
The possibility to change class and castomize the pg is greate, but it didnt help much the work-in-group job, i find a lot of ppl soloing or moving only with close friend and ppl that is not skilled to play his class (most healers)<br />
<br />
Not a bad game, i think it is a good step up for the programmer of EQ and EQ2 cause i see now that i try to come back in Eq that much little thinks cames from Hz or after it.<br />
Hope they can learn as much as they can to give us a greate EQ2!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like hz, it's a nice change of pace from eq/ao and the tradeskills are nice enough, only have low level chars though, highest is lvl 12 warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I quited a month ago. <br />
Was a lot of frustration on the Unity server find a mob to kill.<br />
Probably the community is growing a bit, cause i left after they selled the plots. <br />
Greate tradeskills, but sometimes i want to see some blood ^__^</div></div><hr />
