<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this not any kind of uber mob but it was an accomplishment for me.  Not long ago I soloed a 55 or higher bat in Maiden's Eye without any outside buffs and not many of my own buffs (Tuna buff faded during the battle).  I didn't get the best of screenshots, just one of it still alive and low on health and 2 of it dead.  Dogdog is alive and well I'm proud to report.  Also this was without epic and JBB (iksar).  My magelo is up to date if you are wanting to know about my gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe , awesome job dude , anytime your soloing mobs higher then you its a significant accomplishment. YOu definetly deserve a pat on the back. Congratz =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've killed just about every dragon feasibly possible in WW, but this reminds me of when I was a 30-something in OT and had an epic battle, similar to yours, to take out one of those level 40 tigers.  Those were good times.  Grats to you :)  Everything is relative.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grats :) it only gets better for here :)<br />
<br />
On a side note I read some of the posts in the link from that necro. I have but one thing to say.. well question actully..<br />
How much skill dose it take to chain rune yourself while a pet beats something down?<br />
(holds his hand up and looks at the empti palm)<br />
<br />
The funny part is they even admited that it took about 80% luck and 7 or so tries just to get 1 kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well done, very big accomplishemnt considering yeldima (WW dragon) is easier then these!</div></div><hr />
