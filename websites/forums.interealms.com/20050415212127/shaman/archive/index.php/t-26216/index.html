<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently, I have my epic in an open inventory slot, and equip my TA in primary.<br />
<br />
I have a custom UI that lets me click my epic from inventory to use the hot, and then I have a hotkey button 1 to click my TA.<br />
<br />
From comments in the Tacvi thread, it seems like folks are having success using the Bandolier to use both.  Well, I tried it tonight, and well it seems to work ok, I want to make it better.  <br />
<br />
Namely, I don't like having to use up two hotbuttons to switch back and forth.  <br />
<br />
What I'd like to do, is to have one button that does something like this:<br />
<br />
/Activate Bandolier TA<br />
Casts the TA<br />
/pause for TA cast<br />
/Activate Bandolier Epic<br />
<br />
Since I normally alternate nihili and TA, I'm not too concerned by a delay in reusing the TA, although that might be annoying at times.<br />
<br />
What I can't figure out, is the &quot;Cast the TA&quot; part of the hotbutton.  How do you refer to either A) the primary slot or B) the primary slot dragged to a hotbutton, from a hotbutton.<br />
<br />
I was thinking you should be able to refer to a hotbutton on any key bank, from a hotbutton, but for the life of me couldn't figure out how.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I really like the Bandolier thingy they did. Only problem I have with it is it goes away after you zone and gotta remember to hit that silly B key to bring it back up again. Other than that, I find it very helpful tossing back and forth between epic and the TA. /shrug thats just me though.</div></div><hr />

You can hot-key each of your Bandolier set-ups, and stick em on your regular hot-key pallette. I use mine all the time. Bandolier has made me totally rearrange my hot keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there is no way to put a clicky into a hot key<br />
Are you certain of this? I can drag the slot itself to my hotkey board, and hit whatever &quot;number&quot; that slot is and cast the effect, so I assume its also macroable. What is the syntax for putting your hot-keys into macros? Like &quot;/cast 1&quot; casts the first spell in your spell-pallette, what is the shortcut for &quot;Hot Key button 1&quot;? Thats the key to putting it all in one macro. I will work on it and get back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could do it at one point long ago, but it was based on the hotkey slot.  I distinctly remember doing it with my JBB a long time ago for some reason.  You  might try looking at the monk boards, they might have done something there with their epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You cannot click hotkeys with a typed command.  Otherwise you could imbed macros for a looping function, which is precisely what they wanted to avoid allowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah if you could macro hot keys you could loop them infinite times.  Therefore not able to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well instead of referring to a hotkey from a hotkey, is there a way to right click a primary slot with a hotkey?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well instead of referring to a hotkey from a hotkey, is there a way to right click a primary slot with a hotkey?<br />
<br />
Just drag &amp; drop primary slot from inventory to hot button page, goes with all slots that you have clickys on.<br />
<br />
I have 3 hot buttons for swiching beteen different clickys in primary slot and a 4th button where i use the clicky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You cannot set up a macro to click any item in inventory or on your person.  All you can hope to do to make it quick would be something along the lines of making hotbank 2 have slot 1 as TA bandolier, slot 2 as clicking the primary slot, and slot 3 as the 1.5 bandolier.<br />
<br />
  In this case, you could click the TA by entering the following quick key commands:<br />
<br />
SHIFT + 2, 1, 2, (wait), 3, SHIFT + 1<br />
<br />
  That is about the quickest way you can set up the bandolier to run a weapon swap and TA click and then return to normal operations (or ideally, have 3 hotkey slots you can use on your normal setup, then the &quot;SHIFT +&quot; steps aren't needed at all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can script it, as Caanus says, with after-market macroing tools. Remember, UNATTENDED macroing is against the EULA. If I get a TA someday, I'll have to get my nostromo back from my buddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, well I think I'm on to something from the eqgui site.  I have a mini clicky set add on gui feature, and I think I can tie a hotkey to those mini clicky windows (one of which has my primary slot in the clicky window).  <br />
<br />
If I figure it out I'll post it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">after i set up the hot keys, and tried to use them, well...they dont switch my bandolier items the way they are supposed to at all...so i too click B and manually switch (no biggie really, just a PITA) still like the feature!<br />
<br />
hate that my hot keys dont work as intended tho=/</div></div><hr />
