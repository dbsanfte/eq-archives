<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well been doing 59 in fungus grove.  Did some ae with 2 rogues and me and boxed cleric.  Then soloed and duoed some within a 4 hour period.  I made about 3 blues in 4 hours.  I have read that that is a bit slow.  Should be 1 blue an hour.  That is also with c3.  Is katta better or worse or am I not killing fast enough? Any info would be great.</div></div><hr />

In FG doin a patch I usually get a 2 pull and rest single pulls. But never more than 2. You just have to be smart and judge the distance between the shrooms and slowly pick patch apart. Hardest part is keeping your pet back till they get to you.<br />
<br />
I let pet tank one (pet is kragg,regrowth, and celrity only)...and I take the other...BoN, Ebolt,Epic, melee,reapply BoN=dead shroom..<br />
Now for the one pet is tanking....epic BoN Ebolt melee=dead shroom.<br />
<br />
Avg little over a blue an hour here ;) (with KEI mind you)  Katta is 1 blue per hour diligent killing<br />
<br />
Seeing as im on TZ, in FG solo at times I get run out. So I can't get good exp time in there I want. In Katta I'm fairly undisturbed at my hunting spot.<br />
