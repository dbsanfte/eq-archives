Wow.  I think they're over 70 servers now.  Of course, atm, half of them don't function :/  But assuming they fix these server issues, things are only going to go up... and it still hasn't been released in Europe or Asia, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup, half the servers are down for maintenance.  The other half are experiencing lag due not to load, but database issues.  Guess the stress test was not designed properly.  You know what they say about &quot;The best laid plans......&quot;  Rookies.  :)</div></div><hr />

I tried to play the open beta, had problems downloading the client, couldn't install the game, spent 5 hours screwing around with my comp, gave up deleted anything to do with WoW, bought EQ2 and am thoroughly enjoying the whole thing.<br />
<br />
That said, i'm sure things will settle and the game will be a blast for those that play it.</div></div><hr />

Haha, this post makes me laugh. I am not even sure why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haha, this post makes me laugh. I am not even sure why.<br />
Because it confirms the fears of people who don't want to play WoW because of the type of player Blizzard attracts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well, personally, I see little to no lag. it really depends on what server you're on. server was down for a few hours while i was at work yesterday, but i've played.....~14 hours now or so, with maybe 30 mins of that being laggy. I'm lvl 17, done an instance, done a looot of quests, and very happy with the way the game is running, just pick a low pop server. easy as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, as of Thanksgiving morning, all except 4 servers are up and running great.  I got back on my Eastern server and the performance is even better than at launch.  Whatever they did last night seems to have worked.<br />
<br />
So, chalk one up to experience.  30 more servers now online, over 70 total and over 250,000 copies sold and 200,000 accounts created on the first day.  500K accounts, yup, by the end of the first month, no doubt.  Wait until the europeans and asians get their hands on this thing, it's going to be crazy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">then why bother clicking on the post=pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">then why bother clicking on the post=pp<br />
<br />
I have to agree mcroc. I've seen lots and lots of posts by Valsuvious that I didnt care about AND I didnt respond to.<br />
<br />
On a slightly more serious note the servers are running much better today, so Blizzard might be able to ride off the storm because the game sure is addictive - once you get to play it.<br />
<br />
I was in beta where I tried to concentrate on one character to see what the mid-to-highend game was like. But now that its officially released I have been trying a lot more classes and tradeskills and so far all of them seem fantastic.<br />
<br />
That 200k number might seem high now but I wouldnt be surprised if they reach 2000k when its a true worldwide release. Its just that good.</div></div><hr />

You know what then stay in EQ and rott there. Wow is better in every single way concievable. <br />
And btw @ss was not written that way because i enjoy the kiddie bnet l33t speak. I wrote it cause this forum is to an-l about screening &quot;bad language&quot; and all you get is 3 stars like this ***.<br />
<br />
But hey I am just a 13 year old Bnet kiddie who will gank you while yellling kekekekekeekekekekekekekeke. <br />
<br />
So to conclude rock on man stay in EQ. I'll have my fun in wow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">enh... that's some pretty sad prejudice (not that I disagree with it ala the b.net kiddie stereotype).  But from all I have seen Soulstorm is simply enthusiastic about the game (as am I) and there is nothing wrong with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feh. We told them about the database issues. They didn't listen, apparantly.<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think that Blizzard turned a blind eye to that problem?  Go back and take a look at the information at the start of the thread about the gangbuster numbers for sales and account creation.  The biggest mistake they made was in having so few servers up initially.  They completely underestimated how the game would do - that I can't fathom because I knew it would be a crushing success on release.  As well they were clearly prepared to need a LOT more given that they have already roughly doubled the number of servers since initial release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yep and now the total amount of servers has been increased to 88 :D<br />
88 servers on day 2 of a MMORPG this has got to be a record. Now if i can get this horrible Chemistry test over with I can play again. I shall have my revenge this weekend :)<br />
<br />
I am still shocked as to why Blizzard &quot;underestimated&quot; the influx of players on release. Meh it's all good the lag has been fixed for the most part. Glad i was unable to play for the most part due to school and tests :)<br />

Putting others down is only bad if the ones being put down share your opinions, otherwise they are thouroughly deserving trolls.<br />
<br />
It's all relative of course. There are only grey hats, no white or black ones. Val only wears a black hat because he doesnt share your opinion. You think you wear a white hat because Val doesnt share your opinion. But maybe its the other way around (and from another point of view it is)<br />
<br />
I think the point Val was making is that this is fundamentally an EQ board, and in that context evangelical zeal on the part of people from other games is inappropriate.</div></div><hr />

That's a little sanctimonious, considering this is the &quot;Other Games&quot; section.</div></div><hr />

Nice of you to speak for Val - I hope he agrees.  I wonder why he's hanging out on the WoW forum of the Other Games section?  You're able to understand the concept of  &quot;other games&quot; on an EQ board, right? Just in case you don't, it means &quot;games other than EQ.&quot;  WoW would fall into this category.  Ironically, even EQ II does.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Perhaps Val isn't as pompous as your post seems to make you.</div></div><hr />

This post was started in the General Forum and was moved here by the mods.</div></div><hr />

So why are you slumming it here ?<br />

<br />
Yeah, this was exactly what happened.  Even though that didn't stop a few people from giving me neg rep for posting it when this thread is &quot;obviously&quot; in the right section.<br />
<br />
Basically my reason for posting it is just like mentioned.  It was put into the EQ general section and I don't think that WoW/EQ2 stuff should be posted on their at all.  Why?  Because it's not EQ.  I don't come into the EVERQUEST boards to read about other games, I come onto them to read about EQ, and I come to the Crucible to specifically read about EQ Shaman related topics, not about how WoW is doing on their first day, week/month/year whatever.<br />
<br />
I'm only in this thread as it is now cause that's where this thread was moved to.<br />
<br />
Seriously, can we keep the WoW and EQ2 stuff in their own section.  There are a lot of people out there that really don't care how those games are doing and just want to continue playing EQ.  Personally, I would love to play those new games, however EQ has taken so much out of my life as it is, I feel it's in my best interest to not persue another one.  I think it's time to get back to being a normal person again and not having my life dictated by when we are raiding and when we aren't :(</div></div><hr />
