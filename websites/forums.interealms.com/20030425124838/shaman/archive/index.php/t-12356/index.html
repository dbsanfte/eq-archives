<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tearlag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am new at Alchemy and I was curious about a gate potion that brings you back to your bind point.  Is there one and if so what is the name of it?  My friend said it is simply called &quot;Gate Potion&quot; but I can't find it on any of the charts.  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reeannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes there is a gate to bind potion.  You need to combine 3 helitropes per charge.  I think the triv level is somewhere aroun 176 or something like that. <br />
<br />
There are also new illusion potions.  These are made by taking meat(parts) of any race (i.e., troll, orge, erudite, etc) and combine with Wurmwood, which is found in the Gulf of Gunthak on a vendor.  The cost for Wurmwood for me with high charisma is about 78p.  The parts can be found in a village off the cave from the beach of Gunthak (your first left as you enter the cave)</div></div><hr />
