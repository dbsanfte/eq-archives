UPDATE<br />
<br />
Upgraded Q, 350 hp/tick for 234 mana (6hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Double YES!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">haha they turned the disease DOT into a heal as someone suggested. 1550 is still kinda low if you ask me, I would think 1800-2000 would be more along the lines of what we need. And now BoT is 420 a tick like the previous ratio would have supported. Interesting, I wonder if it's enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, they ARE listening.  Dot was useless, so it's gone.  We needed more healing, so we get same ratio upgrade to Q with 40% more healing and a 19% increase to the spot heal.<br />

I'll take that any day of the week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guess one needs to ask for 3k heals in order to get a 1.8k heal. <br />
We ask for 1800 and get a 1550. Feels like being in a bazaar and bargain for every damn upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm extremely happy.  1550 could be more like 1800, but if this goes live, I can't say I'll be dissapointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It does seem a little low to me too, but at least its a step in the right direction (was hoping for at least 1700).<br />
<br />
Deffinatly better than the dot!<br />
<br />
Of course it will be quite soem time till I see it :) but things are lookign better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1550 is a bit low, but the 2 heals together is decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We just have to keep up our &quot;whining&quot; - as a first step this is pretty decent.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Decent, but insufficient to solve the problems we outlined.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it's better than before obviously, but not enough is not enough.  <br />
<br />
I guess they are figuring with AA maxed you'll hit about 1800 with full focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Boy i'm excited.  The problem for me is i'm not going to buy GoD to get upgrades in my heals.

<br />
probably more like 2k with max aa and focus yes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It is very encouraging to see SOE follow through in responding to our concerns.  The change to Q is especially nice, so that all shaman will get a boost.  It will be a very long time before I see any GoD spells.<br />
<br />
I do agree 1550 is a bit low, was really hoping for 1800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1550 with maxxed healing AAs of 19% is ~1844.  Keep the same cast time as Tnarg's and it's exactly what I personally was hoping for.  Same with our HoT changes.  We needed a boost, not an overhaul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm flabbergasted.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that I completely gave up hope of the shaman class receiving any real attention.  These changes are right on the money, and good.  (while 1550 may not be 1700, its still alot closer to 1700 than 1300).<br />
<br />
I'm very impressed.  If it goes live, I'll feel alot better about my shaman.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just noticed Q was also changed.  Interesting.  I'm not sure that it was really necessary, but I'm not against it (obviously).  I guess that kind of makes it an upgrade to torpor (aside from the negative effects being removed thing).  Good stuff.  I'm excited.  Now push it live! :)<br />
<br />
EDIT #2:  With all healing AA and a healing focus such as the ornate arms, you're looking at a maximum heal of 2200 (roughly).  Thats a significant amount.<br />
<br />
For those saying that they shouldn't have to get GoD to get the heal...  I don't think that makes much sense.  GoD is where the shaman are having all the problems.  I don't want to be the main healer in a hard ldon, I want to be the backup healer in a GoD trial.  Even so, the change to Q is nice for those without GoD.  If you are keeping Q up on a tank constantly, that extra couple hundred hp per cast might be noticeable.  <br />
<br />
All in all, good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">With max AA and a good focus, it should be over 2K quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Awesome...<br />
<br />
Glad to see the devs listening.   If these changes go live, I can say that I personally would be pleased.<br />
<br />
I thing the 1550 heal could be a bit higher, but BoT and Quies changes defenetly make me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This is alot of what you guys have been asking for, with aa's this should really help. Glad to see you finally get get a little something.<br />
BTW what does everyone else get? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Amazing,  thanks to all you crucible posters who have begged, pleaded, yelled and outlined in fine detail our problems for the devs to see.  This time the change is good!</div></div><hr />

The problem with this is the assumption that everyone has max AA and focus...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have to believe that the devs are looking at the &quot;total&quot; picture.  The increased heal and increases to the Hot combine to be a substantial increase overall.  I am especially excited about the upgrade to Q, since I will not be able to get BoT for some time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I agree that the instant heal is a bit low.  Add another 300-400 to it, and it'll be good.  The HoT spell changes are great, especially for the mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I still think that a new AA for GoD would help all Priests healers .  <br />
<br />
AA - Mastery Healing Adept - add something like 10% more direct heal per level (Not CH) at 2/4/6 rates that continue to stack with Focus items (30% Total).   <br />
<br />
By the time you have invested the time for all the AA's required to get to something like Mastery Healing Adept AA ... you deserve to see a sizable impact on your direct heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think with the changes between BoT and the addition of the new direct heal *might* be sufficient enough.<br />
<br />
It certainly makes a difference though, that can't be denied. Hopefully these can be tweaked and ready soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I believe that BoT is the reward from the turn-in for the rune drop from Kod'Taz bosses...  Not something your average shaman will be seeing. :\<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm pretty happy about the changes.  Hopefully the blast heal will get tweaked up a little, but I can live with it as-is, too.  At least I'm getting far enough in my AA progression that I can consider getting some of the healing AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kradek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Does anyone even have BoT yet?  If so where did you get it so i can start farming it.<br />
<br />
BoT is a result of the turn in from a stone that drops from boss mobs in Kod'Taz.  Have had it for a couple weeks and as expected, not really impressed.<br />

EDIT: Done: http://morelight.org/samanna/focus.html#healing<br />
<br />
Note, that's a 2k average heal for Daluda's with AHA3 and IH4, and 4310 for a max crit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Personally I'd still like something a little closer to 1750hps healed for 540 mana or something in that range. Altho I do have to admit that it does work out to about the same 20% improvement that clerics and druids got on thier heals post rescent improvement. Altho since more and more mobs are mitigating more and dps is his generally higher with lower hps in GoD we could use a bit of a bump up in healing over just the standard tune up to compensate for weakening of other areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Litgruv...<br />
Although i most times agree with what you post with this 1 statement you are basically delivering a smack in the face to the whole argument of why shaman need a direct heal.<br />
<br />
I have read countless times Shaman on this board and on the cleric board and the EQLive board saying that the only Shaman who really need a new heal are the ones past Time and countless AA's etc who want to be able to hold a group together in GoD trials.<br />
<br />
If you are at this stage of the game where you NEED (notice need not would like) and you havent got max aa's and a focus then there is something wrong and perhaps you dont NEED the heal.<br />
<br />
On this note perhaps that is why SoE have made it only 1550 base as Shaman have been saying they need an 1800 pt heal which this is with max aa and focus and SoE believe that anyone at the stage of the game where they need an 1800 heal will have max aa and focus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Not bad,<br />
<br />
A little shy of the number most have bandied about but closer. <br />
<br />
Hell keep it up and let it go live in a timely manner. And have Spirit call 4-5 actually fixed, and fix the description of Call of the aincents.<br />
<br />
And I might grudgenly stop busting yalls chops. Maybe. <br />
<br />
But don't hold your breath. Cause there is alot that could be done for the class to make it fun again. Rather than the required stuff to catch us up to viable. <br />
<br />
Like the application of combat effects to focus and avatar rather than outdated and frankly pinned against the stat cap Stat buffs. <br />
<br />
Like the extra mana cost or efficancy lack on our spells to make canna less of a help than a monky button mashing contest. <br />
<br />
Like how a gnome cleric can bash better than a 800 pound gorilla of an ogre. <br />

Still I will give you just due. Thank you for listening. And Keep it up it is a refreshing change of pace.<br />

<br />
Sorry I didn’t post about this earlier. I was waiting for the numbers to be on test server, which I thought was going to be a lot sooner then today, but anyway…<br />
<br />
The new spell parameters should put shaman heals on the same ratio that they were for Planes of Power spells:<br />
<br />
Supernal Light: 2750<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 1750<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 1300<br />
<br />
Comparatively for HP/Second:<br />
Supernal Light:  100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
With the new Daluda:<br />
<br />
Holy Light: 3275<br />
Sylvan Infusion: 2100<br />
Daluda’s Mending: 1550<br />
<br />
for the same comparative HP/second as the PoP heals:<br />
Supernal Light:  100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Daluda's Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
Likewise, the Quiescence and Breath of Trushar changes should make the HoT balance equal from PoP to Gates between Clerics and Shaman.<br />
<br />
Still looking at the slow mitigation concerns in several gates zones.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry I didn’t get this info out earlier, and for letting the bad mana cost on Breath of Trushar go live.  There’s really no excuse for that blunder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">That assumption is stupid. We never asked for a 1800 post AA, post healing focus. We asked for a 1800 base heal.<br />
<br />
It's the usual bargaining from SoE. You ask for something and they don't give in, because that would be admitting that we know better than them what is needed. Giving us a 1550 heal isn't even 20% better than Tnarg's and it makes sure that Clerics(for instance) come out and say &quot;See, Shamans whined and got what they asked for!&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's a shame really. We asked for reasonable things, stop treating with us, just because you want to be stubborn. And of course from every good suggestion(including mine) you chose the easiest and just copied Tnarg's and added a little more than 19%.<br />
<br />
Things like these show me that they don't listen to the voice of reason. They don't look at numbers. They do just enough to shut up enough people and judging by the feedback from us in this thread, you bet this spell will see no upgrade. <br />
<br />
We need to stand by our point, instead of being happy with what we get, because we think they listened or care. The majority asked for a 1800 heal, they gave us a 1550 which is 250 points above Tnarg's and 250 points less than our request- Classy.<br />
<br />
Don't be satisfied so easily, people. We are NOT asking for something unreasonable, we are asking for a heal that will still be 300 points worse than the Druid heal.<br />
<br />
If you kudos them now, we are done.<br />
<br />
Edit: Started this post before Rytan posted, so I am going to add something.<br />
You're right, Rytan. Our heals will now be just as balanced as they were pre-GoD and in part this board is resonsible for making it sound as if the problems with healing only exist since GoD, when in reality they were already present in PoP and LDoN. <br />
Ever since the Slow mitigation was introduced, our heals were not effective enough, obviously, you being the spell guy, you will disagree, so I ask you to look at the numbers posted here and take the time to consider if Shaman healing was adequate back in PoP:<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20192<br />
<br />
I'll speak my mind and say they were NOT, thus upgrading our heals so that they match the relative power to Druid and Cleric heals as in PoP, is the wrong approach. <br />
Thanks for posting, but if you read the thread, you will see that this isn't enough and that the assumption that, just because we didn't make a huge stink during PoP, our heals were fine and thus bringing them back to how they scaled to Druid and Cleric heals is sufficient, is false.</div></div><hr />

Yes we didnt get a 1800 base heal but do you really want to be like druids and just another poor mans cleric.<br />
I know druids have good DPS etc but how many times have you seen druids invited into groups because of their dps or evac or bufs etc.99% of the time theyre invited either as back up healer or main healer and nothing else.<br />

While I can appriciate keeping things comparatively the same I do feel at this point that the relative numbers may need some adjusting for shaman in god. The high dps, low hps mobs making quick fights and the increased fequency of slow mitigating mobs and amount they mitigate slow for have left shaman in a relatively weaker position than previous expansions. Improving our heals will help us compensate and contribute more in GoD situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giac,<br />
It looks like Ryan and the devs want to keep the priest healing percentages the same as they were changed to in PoP. Getting the number changed on Daluda's Mending to 1800 would mean that shamans got almost a 40% upgrade on their direct heal while others got 20%, thus requiring all the priest heals to be upgraded to 40% upgrades from the pop spells to keep the other priests from going ape. Either that or the devs come out and say that shaman healing power had, in fact, been shortchanged a bit through the expansions and that they wanted to up it more in this expansion to compensate. A tough proposition either way.<br />
<br />
I agree with our logic on why the 1800 number is an important upgrade and I think the devs seriously consider it and why we are asking for it.<br />
<br />
thanks Rytan for the update as always!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">That assumption is stupid. We never asked for a 1800 post AA, post healing focus. We asked for a 1800 base heal.<br />
<br />
It's the usual bargaining from SoE. You ask for something and they don't give in, because that would be admitting that we know better than them what is needed. Giving us a 1550 heal isn't even 20% better than Tnarg's and it makes sure that Clerics(for instance) come out and say &quot;See, Shamans whined and got what they asked for!&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's a shame really. We asked for reasonable things, stop treating with us, just because you want to be stubborn. And of course from every good suggestion(including mine) you chose the easiest and just copied Tnarg's and added a little more than 19%.<br />
<br />
Things like these show me that they don't listen to the voice of reason. They don't look at numbers. They do just enough to shut up enough people and judging by the feedback from us in this thread, you bet this spell will see no upgrade. <br />

I would normally agree with you on this topic Giac BUT<br />
I did not really want to heal for x amount of HP what i wanted was to be able to be a spot healer in GoD.<br />
Maybe mobs are tuned also and then this is a fine compromise.<br />
Maybe mobs are not tuned and we still can't keep a mob alive after this goes live, then we can always start talking again.<br />
<br />

Edit: Started this post before Rytan posted, so I am going to add something.<br />
You're right, Rytan. Our heals will now be just as balanced as they were pre-GoD and in part this board is resonsible for making it sound as if the problems with healing only exist since GoD, when in reality they were already present in PoP and LDoN. <br />
Ever since the Slow mitigation was introduced, our heals were not effective enough, obviously, you being the spell guy, you will disagree, so I ask you to look at the numbers posted here and take the time to consider if Shaman healing was adequate back in PoP:<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman...?threadid=20192<br />
<br />
I'll speak my mind and say they were NOT, thus upgrading our heals so that they match the relative power to Druid and Cleric heals as in PoP, is the wrong approach. <br />
Thanks for posting, but if you read the thread, you will see that this isn't enough and that the assumption that, just because we didn't make a huge stink during PoP, our heals were fine and thus bringing them back to how they scaled to Druid and Cleric heals is sufficient, is false.</div></div><hr />

It is helpful to see how you went about determining them.  As it stands 1550 still seems too small to me.  I hope that this isn't &quot;your final answer&quot; and you will be open to more improvement to the new direct heal, if necessary.  Most people have estimated it would take a 1700-1800 hps heal to really be able to perform adequately in GoD as a patch healer.  This is a step in the right direct for sure.<br />

<br />
The new spell parameters should put shaman heals on the same ratio that they were for Planes of Power spells:<br />
But one of our main arguments is that the game was changed so that a lot of our abilities are a lot less useful then the used to be. We need more of a healing upgrade then what clerics and druids got.<br />
Our slow healing and slow damage simply does not cut it in the latest expansions. Slow mitigation and fast fights absolutely destroy the entire concept of how shaman used to heal. We need something to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Likewise, the Quiescence and Breath of Trushar changes should make the HoT balance equal from PoP to Gates between Clerics and Shaman.<br />
HoT spells are a lot less of a balance issue then fast heals, given the way those new zones work. 300 or 450 or 800 HPs a tick simply does not make a difference - neither will keep anyone alive.<br />
<br />
Still looking at the slow mitigation concerns in several gates zones.<br />

Although i most times agree with what you post with this 1 statement you are basically delivering a smack in the face to the whole argument of why shaman need a direct heal.<br />
<br />
I have read countless times Shaman on this board and on the cleric board and the EQLive board saying that the only Shaman who really need a new heal are the ones past Time and countless AA's etc who want to be able to hold a group together in GoD trials.<br />
<br />
If you are at this stage of the game where you NEED (notice need not would like) and you havent got max aa's and a focus then there is something wrong and perhaps you dont NEED the heal.<br />
<br />
On this note perhaps that is why SoE have made it only 1550 base as Shaman have been saying they need an 1800 pt heal which this is with max aa and focus and SoE believe that anyone at the stage of the game where they need an 1800 heal will have max aa and focus.<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i appreciate the difference in opinion, but i have to say, i feel your 100% wrong. Just cause i dont have focus items or max AA for healing ( working on it ) doest mean i cant hack it in GoD? Means i shouldnt get this heal?  Do you realize how elitist you just sounded my friend?<br />
<br />
I have to wonder if you know what its like to play this game unguilded.<br />
<br />
Really you seem like a nice guy and all, but i very much disagree...<br />
<br />
<br />
Beyond that, having a 1800 heal i feel is a tad low anyway. If you give us a 1800 patch then put on the focus and healing, then its where &quot;I&quot; personaly feel our quick heal should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rytan_EQ :<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for posting your reasons behind this. It helps understand and accept what you are doing with the spells. However i think a post AA 1800 heal isnt going to cut it. I for one dont have full AA and full focus and while im working on it, the fact is i dont. I think if you move this patch heal up to 1800 the AA and focus heal resulting from this will be much more where we needed and people like myself that are in GoD and Elemental zones, but are unguilded  can really benifiet. This patch heal will not replace a cheal of any kind. With the reuqested upgrade it will still be too small a heal and too mana insufficent to push a druid out of the main healer spot in the group. However with the new HoT i think personaly itll put us right where we need to be to be a effective healing member of the group.<br />
<br />
I think we need to look beyond ratios of progression for healing classes to fix our issue correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again thank you for talking to us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">On the one hand, I feel relieved that the new spells return shaman healing to the status quo achieved in PoP.  I can live with that.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, this thinking assumes two things: (1) that the status quo of PoP was adequate and (2) that GoD design is such that the PoP status quo will be sufficient to assure a role for shaman healing.  I never thought that (1) was a good assumption to make, although many who have posted on this board would disagree.  I don't know enough about GoD yet to know if assumption (2) is true, although I suspect it may not be.<br />
<br />
All in all, though, this upgrade was sorely needed and I really appreciate Rytan and Brenlo for their work in helping us out.<br />
<br />
By the way, these upgrades do return us to the unchallenged role of 3rd best healer in the game.</div></div><hr />

Question though.  From what I'm reading, to even hack it in GoD you really need to be almost time geared (or close to it).  Otherwise you're going to run into some problems.  Not that it *can't* be done, but it definitely seems that in order to really get into the heart of GoD you need to be darn well equipped/AA'd. <br />
<br />
In short, shouldn't (or at least couldn't) it be assumed that you will have the AAs maxed in the areas that these upgrades are aimed at?<br />
<br />
I don't hunt in GoD - shoot my main is still only 62 and I'm by no means ever going to raid anything bigger than the PoJ trials heh (yes I know it's not a raid) - but I can see where the idea that you should be almost max AA'd can be assumed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Nydara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I am extremely glad to see the heal upgrades but like many others think the base to Daluda's should be 1800 before aa's/focus.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">First impression: glad this is being looked at finally.<br />
<br />
Recurring impression: why is it okay for us to heal worse than druids, particularly since our primary ability (slow), has been marginalized by mitigation and fast fights?  That was the #1 reason why we got lesser heals starting at L58 w/ Kraggs: slow acted as indirect healing.  That reason is gone once you get to mobs that mitigate slow regularly and do high dps w/ low hps.  Veeshan_murtak has pointed this out repeatedly- does anyone else even notice?<br />
<br />
I could live w/ our penalties to healing up until now, when I finally reached a level of gear and aa's that my bazaar friends and I could do LDoN hards and go after nameds in Tactics/BoT.  But no longer.  Now if we want to play, I have to camp Iz and load up a friend's cleric.  How lame is that?<br />
<br />
The Daluda heal should instead be a simple change to the existing spell, Tnargs, not a rare new spell that only GoD raid shaman will see.  In addition, since apparently slow mitigation and quick, high dps fights are here to stay, where's our 4k &quot;cheal&quot; at L64 that was there prior to PoP? The reasons for removing it no longer exist- give it back now as a spectral at the very least.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the screaming from clerics if their healing was mitigated such that it was not noticeably better than any other healer? Or druids if their snares/nukes were mitigated?  Yet here we sit w/ our primary ability, the ability around which we pay so many penalties, reduced in effectiveness and farmed out to many other classes and it's okay.<br />
<br />
3 other classes having nearly as effective slow = okay.  Shaman having a cheal 1/2 as good as clerics = very very bad!<br />
<br />
Pffffffffft.</div></div><hr />

Myreal question is do you think the current ratios are good for the game.<br />
<br />
100 Cleric<br />
64 Druid<br />
47 Shaman<br />
<br />
Why such a large gap between 1 and 2?<br />
Many people are finding balance wise at the top end of the game even with new heals your still looking at requiring a cleric in every single group.<br />
Preferiblly 2 clerics.<br />
<br />
Also in other aspects of the game there isn't such a large gap.<br />
Take Melee DPS.  its not 100 rogue 64 monk for example.<br />
Take Tanks.  Its not 100 Mitigation War 64 Paladin/SK<br />
Take Slows.  Its not 100 Shaman 64 Enchanter.<br />
<br />
in almost every other area the gap is more like 80-90 for 2nd place.<br />
Enchanters slow 80% as well as shaman.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't a more uniform system be something be something like<br />
100 Cleric<br />
83 Druid<br />
66 Shaman <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2ndly the gap in Complete Heal line is even larger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Tnarg's wasn't designed for content where monsters Mitigated slow. It's an ethereal spell, and was available to anyone in the first 4 planes in POP. It's outdated for elemental/GoD content where slow mitigation runs rampant and further cuts into our ability to counter DPS being done to a tank.<br />
<br />
With two mobs that do identical DPS unslowed, the one that mitigates slow by 50% will deal two and a half times as much damage than the one that doesn't mitigate.<br />
<br />
Two and a half times!!! <br />
<br />
Something that is &quot;Mostly&quot; Slowable (Slow is 75% effective) a mob is doing close to twice as much damage as a fully slowable one.<br />
<br />
In content where everything mitigates, We need at least some sort of boost to our healing power to reflect this, and keeping us at a deadset ratio to other healers isn't going to cut it. Throw us a frickin' bone if you're going to limit our ability to prevent damage, or allow us (and only us) to at least somewhat overcome these limitations in a different way.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can still CC, Stun, provide mana regen, haste the group, and nuke decently where stuff is slow immune. A beastlord can still provide monk level DPS, 50% KEI, and paragon, as well as shaman level buffs. As for us, we're dead in the water. This spell is a step in the right direction, now  put the other foot down and actually make it worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

RytanEQ:<br />
Thank you for explaining the mana change was a blunder (as we had hoped it was).  Thank you also for eliminating the Daluda DoT and making it a heal.<br />
<br />
Please upgrade Daluda's Mending to 1800 hp healed (base).  In its current version, I do not feel it is enough.  In an environment where every mob mitigates slow, the current Daluda Mending spell is not powerful enough.  Though I understand your reasoning w/ the percentages per class, the GoD expansion w/ near 100% mitigation (of some kind) makes our 47% too weak.<br />

<br />
I don't hunt in GoD - shoot my main is still only 62 and I'm by no means ever going to raid anything bigger than the PoJ trials heh (yes I know it's not a raid) - but I can see where the idea that you should be almost max AA'd can be assumed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well to put it simply for both of us. All that is irrelivant. The point is that a 1800 heal isnt enough to begin with. If you apply the focus and AA formula to a 1800 base quick heal, you get something right about at what we need i personaly feel. Most the tanks i group with that are only elemental flagged guilds are pushing 9k or more, so with a 1500/1800 heal your healing 1.5 percent approxamitly. Thats just 1 hit from these mobs im seeing. However a 1800/2100 will put us over the danger zone. <br />
<br />
We wont be super effective healers, but if the cleric bites it atleast we can save the group. I believe this will put us right in the healign area we need to be in. Not truly a primary healer, but someone very worth having around incase things get hairy AND someone worth having on these adventures that require 2 clerics or a druid/cleric combo.<br />
<br />
More i think about it, the more sensable it seems.</div></div><hr />

I think its safe to say that the majority of shaman here are settling around needing a 1800 base heal. And anyone not in agreement would not complain if they got it.<br />

 Seems like most of you dont seem to be satisfied with this upgrade, but I am sure he knew there would be quite a few of you that would say &quot;I want more&quot;.<br />
 In all honesty, this upgrade (with AA and focus effects) would put me just over 2k in heals most of the time, which is all i was looking for, when it comes to healing.<br />
<br />
 Now if they can fix our dps to the same way it was up to PoP, I would be a very happy Shaman. Either by makeing &quot;Balance of the Nihil&quot; a bit more usefull so we have more time to cast our dots, or by decreasing the time it in between each tick of our dots.<br />

Just because you don't have the AAs doesn't mean you can't hang in Vxed/Tipt and beyond.  If you don't have the gear, though, you won't be able to.  You need lots of mana and lots of hitpoints.  That's not elitist, that's reality.  If you can't acquire the spell, then you don't need it. <br />

You are right, you dont need a bunch of AAs to do you job in the higher lvl zones, but your effectives DOES and WILL improve dramatically if you do. <br />
<br />
It is like saying, you will walk to work instead of riding your bike.  Sure they will both get you where you want to go, but one is more efficient and is more appealing to other people (groups).<br />
<br />

 I would say haveing all of the AAs that a shaman can really use will improve your effectiveness about 25%, that is soloing and grouping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do think it didn't take GoD to make us shamans underpowered.  Twice today I was on my way to a LDON when I got told that I got replaced on the way there.  Shamans even in old content simply don't offer that much to people in the know.  So for those still stuck in a place where a new heal spell turn-in won't come there way soon or at all, at least they got a small upgrade to their healing capability, to make them at least a little more desirable.<br />

Question though.  From what I'm reading, to even hack it in GoD you really need to be almost time geared (or close to it).  Otherwise you're going to run into some problems.  Not that it *can't* be done, but it definitely seems that in order to really get into the heart of GoD you need to be darn well equipped/AA'd. <br />
<br />
In short, shouldn't (or at least couldn't) it be assumed that you will have the AAs maxed in the areas that these upgrades are aimed at?<br />
<br />
I don't hunt in GoD - shoot my main is still only 62 and I'm by no means ever going to raid anything bigger than the PoJ trials heh (yes I know it's not a raid) - but I can see where the idea that you should be almost max AA'd can be assumed.<br />
Well, lets do a bit of history here, fairly recent history at that.<br />
When LDON was released, a few brave souls tried the High Risk adventures, typically known as Hards, lots of my friends gave them a wack and in turn ended up getting their asses handed to them. It generally became the concensus that you really needed Elemental + gear to really be able to challange a Hard and needed a lot of AA and &quot;the perfect group&quot; to win.<br />
Now, over the course of the last few months, people have gotten LDON down to a science, a LDON easy is just that and LDON high risks are becoming easier and easier, the tanks that dont have access to elemental + gear are rounding up points in Tak and outfitting themselves as best they can, the DPS classes are filling up on Atk bonuses and working on weapon upgrades that can get fairly close to what a good elemntal raid can provide, and DPS has gone way up on average.<br />
Now people do hards all the time...sure having Elemental+ gear makes a lot of the hards seem easy, even if its just a relative comparison to what your used to.<br />
I am thinking that GoD will eventually become similar, sure the higher end trials and zones will still be laying the smacketh down on people, but I am willing to bet that the mid tier zones will be fairly well populated in ~6 months from now, all by people that have kitted themselves out in LDON armor and have good experience working in small 6 man groups, another factor that is against large raid guild types....some simply dont know how to work without a ton of backup. Granting us a good blast heal to help offset the DPS and give us a chance to slow may well help open GoD up as it will help require less reliance on 2 clerics or a druid/cleric combo.<br />
GoD may well become the open elementals that a lot of us have dreamed of.<br />
Now as to the healing topic and how it invloves GoD and other zones...right now with no healing AA and ornate arms I can do main healer/slower in a LDON easy, assuming that there is a mezzer that knows what he/she is doing and I know the tank. If its a group of strangers I got in a pickup group, then I am very reluctant to be main healer...I dont know their capabilities, dont know who to trust to blast heal me if I were to need it, etc, but I have done it.<br />
A 1800 point flat out base blast heal would be a God send (no pun intended) to me at this point...a 1550 point is more like a refund from the IRS...nice, but you really earned all that cash anyway, they are just being nice enough to return it with a moderate amount of hassel.<br />
All that said, I think that its a step in the right direction....if we can break 1700 points No focus or AA then I would say you can stop now, please refocus your efforts on some other weak areas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">About Breath of Trushar:<br />
In GoD Trushar is not a heal, just as the cleric HoT spells are not heals. Trushar is something to throw on the tank between pulls or sometihng to throw on the monk who got riposted.<br />
When someone is getting hit you will be better of casting Chloroblast or even Greater Healing. At least these will actually heal your tank before he dies.<br />
<br />
Clerics have to cast Complete Heal pretty fast to make it lands in time - us taking the same amount of time to land a single tick of healing just does not cut it.<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar (and Quiescence) are nice to make sure the cleric does not have to heal that last bubble of HPs, they are nice to cover the odd riposte damage but they can not take the place of a better spot heal, or even allow for a lesser spot heal.</div></div><hr />

The arguing point was Shaman past Time and with AA out of the ying yang etc can not fulfill their part in GoD.<br />

No - we were arguing for a 1800 base heal all the time. Why would I argue for a 1800 focused heal when Tnarg's already heals 1750 for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I am extremely glad to see the heal upgrades but like many others think the base to Daluda's should be 1800 before aa's/focus. As is it will help to keep a tank up but still wont do the job as is needed.<br />
<br />
How did you determine that 1800 &quot;will do the job as needed&quot;, but 1550 will only &quot;help keep a tank up&quot;. If you guys are goin to make reasonable requests for upgrades to healing power then it might be appropriate to do it the framework of actual model tanks and the effects of particular dps on healing requirements. So, for a particular mob, and a particular tank, if the cleric is spamming fast heals, what size heal would the secondary healer need to spam in order to keep the tank up until mana ran out? I think that as things stand, someone has wet their finger, stuck it in the air and said &quot;hmmm....a 1800 heal is called for&quot;. I don't think that argument would carry much weight with the devs. If 1550 really isnt good enough, but 1800 is, then perhaps some hard numbers to demonstrate why that is the case would be appropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">For those saying that they shouldn't have to get GoD to get the heal...  I don't think that makes much sense.  GoD is where the shaman are having all the problems.  I don't want to be the main healer in a hard ldon, I want to be the backup healer in a GoD trial.  Even so, the change to Q is nice for those without GoD.  If you are keeping Q up on a tank constantly, that extra couple hundred hp per cast might be noticeable.  <br />
<br />
All in all, good stuff.<br />
<br />
fact is that shaman healing was broken before GOD was released (see the others healing threads with comparison charts), and to focus only on GOD for any upgrade would be indecent to the majority of shaman who don't have the level/equipement required to play in GOD as many here have said it is designed to EP shaman with 7k hp while most of us are much more on an average 5k hp full buff.<br />
<br />
however this is a great news as we have been listened by SOE and honestly the little Q upgrade is a little compensation for not buying GOD.<br />
<br />
and last, if the fast heal is released as a &quot;tradable&quot; spell, then I can say that I will be very happy, like many of us around.<br />
<br />
now I'm awaiting to see what will happen live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">thank you ,Ryan<br />
<br />
obviously i hope these are tested to make sure they are enough, remeber that the 1300 heal was abit low to begin with. but certainly these will make a marked different to our back up healing. also HoT being affect by focus and aa would be nice too.<br />
<br />
i would though also ask, along with the slow issue , that you keep in mind that our dots, along with slows, loose effectiveness on very sort fights, quite often we can only cast 1 dot, and it doesnt do full damage, let alone 2 or 3. some way to cause damage roughly equal to dots but for a 30 sec fight would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">First, it is nice to see positive direction changes being tested. Not sure how well it will go on Test; assuming testing will be done once the live server patch is completed.<br />
<br />
Real questions will be answered when we put the spells to use and see what the true effect is. I would prefered higher heal values. We all would have, I am sure. There was one comment made that drew more interest for me:<br />
<br />
Still looking at the slow mitigation concerns in several gates zones.<br />
<br />
From my purely shaman point of view, I always thought, if we have mitigation, then the amount of mitigation should be significantly less for shaman slows than for the backup slowing classes. Something along the lines of 15-20% increase in mob slow (if mobs mitigate to only a 20-25% slow with ENC/BST/BARD versions, shaman slow should be mitigated 35%+) to give us a clearly superior edge. Read that closely ... I really do mean shaman slow should slow the mobs more than other classes. Been playing 10 hours today and so a bit burned out atm.<br />
<br />
So I am waiting to see what these mitigation changes are and hope they are global - not just GoD zones. If done right, coupled with the heal changes, shaman could be strengthened solidly and along the lines of what the class is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
/fingers crossed</div></div><hr />

Daluda drops from Sewers so cut the bull****.  Doing sewers is no harder than doing a LDoN.   Trushar is from Kod`Taz, which is hardly an end game zone, and the named mobs it drops from are one groupable.  Getting to Kod`Taz doesn't take a raid force, it takes 6 people, its no harder to get to than it was to complete PoJ trials originally.   Kod`Taz is going to be flooded with people in the next few months, its going to be just like BoT.<br />
<br />
Since its so wrong to have spells/items as &quot;rewards (or baits)&quot; I guess you feel they should just put every spell and item you could ever possibly want on a vendor so you can just buy it right?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I can't acquire the spell because it's in GoD which offers nothing to the casual player.  I need it because I'm doing LDoN hards, which is pretty damn difficult in our level of gear, but is fun and challenging with a reasonable risk/reward.  Oh, wait, I forgot the raiders' party line:<br />

I want to pay as much for our healing fix as warriors/monks did for theirs, no more, no less.  I want to go through as much trouble as warriors/monks did for their fix, no more, no less.  I want to receive my new healing spells, assuming they go live, the same way I received every single other healing spell in the game so far after 3 years of playing: off a freaking vendor.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy pain, more power to you.  I see no reason to go through a lot of effort for a fix- any other class when fixed gets it for free instantly on patch day.  Shamans have been beatdown for so long that even their own players feel they should be beat down further to receive any fixes.  Unbelievable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">izmalis, make up your mind.<br />
<br />
First you say you want the new spells (but can't get them). In the next breath GoD offers nothing to you?<br />
<br />
Or is it that GoD is currently too hard for your group of people, and hard LDoNs is what you manage atm? If so, then it is just a matter of slugging along at LDoN until you reach the point where they become easier and easier, and eventually you CAN manage GoD. Without even having been to the elementals (I'm guessing?).<br />
<br />
Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />

It is obviously a step in the right direction, while the numbers have to be tested ingame and probably need further tweaking. Especially when you put the increasing number of mitigating mobs in that equation. I have a feeling, that this isn't done yet for calculating spell details.<br />
<br />
Mitigation HAS to be considered and either shaman healing or other shaman abilities have to be increased accordingly. Why is it, that shaman as only class are punished twice against mitigating mobs - in their slower and in their healer role?<br />
<br />
In the previous discussion the question was asked, what SoEs current vision(tm) of the shaman class is. Brenlo thought, this was a legitimate question ;).<br />

I am a every day shaman. I play in GoD zones. I dont have max healing AA and focus. I need this new heal.  I dont see what my AA and my Flag access has to do with GoD to be honest bro. I completly grasp your point, you have made it pretty clear i think. But mine is that you cant assume everyone has 300+ AA and is decked out in full elemental plus gear in GoD. I dont exp in PoN, when i do have the chance im in Elementals and LDoN hards and GoD. Thats the only content i do.<br />

Im unguilded and have a busy life. I dont see how this is a balancing minset if im supposed to be punished and pushed out of content cause of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">How did you determine that 1800 &quot;will do the job as needed&quot;, but 1550 will only &quot;help keep a tank up&quot;. If you guys are goin to make reasonable requests for upgrades to healing power then it might be appropriate to do it the framework of actual model tanks and the effects of particular dps on healing requirements. So, for a particular mob, and a particular tank, if the cleric is spamming fast heals, what size heal would the secondary healer need to spam in order to keep the tank up until mana ran out? I think that as things stand, someone has wet their finger, stuck it in the air and said &quot;hmmm....a 1800 heal is called for&quot;. I don't think that argument would carry much weight with the devs. If 1550 really isnt good enough, but 1800 is, then perhaps some hard numbers to demonstrate why that is the case would be appropriate.<br />
<br />
Our four healing concerns are:<br />
1) We are locked in a chain Tnarg's cycle after a reisted slow.<br />
2) Slow mitigation greatly reduces our effectiveness.<br />
3) We need to be closer to clerics (and druids) in spot healing.<br />
4) We need to make up for GoD MOBs hitting harder.<br />
<br />
Now, 4) does not apply as clerics and druids did not compensated for new content any more then we did. Numbers for the other three points:<br />
<br />
1) As is, chain Tnarg's (at max healing AAs + a heal focus) pretty much keeps up with unslowed trash in most of GoD. You loose a little on a lucky round, you gain a little on crit heals. If we want to be able to recast a resisted slow we need to have one heal worth of security. To do that we need about a 30-40 % upgrade to Tnarg's so we can reach that window with 3 heals - at a point where the MOB might still be alive in a low damage group.<br />
1300+30-40%=1755<br />
<br />
2) To make up for the effect of the least amount of slow mitigation we need the following heal: 1300*(1/1-.75)=new heal*1/(1-(.75*.75)). Solving for new heal gives us new heal=1300*(1/1-.75)*(1-(.75*.75)=2275<br />
<br />
3) To be within 80% of a druid's spot healing capability we need 2100*.8=1680.<br />
<br />
However you do the numbers, 1550 will not cut it. By the way, the average of the above three points is 1900. Personally I think 1800 would work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me personaly i never had a problem working with a druid to replace a cleric. I dont think clerics should have complete monopoly on groups, if you cant find a celric ( which is ALOT ) then a druid on direct heals with a shaman hitting Q/BoT with spot heals should be able to effetivly, though more risky, heal a group.<br />
<br />
I cant see how a cleric would have anything to stand on, its taking TWO classes to replace what they can do alone...</div></div><hr />

We can do Kodtaz without clerics. Without druids. Or at least I do it. Call me crazy, but another healer is not needed for trash mobs there. It gets pretty painful on anything that cons yellow, has a pet, etc. But if you pick and choose, its doable. I don't consider myself outrageously uber on gear, although I do well. Caster mobs? All the better. If they waste their time casting on me spells that I resist I'm happier. <br />
<br />
Hell, I had a mob try to land Plague of Daluda on me today and I burst out laughing on the spot. Maybe we should think of the consquences of our healing bitching on the poor NPCs. Maybe they yearn for Daluda to kill entire parties with over the next 3 minutes instead of meleeing us to death as they can all handily do.</div></div><hr />

If you have time to debuff on the pull and if you do not get multiple resists and if you never get anything but singles, sure. But even then, a cleric, even without a slower will heal better then you. Even without outside buffs. Over long periods of time.<br />
Over the course of a single fight it is not even a contest.<br />
<br />
And that is in the very situation you should shine in - you being the only slower, pulling single melee MOBs over long periods of time. Not to mention the cleric can actually pull those singles himself.<br />

Of course a cleric or druid never has to spend mana on a MOB that just casts - a shaman will already have spent mana (and time) on Malos and Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Being able to almost do as well as a druid in a perfect (for the shaman) situation is not a good thing. Playing healer in a group without a slower that pulls only singles we should outdo druids and possibly clerics, not come somewhat close to them.</div></div><hr />

Well yes. I guess I'm saying thats my usual situation. A single add, depending on what it is, isn't really that huge of an issue. VP, rootpark it. And I often times won't bother with Malos. Just use Balance of the Nihil on pull, then swap to Turgur's. I don't have a TA which would make this far easier, but if I spam Turgur's eventually it hits. Do I have the time to do this? Yeah, in my experience. I didn't think I was that exceptional in this regard.<br />

In an open raid/exploration in Ferubi tonight, after killing a common named Hexx Gkon (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14518), I got the 65 spell Plague of Daluda. I say common, since we killed him, left his room, started killing yard trash/wanderers, he popped shortly thereafter, so we pulled him again, and the 2nd time he dropped the spell. He didn't pop right away so we moved on to more named like Pxet Elite Hammermaster (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14587) (very cool looking mob). Maybe it was pure luck to see him so quickly, but glad I did, and I know have that spell.. course question is, do I mem it and play with it for how ever long before the changes, if they take place, or wait until I can see what happens?<br />

One group of 65s is not neccesarily equal to another group of 65s.<br />
<br />
Since its so wrong to have spells/items as &quot;rewards (or baits)&quot; I guess you feel they should just put every spell and item you could ever possibly want on a vendor so you can just buy it right?  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I almost do actually. Since SOE apparently spend so much time and effort on making sure spells dont unbalance the game it must also work the other way around that they have to balance content from the perspective of people having the spells. But as I said several times it doesnt really affect me - but that doesnt mean I have to think its the greatest idea ever.<br />
<br />
I will go do GoD when I feel like it could be fun. And this might very well turn out to be never. WoW could easily prove to be a much more enjoyable path for my kind of player than GoD. If this is good or bad design from SOE I should probably let them decide.</div></div><hr />

It's called the bazaar, surely you've heard of it. And Q/T are HoTs, not direct heals, to be precise.<br />
<br />
izmalis, make up your mind.<br />
<br />
First you say you want the new spells (but can't get them). In the next breath GoD offers nothing to you?<br />
<br />
Or is it that GoD is currently too hard for your group of people, and hard LDoNs is what you manage atm? If so, then it is just a matter of slugging along at LDoN until you reach the point where they become easier and easier, and eventually you CAN manage GoD. Without even having been to the elementals (I'm guessing?).<br />
<br />
Am I wrong?<br />
Yeah, you misunderstand- I need better healing now, outside of GoD.  Fixing a balancing issue (healing) by tying it to a rare, NO DROP spell in one expansion is flat out wrong.  Imagine the warrior outcry if their aggro/mitigation only worked in one expansion and it was quested?  If you thought their anger was bad before, imagine if warriors were treated to fixes like those proposed for shaman.<br />
<br />
I went back to Tactics this morning to play around a bit- I never really paid attention before because our groups are usually so high on dps, but even in Tactics slow mitigation kills my mana (was duoing w/ my sk and a friend's wizard) trying to keep the tank up.  The healing imbalance between priests exists everywhere 60+- do NOT balance this only for GoD raid shaman.  That's my (somewhat belabored and frustrated) point.<br />
<br />
Questing for a fix is also quite lame- treat me like a warrior, please.</div></div><hr />

Well, it isn't. Balance of the Nihil will be resisted sooner or later and then you are screwed. <br />
Mind you, this is a scenario where mobs do NOT mitigate slow probably too. Single, non mitigating mobs, can it be any more trivial? And still, you will get troubles on a resisted Slow, which is the biggest concern.<br />

1) Mobs are not magically slowed when they hit the camp if you have a Shaman<br />
2) Mobs mitigate slow since PoP(and it's not the exception)<br />
<br />
3) Mobs are outright immune to slow<br />
<br />
4) Druids and Clerics are usually more effective and efficient without a slower in group than a shaman who is slowing and healing for his group, even if the mobs are fully slowable.</div></div><hr />

5 hours a shot, few nights a week. I've had some freetime. More than a few mobs. This isn't me doing a one shot run. I've cleared entire temples with me as the only healer.<br />

BoT, while a nice upgrade, isn't going to cripple you by not having it.  It'll take you some effort to get to where you can get it, but it's most certainly doable with a single group that's never been to Time or even Elemental Planes.  I'm pretty sure there are shaman that post here that have gotten to KT without being in an EP+ guild.<br />

Holy Light : 3275/6 = 545.83hp/sec<br />

The biggest problem is keeping the tank up till the mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
In a 30 second fight, Malos + slow will take 10.5 seconds(barring haste). Your first heal will land after ~17 seconds and it will only heal 1550. How many mobs do you know that will only do 1550 damage in 17 seconds in GoD(10.5 seconds of which are unslowed btw) ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">The heal upgrades might be enough to help make us effective if it's coupled with making tipt+ named mobs not immune to slow and giving us a new buff. <br />
<br />
In GoD we are very effective on trash mobs..  sure we can't heal like a cleric but we can slow them 50-75% so it's all good.    But it's on the GoD named when they take away our slow completely or mitigate to slightly..   that's what makes us useless and undesirable at the moment. <br />
<br />
Slow immunity on single-group mobs is one step away from being fully braindead game design.  If anyone stopped to think about it instead of just following the cookie-cutter mold of &quot;here's a named how can I make him tougher..  ooo make him immune to slow!&quot; You have a single-group encounter that's balanced for 30 minutes while you are clearing trash..  then let's put a mob that is immune completely to anything one type of party member can do.  Oh and make their stupid proc-pets mitigate heavily too!  God forbid we let them slow those things!  I haven't seen melee-immune mobs in single group content, I haven't bumped into any nuke-immune mobs in single group content yet..  why does it make sense to take a whole subclass of people and make them useless for the most important events?  <br />
<br />
If they want these mobs to put out N dps that is fine, I'm all for the content being extremely challenging.  But I'd just prefer that in order to make that N dps number they increased the mobs DPS by 40-50% and made them mostly slowable.  That way the slowing classes are actually important in a balanced group, and maybe we'll see shaman get some invites instead of groups consisting of 2(or 3) clerics all the time.  There's a lot of classes out there, it's silly and not very profitable from a company perspective to create events where you MUST have 2 clerics and MUST use a warrior. <br />
<br />
For a 3rd step I'd rather us not get a bigger heal...  I'd rather have us get a better and useful buff.  Being that we used to be King of all buffs and have been severely downgraded in PoP, it might be nice to see an upgrade in this arena also.  We shammies got stealth-nerfed when they made stats capped and useless.   We are long overdue for a interesting buff..   a group buff that grants a +10% evasion bonus and a +10% melee-mitigation bonus or something.  If they put a 2 minute duration on it and gave it a 45 minute recast..   it would actually help us in single-group content for the biggest fights, and also help us STACK on raids. All of a sudden there's actually a reason to have that 3rd shaman around.  Basically it'd be nice to have a short-term defensive oriented melee-boosting buff of some kind like Bulwark of Vie.<br />
<br />
Not to rag on clerics but they get virtue which is better than fos, they get WoG which is better than our AC buff, they get a spell-haste buff..   AND they have the extremely useful Bulwark of Vie.  They have so many useful buffs most of them are pretty grumpy about it when you /tt cleric &quot;Hey gimme BoV, BoR, WoG, and Kazad prz&quot;.  I'm not positive but they may have even gotten a self-target FA buff as well?  We are long long long long long long long long overdue for a useful buff.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to post so long, but thanks for stopping by Spell Guy.  It does give me some hope for my class and my toon to see us get this small healing upgrade.  Follow it up by helping rid the GoD world of complete slow-immunity and giving us a useful buff and I think we'll be useful again.</div></div><hr />

Sciek, that would only work if we were the only slowers in the game. As we all know this is really not the case and therefore your comparison does not work.

Us being a better choice for main healer vs. a druid or cleric SHOULD be the exception rather than the rule.  If we're capable of easily doing the job of main healer as well as slower, that's not balanced.  It should be difficult to cover two Primary roles in a group at once.  If it were easy for any shaman to fill both roles then what reason would anyone have for inviting a druid to a group as healer if a shaman was available?<br />
<br />
i.e. I can get a shaman as slower/healer or I can get a druid and use another slot for a slower.  If the druid/slower combo isn't significantly better than the single shaman, that's not balanced.<br />
<br />
Regardless, My response was mostly directed at Murtak's claim that a druid was a better healer vs an unslowed mob than a shaman vs the same mob slowed. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes. I can follow with that. But I do not think that the current upgrades will enable to do so in GoD for some time (eventually, sure) and that is quite ok.<br />
<br />
Anyways, lets see how it works out. I am very glad that something positive is happening at all, no need to overly critizise it before we try it out. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">Us being a better choice for main healer vs. a druid or cleric SHOULD be the exception rather than the rule.  If we're capable of easily doing the job of main healer as well as slower, that's not balanced.  It should be difficult to cover two Primary roles in a group at once.  If it were easy for any shaman to fill both roles then what reason would anyone have for inviting a druid to a group as healer if a shaman was available?<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow isn't a main ability. It's a way to mitigate damage. A Shaman slowing AND healing should very well be at least as good as main healer as a Cleric let alone a Druid.<br />
The Shaman pays with a HUGE mana expenditure per fight, no other utility and a lot more aggro. In return the Shaman would be weaker than both, Druid and Cleric if the mob was immune to slow or in an area where mobs heavily mitigate. A 1800 heal would do that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">My point is that it's not balanced for a shaman to easily replace 2 people in one group...  most groups need both a slower and a healer.  We can fill either of those roles (healer is arguable in some cases heh) but we shouldn't be able to fill both of those roles in any group with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">You don't need a slower, if you can heal the damage of an unslowed mob just fine. That argument is invalid. <br />
A Shaman should be able to heal better than a Cleric or Druid by himself, if the mobs are fully slowable than the Druid and Cleric himself without a slower, since he's spending a LOT more mana and will not be able to add anything else to the fights. <br />
Likewise the Shaman will be not as good a healer as a Cleric or even Druid on mobs that *heavily* mitigate or outright immune. What's wrong with that picture? Would it be imbalanced if that was true...again(that's how it used to be for a long long time(with the exception that Druids had the same heals as us, because they were obviously the better damage dealers, but that vision seems gone)?</div></div><hr />

__________________<br />
Venerable Izmaill<br />
<br />
Izmaill, 2 points. EverQUEST or EverHUNT or EverCAMP ... call it what you will ... is how many, many spells have been acquired throughout the game.<br />
<br />
Key shaman example: Canni-2. That is a quest spell, er, sorry, was. Now it can be purchased in Abysmal. Before GoD, it was a quest spell that WOULD NOT, in anyway possible by a average equipped, be acquired by the level it was entended for without serious help from higher levels. Was that a pain? Yes, but the pain of effort was also worth it in the reward received.<br />
<br />
50-60 spells are not sold at vendors ... with the exception of 1 (at the most 2) for each level. The majority of them drop from things you have to go EverCAMP or EverHUNT. As for the Ancient line of spells, the only way you would get them is to EverRAID. Please don't take this as exceedingly rude, but, here is a newsflash: Bazaar Traders are not VENDORS ... they are TRADERS. Those spells they have are the result of someone EverQUESTING, EverHUNTING, EverCAMPING or EverRAIDING.<br />
<br />
That you are not the one QUESTING, HUNTING, CAMPING leads me to believe you are not upset that the new spells are in GoD zones as much as you are ticked off they are no-drop tagged and won't end up in the bazaar fast enough to pick up from one of your &quot;vendors.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have picked you out individually, Izmaill, but don't take it personally. This applies to all those sharing your opinion that now that SOE has done something positive we need to find a new negative way to look at how they are screwing us over yet again. Where and how the spells drop is not screwing us over. It is how these have been implemented since day one ... of Kunark. Before then, the method was to collect runes/pages/words/etc ... if you were a &quot;pure caster&quot; for your key spells from lvl 16 to 49.<br />
<br />
Amazing how much whining is now about &quot;never seeing the spell&quot; because it is in a GoD zone that is perfectly doable by a group decked out in bazaar gear ... sorry, &quot;trader&quot; purchased items.<br />
<br />
The only questions that are valid at this point about the changes are:<br />
<br />
1) Do the heal increases allow shaman to fill a healer/back up healer priest role?<br />
<br />
2) If not, (first) will mitigation changes change that or (second) will SOE further modify shaman healing to allow us to fill that role.<br />

<br />
Sewers isn't near as hard as Vxed or Tipt, but you still need people with good mana regen and mana preservation and hitpoints.  I know all about bazaar gear -- as a 1748 tradeskiller, I've made a lot of it, bought and resold more.  SOME of it is nice enough, but there's no comparison on most of it to really good stuff.  A lot of it is not even as good as ornate, and very little is significantly superior.  How many people in a group are realistically going to have or be able to equip, say, a black plated war collar or whatever that tactics neck is, or a white dragon helm(100 hps)?  Not a lot.  How many fully bazaar-geared people are going to be wielding a BoW?  Very few.<br />
<br />
I'm okay with where the spells are dropping.  I don't think they will change anything to make shaman pre-GoD get groups easier, as our HOT's and DPS are still not so great really.  But the changes will help a bit in GoD...not sure how much yet, but we'll see.  I'm hoping.  And addressing our problems in GoD was a very large share of what our recent threads have been about.<br />
<br />
But I don't think people's expectations should be raised about getting these spells in bazaar gear.  Maybe if YOU the shaman is in bazaar gear, okay.  But I sure hope you have plenty of AA's!  But I'd think people with tanks and healers equipped in bazaar gear would have a very rough time in sewers indeed.  Maybe the very most skilled, highly AA'd people.  But Joe Blow is not going to hit 65, gear up in ornate, get a couple or few dozen AA's, and beat sewers even if he's pretty skilled.<br />
<br />
That's my take on it -- don't get hopes up unrealistically.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Ok let's assume the Shaman has a 20% detrimental and 30% beneficial haste item max healing AA's and a 25% heal focus.<br />
<br />
In a 30 second fight againts a hard hitting fully slowable mob, it would look like this:<br />
<br />
0    -  4 secs - Shaman casts Malos<br />
6.5 - 8.9 secs - Shaman casts slow<br />
11.4 -14 secs - Shaman casts Tnarg's<br />
---------------- - Shaman casts Tnarg's till mob dies<br />
<br />
The Shaman's tank has to live without a heal for about 15 seconds if you account for lag and clicking spell gem delay, which is 50% of the fight. Note that for ~1/3 of the fight the mob beats on the tank with his unslowed dps.<br />
<br />
If you now assume an exp mob has a DPS of 600, the Shaman's tank will have taken 5400 damage *before* it was slowed and another 750 *after* it was slowed on AVERAGE(the chance of a Shaman's tank dying to a mob due to spikey dps is a lot higher due to the long time he has to go without a heal btw), before ANY heal lands on him. <br />
The Shaman will be able to chain heal for 18.6 seconds worth of Tnarg's that will mitigate 377 dps. In total the Shaman's tank will have been taken 8550 damage of which the Shaman can only heal 7012.<br />
<br />
Let's do this for the Druid:<br />
<br />
The Druid will have max healing AAs and a 25% healing focus+ 30% beneficial haste<br />
<br />
0  - 2.6 seconds - Druid casts Infusion<br />
5.1 - 7.7 seconds - Druid casts Infusion<br />
10.2 - 12.8 seconds - Druid casts Infusion<br />
---------------- - Druid casts Infusion till mob dies<br />
<br />
The Druid is able to heal 2982 with 1 cast on Infusion on average. That's about 585 HPS(healing per second). The tank will practically lose 15 HPs per second with a Druid chain healing, which amounts to a loss of 450 HPs total at the end of the fight for his tank. All this while the Druid is never risking to lose the tank due to constant and steady healing. <br />
The Shaman on the other hand will have to watch his tank dying on a DPS spike and hope his slow will never be resisted after Malos or it's going to happen regardless. He will spend about 200 more mana per fight and his tank will be looking at a net loss of 1538 HPs after the 30 second encounter.</div></div><hr />

In addition to Giac's numbers, which are right on the mark, a number of other posts have gone into great detail showing how much worse shaman healing on slowed mobs is compared to druids and clerics healing on unslowed mobs.  Here are a few:<br />

<br />
Numbers please, because I just do not believe this to be true.<br />
<br />
Shaman mana regen = 170ish per tick (when cannibalizing - 80ish when not)<br />
Druid mana regen = 85ish<br />
<br />
Assuming 30 second fights, no resists on slow after malos.<br />
<br />
Malos + Slow = 650 mana, 11.5 seconds cast time - with some basic focuses 490ish mana, 11.7 secs cast time, slow hits after 10.5 secs.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's is 450 base mana for 1430 (with basic focus) in about 5.7 seconds.<br />
<br />
Overall MOB damage is (10.5 secs * 100% + 19.5 secs * 25%)/30 = a little more then half.<br />
<br />
Not canning during Malos / Slow /Healing raises mana cost to 670ish for Malos+Slow and 425ish for Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
Per fight a shaman can thus cast Malos + Slow and less then half of Tnarg's for about 700 damage healed - less then 1500 damage healed per fight, accounting for slow.<br />
Even assuming the MOB can be kited while landing slow this only rises to about 2800ish damage healed.<br />
<br />
A druid will cast 5/6 of their incomplete heal for about 3900 damage healed per fight.</div></div><hr />

Not rude, just ignorant.  If it walks like a duck, looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, well, in my book that's a duck.  I right-click on a vendor/trader/whatever and purchase the item.  It is functionally the same regardless of whether there is an NPC or PC behind the transaction.  This is hard to grasp?<br />

It's just as silly as logging in the day after the melee fix patch as a warrior and rolling up to the tomes vendor and getting your new abilities.  Please, in detail, explain how it's okay to put in a fix for melee that you get by logging in and running to a vendor, but if you're a shaman that's no good.  If you enjoy pain, it's all you- I don't.  Again- treat me like a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, if you want everything to be no drop so it can be bought, go to Firiona Vie server, that's what it's there for.  Also, the bazaar =! spell vendors.<br />
Offer server transfers to FV w/ gear and I'm there in a second.  <br />
<br />
I bought every single one of my PoP spells from the bazaar, so I will respectfully disagree.  Functional equivalency isn't really that hard to understand, is it?  Seriously, this is elementary.  Do you really see much of a functional difference between getting your money from a bank teller as opposed to an ATM?  Having to explain this is sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">I am just wondering, for all of you that are still not satisfied with the new heal, and want better nukes, why not just play a Druid.  It seems to be all you are looking for.  You also state that our midigated slows mean nothing anyhow.     <br />
  <br />
I personally love playing my shaman.  I know its really meant to assist other classes most of the time, but I am really good at it and seems to keep me busy all the time.   I dont want a much higher heal or larger nuke, that would be turning me into a druid.  <br />
<br />
 What would be nice though is a group HoT that would assist a cleric or druid when everyone in the party is about 15-20% down in hp, which would be a nice different step in our overall healing capabilities.  And somehow getting our DoTs to land a few more ticks before the mob dies, but those are wants, not needs.  I like being the = Debuffer/DoT landing/overall general spot healer/and mini pet class.   <br />
<br />
Certianly in some situations (like KoD trials) we dont have too many tools to offer that are specifically needed like the other classes do.  <br />
But, since I can play multiple roles in a group, I will NEVER get bored with it (unlike clerics, wizzys, and warriors) ,  where their class is meant for ONLY one defining role, which can get VERY boring at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">Iz, I know this is turning into a couple of shaman pissing into the wind and wondering why we are getting wet ... <br />
<br />
Point on warriors, with the exception of the base level of new abilities to gain taunt the majority of these free tomes warriors got on &quot;day one&quot; as you put it were the tome necessary to replace the level based class skills they had that were deleted by the change. So, to get a skill they were given by simply hitting a level (30, 40, 50, etc) they had to go find a tome vendor and purchase it along with a very few new abilities. At the time SOE stated there would be other tome initiated abilities that would be drops from mobs as well as quested ... neither of which has come to pass yet.<br />
<br />
So taken in context with what I stated earlier, Tome on vendors are the same thing as spells on VENDORS (not traders in bazaar). They exisit but do not cover all the available or potentially available items in the game.<br />
<br />
That you can rationalize a Trader as a Vendor and further equate that to being able to buy ALL your other spells from a &quot;vendor&quot; so you should have the same access to the new spells is still just damn foolishness. Unless of course you know a vendor/trader somewhere you can point out that will let me pick up those ANCIENT spells ... you know the lvl 60 ones that only a few folks have.<br />
<br />
That you have never had to farm or quest or raid for a spell leaves me feeling sad for you. It is the farming, questing, raiding, hunting that makes the game ... the spells are just the added tidbits that drop along the way.</div></div><hr />

Even though I havent even set foot in the Sewers yet I think I have just as much right to say that they are extremely hard as you in all your time gear and 300+ AAs have to say that they are not overly hard.<br />
<br />
This is in no way intended as a flame - its only an attempt to clarify that not all are equal in this game but we all have to go to the same place to get the spells.<br />

<br />

<br />
But how big a percentage of those spells on sale in the bazaar do you think was the actual goal of those people EverHUNTING, EverCAMPING or EverRAIDING? My guess is that by far the largest part of them were &quot;byproducts&quot; from doing something else. And since not even a twink in the guild could use them anymore they are put up for sale.<br />
<br />

Before then, the method was to collect runes/pages/words/etc ... if you were a &quot;pure caster&quot; for your key spells from lvl 16 to 49.<br />
<br />
I certainly dont think its fair to accuse us of just having to find something to be negative about now that SOE apparently is making positive changes to the GoD spells. This is certainly not the first time I have critizised the way spells are available in EQ. Im almost stunned that you seem to think that spell drops in Kunark were fine. Anyway I dont buy the argument that just because something was a certain way 1, 2 or 3 years ago then it is perfect and must never change.<br />
<br />
Amazing how much whining is now about &quot;never seeing the spell&quot; because it is in a GoD zone that is perfectly doable by a group decked out in bazaar gear ... sorry, &quot;trader&quot; purchased items.<br />
<br />
How many of the GoD spells you have now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Aqualung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">Even though I havent even set foot in the Sewers yet I think I have just as much right to say that they are extremely hard<br />

<br />
How's that work?  Me and my group of slackers are flagged for KodTaz.  None of us are elemental flagged, none of us really even raid at all, to speak of.  The sewers were pretty rough on us, at first.  Once you figure out what works best there, they become a lot easier.   It also takes a while to just get used to that difficulty of mob.  You can't just barrel in and toss slows around and tank when you get aggro.  The game is different at that level, you need to adapt to it.  But of course, that involves actually trying it.  <br />
<br />
For anyone that gripes about how hard the expansion is, and how its only aimed at Time guilds.   You are dead wrong.  Our single group (6) of non-elemental players are seeing elemental level loots drop, without having to ever attend a raid.  From where i'm sitting, the casual/indy player stands to gain a TON from this expansion.<br />
<br />
That being said, the drop rates on the spells suck ass.  Please god fix them.  I've killed an awful lot of nameds in sewers and mountains.  From what i've seen (i'm aware of the role of sample size in statistics) nameds drop a spell somewhere between 1-8, to 1-10.  Considering it takes at least a half hour to kill a named, if all you are doing is farming for them, then its gonna take you 4 hours to get a spell drop.  Now factor in that it will be one of your class, and the correct one you still need if you have 1 already.  You're looking at a long ass time spent doing nothing but farming for spells.  It's a lot easier if you have a guild to call you in to loot a rotting spell somewhere.  This is where the indy/casual player is going to get shafted in GoD.  I'd much much rather see the nameds drop a rune, that you can turn in for spells across the board, than having to farm for individual rare as hell spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the rest of the comments, check out my other posts before these heal changes were introduced. I am very much for holding SOE, Brenlo and Rylan to meet expectations and address shaman problems. Now that I see them doing so and those changes move in a positive direction I will give them the benefit of the doubt. That doesn't mean they are off the hook. Just willing to give this time to play out and experience the changes before flipping my whine switch to full-auto mode.<br />
<br />
Now, if I were to take the tack that these should be droppable spells and that every shaman needs them now - not later - my post would ask for even more than the let me buy them from traders/vendors. I would want to log in after patch and have them already memmed in both the book and my spell lineup.<br />
<br />
GoD is the &quot;kick butt&quot; zone(s) now. Even the lower levels. It has always been this way. When PoP came out, those first entering BoT were getting owned by trash mobs. Now it is the KC of EQ progression. It didn't take long for that to happen. And yes, I realize I followed my trend of comparing old patterns to new.<br />
<br />
As for how the spells got into the bazaar, I am not sure I am following your point. Yes, they are there because (1) the person can't use them, (2) they were acquired while doing something and the spell dropped, and (3) no one else they know, if they bother to ask, can use it. Here is an added twist though that didn't exist until recently. Spell drops were the only way to get them. Now there are spell drops AND researching for the same spells. Another avenue was opened up that makes the spells even more available. Yet, that availability still requires &quot;getting&quot; the research components from dead mobs.<br />
<br />
Is it a pain that GoD spells are no drop? Yeah. Right now it is a significant pain. New expansions have always had that bottleneck. Will it be as difficult once strats are worked out and effort is put into going after them. I don't think so. It is just a matter of importance to the individuals. If the importance of the spell is based on availability to purchase from a vendor then the value of the spell cannot be that much. That is my view. Effort and getting the spell are part of what 'playing the game' is about.</div></div><hr />

What else are message boards for.<br />
<br />
<br />
So taken in context with what I stated earlier, Tome on vendors are the same thing as spells on VENDORS (not traders in bazaar). They exisit but do not cover all the available or potentially available items in the game.<br />
<br />
True or false: Warriors (and monks) on the melee fix patch day could login and go to a vendor and get their new abilities.  Abilities that were put in to fix a balance issue.<br />
<br />
Based on the responses thus far, I believe I am the oldest shaman who frequents these boards, as apparently I am the only one who remembers how we got Kragg's Mending when that balancing went live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless of course you know a vendor/trader somewhere you can point out that will let me pick up those ANCIENT spells ... you know the lvl 60 ones that only a few folks have.<br />
<br />
Please show me where I either asked for this or stated this.  Read my posts: I want any fix to healing to be a dropped spell that is not tied to an expansion because the problem exists for all high level shaman, not just GoD raiders.  I could care less about the crappy ancient spells, I doubt I would bother to bend down and loot them even if available- they are not game changing and do not represent spells around which the entire class is penalized, er, balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
That you have never had to farm or quest or raid for a spell leaves me feeling sad for you. It is the farming, questing, raiding, hunting that makes the game ... the spells are just the added tidbits that drop along the way.<br />
I did farm/quest the spells: I did it via Capitalism 101 in the bazaar. I feel sad for you that you want to make others' enjoyment of the game match yours.  I couldn't care less how you play- have fun and enjoy the diversion from real life that EQ provides.  Let me play my game, you play yours- EQ is large enough that it should be able to accommodate many styles of play.</div></div><hr />

Heh sparky.<br />
<br />
Some of us have been shaman for a while. Like beta to be exact.<br />
<br />
Some of us were hp/ac shaman when all the &quot;good&quot; shaman wore the wisdom gear.<br />
<br />
Some of us were around when you could charm gorillas in Cazic thule. As a shaman.<br />
<br />
Some of us were fighting at the center of the disease paw at level three. Because blackburrow was only visited by madmen and people with a deathwish. Before anyone knew what a port was and the spires were relics of a forgotten age.<br />
<br />
I am not saying these people that are still around know everything of course. We learn along with the rest of the world, and when the newer shaman come in burning with desire and ability we welcome them. But there are shaman who have wandered the world of Norrath when night was the blackness of Tovax Vmars heart, and to harm a bear or wolf in Qeynos hills was always watched with one eye over our shoulder to keep an eye out for Holly Windstalker, and Cros Treewind.  So don't go lecturing me about the old days you damn youngen. Cause We were made of sterner stuff back then. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">Aqualung has the pros/cons of single group non-raiding folk down pretty well.  My usual group is in Tipt, and aside from some minor problems (got to the last room yesterday before dying), we're having a blast in GoD content.  The loot is incredible for us, and we're getting a good number of upgrades.<br />
However, spell drops really need tweaked.  We've killed named in the sewers about 18 times now (8 masks and 4 of those gd arms have rotted, on top of the ones we've been able to give away), and we've not seen a single spell drop.  And this is just doing quick &quot;start expedition, have druid track, kill named if near zone&quot; for hours on end.  If we finally get one to drop and it's not for a class in our group, we're going to be mightily pissed (in Vxed we've rotted 2 bard, an sk, and a paladin spell so far).<br />
<br />
The main problem is, they've designed GoD much like PoP for progression through the various zones.  Why go back to disease when you can exp in fire?  They're pretty much forcing us to do that to get any spells to drop, and when you've got a 1/10 chance of a spell drop and might not even be for a class you can give it to, I have a feeling I'm going to be in the sewers for the next 10 years to outfit 1 group.</div></div><hr />

Not be an ass or anything but it would sure help if i could see your Magelo and those of the people you group with. Not having any elemental or better equipment is ofcourse a big hint but it is still possible for people that dont &quot;raid&quot; to have very good equipment if they put in an obscene amount of time :) As is pretty obvious from other threads on this board it is possible for a shaman to get by with non-stellar equipment if the rest of the group is better equipped.<br />

This I agree with completely and you make a very good point about being in a big guild that will have spells rotting from time to time. But according to the all-knowing Jenamdar and Jaradis this is a perfect system that will ensure that almost everyone will have their spells very soon. I guess time will tell.<br />
<br />
I better stress again that GoD-spells - except the canni upgrade - dont really look that fantastic to me and certainly not anything I must have. To me this is more a debate about if this system is good or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You guys need to get away from the perfect condition thinking. This would only be true, *if* you could cast your Q 5.5 seconds *before* the mob hits the camp.<br />
Under realistic conditions, you'd probably be able to start casting a Q around 2 seconds before the mob hit's the camp, which would delay your slow by an additional 3.5 seconds(with quickbuff 3). 3.5 seconds of an unslowed mobs melee in my example(600 DPS) equates to another 2100 damage of which Q would only be able to heal 1500(30 seconds fight assuming you have SCR). <br />
So basically under realistic conditions your choice to throw a Q on the tank first would net the Shaman's tank an additional 600 HP loss. The comparison between Druid and Shaman healing would look even better for the Druid.<br />
<br />
Mind you, we are talking about realistic conditions. This doesn't account for the times when you will only be able to start casting your Q the instant the mob hit's the camp, in which case your slow will land 5.5 seconds later even(Q cast time with QB 3 + spell gem refresh of 2.5 seconds). 5.5 seconds unslowed DPS are another 3.3k on top of the 6.1 k I had in my analysis. Needless to say that you will end up losing your tank. The Shaman's tank has a high risk of dying, because the Shaman is so damn slow whatever he does, but this underlines it.</div></div><hr />

When Luclin came out Shaman and Druids got 75% CH spells so we can group more.<br />

Druids     Tunare's Renewal   2925hps    <br />

*grin* I knew that would get people's attention. My point was- why are people who've played since before Luclin so willing to accept having to go jump through hoops to a fix of a balance issue?  Remember how we (and druids) got our last healing fix?<br />
<br />
FROM A VENDOR <br />
<br />
Same as warriors, same as monks, ad infinitum.  As far as I can tell, shaman are totally beatdown and willing to accept whatever bone The Man gives them.<br />
<br />
This isn't a brand new ability/spell, this is something that we've had since L1 and only in the last few expansions got left behind in by sins of omission.  A bug (or balance) fix should not require the user to put in work that rightfully is on the shoulders of the devs and designers.<br />

<br />
The HoT is NOT an effective tool.  It's good for down time healing.  It won't allow you to control burst dps.  You can't time a HoT tic.  You can time a burst heal.  Tics seem to be fixed to a clock.  Every six seconds as to 1 clock, not six seconds from cast.  Notice how all your DoT tics hit at once?  Even some you JUST finished casting?  However they set it up, you can't time HoTs because you don't know when that first tic will go off.<br />
<br />
Also, some of you folks really need to remember that we aren't primary healers.  We're back up healers.  That's what we've evolved into.  We darn sure don't need a 2000+ base heal or a new CH.  That's infringing on druid territory.<br />
<br />
The reason most of us selected 1800(ish) as our base number, is that was what we felt would accomplish our goals of giving us enough breathing room to (a) risk a slow again if one bounced, (b) risk a cannabalize, or (c) do some kind of damage.  1800 is a BASE number after which AA and healing focus could be added.  1500 is a pretty weak response.<br />
<br />
Max AA = 19% increase from base.<br />
Marr's Gift = random 25% increase from base<br />
<br />
A 300 hp base difference can equate up to 432 difference.  That's at least a bash healed!  :p<br />
<br />
Those numbers aren't inconsequential, especially when chaining heals.<br />

<br />
The HoT is NOT an effective tool.  It's good for down time healing.  It won't allow you to control burst dps.  You can't time a HoT tic.  You can time a burst heal.  Tics seem to be fixed to a clock.  Every six seconds as to 1 clock, not six seconds from cast.  Notice how all your DoT tics hit at once?  Even some you JUST finished casting?  However they set it up, you can't time HoTs because you don't know when that first tic will go off.<br />
<br />
Also, some of you folks really need to remember that we aren't primary healers.  We're back up healers.  That's what we've evolved into.  We darn sure don't need a 2000+ base heal or a new CH.  That's infringing on druid territory.<br />
<br />
The reason most of us selected 1800(ish) as our base number, is that was what we felt would accomplish our goals of giving us enough breathing room to (a) risk a slow again if one bounced, (b) risk a cannabalize, or (c) do some kind of damage.  1800 is a BASE number after which AA and healing focus could be added.  1500 is a pretty weak response.<br />
<br />
Max AA = 19% increase from base.<br />
Marr's Gift = random 25% increase from base<br />
<br />
A 300 hp base difference can equate up to 432 difference.  That's at least a bash healed!  :p<br />
<br />
Those numbers aren't inconsequential, especially when chaining heals.<br />
<br />

Your assertion that we don't need a 2k heal or that it would put us on the same healing level as druids is absurd.  You think that 2000 vs 1800 is too much, but you complain that 1550 is too little.  So 250 down from 1800 is too little and 200 up from it is too much.  These mob can double from 1200..that is 2400hp's.  I'm pretty sure that being able to heal one round isn't TOO much healing.  It is morons like you that keep us from ever getting what we NEED.</div></div><hr />

Dude...<br />
<br />
If your opinion is that Shamans should be on par with Druids HPS(healing per Second) wise, because of the superior offensive capabilities, that's fine. But you can't accuse Chutoi of something like this. It makes you look bad and I promise you you will get flamed pretty bad.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after doing my analysis there's a few things that became really obvious to me:<br />
<br />
1) A 1550 heal doesn't cut it at all<br />
<br />
2) Even a 1800 heal would not allow me to outheal a cleric on fully slowable mobs by a HUGE margin(The Cleric's tank would end the 30 second fight with a surplus of 9k HP on top of the full damage healed and the Shaman is barely able to heal the tank to full by the end of the encounter. This is ridiculous for non mitigating mobs.)<br />
<br />
3) A Shaman needs to be as good a healer(better imo actually) as a Cleric without a slower on fully slowable mobs, but in order to achieve that, the Shaman would have to heal significantly better than the Druid can currently, which would pose a problem.<br />
<br />
4) Shaman AND Druid heals need to be upgraded to make them viable healers. The Shaman needs to be able to heal as well as a Cleric(imo better actually) without a slower and the Druid has to be able to be a viable substitute for a Cleric for most mobs outisde of raids(or boss mobs in single group trials) in exchange of a DPS upgrade to Shamans. <br />
Clerics would still offer Pacification, Blessing of Reverance, Virtue, DvA and in general more effective and efficient heals on top of Resurrection for those mobs.<br />
<br />
In short, the etire healing needs to be revamped. I do not suppose this is going to happen before the new expansion will come around. What I am asking for currently is a 1800ish heal with a 1 second cast time and a 5 second refresh to be able to speed up my healing after Slow and be a viable secondary healer for EVERYTHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">When people get terrified about shamans healing, they tend to forget we have so many other things to do first.  By the time our first heal even lands, a lot of time has gone by, and with mobs hitting as hard as they do these days, that's makes the point even more critical.<br />
<br />
But regardless, our heals don't get cast for quite a while.  So even with drastic improvement, the real-life healing a shaman does won't be enough to kick any clerics or main healers out of groups, unless for some reason they don't want the shaman to slow or debuff.  In which case, why would they have invited us in the first place?  Certainly not for our DPS or our tanking or anything else.  So in practical terms, everything a shaman can do besides debuff and slow looks much scarier to other classes than it really should, since we can't go at our healing or DPS full blast all through a fight anyway -- far, far from it.<br />
<br />
Heck, I've often, when playing my SK's, seen people start to plant DOTs and DD's on mobs before they've even gotten back to the group(people's expectations of SK aggro are virtually infinite).  And I've seen clerics start to cast CH before the tank even has any damage taken off him.  Shaman heals and DPS(ugh) will never be used that way.  Whatever we get, our bark remains worse than our bite because we can't even take a bite till we're done setting the table for everyone else and they're halfway through the meal.</div></div><hr />

Why should I not accuse him of it, that is exactly what he said. <br />
<br />
He said a 2k heal would be too much and that it would be infringing upon druid territory.  That is ABSURD.  That somehow getting closer to the healing power of a druid is somehow wrong.  If druids are going to keep a far superior DPS advantage to offset our ability to slow, then we should be on par with them on spot healing.  I call em like I see it, and if he wants to spout stuff like this, I'm going to call him on it. Did you read his post?</div></div><hr />

It's perfectly fine to disagree with him on how Shaman healing should compare to Druid healing at thispoint of the game when factoring in other utilities. It just doesn't make sense to accuse him of holding us back since he has been one of the more vocal people &quot;crusading&quot; for improvements in our healing capabilities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">When I rolled my shaman, back before Velious came out, shaman heals were exactly the same as druid ones right up to level 60, where they got Nature's Recovery and we got Torpor.<br />
<br />
One thing that prompted me to start my shaman was when I was grouped with my ranger in The Overthere, and a shaman was the group healer. I can't remember his name, but he was great - kept a whole group all buffed and healed. I'd never really grouped with a shaman that much before, and it impressed me.<br />
<br />
Then SOE looked at healing, decided that clerics shouldn't be the only choice as group healers, and added %age heals, giving druids a better one than shamans. I remember the outcry here about that.<br />
<br />
Ever since then, druids have been the second heal heal class, and shamans have been a poor third, some might say fourth after paladins.<br />
<br />
I like healing, I don't want to replace a cleric, but I like being a backup healer and saving lives in a pinch.<br />
<br />
However, as it stands in GoD, clerics are essential, druids are backup healers and shamans are asked along if there's no enchanter available.<br />
<br />
We're back to the point of clerics being the only choice for main healer, and often a group will have another cleric or a druid along as backup healer. A shaman is there for slows. People just aren't looking at shamans as healers at all.<br />
<br />
I just want our healing to be upgraded to the point where we can pass as a backup healer in GoD, to give groups more options for classes. Whether these changes do that or not remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

I should have known better than posting those numbers. None are as blind as those who don't want to see. You THINK your Shaman is powerful, big difference.<br />
<br />
Adding time to my analysis wouldn't be realistic, since shorter fights would just hurt the Shaman more than longer fights would help him. You realize that the analysis was comparing a Druid without a slower and a Shaman in an environment where mobs don't mitigate slow at all?<br />
<br />
Do you realize that I gave the Shaman in my analysis a 20% detrimental haste focus item?<br />
<br />
Do you realize that I didn't factor in any resists for Slows?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I gave you the numbers under realistic conditions, which in many cases were actually favoring the Shaman, yet you are convincing yourself that you are important.<br />
Here's news for you, if you up the mob DPS in my analysis so that a Druid needs a slower to be able to heal, a Shaman can simply NOT heal in that environment, period. I am done explaining. <br />

I will agree with this statement to a certain extent, but I truly think that a 1700-1800 heal would put us into the &quot;solid Back-up healer&quot; role, and when you add in our debuff utility our desirability goes up some. I think adding in a fast 1Kish nuke would put us into the &quot;Lets get the shaman, he can back up heal, slow, and drop a few quick nukes&quot; role that we all REALLY desire (i.e. Some Healing, Some Debuffing, Some Offense, thats MY definition of a Shaman). However, a 1700-1800 heal would DEFINITELY put us into the &quot;Viable Main Group Healer for All Content pre-Gates, including LDoN Hard&quot; category, and this is what I think SOE is afraid of. <br />
<br />
Personally, I dont want to be a cleric. I dont want to be a wizard either. I want to be a little of everything. Thats how my spell list reads. The GAME itself is what is passing us by. Shorter fights, debuff mitigation, faster harder-hitting mobs. Its not just us that is feeling the sting here. Every other class except the &quot;Holy Trinity of EQ&quot; is feeling the pinch. For myself, and I am speaking ONLY for myself, I will accept the role of &quot;Back-up Healer who offers utility no other healer has (slow)&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I am not disagreeing with you completely here. I just happen to think you picked out a scenario that only exists in a very small percentage of the games current content. If you can name 5 places where your &quot;scenario&quot; exists, I will concede your point and never question you again. Even LDoN hard mobs last more than 30 seconds unless you got a couple chanters with charmed pets. <br />
<br />
Lets take another example, ok? The Soldiers in Castle 1 in Fire. They hit 600-800 ish, pretty fast, they dont have TONS of hps, the fights last in the 1 minute range. I cast Malos before it takes its first swing. Please run those numbers for me. How about Earth-left ledge? Lets run those. Those frogs and gators are fairly nasty buggers. BTW, with a Sharkspine and no Gates spells, I SOLOED a Gator in Earth. And I am not even really an EP level shaman, most of my gear is VT. So lets see some 1 minute fights, no cast time for Malos (feel free to factor in 2 seconds for spell gem refresh, though, k?)<br />
<br />
Every single class in this game that doesnt start with a &quot;W&quot;, a &quot;C&quot; or an &quot;E&quot; is relatively unimportant now, dude. Our job is to find a niche we can enjoy and be realistically effective in. By all means, fight for us to get the heal we deserve, I am ON YOUR SIDE! But SOE is not going to overcompensate us and completely trivialize 97% of the games content, especially their prescious PoP. <br />
<br />
Maybe instead of so much complaining about our abilities, we should be complaining about the GAME. <br />
<br />
The bottom line here Giac, as is the case in other threads, is that I am truly on your side. I just think that sometimes, some of us go OVERBOARD in the way we look at situations and abilities. SOE is going to give us a bit less than we deserve, same as they give every other class in the game. So push for a 1900, 2.0 second cast heal, and accept it when they give us 1700 with a 2.9 cast time, ok? Personally, I highly doubt we will even see that, but I am not gonna lose any sleep over it.</div></div><hr />

If your groups wear average gear and you're not experiencing the issues we do, there's no need to debate really.

Oh, one other thing I forgot to mention in MY scenarios. My pattern of casting is . . . Malos as mob runs in (I usually jog ahead a bit toward the puller), Slow as the MA engauges, Tnargs the MA, Quies the MA, Tnargs the MA, Bane the mob, re-Quies the MA, Tnargs the MA as needed. I realize that your scenarios don't offer an oppertunity to sneal in Quieses, since you cannot even begin casting Malos before the fight even begins. It doesnt take much to distort the numbers Giac.

I gave the Shaman a 20% detrimental haste focus(2nd best in game currently). I assumed the Shaman will never get a resist on Slow after Malos. <br />
Even if(which I really want to dismiss, before this becomes common thinking) the Shaman was able to land Malos before the mob hits the &quot;camp&quot;(remember that you don't really pull from a huge distance to a camp anymore) reliably, do you really think the Shaman would look better when factoring in every detail? <br />
I want to remind you as well, that if *anything* goes wrong in 1 of 100 fights, you have a dead tank probably, while the Druid's tank will never really be in danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">However, a 1700-1800 heal would DEFINITELY put us into the &quot;Viable Main Group Healer for All Content pre-Gates, including LDoN Hard&quot; category, and this is what I think SOE is afraid of. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not an EP shaman, I don't have ubber equipement (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39191), but if you give me a mob I can slow, then I can be main healer like I always used to be since my youngest levels!<br />
<br />
Fact is that with most mobs that are no more slowable or mitigate a lot, I cannot do my job anymore (regardless if it's GOD related or not).<br />
<br />
Our healing power has been reduced to nothing, even pally heal better than us nowdays. (not a rant, just a fact)<br />
<br />
In a regular exp group, I can be main healer in Kael, Velks, Old Seb, I can be main healer in POJ, PON, POI, POD, PON, POV, POS... I even can be main healer in BOT, POTA, HOH if I'm carefull and when my slow is not resisted (or if I have a good tank that can take a lot of damage untill I can patch-heal him).<br />
<br />
I can be main healer because mobs don't hit so hard once slowed... but if I get a resist, I'm dead, so my group is if they didn't evac in time. :)<br />
Simple fact.<br />
<br />
Now we are facing mobs that can't be slowed or hit so hard once slowed that we can't even survive this.<br />
<br />
So, I'm sorry but having a new (1800 base) fast heal won't change what we can already do in old content. But will greatly help us survive and then have our group survive in the highest zones.<br />
<br />
And at the end, have fun in this game, because there is no fun dying on every &quot;INC %T&quot;.<br />
<br />
Is SOE afraid of letting us do what we always did ??? Will this new heal trivialize old content? Certainly not because it is already trivial.<br />
<br />

We now(on test) match, percentage-wise, the  upgrades clerics and druids got to their fast heals.<br />
That still does not account for<br />
- shaman getting lesser and fewer upgrades for Velious, Luclin, PoP, LDoN and GoD<br />
- shorter fight durations<br />
- slow mitigation<br />
<br />
Considering what we lost asking for another 250 HPs on our spot heal and some sort of healing AA (or a shorter cast and longer recast on the spell) does not seem like much.<br />
Let Tnarg's go live as it is on test now, put the new spell on a vendor in Kod'Taz, put the heal AA in the GoD section. No older content trivialized, and shaman healing gets adjusted appropriate for the content / expansion they are in.<br />
<br />
I see people all the time bashing Quesance as not good enough Or useless. Or whatever.<br />
In GoD it is. Really. It is a supersized regen. That does not mean it is a bad spell. But it is not a heal.<br />
<br />
But do you still have it memed? Of course. Will it heal everything we need. No. But useing it plus blast heals is a pretty fine option to me.<br />
It is not a fine option to me. It does not solve shaman stacking issues on raids. It will not let me be a secondary healer. And it will get overwritten by the cleric version (or not take hold in the first place). Being mana efficient - the only thing Quiescence is useful for for us - does not do us any good if we cannot keep the tank alive in the first place.<br />
<br />
Will it be enough. I dont know. But it is true to the shaman class.<br />
It won't. I am not sure if a 1800 spot heal + my proposed spirit shift AA will be enough. But I would be willing to give those two a try. I am  very sure merely bringing us back in line with the cleric and druid enhancement will not cut it - we were already behind the curve in PoP and LDoN.</div></div><hr />

I am not the whining type, and love playing shaman even without these upgrades - but I am absolutely tickled to get a healing improvement.<br />
<br />
My only complaint now is that GoD spells still seem unduly difficult to obtain. Additionally, the &quot;Ancient&quot; status of the Cannibalize 4 upgrade spell is really depressing. Since I have zero Ancient spells to date, I suspect I will never have my Cannibalize upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u207"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p207">Will the current upgrade allow the average GoD shaman to keep the cleric alive for one or two rounds of attention from an unslowed Gates of Discord mob while the tank gets aggro back, either due to an add or a CH timing problem? I dont think so. Show me the numbers, and I will bow to your wisdom. I would think clerics would want a better fast heal for shaman and druids, with a lot less mana efficiency, so that we could not use the fast heal as a substitute for their efficient CHs.  <br />
<br />
In fact, every class in the game should want druids and shaman to equal clerics in fast heal cast time, refresh time, and amount healed. The mana efficiency should be tuned so that even shaman with the best aa's and focus items and CanniV and the best spells could not chain cast the quick heal in a Gates of Discord encounter.  Perhaps the efficiency ratios for quick heal should equal the dps ratios they are focusing on now, or perhaps the efficiency should be tuned down from those ratios.<br />
<br />
Quick heals should allow any healer to save the cleric who gets aggro from one unslowed mob or from one unslowed add for at least the amount of time it takes a warrior to reestablish aggro. Otherwise, the other &quot;priest&quot; classes are useless as back up healers.</div></div><hr />

I have never cared nor discussed about where spells should be dropping.<br />

<br />
Where do I argue against a bigger heal? I have been saying all along I like the number 1700. Puts it around 2200 with focus + AA. I can live with that. I think SOE can too. I think 1800 is a good number to push for, so we can get 1700 maybe. But thats it. Any more and we BECOME primary healers 90% of the time and thats not what *I* want as a Shaman. I dont want to be the only healer in groups on raids. I dont want to be the only healer in MOST situations in this game, period. Personally, I would much much rather see the game itself adjust back to where our BEST features, debuffs and DOTs, play a larger role. Pretty soon, it will be 10 second fights on yard trash that quads for 2K where you NEED everyone to start casting their biggest nuke as the mob is incoming. Thats when the other &quot;W&quot; class will start to shine again, LOL.<br />
<br />
As for aggro, I cannot speak for Gates, I havent spent much time there (havent spent much playing at all recently due to RL complications) but do the mobs not aggro on the healers there? Especially early in fights, before the MA has built up a bunch of aggro? Can most druids survive a couple unslowed rounds of combat from the stuff thats a &quot;problem&quot;? So far, after speaking to the shaman in my guild, they are saying that our current healing set up is adequate for MOST tasks in Gates, with the exception of a few of the more difficult trials, you know, the ones where 7 or 8 classes are feeling the same uselessness as shaman are. <br />
<br />
Honestly Giac and veeshen, I am not here to disagree with what you are saying or what you are trying to accomplish. I just think that you guys are WAY over the top in your zealousness. Our class is very playable in 98% of the game as-is, right this second. We are not perfect at anything, thats our nature. Jack of all trades, master of none (yeah, used to be master of slow, but thats been getting phased out some). For SOE to adjust us up to the level you &quot;seem&quot; to want for that other 2%, I think it would over-compensate. They won't do that. Maybe we are taking the wrong approach. Maybe a 1550 heal is enough, added to the changes to BOT, if the GAME is adjusted so that every single class (except the Big 3) isn't getting hosed by that same 2% of the content we are. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I have pretty much decided not to post on the subject anymore. I will take what they give me, and smile, maybe gritting my teeth while smiling, but smile all the same. But eventually, I will find my niche, settle into it, and play the game, because I enjoy being a shaman. You guys have been arguing that we haven't been adequate to the task since PoP came out (i.e. we cannot heal as well as druids on slow vs unslowed, or that clerics are far better in LDoN than we are, etc etc). Gee, thats kinda curious, cause I have been having the time of my life in my inadequate state. I dont need statistics to tell me if I am having fun or not.</div></div><hr />

That 98% of the game argument is bull****. Unless you are talking about older content which does make no ****ing sense to include in a balance discussion. Its rather obvious that you aren't at the stage(and seem to have no qualifications either) to recognize the issues. <br />
<br />
I am wasting my time, because you refuse to look beyond your situation(which, if you play in PoP is far from being fine for Shamans I might add). The game needs to be balanced from the top down, so I *can't* look at your situation which is what you are insinuating and want me to do.<br />
SoE needs to pick out a few of each class who have tons of experience and talk about balance issues. People who really know the game and other classes on top of their own. As it stands, there's a handful of Shamans on these boards who have the insight to be able to see how changes affect us.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself where people like Jinheim and Valsuvious are who were not seeing these issues to be that bad?<br />
Last I checked Jinheim quit because he wouldn't get GoD groups and Valsuvious, finally converted, was arguing FOR Shaman healing upgrades on the cleric boards, because he was the only Shaman ever invited to succesful Ikkinz trials on his server or guild, when I was bitching about our state for months.</div></div><hr />

Why don't you start a group for LDoN hard or elementals and see how many of your guildies will join a group with a Shaman as main healer for them. <br />

I have never touched the argument of where that new Shaman healing should be dropping because it's pointless. A 1800 heal won't be trivializing early GoD tiers, nor LDoN hard or PoP, since even that won't enable us to heal as well as Clerics. It won't trivialize any content that isn't already sufficiently trivial, so what's the point?<br />

Alright, I don't know whether you are just stupid or ignorant or both. I was primary healing just fine for over 3 years, before the gap became so huge. You claim you have been playing this game for 5 years, how come you don't know that?<br />
I have been playing this game since the very first day and the Shaman class was a main healer and slow was irrelevant for us till Torgor's(caps don't work with me btw). <br />
Nowadays, if you can't main heal a group for the common trash, there is no way in hell you will be invited as a secondary healer for slow immune mobs. <br />
In fact, there's nothing that justifies bringing a Druid or a Shaman over a second Cleric to the Ikkinz trials(this isn't even the GoD endgame, mind you).

Er, pretty sure I mentioned that I have done both of these things. Its not stuff I wish to do every day, but its doable. For the record, I duo the soldiers in Fire Castle 1 quite a bit with just an SK or Paladin. Pretty sure Fire is an EP, isnt it? Done a couple LDoN hards, with a chanter on slows, me as healer, Paladin as back up heals and MA.

My shaman started as a twink, had a Manastone and Rubi BP the day he was born (well, when he hit level 6 that is, or whatever level it was at the time where your corpse didnt poof), but regardless, through Kunark, when I switched mains, my shaman was RARELY expected to be the main healer of any group. Buffs, debuffs, back up healing. Thats been my role since . . . forever. <br />
<br />
Gates went live something like a month ago. A month after LDoN went live, NO ONE did LDoN hard without a cleric. Now, its quite common for a single druid, or 2 shaman, or whatever to handle this stuff. Nothing really changed. People just learned HOW to beat them. <br />

There's a difference between being able to contribute as a healer and becoming a cleric. When your doing a single group mob that hits for over 2k a hit a 1300hps heal is a joke, even a 1550 isn't enough to be effective. If you want to get picky tho I started my shaman because my roommate was a barb warrior and wanted a healer to group with and we didn't know how to get from qeynos to halas at the time, lol.</div></div><hr />

I think the real issue here is that you are stuck on healing as though that is the only thing shaman can do, when that is not the case. The problem with you guys is that you focus on one issue in isolation and dont look at the big picture. Then you move onto another issue and do the same thing. You are clearly following a political agenda to suit your own style of play and no argument is going to change that. And equally obviously you are going to get support since who is going to say no to freebies, especially if someone else gets them for you?<br />
<br />
In my experience so far with nameds in IK groups with druids and shaman as secondary healers have performed just as well, plus they bring other things to the group as well. Now, I'm sure that is a limited subset and in absolute terms a cleric should be better, but the facts on the ground suggest that the difference is not as large as you have us believe. It seems that luck and timing play a big role in whether you succeed or not. Having a slower is pretty much essential there even though the nameds themselves are unslowable (you ever tried tanking an unslowed yellow con Kyv before?). Shaman are great in that role since they can switch over to healing on the nameds when the time comes. You know, seriously, you really mean to tell me that you have NOTHING to contribute in these trials? Give me a break.<br />
<br />
One other point, from my experiences as a warrior, when your class takes it upon themselves at every opportunity to tell everyone how much they suck, others will take them at their word, even if it is not true, and turn it into a self fulfilling prophecy.</div></div><hr />

Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Daluda's Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Your fundamentals assumption are showing... Obviously, the Shamans must heal less, and less efficiently than Druids. This was assumption was flawed when it was introduced a year and a half ago, right before PoP. The changes in the game since have just made matter worse.<br />
<br />
The idea that druid heals should be better than shaman heals was unjustified right before PoP, when the first incomplete heals were introduced. Even then, in the upper tiers of challenging encounters for an exp group, the damage mitigation of Slow did not compensate for the lesser heals, especially considering the mana expanditure and time cost required to LAND slow.<br />
<br />
It went from unjustified to utterly ridiculous with PoP, when the druids got several healing upgrades and shamans were stuck with that pop-gun heal that Tnarg is. Slow mitigation was just the last nail in the coffin of shaman healing, given that even if the MOBs were fully slowable in tier 3 and elemental zones, there would be no way that shaman could heal as economically as a druid (who would, at the same time, be putting out a level of DPS shamans where never NEAR achieving).<br />
<br />
In Gates, the absolute lack of instant heal upgrade was so far removed of what is needed by the shamans it could only be described as delusional. That 1550 heal is just a 'day late and dollar short' version of what Tnarg was to PoP, i.e. next-to useless.<br />
<br />
This is not a call to nerf the druids. That class is working admirably well, with a nice  balance of utility, heals and offense. I just wish I could say the same about the shamans. And heals are just one of the many facets that need a serious review and overhaul, not just the throwing of a bone.</div></div><hr />

Jeez, what is this?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, shaman were traditionally HEALERS.  Notwithstanding the experiences of super-twinked gamers like Blazz, or the cynicism of Tugela, shaman classically functioned as HEALERS who also had a slow spell.  <br />
<br />
As we leveled along, what we did primarily was heal, and slow was a tool that was balanced against the druid DS/snare/track/evac.  <br />
<br />
It was not until PoP that there grew to become meaningful differences in the ability of druids to heal over shaman.  So if shaman weren't healers, neither were druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While its true I was well twinked to get into my 40s, once Kunark came out I was basically on the lower side of the gear table. However, it was almost ALWAYS my experience that a Shaman was brought to a group for UTILITY and back up healing, not PRIMARY healing. Doing things like OT yard, Dreadlands Ruins, OS camps, etc etc, the groups I played in invariably had healing, and needed me for debuffs and buffs, with some minor offensive power to boot in my DOTs. <br />
<br />
In short, I was never a HEALER who had a slow spell, I was a SLOWER-BUFFER who had a heal spell. <br />
<br />
/shrug, your experiences may vary, but thats how I have defined my roles in this game for a long long time.</div></div><hr />

There's a chance that an SOE representative might post here to discuss shaman concerns. We have wanted this for a long time.<br />
<br />
I will be moderating any such threads very strictly. Everyone should remain polite and focused on shaman issues. No personal attacks, no attacks on SOE, no attacks on issues which are irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I will delete posts and grant one week suspensions. You have been warned. This is not up for discussion.<br />
