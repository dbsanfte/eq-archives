<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone here know much about Lucy's item collector?  I've been using it for a while but it has yet to upload my inferno chain sleeves, so something ain't right.  The people in their own bugs forum have been, erm, less than responsive.  :p  But I have a new item, durn it, I wanna add it!  The following is what I posted on their boards a few weeks ago.  I've just left it running since, but no change.<br />
<br />
At first it was in quiet mode, but taking it out of that didn't help.  So I dinked around with the Network Interface option in the settings. The default that it was on previously was &quot;NdisWan Adapter&quot; while the other option that I tried now is &quot;Intel(R) PRO Adapter&quot;. I tried switching between the two while logged in, zoning a couple times when it said &quot;Desync detected, zone or relog to reset.&quot; Here is the entire transcript, with the port #s turned into XXXX because I don't know if they'd give anything away to unfriendly hacker types: <br />

Each time I zoned after switching to the Intel, I immediately checked and it was already saying &quot;Desync detected...&quot;, so it's losing the connection immediately. The NdisWan doesn't even look like it's trying...? <br />
<br />
Can anyone turn this into suggestions on how I can get the collector to collect?</div></div><hr />
