<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally got around to making a magelo for him. Take a peek if you get a chance and point out any nice gear upgrades you can think of, please ;)<br />
<br />
Will get him some thurg stuff soon. Will be moving from the wurmy to a lammy/captains guard mallet when he hits 40. Mostly looking for armor suggestions. Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and that bow listed in the profile is the wrong one, I can't remember the name of the one I am using off the top of my head. Will take a look tonight and update it.<br />
<br />
1 day 11 hours played so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats sick except wurmys are horrible for MT warriors .... damn you have better gear then me at 55 lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">whats that sash on yer shammy??<br />
<br />
Why u need the fungy tunic??? You have better grp regen from yer shaman....oh twinkon same account?   ic<br />
<br />
your weapons are way too slow,  depends on how much your spending!   for cheep try-  venomous axe in primary 85 dd proc, defiance in offhand (fst and has ac)<br />
<br />
get helm of the raldulkhan if u got pp its ac 26 with nice stats. maybe wrethced pauldrons for ya shoulders ac 19<br />
<br />
seahorse bracer?  try dragon hero  low ac nice resists<br />
<br />
Keep ur piersing skill up, and get bloodpoints at 45, although if u not 2 boxing maybe ur dex is too low for this- good procs, crap ratio<br />
<br />
get more cobalt gear,  its mostly 1k a piece on my server, and ac 25 is nice!  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If ur not 2 boxing, do /w 25 30 cleric all<br />
<br />
send tells and duo with em on spectres or similar (they can fear em) cuts yer downtime, and u suk most of the exp!&quot;<br />
<br />
MAKE FRIEND WITH A CLERIC OR 2 THEN SELL THE FUNGY AND BUY SOME nice WEAPONS LIKE FROST BRINGER  FLESHGRINDER ETC<br />
<br />
oops sorry about caps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As soon as you get him (or if you get him) on CoV, you can do this one...<br />
<br />
Draconic Pauldrons Quest at Allakhazam's (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2277) <br />
<br />
Other than that, getting a Bracelet of Fortitude (12 AC, 15 STA, 6 all saves) Might be nice.<br />
<br />
Other than that as far as armor, I would definitely concentrate on the boots/helm/range slot, in no particular order. Get him a Grodan's Idol (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7164)  for that range slot. Just camp'em out in ME and have him standing by to loot it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First of all, this warrior is on a separate account and has been PL'd with shaman buffs up to his current level, and will probably get PL'd all the way to at least 50 or 55. So taunt isn't really a concern at this point, its just big damage and fast killing. <br />
<br />
oogha: Sash is no drop from Ssra. I've been wearing the fungi on the warrior + regrowth while PLing him in Kaesora, generally fighting 3-5 mobs at a time. 40 points a tick is alot when they are only hitting for 40-60 max.  ;)  Stats on this guy while PLing are generally 235+ all the way around with focus/carnage, so proccing will not be a problem. Again the concern is big damage atm. I think i'll be changing that 2hs out soon for something bigger. <br />
<br />
Btw Iksar cannot wear cobalt<br />
<br />
Not selling the fungi, money is not much of a problem. Will outfit him in lots of CT gear/weapons once he gets to 51.<br />
<br />
<br />
ThatDumbGuy: Good suggestions, actually there are a ton of things I want to get him from ME. That idol, the shoulders, that axe, that belt ( whenever I find a haste upgrade that isnt a belt ).<br />
<br />
Have a nightmare compound bow waiting for him when he is high enough.<br />
<br />
What is the next logical progression in droppable haste? I cant really camp him a CoF, would have to buy one. 50k sound decent for one? Can't remember the last time I saw one for sale. What about the seahorse belt? I could go camp that without much trouble.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With you power leveling him, you should go all sta/hps (duh) cause he'll be 60 in no time and will get full use of sta. With that said, Clattering bone necklace, braclet of forditude, keep the girdle and get a hiero cloak. Hiero cloak you'll have for a long while unless ya gonna get a seb cloak/CoF. <br />
<br />
For weapons: <br />
Fleshgrinder (duh)<br />
fungus encrusted hammer<br />
longsword of etheral energy<br />
Wrapped Entropy Serpent Spine<br />
Blade of the Black Dragon Eye <br />
spiked velium malet <br />
or a windblade for 2hs.<br />
Those are nice damage. <br />
<br />
Edit: You'll also wanna think about an earing of solstice, and one of them 35hp/25mana ones.<br />
<br />
Waredan 61 Oracle<br />
Tunare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, windblade would be great; so would a fast 2hb.  At 51, he can use the tae ew war maul, 33/36 and 65 hps; quick skill builder and decent weapon and cheap.<br />
<br />
Frostbringer is nice, and procs very low level -- I think already at your level, can't remember.<br />
<br />
I'd get more HP gear too.  The collar of undead protection was a good suggestion.<br />
<br />
Crystal spider eyes for face; some dex items would be nice to swap in when you're wanting to max offensive/weapons skills -- shissar scaled headpiece comes to mind, I think it has 12 or 15 dex.  Helps to make up for dex minuses of the fungi.<br />
<br />
But what's going to help most of all is doing damage faster, which is probably more a matter of haste than weapons, once you have at least reasonable weapons, which you more or less do, some better than others.  If you're keeping him out of group to level, especially, cuz then you're waiting for him to do damage to 51% before you can sic the doggy on the mob or whatever.  RBG is only 27% haste; there's plenty faster haste out there.  RBB, at 31%, would be nice whenever you can afford it; it's about 20k to 25k more expensive than RBG, but you'll definitely see a difference.  <br />
<br />
Haste and hitpoints are going to be your gods overall with a melee, though hitpoints are a lot less vital when you have a high level shaman around to slow and heal for a twink.  Then, the quality of weapons leaps up in importance.<br />
<br />
But any melee has to save for something like an RBB or COF or COM just like a shaman has to save up for torpor(unless you get lucky and loot it -- not likely for most of us).  If you aren't prioritizing haste now, do it soon -- and the sooner the better, really.  You'd be surprised what a difference 5% makes in powerleveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Drop your earrings for electrum BS ones, 35 hp each from those. <br />
<br />
wurmslayer is good damage untill about lvl 40-45, after that you`ll want to grab a lower delay weapon like a lammy for main hand.<br />
<br />
Your next cheapest haste upgrade is probably a rbb, 31% haste, 10 sta but lower ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bought a lammy and a defiance, been toying with them. Honestly I dont like using both at the same time, the damage output sucks. Lammy mainhand and LSoEE offhand seem to be my favorite combo atm. (defiance looks like a centi shortsword! rotfl!)<br />
<br />
The seahorse haste belt that drops in Sirens Ghetto, anyone know where it drops? I'd like to pharm one up.<br />
<br />
Exp starting to get thin at lvl 39 in Kaesora...gunna try bloodgills next. Not sure there are enough spawns tho :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know this isn't the primary point of this thread, but for nice exp at his level, hit CoM.  I PL'd my warrior from 1-52 with 3aa's in under 5 days /played, and pretty much all of the mid 30's up to 52 was in CoM.  Start at the entrance, then move to the temple when he gets a little older.  Pull with the shammy and you'll get singles no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ahhhhhyeah CoM, almost forgot. Love that zone.<br />
<br />
When he gets 45 or so prolly gunna hit up Howling Stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">chardok is a nice place also. Kinda rivals HS in that its a little less complicated and has a wide range of things to kill. Good exp also. Loot is pretty common as well.... you know the deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Plowed thru level 39 in CoM last night, indeed good exp. Pulled the entrance and over into the stables. ( some shaman was there trying to get the spec. courier to pop and wanted help ) Not too bad of exp. Probably going to stay there until 45 and then hit up chardok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmmm... exp in CoM isnt quite as good as I thought it would be. did 40-41 last night, entrance, stables, then moved to the goo house after a while. Would kedge keep be better?</div></div><hr />
