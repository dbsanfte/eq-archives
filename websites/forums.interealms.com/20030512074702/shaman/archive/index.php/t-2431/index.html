<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gexo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have hear that the students log for epic quest is a random drop in CoM...I have also heard  it drops off someone specific, (do not remember whom it is supposed to drop from).<br />
<br />
I currently have the other 5 pages, the 3 books, and high scale icon all taking up bank space because i cant find this piece.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have seen the Spectral Courier Spawn in any of those front locations.  Seen in the stables, on the balconies, one of the 3 at the gate and even one of the 2 before the bridge.  Never seen in the temple but I assume it is a possibility as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've only seen the spectral courier pop in two specific locations in the stables, never anywhere else.  Not saying it's not possible, but between 2 toons, I've hunted 20 levels in there.<br />
<br />
If you run to the back of the hallway into the stables and turn around, one pop will be in the door on your left, into the door on the back left, then all the way into the back of that room.  The other one is in the door to the right from the hallway, then the 1st door immediately on your left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So long ago when I got these, but I _think_ I actually looted this off something else than the courier. There was some group in CoM (plus me soloing for my bits and pieces) and I asked if they could keep eye out for the student log and they got it from one kill and I dashed to loot.<br />
<br />
All those pieces and ghiosk books too me many slots from bank for quite many months heehee damn glad to get rid of em :p<br />
<br />
Well cause I can't say anything with 100% accuracy, I would just suggest try to get a few friends (can't rely on pickup groups in CoM) and make some exp while there and try to kill as much as possible while waiting for it to drop.</div></div><hr />
