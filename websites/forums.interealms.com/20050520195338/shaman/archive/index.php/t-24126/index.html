<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's also great for those times where you can cast levy/invis/summon horse whatever in those seconds before the port.  Great for avoiding those trains to the zone line or whatever too.  Now you don't have to worry so much about zoning into an area and getting smoked off the bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup. Totally agree with you on that. I have been wondering however (haven't gotten around to trying it) if you can do a run by &quot;I WISH TO GO HOME  &quot; and keep running. Like to know if you still get ported shortly thereafter. hmm. I think I will try that tomorrow .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The port in to WoS is a bit odd.  That Dragorn Champ is too close to that place for my comfort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sustenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just thought it wasn't working the first time I used it lol. But yeah it is cool to be able cast invis if ya need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Am I missing something, or can the PoD boot you directly to somewhere like WoS?  I don't see where he ports you to in Dranik's as a very dangerous place.</div></div><hr />

I hate this.  Everything runs so fast, you can barely leave a train behind, or not possible at all.<br />
What happens in GoD when I get a train in Natimbi?  I run to magus, have the &quot;nedaria&quot; already typed out, and zone the moment I get there, leaving the train back in the water out of aggro.<br />
What happens in OoW when I get a train?  I run to PoD, type &quot;go home&quot;, wait for the train to catch up to me and hope I live long enough to port, then port off to pok, leaving the train of mobs to kill everyone that's afkish at the zone in.<br />
Ya.  Great change...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So in GoD the poor schmucks who are afk near the port-in spot get your train and you don't, whereas in OoW you have to eat it too?<br />
<br />
I don't know how you play, so I'm not accusing you personally of doing that, but I know there are a LOT of idiots out there who DO do stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Keep running.  I had a paladin friend try it on his horse, and it still ported him.<br />
<br />
Do a run by with the trigger phrase typed out, and keep on hauling ass.  I believe the range is 1000 feet.  The paladin couldn't get out of the way at full speed on their holy steed (ie, almost top bard speed).<br />

Yer can understand why it would upset you.Theres nothing i used to enjoy more than zoning into natimbi magus and being whacked  by a bunch of nocs etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The PoD will port you no matter how far away you run from him once you have said &quot; i wish to go to discord&quot;.  I'm Iksar, the guards in kelethin HATE me but I use the kelethin pod everytime I head to oow.  The Kelething POD sits directly under the warrior guild and is next to guards, they all aggro eveytime I use the PoD.<br />
<br />
Simply say &quot;I wish to go to discord&quot; and keep on running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Totally off topic, but why do you use the Kelethin Priest o' Discord (&lt;-- sounds a bit more jolly when said that way)?<br />
<br />
There is a PoD in PoKnowledge now by the library, and I'm assuming you have a spirit stone to gate you back to Cabalis if you wanted to use that one.</div></div><hr />
