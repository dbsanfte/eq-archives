<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well iv'e posted this in equipment but just to make sure, basically iv'e gto 600pp, maximum 850pp to spend on upgrade(s). I was thinking maybe a JB helm which goes for 350pp so i'd still have some cash left but any advice would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwynhwyfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looking at your items, I'd say that the helm wouldn't be really, really, useful to you.  Even when you get to 45 and can click it, it's not like you're going to be using the effect a lot.<br />
<br />
Those gold tribunal earrings would be nice, and probably cost you less than 100p for a pair.  AC, and wisdom there.  A chitinous belt would be nice for you too.  I bought one for 400p, it's AC, STR, STA, and WIS.<br />
<br />
Just something to consider.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mathae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would think about getting some 6ac/65hp rings, spider fur belt, goranga idol.  Some things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwynhwyfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those rings would be nice, but he's only got 600 to 850 to spend according to his original post.  It's all about shopping smart, and getting the most for his money.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of other items that would be nice improvements for him, but I'm certain he'd like to keep a little platinum available in case a good deal happens to show up two days later.  Crinthia's ring comes to mind.  I bought one for 50p, but he might be able to find a group and go squash her in Echo Caverns and save himself the money.  It's AC, and wisdom as well (wisdom seems important to him just from looking at his magelo).<br />
<br />
The last time I priced those velium AC/HP rings, they were almost 400p each, but it's all a matter of priority I suppose.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">with 600p to spend, I think I'd go for a pair of 4/45 ac/hp rings , Spiderfur belt, Rygor Coif (hat)and a pair of the tribunal earrings (4ac/3wis). With a bit of patience you should be able to get any of those for 100-150p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Orc fang/Cougar claw ears<br />
Goranga Idol<br />
6/65 ring(s)<br />
<br />
I forget what, but something on your Magelo had 1 ac.  Dump it, replace with banded or whatever, something with ac or ac/hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Suggestions:<br />
<br />
In priority order:<br />
- something for range slot (suggest goranga idol)<br />
- 2 platinum fire opal rings (5ac/55 hp) or 2 jagged bands (cheaper)<br />
- 2 gold imbued ivory earrings or 2 orc fang earrings (cheaper)<br />
- blackened alloy legs<br />
- chokidai hide spaulders or tattered mantle (if can find either cheap)<br />
<br />
Might also be worth spending about 40 plat on an opal encrusted stein to equip when selling loot.  (+25 cha)<br />
<br />
You could consider asking a smith to make you imbued tribunal (cultural) ringmail armor for some of those slots also.  It's actually pretty cheap to make and any barb smith who trivialed banded before the smithing nerf can make it for you if you obtain and imbue the ivory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another thing to consider is that you may actually be able to get a group together and loot some upgrades rather than buying them.  You might be able to get a group at the ry'gorr fort in eastern wastes and loot yourself some ry'gorr chain, orc fang earrings, etc.<br />
<br />
You could farm blackened alloy armor yourself in the bottom of runnyeye to upgrade a couple spots.  And some of the stuff that drops there still sells for decent plat (blackened alloy medallion).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so what is better for Shaman to try to find then Mana items, Wis, items, or HP items? Or perhaps a combination of them both..i would think that Mana or Wis would be the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, jsut to make this clear i'm a AC/HP shaman, i tank for the pet etc and don't usually root rot(unless i have more than 1 pull, btw got the ikky BP as a borrow of a friend if your wondering why i have that then all the crappy stuff.) Thanks, keep the advice coming in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here are my suggestions:<br />
<br />
JASARTH!!!!<br />
<br />
Get the Jasarth Legs in KC, you got a bracer from there, legs are pretty easy to get and  very very often rot.  Bring a little patience, and some good humor and walk away with a free pair of legs that will serve you well into your 50s.<br />
<br />
AC/HP rings.  no daubt get a pair of ac5/55 hp rings. shop around, ask friends if they know a friendly jeweler that can do it for cost.<br />
<br />
Totemic helm.  do the quest.  cost 160p for gem. great helm and a real upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
Goranga idol.  GREAT range slot item, i wore mine till level 62.<br />
<br />
Tattered Mantle for shoulders<br />
<br />
Imbued Ivory earings. Can't beat them, try to find a friendly chanter...<br />
<br />
Get some friends together and do the Coldain Military Wristband quest.  Use the search function in the Quest section, i wrote up a spoiler. Easy quest, GREAT reward.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tranzar - depends on your play style of course, but most of the people here would probably suggest that you focus on either AC or HP first, then wis/mana second.  Personally, I plan to focus on AC until i routinely hit 1050 AC self-buffed, then I'll gradually switch out AC for more HP, which will hopefully get me in good position to make proper use of canni V when I eventually get it.<br />
<br />
My personal recommendations, in priority order highest to lowest, through level 57 at least:<br />
<br />
1.  horse<br />
2.  jbb<br />
3.  iksar regen bp or fungi tunic<br />
4.  epic spear<br />
5.  extended enhancement focus item<br />
6.  mana preservation focus item<br />
7.  extended affliction focus item<br />
8.  affliction efficiency focus item<br />
9.  ac gear until you hit 1050 ac<br />
10.  hp gear<br />
12.  wisdom/mana<br />
13.  resists (against certain types of mob, this goes to #9)<br />
<br />
In other words, to equip a horse, jbb, regen bp, or a number of useful focus items, I'm willing to trade out my AC/HP/whatever.  But assuming I've got whatever of #1-#8 that I can get, I'd work on AC until I hit the chain-class soft cap, then get HP, then worry about my mana pool size.  And you'll want a set of resist gear bagged for when you start raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some advice:<br />
<br />
Do the Coldain Military Bracer quest (you will need a level 50 friend to help with the last bit)<br />
Do the Kromriff Military Legging quest (level 50 needed to complete last bit)<br />
Details of these quests can be found elsewhere on this board<br />
You could get a runed smudging stick for your range slot by camping Grimling chief (you should be able to solo him at level 40), although it is a long camp<br />
You could try to get an Elder Wolfhide also solo, although this might be too hard at 40.<br />
<br />
At 40 you can probably handle the forest giant camp in FV - this is good loot and plat, excellent exp and you might get forest loops which you can wear or will sell to vendors for like 250plat or something in that range<br />
<br />
Giant scalemail sleeves are common drop in KD and sell for almost nothing. You can often get howling harpoon for 300 plat or less, which can be your primary melee or range slot if you need the wis/mana<br />
<br />
I would not bother buying a JB helm, it is cr@p. You should be able to pick up a Metal Linked Crown for real cheap. Alternatively, go solo yourself a blackened alloy crown</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">solo free jewellery in Grimling Forest<br />

<br />
feather ring<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7113<br />
<br />
They are nothing special but at least you can then spend cash on other decent stuff (like a chitinous belt). IMHO it is better to do upgrades in large steps than lots of little ones...</div></div><hr />
