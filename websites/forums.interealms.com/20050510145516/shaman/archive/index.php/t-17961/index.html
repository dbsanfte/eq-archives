<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am about to buy MGB.  My question is what group spells are not MGBable?  Looking at Lucy I was under the impression that a Target Type of Group v2 is one that can be MGB'd.  Tiny Terror being the exception do to a lack of it taking up a buff slot.  Are there any other exceptions?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not as far as I know.  The most popular shaman MGB spells are Focus, STA, and Diaku, and they all work for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as i've seen any group spell that has a buff icon can be mgbed. Personally I've mgbed Focus of 7th a bunch of times and talisman of tribunal several times. If you can target the group buff you should be able to MGB it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are able to /tgb a spell and cast it on another group, you can MGB it.  If it doesn't work with tgb (like tiny terror), then you can't MGB it.<br />
<br />
You cannot mgb any clickable items (same rules as above, really).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Radiant cure isn't mgbable. Radiant cure isn't a buff. It doesn't have a duration or an icon so it isn't a buff and it isn't mass group BUFFable.</div></div><hr />

You can't MGB RC.</div></div><hr />

Feradach must have gotten warped to an alternate reality ala Twilight Zone... ;)</div></div><hr />
