<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like some information on the Trial of Flame.<br />
<br />
Last night we gave this trial 3 goes, Pal/Pal/Cleric/Shaman/Ranger/Wizard.  Probably over 600 aggregate AA, all level 65.  A solid group of 65s in NToV / Ssra gear.<br />
<br />
We got owned bad every time.  Every mob I attempted to slow I got &quot;Your spell was SLIGHTLY successful&quot;.  I wasn't doing timings, but the slowed mobs were barely slowed at all.  I'm not convinced its worth slowing them.  <br />
<br />
So ... anyone in a sharing mood?  Any tips?  If you've completed this trial as a shaman can you post the group makeup?<br />
<br />
The remainder of the trials seem comparitively easy for a group like this.  What am I missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help / suggestions!  If you'd prefer to keep it off public forums ... isazomt@hotmail.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe I did it with shaman/cleric/paladin/monk/ranger/ranger.  Cleric 64, rest 65.  Might have been 2 monks and 1 ranger, it's been a while.<br />
<br />
We had no level 65 spells (I think one ranger had the summoned DD proc buff spell) at the moment but were all in Vex Thal gear with huge amounts of AA.<br />
<br />
Do not use 1h weapons, evil  damage shield on these things.  Group heals are good but have huge agro so be careful with them.  The cleric was mostly doing group CE/group CH while I'd keep peoples hitpoints even so we could fire it off with everyone around 30%.  Divine Arbitration and Quiescence would be huge for this but it was too soon after release so we didnt have these.<br />
<br />
Other than that, My job was to add cold damage to the rangers first (kill theirs so they could use bows on the others) then the monks, then the paladins.<br />
<br />
I'd dump the wizard and add another tank, a monk with a caens type weapon would be ideal.  If not that, a shadowknight would be very good too.  If you want to keep the wizard you'll have to be quick on the root parking.  I don't remember which type could be rooted but one of them could.<br />
<br />
Finally, yes, the rest of the trials are simple compared to this one I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to monklybusiness.com and write a post how your &quot;ubber lvl 65 monk with 200 aa's&quot; can still solo well, and that the mitigation nerf is not that bad. Then you proceed to the rangers grove and claim that all the rangers in your guild is doing 500dps continously with bows and wooden arrows, thus they must be nerfed!<br />
<br />
Finish off at the chanter boards, and make a lash at charming  and how &quot;any chanter with 9aa&quot; can solo nameds in plane of time and earn $ 20k on ebay from pharming loot...<br />
<br />
Thats a REAL test of flame :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally found a bard very handy for this event - charm/mez/resists - you name it. <br />
<br />
I think we did it with bard/rog/rog/clr/dru/war - but it did take a couple of runs to get right.</div></div><hr />
