<br />
First off, I'm not a big-time programmer .. so don't get all critical on my coding style!<br />
<br />
I got tired of doing the math by hand.. taking the stats and multiplying by the weights that were suggested on this board.. to produce a ranking list.. ie to see whats better..... SOOoo .. I cobbled together a quick excel (2000) macro to do the dirty work for me.... <br />
<br />
http://www.eatmysand.com/dad/powerweight.htm<br />
<br />
I take a search results from Allakhazams and tweak the weights worksheet to produce a list that ranks the equipment... and presto ...... go take a look :)<br />
<br />
There are some basic instructions posted on my site along with the spreadsheet... I left a search of Back items in the file to give you an example.....<br />
<br />
Post some feedback on both the macro and what you favorite tweaks are ... both for equipment and weapons<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
BTW .. Im thinking of throwing together a function that will allow me to rank different profiles(ie complete equipment layouts) againt each other</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That last idea sounds really cool, the thing youll hafta think of tho is how to encorporate overall effectiveness.  I.E. a good balance of ac/hp/wis<br />
<br />
also it asks for a username and password when downloading the spreadsheet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You dont need a password to down the spreadsheet.. It's on an open server... You may get a prompt regarding macros, which you can ignore.... Hell, if it makes you fell safer I can post the source that way you know what it's doing.... <br />
<br />
As for a username/password, that has to be on your side.  Maybe a FW/Proxy asking for elevated access to download &quot;potentially&quot; harmful materials???<br />
<br />
Overall effectiveness is subjective.... I just made the tool to give you a frame work to play with the numbers... Currently it works on one sheet, single item scenarios.. the idea to move to profiles would be to compare different setups, with multiple items.. ie Fungi/Jbb/Epic vs Iksar/RMB/Rusty Spear (drastic, but none the less the point)</div></div><hr />
