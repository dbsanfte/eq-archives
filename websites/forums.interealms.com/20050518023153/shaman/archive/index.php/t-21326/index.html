<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jeddreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently playing a lvl 43 Beastlord, but I keep noticing that the lvl 44 shaman pet has a higher damage cap than my lvl 39 pet.  I keep thinking why am I playing a beastlord when I could be playing a much more powerful shaman it seems.  Anyway, I know the beastlord pet does more damage overall with the procs and what not, but what else does the beastlord have besides the spiritual series of hp/mana regen and dual wield?  Shamans have better slows, better nukes, better buffs, better choices of armor, a comparable pet it seems, and gate! :)  I am thinking of rerolling a shaman and I would like to read an explanation of why beastlords are comparable to shamans.  A couple more questions:<br />
<br />
Do shamans mitigate damage differently than beastlords?  IE will a shaman with 1000 AC take more or less damage than a BL with 900 AC?<br />
<br />
Do barbarians still get an exp penalty?  Or is it just ogres, iksar, and troll now?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am going to respond under the impression that your not a troll and give you the benefit of the doubt.<br />
<br />
1.  At 65 Beastlords slow is only 10 pct lower than a shamans and casts faster.<br />
<br />
2.  At 65 a beastlords haste is only one notch below our best.<br />
<br />
3.  At 65 beastlords have stat buffs that can be compared to ours.  But overall I think stat buffs need to be revamp as most players are near caps.<br />
<br />
4.  Beastlords have a pretty decent line of cold based DD's that in the beginning have a long recast time but in the higher 50's you get one that doesnt have a recast time.<br />
<br />
5.  Their pets can tank like champs and bst can play cleric to their pet in need be.  Your pet takes a big jump HP wise at level 49.  45-49 is rougher as your last pet was 39 and you pet will turn green but 49 is one of those levels when you become a shredding machine.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 shaman and a rising 53 Beastlord.  To tell you the truth once i see how a beastlord gets groups at 65 the beast may become my main unless shamans are tweaked.<br />
<br />
We are in a fast paced world now where all that counts is DPS and HPS and shaman are pretty dreadful in both categories.<br />
<br />
Some say its the game designs fault and some say shaman are overdue for some upgrades.<br />
<br />
Bottom line i cannot get groups in GoD as easily as a beastlord.  Why have a slower that cannot provide DPS when you can have one that does. That and a BST can give a mana/hp regen line where shamans is self only.<br />
<br />
For now I am having a blast with my Beastlord.  He has a fungi vest and stick and can tank like a champ.  I cannot wait till I get my 50 pct slow to see what I can do.<br />
<br />
If you prefer to contribute dps and get groups that a shaman may have trouble getting into go with a BST.  If you wish to stay in old content remenicing(sp) about the kunark days then play a shaman.<br />
<br />
Take what I say with a grain of salt because i rolled a bst in bitterness but really enjoy him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont think Barbs have an XP penalty anymore. Trolls, Ogres and Iskar definiately do though.<br />
<br />
Comparing classes at anything but 65 in the current state of EQ is irrelvant. If your playing for fun, play whats fun. If your playing to have a strong character, 65 BLs are really amazing. They can buff ALMOST as many hps as a Shaman with Talisman and SV. Add in SD, Ferocity and Paragon, and you got a damn nice set of buffs. Their pets arent speedbumps like ours either. They can tank damn good, and put out immense damage. BLs melee powr is also far superior to ours as well. <br />
<br />
All in all, I think this whole BL vs Shaman issue is what makes me the most upset. BLs seem to be some kind of &quot;special&quot; class to the developers of the game. I really don't know what else to say about it. It kinda bugs me, a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Having played both, I can tell you both are pretty disheartening throughout much of the 40s.  During the 50s, the shaman pretty much beats the beastlord out soloing, but the beastlord starts to edge ahead at 60 with their 50% slow.  At 65, depending on how trivial the stuff you are fighting is, the beastlord pretty much wins for solo, but this doesnt apply to stuff beyond tier2 pop (unless you can aggro kite/blind kite).<br />
<br />
The reason beastlords mitigate better than shaman is due to block, although higher defense/dodge caps help too!<br />
<br />
Overall, I found the beastlord to be much more fun than the shaman was.<br />
<br />
PS much of the stuff you list shaman as having better is only marginally so at 65, and some really aren't better (buffing especially so)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stick with your beastlord. The beasty pet is far superior at 49 and the 62 and 64 are total monsters compared to the shaman 61 doggy. The day I saw a 64 beasty pet quadding for 77pts, proccing like mad and found out it had 4500hp unbuffed is when I made a beasty on SZ before my last retirement. <br />
<br />
Beasties have 70% slow, massive DPS, crack and are way more fun than buffing and canning all the time. :mad:</div></div><hr />

Oops, see, there ya go. Now, granted, FoS +SV = more than Talo+ SV, similar to the Paladin being able to outbuff hps to a Cleric with BSS, but the difference is stacking. <br />

Regardless, look at the numbers. Its sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is untrue.<br />
<br />
Both Mages and Bst have problems finding GoD groups.<br />
<br />
And besides that why pick a BST for DPS and slow when an enchanter provides WAY better DPS with the use of Charmed GoD mobs.  <br />
Plus the enchanter provides a much better slow and means of landing it (Tash).  <br />

Blazz I am not sure why your omitting a shamans STA buff as total of calcuated HP added.  <br />
<br />
And stating everyone has maxed out STA now adays is just not true.<br />
Infact STA can be one of the hardest states to raise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm guessing he omitted STA because beastlords have no issues maxing out a properly equipped groupmate's STA.<br />

<br />
If they really need more than *85* sta to hit cap, I think their problems extend a bit farther than what buffs you can land on them.<br />
<br />
Didn't see mentioned the innate detrimental spell haste that every hybrid gets - so those cast times listed under their nukes and slows on Lucy are longer than they are in actuality.<br />
<br />
Don't forget as well that beastlords get impressive disciplines in addition to the spell book that rivals (and surpasses, in points) that of a shaman.  The power jump for a bst round 40-50 is mind-blowing.  Stick around for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a reminder the real cap is 305.  I'd its not as easy as you think for the beastlord to max out and even worse in some case for the class that is receiving the BST's buffs.<br />

<br />
BST can have all the nukes and melee dmg they like.  <br />
They still don't out slow or damage enchanter in a GoD group with a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
What I have found BST and Mages are not the first choice for DPS anymore. <br />
<br />
 Enchanters, necros and druids are becoming the new need because of charm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and if no STA buff do you plan to have FA on everyone in the raiding group.  /Boggle<br />
<br />
Well BLs get lower versions of stat buffs, right? As well as IoS which adds STA. If those 2 dont max anyone level 65, then they need to examine their gear choices. FA doesnt add STA, only STR,  DEX and AGI. Of those, STR is maxed on most melees, even Bazaar level guys, AGI has little value over 255, and DEX has moderate value for proccing weapons, but no clear MEASURABLE difference between 255 and 305.<br />
<br />
Face it, stat buffs are totally obsolete at level 65. They do not factor into the BL - vs - SHM equation at all, nor do they factor into the &quot;shaman buff value&quot; equation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In most cases, yeah your right.  <br />
Stats don't mean too much in the game, right now.<br />
Maybe SoE will make a more dramatic role for them in the next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm still curious why people refer to &quot;GoD groups&quot; as those groups only in the Barindu/Mtn Pass area.  I say this because all that I ever hear of is talk about chanters and their pets there.  Well, if this isn't common knowledge, past Tipt, chanters cannot charm anything in kod'taz or ikkinz or beyond.  So, their advantage of dps there is nil compared to us.  <br />
<br />
Really, having a 65 beastlord and shaman, I can tell you that there are perks for both classes, and alot will say without having known any class that you should go with the Beastlord.<br />
<br />
Personally, the shaman was my first and my real love.  Even with the beastlord, I would not even think of making him my main, much less use him for more than just messing around with.  Hell, if it wasn't for rotting leather in the elementals/time areas, I prob would never have even created him.<br />
<br />
In the end, use whatever character you want.  It's just about picking a playstyle you enjoy.  I don't enjoy sitting there meleeing a mob as much as I enjoy standing back and debuffing each mob that comes into camp, as well as casting spells on them.  That's just me.  Some are different.  With the beastlord, you have a chance to be a pretty powerful melee character.  If that is whatyou like to do, then choose that class.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record, I choose a warrior when I first started EQ.  I created him, and got him to level 23 before I quit playing for a girl.  When I was about 16, I was in a group with a 17 shaman who was outmeleeing me.  I thought that shaman were GoDs because they could heal, sow and melee.  This is why when I started playing again, I created the shaman.  Sure, the melee aspect was false, but the feeling that I had when I saw that guy doing what he did is still there for me today when I'm playing my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Having played both, I can tell you both are pretty disheartening throughout much of the 40s.  <br />
<br />
Get a JBB and you will barely notice 45-50 as they fly by.  I only get to play a limited amount of time between my job and family, and even only doing 3-4 hours a night back in the Kunark/Velious days I went from 45 to 50 in under a week.  Yes, my shammy was tougher to level low 40s but overall the 40s were nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Have to agree with you Val.  <br />
<br />
I'm only level 58, in my prime, and I really don't get excited when I see what a BST can do.  Yeah, I know they are late bloomers, and at 65 with 200+ aa's they are, well, beasts, but so are we.  If you speak to other folks with high level BSTs, they will tell you that not everything is rosey for them either.<br />
<br />
And, like you, I'd rather play strategically, controlling the battle with my debuffs, CC, dps, and heals, than be focused on the one mob I'm swinging at in front of me.  Sure, I'd love to have the warder and Spiritual Dominion, but heck, I've got Canni 4/5, nice HoTs, and wicked dots.  And when I want to melee a little, I can jump in and do poor dps for a few minutes.  :)  Sure, in some zones and missions I may not be as desirable as others, but I think that goes for all classes (except maybe clerics).  <br />
<br />
I also play a BST alt for fun, but my main is my Shaman and its gonna stay that way.  So although I understand the situation at the higher levels, I'm hoping some tweaks are coming.  But for now I'm having a blast and would not change a thing (except the exp rate for levels 58 and 59, damn).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Most of what I did with my shaman to control a bad situation is easy enough to do with the beastlord, as well.  Instead of root parking adds, I sick the pet on one, slow it, and the gator keeps it stunned/tanked until it's dead or dealt with.  Slow everything in sight.  Spot heal where needed.  Taking too much damage?  Hit that 90% damage reduction disc that refreshes every 2 minutes.  And of course, nuke like mad when possible.  I thought bst had plenty of toys to keep me busy in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Of course it boils down to playstyle.  But I always played my bst very shaman-heavy - and was a huge surprise to the groups I was in, so I'm guessing that's rare.<br />
