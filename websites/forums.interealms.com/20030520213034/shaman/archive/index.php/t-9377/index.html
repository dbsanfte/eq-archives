<br />
This post is just to consolidate alot of the information at www.eqtraders.com on the &quot;how-to's&quot; of making Nightmare Terror Chain armor as a reference tool for myself and those gathering components.<br />
<br />
brick of nightmare iron - drops off mephits, hobgoblins in Plane of Nightmare<br />
<br />
nightmare mephit blood - mephits in Plane of Nightmare<br />
<br />
fetid slime - slarghilugs in Plane of Nightmare<br />
<br />
midnight stone - various mobs in Plane of Nightmare  (Stalkers are what we usually hunt.) <br />
<br />
Powdered midnight stone is made from combining 3 midnight stones in a mortar &amp; pestle. (NO-FAIL combine)Yield 4, wt 0.1, tiny, all/all, (stackable) Midnight stones drop in PoN.<br />
<br />
Nightmare terror temper is made by combining nightmare mephit blood, fetid slime, powdered midnight stone in a tanaan brew barrel trivial &lt;=169; wt 0.1, tiny, all/all, (stackable); used to temper nightmare iron. Mephit blood and fetid slime drop in PoN.<br />
<br />
Nightmare iron rings are made by combining nightmare iron, nightmare terror temper, &amp; file in a tanaan forge, which yields 2 nightmare iron rings,(stackable) wt 4.0, small, trivial &lt;=149 <br />
<br />
Distilled Mana Vials are made by casting the 400 mana cost level 39 Enchanter spell Distill mana. Components required are a poison vial and 2 sapphires.<br />
<br />
Enchanted Bar of Nightmare Iron is made by combining a distilled mana vial and nightmare iron ore in a tanaan forge, trivial 135, wt 5.0, (stackable), small, all/all <br />
<br />
The SPELL: Imbue Nightmare is made by combining a raw diamond, the spell: Imbue Diamond, PLUS a nightmare mephit blood in a planar jeweller's kit. This is a NO FAIL combine, and results in the paper spell scroll for scribing.  (The imbue diamond spell is found in Temple of Marr in North Freeport from Locarme Zennix (92, 287)<br />
<br />
Black Diamonds of Nightmare are made by casting the spell Imbue Nightmare (by a 62ENC/NEC).   Components required are a raw diamond and a nightmare mephit blood.<br />
<br />
Nightmare emblems are made by combining a blank emblem with an enchanted bar of nightmare iron, and an imbued black diamond of nightmares in a planar jeweller's kit, trivial &gt;250, magic, wt 1.0, small, all/all. (Blank emblems are vendor bought in PoK.)<br />
<br />
Nightmare Terror Chainmail is made by combining a tanaan smithing hammer, MEDIUM chainmail pattern, an emblem of nightmares, 1-3 of the Nightmare iron rings(1 ring bracer; 2 rings coif, sleeves, gloves, boots; 3 rings tunic, leggings), and a nightmare terror temper in a tanaan forge, trivial &gt;250.<br />
<br />
(Medium chainmail patterns can be found in PoK from Halena Paerk at loc 72, 1374. A Tanaan smithing hammer purchased from Tallis Paerk at loc 67, 1388.) <br />
<br />
The final results are:<br />
Nightmare Terror Chainmail, recommended level 61, required level 46; RNG, ROG, SHM; BAR, DEF, DWF, ELF, GNM, HEF, HFL, HUM, IKS, OGR, TRL, VAH<br />
