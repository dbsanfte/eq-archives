<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nustrimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right now I'm at level 30 and can't wait to get to 34 and get my pet!!!  The problem I'm having with this level is most ppl say head to marus seru or dawnshroud and I can't hate either zone more!!  The big problem for me is the overwhelming lag in both areas- I keep having to camp just to be able to move the cursor.  Can anyone PLEASE recommend a different area to hunt at this level so I can get my pet and start the fun stuff again?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you dont mind getting less exp per kill try SK.  There are Aviaks and Gnolls there that you can get exp from till 35 or so iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pzakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although I did spend most of my time in Dawn Shroud. I also spent some time in Echo Caverns getting decent XP. I killed Bog Warriors, Torin Truestring, Dack, Murph and other NPC's. Torin gives up a horn that sells for 19pp depending on CHA.</div></div><hr />

25-30<br />
I hunted Drachnids in FV on LOIO side. Root, DOT, slow method to take them down. Average drop 1-6 plat (if they drop sacs and web) (easy to get her since pop no faction but with mist Moore if evil zone to loio)<br />
Suggested buffs<br />
BOA<br />
KEI<br />
Spiritual Radiance (regen for mana and health)<br />
Regen or better<br />
Poison resist (89 or better)<br />
Magic Resist (89 or better)<br />
My magic resist at the time was 70 got rooted ever time so adjusted by have an enchanter cast there resist MR on me brought me to about 100 never got rooted (better than my own spell I cast)<br />
My poison resist was already above 95 and rarely got poisoned<br />
With spiritual and regen I never saw my health go down below sliver of a bub<br />
With cani I could go from oom to full in 30 seconds with 175 wisdom<br />
<br />
30-32<br />
I hunted the Great Oowamp ( if you are evil race reconsider you will be kos to OT outpost if you hunt here)<br />
Great camp single static spawn (6 minutes spawn)<br />
He dots and AOES all the time is about 32-39 shaman<br />
Root slow dot use low level dd to interrupt spells poison storm 180 points over 3 ticks (60 a tick)<br />
Suggested buffs<br />
BOA<br />
Kei<br />
Spiritual Radiance<br />
Regen or better<br />
All resists above 100 (more is better he is a shaman but leans towards our dots more than dd also gates at 35% occasionally will have a pet for you to deal with)<br />
This is wear our chipped bone bracelet drops 5 Wis and all fiction effi<br />
Int items still sell well on E marr server the Turtle helm still gets nice price (str int) for low end items<br />
<br />
32-36<br />
Dawn shroud peaks<br />
I went shroom hunting. Solo with out pet was rough but the 35 plat I donated for KEI and 20 for BOA helped here and most the time as with my previous Keis a BL hit us up too.  The hunt was hard until 34 but worth it. I made 500 plat plus my kei and boa paid for. Avoid at all cost wolves and pulling wolves near the druid.<br />
Ps on this anyone know what to do with the no drop shrooms<br />
Suggested buffs<br />
Boa<br />
Kei<br />
Tnarg<br />
All stat buffs<br />
Spiritual radiance <br />
Again no faction hits and great loot. BTW I have seen tons of high ups kill and leave the shrooms. If no one claims the loot them. Boring camps though.<br />
<br />
36-39 (yes new pet better spells)<br />
Guard slaughtering in Marus Saru. 6 static spawns. About 15% paladins 10% rangers and rest straight warriors. Pet can solo if you root one let the other come to you then root him and slow dot.  Let pup kill and then dot the one you root. Key stay the opposite side of your pup. Root dot.<br />
Average plat 150 in 2 and ½ hour stint<br />
Enough to pay for Kei and Boa but not enough to also make sow pos<br />
Another thing to remember your Faction goes down with shadow haven all though most can be soloed or out run also you cannot bank and if evil you can not get necro evil spells. Another thing to remember is it is a hard run through echo caverns and shadow haven when kos.<br />
With that said killer exp though static spawns good loot (not HG loot though)<br />
Timer about 6 minutes (give or take going off eq clock)<br />
Suggested buffs<br />
BOA<br />
KEI<br />
Spiritual radiance <br />
All stat buffs<br />
Tnarg<br />
Pet<br />
All buffs on him <br />
First four spawns 2 up 2 down park pet at opposite zone line<br />
Cani (yes even with kei and sr you will be oom by the end of 4 at 36 and 20 left at 38 with 175 wis in bear form)<br />
<br />
