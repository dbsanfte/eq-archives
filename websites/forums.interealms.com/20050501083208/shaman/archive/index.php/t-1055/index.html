<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's just stupid. I've seen 3 copies of the spell sell for the 10-30k range in the last two weeks on Stormhammer. Screw the greedy bastards who pull this crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just bought it 2 days ago for 5k :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chhaaa-rrright! .. heh heh .. Try 12k - tops. You could probably find a package deal for 8k.<br />
<br />
/auction WTT: Malo for SC Hand Wraps, or G. Focus/Ageo combo. I don't feel bad for the him though.  He made it up selling the 500pp Avatar for 30k .. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Vova, lemmie know if you see Malo on Stormhammer again.  The lead you told me about might not work out. The seller is having trouble locating his spell banker friend. :/<br />
<br />
&lt;- Thrilled to have a chance to pay 22k for Malo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Values of spells all depends on what server you are on. For the poster from Xev that said you could get a group focus and group aego for 8 k instead of the 80k value that they placed on them might be true on his server, but I know that on my server group aego sells for 40k or so still. I was really surprised by the bid on sunstrike however at only 11k. On drinal there are numerous people offering 100k+ for it now. Oh well heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aktunka - read the name of the poster who said that about the prices.  He's on Xev.  =)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for pointing that out, jaruden hehehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Piggy backing here, but Topor for sale on Brell... currently 52k :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">40K for G. Ageo?  G. Ageo dropped every time from the Grimling High Priest cycle. Takes 40 minutes to do a cycle.  What value do you put on something dropping every 40 minutes?  Couple days, and all of our clerics had the spell.  Seems to have been nerfed now.  Still common as dirt.  <br />
<br />
I also saw G. Focus sold for 8k, by a guy standing next to me in the bazzar.  Which, at the time, I thought was high.  The general concensus on this board was 5k.<br />
<br />
8k+4k = 12k .. Consensus on the board = 5k + 4k = 9k .. Thought I'd knock off another 1k to represent the low end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malo (shm) --- Current offer is group aegolism, group focus, and warsong of the VahShir (120kpp value)&quot;<br />
<br />
 ... So adding a lvl 53 Bard song added an additional 40K?<br />
<br />
I've gotton dozens of copies of this spell.  So common in fact, they go to the merchants by the fi****ll, because I can't give them away.  Settled for 12pp + One backpack slot.<br />
<br />
Like I said before.  /shrug<br />
<br />
It's really no concern of mine.  Merely pointing out the humor and irony in that thread.  It's there if you look.<br />
<br />
Edit ...<br />
<br />
Looks like Malo sold for G. Ageo, G. Focus, and Battlecry.  12,012pp.  Not a bad deal if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's more humor and irony.  The board edited the word fist-full without the - .. Heh Heh</div></div><hr />

We have done this boring circle 3 time ,result ? nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He appologies for a long time grrrrr but had no Malo.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The person isnt paying 120k, hes trading up 3 spells.<br />
<br />
If you regularly kill Rhag1/2 and THO, Group Aego/focus and warsong are super easy to get.  Malo is significantly harder to find.<br />
<br />
I'd consider that a good trade...can't tell you how many copies of group aego and focus go to the guildbank every Ssrae raid...</div></div><hr />
