<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boogaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recenly got an item with the effect but it doesn't glow when using group buffs or Torpor.  I wasn't surprised to see it not glow with torpor, but with group buffs this seems not so good.<br />
<br />
I haven't had time to test the buffs with timing and might not have the time for a while.  Can anyone confirm if it doesn't work on group buffs or if it just doesn't glow?<br />
<br />
Few other related questions.  Does the new effects stack with AA skills like quick buff and SCR?  Does spell haste work on torpor?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info,<br />
Boog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Group buffs are currently Bugged for this effect (or better the effect is bugged for group buffs).<br />
<br />
The effect stacks with QB (as a matter of fact all new effects stack with each other and with all AA skills to 50% maximum bonus)<br />
<br />
Spell Haste does (currently) work on torpor.<br />
<br />
And to add: <br />
Spell haste and QB stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I seem to recall that the extended enhancement focus items had a limitation to prevented them from working on buffs that lasted less than 72 secs. Since Torpor only lasts 24 secs (36 with AA's) it isn't effected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The limitation is 36 seconds. I *think* the AA ability that increases buff duration will increase torpor to 36 seconds duration, which would make it covered by the focus effect.<br />
<br />
Don't quote me that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My extended enhancement3 does work with damn near everything except:<br />
<br />
1.  Clicky fungus staff<br />
2.  Group buffs<br />
3.  Illusions except bear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">does not work with torpor, group buffs or clicky buffs.<br />
<br />
torpor i can understand.<br />
<br />
but it really needs to work with group buffs and clicky buffs (like BP).</div></div><hr />
