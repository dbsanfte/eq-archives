<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peonthis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if you can give the White Dragon Helm back to Tormax for the White dragon Boots instead? I don't wanna risk giving it to him to have him eat it =) thanks for any helpful info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah it works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You need to still have appropriate faction to do this, if you've lost the faction in the time since you got the helm, you won't be able to (and he'll probably eat it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harrek Stormwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I may be wrong, but I thought that the quest giver is Yelniak, not King Tormax and you must have high Yelniak faction (not CoV) in order to do quest or cycle rewards.<br />
<br />
Harrek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty sure it was just a typo, but yeah Yelinak is the guy you do this with.  You need ally faction, but it does indeed work and you can cycle through rewards as many times as you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You do not need ally faction. I turned in my tormax head to Yeli with substantially less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As long as an NPC responds to the quest text, its ok.<br />
<br />
Same for any quest :) So just go have a Chat to Yeli! $$ <br />
<br />
You have to get real close to him though, I had a hard time finding the right spot coz he is so big.<br />
<br />
Also if you are KoS to CoV his guards will kill you.</div></div><hr />
