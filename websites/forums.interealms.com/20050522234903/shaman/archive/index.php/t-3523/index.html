<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Actually, its clean, but still another stupid gear question.<br />
<br />
Last night in HoT I won an unadorned chain coiff (haven't turned it in yet for my SS headpiece), problem is I already have a Thurg helm.  Here are all the stats, although likely everyone knows em already.  This isn't exactly a big issue, but I'd like to do whats right by my guild and MQ the helm if it does more good for someone else.<br />
<br />
Thurg: AC 16 5sta 5wis 15mana (looks like FS helm)<br />
<br />
SS: AC 19 6str 7wis 25mana 4mr (looks like I got nothing on my head which comlpiments the fact that there's nothing in there either)<br />
<br />
Although I kinda like the whole notion of seeing my face, I'm not all that keen on watching small children flee in terror (I chose the butt ugliest shaman face I could find ... on purpose) and the graphic for both helms are kind cool.<br />
<br />
Statistically, I'm not sure the 3AC 2WIS 10 mana and 4mr is better than the 10-15hp from the thurg helm (as I can regen the health, but not the mana without converting health).  Granted 15hp is kinda small, but I can regen it and every little piece of health helps.  My MR in resist gear is already over 100 so 4 more isn't really a big deal, and I'm not sure how 3AC will play out as I have 979AC self buffed and the helm will not be significant in getting me to 1k.  STR is negligable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would stay with the thurgadin helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I happily traded my thurg helm for SS, it was an upgrade and I got rid of those horrible horns.<br />
<br />
During that time, my guild was following a &quot;leapfrog&quot; loot policy.  If a chain helmed dropped in HOT, everyone interested would send a tell with their current level of helm (planar, Kunark, PoG/Thurg, other) and a random would be done between only those who needed it the most (for example, the people wearing planar would roll, not those with Thurg).<br />
<br />
It was a pretty slow process, but eventually I was able to loot my SS helm without feeling like I wasn't being fair to a guildmember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm I have a thurg helm, and would probably pass on the SS chain one till others needing chain in the group(s) I raid with have it. Mostly because I like the &quot;Texas caddillac&quot; style helmet the old model barbs have with the thurg helm =p It just doesnt feel barbarian to me without those 2 big bull horns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Every little bit helps out yourself and your guild. Don't feel guilty if you won / were awarded something on the raid. Just imagine, if you had 10 slots of items with just a small upgrade of 2-5 ac and some stats, that adds up pretty quickly. The only time I would pass on an item that would benefit you is if it would benefit someone in your guild much more, or you are holding out for something even better. eg, having Jaundiced Bone BP and passing over on Skyshrine BP while you're waiting for your chance at a Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
People forget that EQ, at the high 50's + game, is all about small leaps and bounds. Until you hit the &quot;Uber&quot; end game, you won't find items that are a vast improvement over what you currently wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hubu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*shrug* I'd go for the Wolf callers helm personally. But it's up to you, do what you think is best ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Bumping this thread with a helm question of my own.<br />
The Circlet of Vallon has some nice DR/PR stats (+9 I think) on it, and matches the AC on a JB Helm at 18.  Weight is 0.9 and it is all/all.<br />
<br />
I went on a pick-up Kael raid and this was defaulted to monks only NBG after it dropped.  The raid rules on non-quest &amp; non-gladiator armor was NBG all/all.  I would have immediately put it on and kept it on over the JB helm, as I only use the charisma buff at the spires when I'm goofing around, or junk buffing myself when I have lots of time available.  I didn't beef at the raid except for a quick inquiry, and sent the raid leader an e-mail about it afterwards.  We've agreed to disagree and I adhered to his call.<br />
<br />
Is this not a good hat for us?  SHOULD it be monk only?  I'd think monks would want the 0.0 weight helms more than this one, except as resist gear...<br />
<br />
Any other single group attainable helm advice for a 56 shaman would also be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts always welcomed,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail Mojokyn,<br />
<br />
You MUST have been slowed...<br />
Because Faern made his comment a MONTH ago. :D<br />
(I bumped this from way back after conducting a search.)<br />
<br />
Now, if you would kindly answer my questions. :)<br />
<br />
Hugs,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We actually have damn little decent hat options outside of the end game. <br />
<br />
Circlet of Fallikan's pretty good. SS helm is passable. I personally like the one I'm using, circlet of suffering. 20 ac 100 hp, 7 sta, 50 mana and some str and dex. 0 wt and all/all kind of make it a monk item too tho. If you can do HoT, wtov dragons like Telk (and this item) aren't far off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Frekkels<br />
<br />
Circlet of Vallon / Tallon go to monks because they are one of the highest AC head items monks can get at Kael raid levels and they are light.  <br />
<br />
You could have taken the Circlet, but you have lots of other upgrades that over what they do.  They have other choices from Tormax/Dain/Vulak/Ssra/TOV or Cowl of Mortality etc... or else they are wearing something like a frog crown or a shissar scale headband.   I've seen lots of monks wearing Circlets of Vallon/Tallon at 60.   Sucks for them, cause it looks like a paper bag!  :D<br />
<br />
upgrades for you:  Thurg/Pog Chain Helm, Skyshrine/Kael chain helm, Circlet of the Falinkan, Slime Covered Rubicite Coif, Tae Ew Spirit Callers Coif, Mud Smuged Cap, Artificers Ringmail (or other racial smithed) -hrm, you're a kitty I think so this doesn't apply, Spirit Talkers Headdress, any of the hats from the dragons in West Wastes (dragonskull helms - they have good sta) ... etc - none of these are uber mob drops.<br />
<br />
Point is, lots of upgrades for you - not as many for them.  Circlet of vallon/Tallon is barely an upgrade from JB.  You can do better, don't worry about the ugly bag hat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I couldnt stand the looks on my Spirit Callers helm, so I happily used a Froggy Crown and a Shissar Scaled Headband for a good while because neither of those have no visible graphics. <br />
 A couple of weeks ago I found a bargain on a Slime Covered Rubi Coif, and bought it for 16ac and 65hp (all stats are: +16 AC +6 Agi +4 vsFire +4 vsCold +65 HP weight+2.00, recommended lvl 51 or 55 ).<br />
 I love that headpiece for hitpoints, the nice chain look and the colour (it has a nice red tint with great chain look ;) )<br />
Wont go back to other pieces until I'll found something to replace the hp's with. <br />
<br />
I got to say I love that new CT equipment. <br />
 Theyre perfect gear for someone non-uber, casual player as me. I'll wear that stuff for as long as I'll find some time to start thinking about joining a guild and doing some raids again. I know that with some assorted pieces or Artificier's I could get a few more Hp's and maybe some mana, but still not enough to make them worthwhile. CT stuff has great Hp's, looks, and decent Ac and affordable prices if you just dont buy from the first seller you see. I'm finally over the 1924Hp's which I need if I'll ever find time to gring Canni5. ND3 will put me well over 2K hp's while maintaining decent resists, and about Ac I dont care much anymore. With aego and self buffs I'll be able to get over 1100 ac, which is pretty much enough for me and my playing style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input Henora. :)  That's exactly the kind of information I was looking for.  I had no idea what is available to monks for headgear.  <br />
<br />
I'd also like to thank those posting with other helm advice.<br />
Looks like I'll be wearing it awhile longer.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
