<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I've been reading posts here for over 2 years and trying to contribute as I can.  It occurred to me the other day that one of the major advantages that Druids have over us in a zone with pure animals is that almost always their DC pet is stronger than our summoned pet.  So....<br />
<br />
What if we asked for the ability to charm aminals and get Dire Charm just like druids?   That would cure the pet problem in a lot of zones (I realize not all) and would honestly I think allow the higher end Shamans something to do (keeping a tougher animal constantly charmed).<br />
<br />
Perhaps, since we all complain about our lack of dps, SoE could slightly expand the definition of &quot;animal&quot; so that we can dire charm more mobs out there than Druids can.<br />
<br />
What do you think about something like this? I did get &quot;Charm Animals&quot; way back when and I do think it kind of fits with the Shaman spirit.  Dog Dog is nice but any mob over say....level 20 can out hit him.  A DC pet (or a charmed pet) would significantly increase our DPS and possibly allow us to fill the &quot;DPS needed&quot; slots in groups.  <br />
<br />
I know druids will complain bitterly about this, but when you think about it I think that being able to DC more pets (like the frogs in LDoNs) that they cannot with *no snare* means to me there is a lot more risk, especially after we buff our new pet up.  I think you could control the &quot;overpowering&quot; nature of having a charmed pet by either capping his DPS while charmed (just let it rise to at least a BL pet!) or by having the Charm spell slot block HoT's (which is the only mana-efficient way we're going to keep it alive). <br />
<br />
I'd be interested in everyone's comments on this.  DC Pets is something I haven't seen proposed here for a long time.  Maybe I'm way off base, but I could see how this could fix our low dps woes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dire Charm is garbage.  It's a novelty for the most part.  The only place it's remotely useful is in PoE for charming the small armadillos.  Regular charm is a pain as well, it's no solution for dps.<br />
<br />
Make our nukes faster casting or give us stronger nukes, something we can use in all cases, just not when something charmable is around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Charm isnt really a shaman thing, shaman deal more in the spirits than the wildlife actually living around them.<br />
Not saying they have nothing to do with nature, but primary focus is the spirits of the things in nature.<br />
<br />
Now something like monster summoning might work.<br />
Make it so maybe we could summon the spirit of any animal in the zone.<br />
Give it the model of a random animal in the zone, make it transparent and cut its max hit and hp in half from what the living version is.<br />
<br />
An animal only WTD might be cool too although necros might have a problem with it, and with good reason.<br />
Maybe if it were an AA with a long refresh time and make it unable to recieve buffs.<br />
Being able to just pull up any animal at full strength just seems like it would be too overpowering compared to what we have now though.<br />
<br />
Theres lots of cool ideas they could put in for pets, and alot of them i wouldnt mind having.<br />
But to be honest if they would give our pet innate DW, innate SoW, make max hit around 100, and give it about another 1000hp id be happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or.... Just give us the pets from ASC1-2 as a summonable pet...  Those things hit for about 130 (i think) and have a 650DD proc, but about the same hps, that would be very nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it has been thought of, and despite the above post, it is a very effective aa for free dps, the dc mobs do silimar damage as a top line summoned pet.<br />
<br />
the problem is that charm was given to shaman as an after though and not extended, so dire charm of animal isnt  quite right for shaman.<br />
<br />
one idea i saw was to have a dc like ablilty crossed with necro call of the dead, ie we raise a corspe that became a dc like pet, which i thought was better. however , this is abit more flexible than dc animal so  maybe could have it only work on mobs that could be considers to have a spirit to call back into service. (ie wont work on allready dead mobs, plant types) . corse depends on what soe would count as  ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It used to be fun to charm bats in SolB and toss them in for extra damage before our charm spells got nerfed and they extended the druid line.  Now that &quot;Teh Vision&quot; (tm) is dead, SOE might give it a second look, but there are a ton of bigger issues lined up in front of a new charm toy.<br />
<br />
With my troll charisma, I'm not sure I would try to use something of this nature. :p</div></div><hr />

I don't think charming a corpse would be appropriate, but maybe summoning a 'spirit of Kbok' pet in the same manner as a necro's WTD pet would be a nifty AA.  Maybe limit it only to PC's and not monsters?<br />
<br />
I don't want Dire Charm.  I'd rather have a stronger dogdog.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm Druids are overpowered.<br />
<br />
Anyway my idea instead of this is a pet avatar idea, makes pet immune to damage for a period while hitting for 200s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree, stronger dog via an aa would be great.<br />
<br />
but limit our spirit (dc) pet to pc corpses only certainly would make it a limited help, but funnily i like that idea:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lol how the wheel turns.<br />
<br />
Charm was originally a Primary Shaman ability way back when the game started, I actually have charm in my spell book - although its unusable.<br />
<br />
Anyway they are never going to give us a DC ability but if they did it would make sense to be Undead related given our supposed afinity to the spirit world. DC would not be of any use whatsoever to a higher level raiding shaman, much less a &quot;high&quot; level raiding shaman. DC is fantastic upto about level 60 after that its usefulness trails off dramatically.  I have a fully raid geared 65 Chanter with 300 AAs as well as my shaman so I have at least some idea what im talking about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i think even requesting DC for a shammy is ridiculous. i'm not intending to be rude or offensive to the originator of this thread, but in general, i see (between this forum and ones for other classes) a derth of requests for this or that class to have access to abilities that are considered major edges to other classes. <br />
<br />
DC and charm abilities are already more than appropriately distributed among the classes they are in line with conceptually (i love that mages can charm elementals, w/o the ability to DC--very nice touch), as well as being factored in as far as the balance goes. <br />
<br />
charm is a big advantage, whether people want to admit it or not. while a dire charmed pet as it stood w/o buffs isn't anything spectacular, if you were to give shammies the ability to DC or charm, we would be able to use swift like the wind, FA, FoS, an AC buff, and regen, as well as maintaining the pet with our heals. in other words--we could do more to improve a charmed pet than any other class. even enchanters can't heal their own pet, and while mages can do crazy things with their charmed pets, they still can not DC (at present), and can not slow mobs that their pets fight. the combination of major charm ability plus slow, heals, buffs, and our dots and debuffs would lead to situations where we could effectively solo mobs that we really should not be able to. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
aside from that, if we keep taking cornerstone abilities and giving them to other classes, we're eventually going to wind up with four classes. tank, healer, melee dps, caster dps. <br />
<br />
i don't want that. i'm happy with dogdog. if you want to be more like a druid, PLAY ONE. <br />
<br />
i want to remain shaman.</div></div><hr />

this is oppossed to druid who can haste and heal their dc pet right? <br />
or the fact that beast can heal and haste thier pet which is as good as a dc pet (or better) and can slow too?<br />
<br />
or that enc can slow and haste, and they have attack buffs too ,  their pets? though they cant heal, maybe rune it?. mages can also heal pets for 1200 for 300 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">bara cudar--i'm aware of all those things. my point is that none of those classes can do *all* of the things we can. druids can't slow the mobs their pets fight. enchanters can't heal their pets. mages can't slow the mobs their pets fight, OR dc. beastlords can do all of these things, but their pets are what they are built around, and are plenty balanced. i recognize that beastlords, in particular, are extremely powerful inherently, but they also have shortcomings. they have no large self-heals. their pets stun only up to certain levels, which is a check of sorts. they also have no cc whatsoever, which is a much bigger deal than it sounds like when they try to solo.<br />
<br />
shammies really are a couple minor tweaks from being where we should be, and charm is much more than a minor tweak.<br />
<br />
with charm ability, even BoT shammies wouldn't need to bother looking for groups there at all. soloing would be almost as efficient as low aa groups there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nevermind!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK,<br />
<br />
It is obviously a less than stellar idea to extend the charm line.  I do like the idea of an AA to &quot;call the spirit of the zone&quot; to aid the shaman, maybe in a similar fashion to Spirt Call (on an independent timer of course).  Or perhaps, instead of calling an additional pet this AA could infuse our existing pet with the power of some other kinds of spirit animals (Tiger for increased Dmg, Cheeta for incrased attack speed, Lion for a Fear DD, Bear for increased HPS, Monkey for a stun proc, Rhino for a huge DD, etc...) that we could use every 10 minutes or so for a min or two.<br />
<br />
That would definitely fall under the Spirit idea and give us at least a different pet of sorts that could increase our damage output situationally at least.  It would also be kind of nice to be able to situationally enhance our pets to the situation.  If it would &quot;unbalance us&quot; then make the AA drain our mana/hps for the time that the spirit is active.  That would fall in line with other Shamanistic behaviours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its annoying how Druids getting a specialized pet buff, and shamans being a pet class don't except spirit quickening. There is no logic in that?<br />
<br />
That aside I am curious,  can those with DC take their mobs with them or is it just pet classes that can do that?</div></div><hr />
