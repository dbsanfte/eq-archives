<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I've recently discovered that with a good cleric, I can f'ing tank in Plane of Nightmares. And I'm not talking blood ravens and young bats, I'm talking the hard ass stuff down by the hedge like the wraiths and bansees. Here's the run down:<br />
<br />
<br />
53 Shaman (me)<br />
59 Rogue (tarachi)<br />
61 Rogue (mokoboo's rogue)<br />
58 Mage (audelune? can't remember his exact name)<br />
65 Cleric (mokoboo)<br />
<br />
I was holding agro and tanking over all of them. With my new Velum Fire Opal Rings (thanks Juliette), all buffs, Rage, my spear/shield, and level 65 cleric buffs, I had 1024 AC and around 3500 HP. Rogue would pull and I would slow when the rogue was incoming to pull agro immediately. Then once it stuck (1st or 2nd cast), then I got RIGHT up in it's face and started chain casting root and holding agro through proximity agro. Then the rogues where able to backstab till their hearts content and the mage was nuking to his hearts content and the cleric only had to heal me mainly. If things got hairy I'd back up a litttle and let the rogues take agro until heal landed. Pretty much I only had to be healed with an HoT once, maybe twice over each mob.<br />
<br />
I had a lot of fun and if anyone has classes they wanna come to PoN, I'd be happy to enjoy a group like this again some time. Rogues could be swapped with Wizards or Mages, or Monks, any class that doesn't want to tank but have high DPS. I got a TON of xp last night, like 21 to 69. It fealt like I was in my high 40's again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, I noticed last night that slow would slow the mob, but when I dropped cripple on top, it seemed to overwrite the slow because the mob starts hitting normal speed again... very odd. Think cripple might be bugged... or maybe I was really tired and smoking crack last night...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You smoke crack when you are tired? Does that help?<br />
 <br />
I know the feeling Sori, recently I have had the chance to tank some also, and I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was just awesome holding agro over two high level rogues and watching the backstab damage. :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, slow and root proximity aggro will do that. Becareful with Hobgoblins, they can not be rooted, but a couple slows and they should be stuck on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sori,<br />
 <br />
Poison dots are like killing their kids...2 poison dots after landing malo and slow and I can get aggro over well equipped warriors pretty often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">little hint on holding aggro....try flash of light.  you'll like it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dalaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soriathus ! You can tank for me anytime bro ...! Now if we could just get your leezard to slow the mobs..we would be set!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ummmm my leezard, aka Sori?  I was slowing and stoicisming. Hence why I was able to actually tank. Also since I wasn't meleeing just taking hits, I was medding/siting/regening on my leezard horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">FoL bad, sure it's great for holding aggro but  the minute a caster out aggro's you, or if you back up, mob goes running. Only use it if youre absolutely sure youre in melee range, and on top of the hate list.<br />
Soriis tanks with tainted breath and cripple. recast TB as needed to keep aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wait til ya get Voice of Bezerker, Sori:) God, I am already in love with this spell for meleeing! Stacks with da focus and wrulan...max str,dex and agi! Sure, I still get my butt handed too me, but I FEEL like a tank when it happens:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehehe, Nad, I was chain rooting and proximity agro holding. With 2 rogues backstabbing if I lost agro due to root dropping or just got out of range, mob would switch to the rogues for agro.</div></div><hr />
