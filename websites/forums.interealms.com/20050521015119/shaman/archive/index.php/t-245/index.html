<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay.. So I spent a while raising money with SOW potions, and now I've got some decent upgrades to my gear, and a bit of a bank account. I got all the items that I was planning on getting, but now I'm stuck. I don't know what stuff to shoot for next. Could anyone give me some suggestions on what items would be the largest wis upgrades, for the least amount of money? Thanks all =)<br />

<br />
* Replace neck with one of those new blackened iron medallions from Runnyeye, similar but also has AC, save up for an ivory collar from Chardok<br />
<br />
*  Upgrade to plat or velium ruby veil, make some long term goals for a bone mask of the jarsath or enshrouded veil<br />
<br />
*  Head - totemic helm, better ac AND wis<br />
<br />
* Bracers - runed mith bracers have more AC and wis, totemic have more AC, sentry bracers are nice (not sure of the stats on rygorr but probably definitely more AC<br />
<br />
* Gloves - any gloves but those, please<br />
<br />
* Shoulders - lizard scale mantle, tattered mantle (great AC)<br />
<br />
* Waist - smited girdle 10 AC 3 to all stats, maybe a strawspun until you can get a smited<br />
<br />
Read my response in this thread about some reasons why a goal of 200 wisdom is not necessarily (although some argue it is) the best goal for shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rings = ac/hp<br />
neck = ry'gorr neck thingy<br />
legs = cant think of anything but there is probably something with ac/hp, i use ry'gorr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how u get those boots at 34???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) How much do you have to spend?<br />
<br />
2) Nice boots.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As ...inappropriate as it may sound, you can go to KC and ask for the right to loot Jarcrap stuffs.  The helm, the guantlets, the leggings, even the bp is not bad for shaman at all.<br />
<br />
Black Iron Medallion got to go...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah.. I had figured my gear was pretty good, but other shamans my level were saying they had wis 180+, and I felt a little behind, so I went on a wis spree. =p<br />
<br />
The boots were done by me, and a couple friends. SK, enchanter, and me barely took down Mr. wolf. I helped with healing! Really! =)<br />
<br />
I'd never really thought about going the AC route.. I figured it was easier to wait a little on slows, since my slows aren't really make-or-break the fight yet. (Hearing from others, I get the assumption my later slows will be absolutely devestating)<br />
<br />
About the necklace, yeah.. I knew I needed an upgrade, but I didn't realize how nice the BA one was. I'll be shooting for that next. Not sure on what to do about the gloves though.<br />
<br />
As far as my bank account, it's not that high. I'm flat broke right now, but I can build up to about a K or so if I spend a few hours doing potions. &lt;1k is what I was aiming for on new gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I too have become a believer of AC &gt; Wis ... even though an iksar i have been dumping Wis left and right recently ie. 6ac 65hp rings, Death Mask of Elysians, Barbed rubicite bracers. on a note ... even though the bracers have 5 wis.. i would of bought them even if they didnt for the ac and hp.  <br />
<br />
i now at lvl 58 (forgive the sig) have 994 self buffed ... with 2073 hp. <br />
im doing further upgrades in future. <br />
<br />
think im gonna start gate potions soon =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">belt=straw spun belt.<br />
gloves=banded<br />
tunic=banded<br />
rings=6AC/65HP (This will take most of 1k)<br />
shoulders=banded <br />
neck=banded <br />
head=banded<br />
<br />
That's my honest suggestion for most useful gear upgrades in  the 1k range.  Don't get sucked into the &quot;I have more wis than you&quot; thing.  Shaman are more like hp-casters than wis-casters.<br />
<br />
But keep the +wis stuff for alchemy, by all means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well.. I took everyone's advice.. I changed my gear around some.. More AC oriented now.. Not done but this is what I did so far.<br />
<br />
One bracer - Jasarth<br />
Helm - Jasarth<br />
Mask - Arctic Wyvern<br />
Range - Eye of Trust (One less wis but 5AC)<br />
Gloves - Iksar scaled<br />
<br />
Next up is to get a blackened alloy medallion.. The rings, I'm kinda not sure on.. I mean, the ac/hp rings are nice.. But 12 wis is a lot to drop. and besides, I don't really want HP, since I don't tank much. I just want AC for when the few post-slow hits I take, it'll be as small amount of damage as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BLASPHEMY!  HERESY!  THE STREETS WILL RUN WITH THE BLOOD OF THE NON-BELIEVERS!<br />
<br />
*cough*<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Sorry about that, what I meant to say was...<br />
<br />
12 wis is only like 70 mana at 34.  That's about half a good spell.  130 hp is about 60 mana, or a few solid hits from a mob.  Plus the 12 raw ac.  To each their own, though, there's no one right way to do it.  Btw, where's the Eye of Trust from, I've never heard of that?<br />
<br />
That's what I meant to say. :)<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
As a compromise, you might look at Jaded Velium rings, they're AC5, 30 mana, 30 hp.  Also, they tend to be a bit less pricey than the 6/65s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was born to follow the way of the warrior, so Wisdom is something I desperately need.  I exchange 18 Wis for about 70 AC and 70 more hp when I go hunting.  <br />
<br />
100 less mana to start off when I go adventuring, too.  Being somewhat wisdom-deficient to begin with, it has made me be a lot more aware of how to get more mileage out of the mana/hp I have.<br />
<br />
hp = mana for me.  1033 hp at lev 44 (unbuffed) isn't too terrible.  Add Altuna and chloro (and the occasional fungal regrowth) and I'm downright content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yet another update. More time in Karnor's=More Jarsath.<br />
<br />
Now I have legs, and gloves. Arms I don't see myself getting tonight, since it's uncamped.<br />
<br />
The eye of trust is out of Sanctus seru, on luclin. VERY easy quest, but kinda time consuming. Link is here:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1503<br />
<br />
I am SERIOUSLY considering going for the hp/ac rings, after doing some math.. Now to make some money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mez know dat the AC v. Wis debate has been bashed into da ground but to me da 6/65 rings are such an easy choice dat even an ogre can figure it out.<br />
<br />
Mez lvl 31 now and have a little over 900 hp and 760 with mez own buffs.  I do most of my damage with da big hammer and only use mana for buffs, and slows.  Mez can kill da blues over and over and over again with almost zero down time.    My wisdom is only 142 or so with 2hb setup and is no kind of handycap at all.<br />
<br />
True True my gear is quite nice,  but mez thinks dat ac is da way to go.<br />
<br />
You should also start to get some JB armor like da arms da are great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Okay. Whew. I'm done for now. I went gear crazy, and changed slots everywhere. The final setup I have now, and I think should be okay for at least a while, is here:<br />
<br />

<br />
Other than the obvious rings-&gt;6/66s, and CBB-&gt;RMB, which I don't think are worth the money right now, anyone have any *more* suggestions for under 1k? =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nah go out and play.  Your gears are more than enough to get you through low 50+.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
I envy you.</div></div><hr />
