<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elrynia</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This idea crops up in my mind from time to time and I thought I would ask you about it.  From time to time I play with the notion of starting over on another server, brand new.  Mostly I find when you know so many people on your server it gets harder and harder to avoid dramas.  Has anyone here ever restarted on another server?  I mean I know all server are essentially similar, I just thought maybe switching to an older server would have a different feel.<br />
<br />
Or I could just be moody because I have no eq time and I can't seem to lvl lol.  Who knows. Ranger's rule though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently restarted...<br />
<br />
EQ was getting boring for me, alot of my friedns had quit, but I loved EQ the sub-culture...<br />
<br />
So, I gave 35-ish K away to strangers and started on the same server as some RL friends.<br />
<br />
Now they are all 55+ and can't hang with me (except alts), and they haven't really twinked me, cause they know I would probably get bored again.<br />
<br />
I will tell you this, it is both SUCKY and AWESOME to be a true noob.<br />
<br />
I have a 8 51 bow, an 11 29 weapon, and barely have now been able to not have empty slots.  I can't afford bandages and spells both -- this should get better as I get higher of course.<br />
<br />
BUT, every spider leg I get MEANS something. Every group I get into I am thankful for. My char building has context.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I look back and wish I had my Regen BP, my SCHW, all my other goodies, but I wasn't having fun, they were just 1's and 0's.<br />
<br />
Now, when I get upgrades, or skills or levels, it's more fun. Before if I had a Ranger, I would have solod to 30 in a week or two, never stopping to smell the roses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamas</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I moved to a new server (not that we'll be seeing any more of those) and it was fun for awhile, but I did eventually return. I don't think moving to an exisitng server is really going to solve anything, because doubtless what would end up happening is that you'd buy stuff in EC, and still end up simply looking like a low-end twink compared to the people you'd likely be grouping with. <br />
<br />
You're better off staying where you are, IMO. Old drama and friends you don't see often enough beats new drama and being a stranger. If you have little play-time, on a new server you're unlikely to make many lasting friendships in the modern powerleveling twinked-to-hell Circuit playing environment of the low level game now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elrynia</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kane Bayle is what made me think of that, but I'd miss my friends and eventually it would turn into the same sort of server.  You know what I wish, I wish I could remove my memory of this game and start over.  Damn it sure was fun.  We used to be terrified of the EC tunnel because no one knew what was on the other side.  I thought Rivervale was there and some people thought it was a high lvl dungeon. I never EVER thought I'd see 1pp.  That was just inconceivable.  The first time a high lvl ever gave me loot for showing him the bank in Neriak (which took me like 45 mins lol) I seriously couldn't sleep that night.  I kept opening my bags and just looking at it.  Know what, I still have everything he gave me. Hell even the intro loading music used to get me all excited.  I still love EQ, I just miss it being new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaphirien</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried doing this recently - I have a 52 Ranger and 52 Cleric on Quellious and an old friend from Quell, who had sold his old account, restarted on a young server.  I made a new Ranger there, got some twinkage from him, and tried to make a go of it.  The tough part was just not knowing anyone other than him and knowing I still had friends on Quellious.  I also couldn't justify having two decently-equipped, established characters on a server and letting them sit there.  Perhaps I could have done it if I had made a clean break, but that's what I couldn't bring myself to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluuvan</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just recently started over on a new server. I used to play on Zeb and quit when my ranger there was only 20. I have now started over on Prexus, where i found out i have some rl friends and I have a nice level 11 wood elf ranger. Also I just joined like 5 minutes ago, i wish i had known about this site earlier in my eq career. Good luck to all<br />
<br />
Edit: had to change the level of my ranger</div></div><hr />
