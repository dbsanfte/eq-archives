<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Based on SOE's history of releasing expansions, we know that:<br />
<br />
1.  There will be an emergency patch on the same day of release.<br />
2.  There will be an emergency patch on the second day of release.<br />
3.  There will be an emergency patch on the third day of release.<br />
4.  There will be subsequent patches several days and weeks after.<br />
5.  #1, #2 are both true.<br />
6.  #1, #2, #3 are all true.<br />
7.  #1, #2, #3, #4 are all true.<br />
8.  Some combination of #1, #2, #3, #4.<br />
<br />
Given that we know that they are going to &quot;patch something&quot;, let us all make guesses what to might be broken the minute the expansion is released.<br />
<br />
What is it that you think that needs to be patched first?<br />
<br />
I'll start by guessing that there will be a hole in the Guild Tribute sytem, and exploiters have figured out that nadoo is worth 10,000 tribute points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Graphics Bug. Toons can't [insert witty game-breaking graphics problem here]!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Corpse &quot;loot all&quot; button with &quot;despawn&quot; equipment sporadically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman will be fixed by given a spell vendor which would take about 45 minutes to visit.  Purchasing these spells which are not on Lucy (it would be overpowering to actually show you the spells you are getthgn when you are not supposed to know before hand) would actually make shaman balanced again.  The rumor that shaman were desireable would start to spread with news of these spells.  approximately 30 minutes after this, the servers will come down and the vendor will be removed.  <br />
<br />
Due to this rumor people will rexamine what they think about shaman, realise they didn't gain anything new, and actually are blatant liers (as no one else actually saw the spells) And therefore shaman *should* in fact be ignored, rather than just ignoring shaman out of habbit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There will be a collision bug.  MOBs will fall under the world periodically.  You will pass through walls to fall down and join them.  Mounts will get stuck on dirt clods on a flat grassy plain.  You will have periodic lockups when loading the graphics for a large number of players (such as in PoK).  Random client crashes.  Bugs in the tribute system allowing for exploitation of the point system.  Arrows will hang in the air for a duration of time.  MOBs won't be able to be cornered.<br />

wait... that was the last &quot;upgrade&quot;.<br />
<br />
My bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You'll have 900 spell slots. 10 pages of 9 slots.<br />
<br />
They will fix it in an emergency patch but in the process break bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ginevra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bards will be broken. . . that goes without saying. I also am looking forward to three or four days of patching. And who knows? Maybe we'll get the naked graphics again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They'll implement a fix to bring horrendously overpowered Iron Rations back in line with the standard Rations and will inadvertently break movement. An emergency patch will go through fixing movement but in the process breaking Bards and deleting all characters with the letters x, a, o, e, s, or t in their names</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You will ding back to level 50 after you die, becuase the expansion check is messed up.<br />
<br />
This one is classic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey.  Delevelling to level 50 is awesome.  You give all your tradable **** to your bazaar mule, and when you get rolled back, BINGO, free loot for your troubles!  It's so nice of GMs to do your duping FOR you.  LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's extremely funny.<br />
<br />
And makes me think - how about a thread of suggestions to make the next series of patches work for YOU.  What other exploits can people take advantage of in the course of a patch?  We all know that exploitable problems get patched soonest... maybe this will give them some incentive to make sure it works a little better before release....<br />
