<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know moderators have mass amounts of stuff to look through on the forums, but perhaps sticky some stuff in this section.<br />
we tend to see the same questions over and over again, and honestly as much as everyone likes to help it gets annoing to see the same stuff over and over.<br />
suggestoin-when we see a thread like &quot;soloing tactics?&quot;/&quot;soloing PoV&quot;/&quot;soloing sol ro&quot;/&quot;soloing WW&quot;/ect and there is a bunch of good info in it, sticky it=p, we have seen SO many &quot;hardest possable solo&quot;/&quot;where do i get cash&quot;/&quot;droga&quot; threads...<br />
<br />
i just think it would be a lot easier for people to get/give information with a few stickies.  It would certainly make the resource bank broader because we are gathering information on 1 topic in 1 easily accessable spot where information will not get lost (much easier to compare/contrast if all the info is together).   It will also make it easier to discuse actual new topics when they do come up.<br />
<br />
it is so late i refuse to spell/grammer check and i don't mean to piss the mods off, but please help to organize this section a litte more =p</div></div><hr />
