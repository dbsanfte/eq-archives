<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ya I am dumb. Any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">46 I think.  But you will not get as much exp as you would expect - you can do better grouping closer to your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know that a lvl 45 can get xp with a 65, not sure about any levels lower</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have to be 2/3 of the highest level in the group.  So 43.  Can also confirm from experience, I grouped a 43 BST in Droga the other day and he was getting exp with 2 65's and a 58.  He dinged 44 pretty fast. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah I've always been under the impression that it was 43, and a 40/59 combo worked the other day so it would fit the old levelx1.5 formula...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's 2/3, but I'm pretty sure it rounds up, which is why we waited till 44 to group the new little ones.  Pretty sure we'd tried at 43 and no go, but I could be misremembering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We just did it 3 days ago with the 43... I thought it rounded up too, but I was proven wrong. ;)  Maybe the &quot;rounding up&quot; part comes the lowest level x 1.5 way of calculating it.... ie. 43 x 1.5 = 64.5, rounded up to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been PLing up a little rogue twink - was able to group at 43, get 60-63 spells cast on him at 46, and spells up to 65 at 47.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">half you lvl + 1 + your lvl so <br />
<br />
lvl40 - 20 +1 = 21+40 = can group with a 61<br />
so to answer your question ..<br />
<br />
lvl 43 = 21+1 = 22+43 = 65!!! DING DING DING 43 is the magic number!!!<br />
<br />
(round down or up .. not sure)<br />
<br />
edit..<br />
<br />
BTW this has only been the case since the last major exp change when the gave seb back to people 65 .. when everything went back to LB =)</div></div><hr />
