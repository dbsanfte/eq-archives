<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow I can't connect to most of my frequented websites.  My homepage, search engine, EQ and others.<br />
<br />
Has there been a worm attack, storms in the southern US?<br />
<br />
I know this is techy but if it is a major router outage it is more than &quot;what video card should I buy?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
NE seaboard here and both NIPRNET &amp; SIPRNET are operational for me at work.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">seems fine to me.  What could be is that your default DNS server is down, that would have the effect of looking like everything is down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My brother and I had the exact same thing happen to us last week, we're both running through the same router.<br />
<br />
Not sure about you but I'm using XP and my computer is the server. I did an OS update, almost like re-installing windows but it keeps all your files and settings but cleans up a lot of the registry.<br />
<br />
I then got my hands on a program called Spybot which detects and gets rid of Spyware and other crap that makes it way onto your system.<br />
<br />
Got rid of all my critical problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our lovely network is infected with the Sasser Virus today, possibly other systems experiencing similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can get everywhere I normally go from Atlanta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a new worm out that can affect Internet browing.<br />
the Windows update site has a security fix for it, and Norton has info there.<br />
I got it and killed it quickly, but it was still annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sasser is causing a lot of problems today, and they seem to be getting worse as the day goes on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use Me and have a hardware firewall so I was not so worried about getting this worm.  I use Ad-aware, Hijack This and other tools so I keep pretty clean.<br />
<br />
It seemed like the problem was with the other servers.  My homepage is on my own domain but hosted on a Yahoo owned server, so it was not like it was on my own personal server.<br />
<br />
Seems to be a bit better now.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
Sion</div></div><hr />
