<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else have chars around the 20 level that want to get something going sometime during the week? I have a 21 warrior, and Ravi will have either 23 Druid or 21 Bard. :D  What nites are good to get something like this going? I know Weds are the other 20s group... just curious if there are some west coasters that want to try this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Count me in!  Wednesdays aren't a good day for me, and I'm West Coast (Portland,OR) and would love to organize with you.  I'm currently having internet problems (Version has yet to get their act together), but I'm picking up a modem that I've been letting a friend barrow so I can be at Aranuil's wedding.  Anyhow my DSL should be up soon, so count me in!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was curious to find out since I didnt want this burried to far down... lol <br />
<br />
Any West Coasters want to get a mid lvl group going one night a week? My Warrior is lvl 22 closing in on 23. Ravi and I get on around 830 PST. Anyone able to do that? Give us a break from the mains for a night. <br />
<br />
What nite is good? Where is a great place? Fun as well =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool =) ok so do we wanna stay in the Lake then? If so I have to get someone to port me to DL to make the trek... not going to be fun at 22 lol. IS there an easier way? It will be myself and wifes bard =) Im VERY much hoping we can get something going ... Im getting sooooo sick of Lake Rathe right now. I want to go other places to level.:p</div></div><hr />

Could use one more. What is a good nite for everyone. Weds I dont think are that good ... so maybe tues&gt; Also what is a good time? Ravi and I can usually log in around 8-830 if we can get the kids in bed quickly. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I've been getting Sherazad (my GFriend's HighElf Paladin) up in levels so soon she will be our level.  I don't care what day of the week we schedule, just keep in mind I'm going to be on almost every day of the week in the lake.  (see my other post in younger gen for more info)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thats cool ... just dont level ;)  lol Just need to get the rest of the details from the others and we are there. Thats cool as well .. get your gf involved =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Woot.  I got Sherazad to 19 and a half last night.  So another half a level and her ghoulbane will proc so also with the help of double attack, she'll easily be on her way to 21 very very soon.  Who knows by the end of tonight she could very well be there.  :-)  BTW, Soriathus undinged to 24, but a couple of kills and he should be 25.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sounds great bro! <br />
<br />
Currently I am looking for a port for both of us with maybe a possible escort to the Lake. Once there we will camp and see when a good nite would be to do our little ones.</div></div><hr />
