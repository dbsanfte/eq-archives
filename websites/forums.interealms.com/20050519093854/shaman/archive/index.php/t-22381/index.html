<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First and foremost, these mobs can drop Yiktu and Eril runes, Jelki comes only from KT. This doesn't need to be a debate on whether or not shamans are good in GoD, just providing a model for how a normal group without an enchanter can farm Yiktu and Eril runes!<br />
<br />
http://www.criesofinsurrection.com/files/crucible.jpg<br />
<br />
An evacer can be very helpful if you are low DPS. Basically you fight to the right, as can be seen on the map below, spawns are marked. The Chav PH starts down, as well as 2 of the roamers.<br />
<br />
 The spawn time is 15 minutes, give or take.  This means you get about 4 chances for a named every 15 minutes. And in my experience, named are pretty common, maybe 1 Chav for ever 2 Chav PHes, and 1 Umbiki for every 6 Umbiki PHes.<br />
<br />
The roamers are marked at the lowest point they roam to (as I have seen, not 100% sure on this) and all roam atleast up to the corner before the Chavoor the Trickster PH. To start out, pull the 2 static spawns at the front, and then the roamer might be really close. Try to pull the first 4 static (red marked, they are not red cons) mobs before doing roamers because statics spawn nice and far back and are no danger once you move up, whereas roamers have a habit of popping right on top of your group.<br />
<br />
After pulling the 4 statics, if you have just zoned in and are clearing up for the first time, this is about when the chavoor PH will pop along with the Umbiki PHes. This leads me to believe that the roamer that is up when you zone in cannot pop Umbiki as well as the &quot;never seen him pop here&quot; mark on map cannot pop Umbiki.<br />
<br />
Alright, so assuming no named, kill your way up, make sure not to move up until after the roamer that comes down to there is dead. Once you kill the high roamer, you have two spots you can pull Chavoor PH to, marked with X's. Chavoor PH is kinda a funny situation, I have been grouped with warrior who just run up and shoot at arrow at him and he comes single, I freak out when I see this, but then after a couple PHes I find out they can do this every time with no adds. Meanwhile, I group with bards/monks/SK's who try to get too fancy and it takes them a couple minutes to split the PH... Once ya get used to it a shaman can pull it with Malos. Chavoor doesn't ramp so this is especially useful on him.<br />
<br />
Now, if you have fought up to here and killed the PHs, run down to the start again or evac, evac is nice if you are slow and repops have started.<br />
<br />
So you have the basic farming strat down, now lets imagine a named pops.<br />
<br />
Umbiki: http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14551<br />
<br />
Umbiki triples 1550, rampages(single target) and has a really wussy proc that doesn't matter. Shamans can ramp tank with good gear, or any of the group melees etc. Doesn't rampage much after slow, barely rampages after cripple. Before slow hits patch heals are best, after that cleric can chain CH with shaman patching incase of spike damage with a reasonable tank. This guy drops Yiktu Rune for Balance of the Nihil. Some Robe and Hybrid Cloak that has rotted about 6 times in 10 kills for me :0.<br />
<br />
Chavoor the Trickster: http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14588<br />
<br />
I can't remember if this guy reall does hit 2200, but hes a truck compared to Umbiki. No rampage, shaman can pull with malos, nice to start with whirlwind/furious/weaponshield(might be overdoing it)/Nimble but it really isn't that big of a deal without it. Patch heal before and after slow, sometimes with just malos slow gets a resist, if a melee has a Jman stick have them use it, but usually slow isn't a big deal, but if you get an unlucky string, it burns time you can be patching and ideally you want slow on a few seconds after riposte disc is over at the latest. He drops Eril Rune for Daluda's Mending, some reports say he can drop Yiktu rune also, I don't believe this. Drops nice plate pants and melee earring.<br />
<br />
Both of those guys drop BiC pieces also, I don't really keep track of those. <br />
<br />
Good Luck getting your spells, you can do this with Clr/Shm/Tank/3DPS! Don't forget! Convince your friends to try it without an enchanter!<br />
<br />
And that image is hosting at my guild site, I couldn't attach through the normal thing on this site, dunno why, but if someone can back that up with a host that might not get pissed off at me, that would be great. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I don't know how pictures work :( -- Nevermind! Yay!<br />
<br />
EDIT2: If anyone didn't know, you no longer need sewers flag to request vxed/tipt expeditions, I don't know why, you just don't.<br />
<br />
Also: Exp is about 4% per mob, and mobs die in like a minute. Its far better than earth if you can keep up imo. With a reasonable non-ench pet group (pet soaks up exp) you can get aa every 40 mins with a mediocre group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks T, good writeup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is very doable, did it for a couple hours with about the same group, got 1 Umbiki, stupid robe, we called in a recruit to loot it. XP is respectable too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do Vxed drop pop like runes now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kinda. Eril, Yiktu and Jelki are the 3 runes that drop, and those are for Daluda's Mending, Balance of the Nihil, and Breath of Trushar, respectively. Anyone can use the runes to get their own spells, those are just the spells shaman receive for each.<br />
<br />
Also, if an ench wins a Yiktu rune, don't let them loot it! Its a level 57 spell that they will  NEVER USE . Explain this to them and they will probably pass on the rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very nice writeup Torp, thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I will add that letting a Ranger loot the Yiktu stone is equally as bad as letting an Enchanter loot it. Rangers get what is essentially Superior Heal off a Yiktu stone. Their proc stun apparently comes from Eril. I had one Ranger win over me on a Yiktu drop, and he was pretty pissed with what spell he got when I told him my new slow comes off that rune.<br />

I have seen the lizard Umbiki 9 or 10 times, and seen Trickster once. I have seen exactly 2 runes drop in that time, and lost rolls on both of them :/ I have to say that even given the recent &quot;increased drop rates on runes&quot; that its still pretty fargin rare to see a rune.

try and hit 3600 hps and closer to 5k mana, patch healing on nameds can make me go OOM very fast if they spike up (wich usually happens right befor a CH lands lol)</div></div><hr />

they increased the spell drops, then changed the spells to runes ... WICH changed the rarity all together ....<br />
<br />
so we are back at square one, they are rare like hell again.</div></div><hr />

I agree. We just camped this spot for over 3 hours and neither named popped once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thats really unlucky with chav. With umbiki, however, he can pop in different roamer spots all around the map, so if you zone in and he pops up high in a roamer spot, need to zone out and get a new expedition.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, no really easy way to check this unless you are using 3rd party programs, I tend to have a tracker though that can give me an idea if named have popped elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am I just lucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lucky? well did any runes drop? :P   Before they changed the system, I saw around 3 spell drops from GoD sewer trials in as many runs.<br />
<br />
   After the patch, I've completed 3/4ths of the sewers and done tons of other camping, yet no runes.   Seems the fudged something up on the drop rates, guildees reporting the same thing QQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Got 2 runes in that time, 1 from Umbiki, 1 from Chav</div></div><hr />

So do these new named replace PHs previously there or is there a chance of them spawning after time.<br />
I'm asking as our SK wants a drop from the Ukun Bloodbeast so if we fight to his spawn spot and he's not there and we stay and clear around there the named would have a chance to spawn every 15 mins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When you zone in, The Chavoor PH is down, 2 roamers and 1 static otw to Chavoor are down, 1/2 of the flag room is down, 1/2 of the room to the left of the flag room is down, and a lot of random spawns around the map are down, they don't spawn for a certain amount of time.<br />

This is to prevent people from making an exped simply to check for named and zone out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in an elemential guild. This should be doable for anyone who is skilled. YES, SKILL! We have cleric apps in bazaar gear with ft5 and 4k mana pool who I have done this with. Tank should be 8500 buffed minimum, thats reasonable for any tank who has worked his character up to 65. <br />
<br />
AA, I would say the a good amount of aa for GoD is 100. Thats not unreasonble. This isn't a farm for BoT kiddies, its for players who know what they are doing and have been around for a little while and didn't just pl their botted shaman up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You say the named have PHs so after a certain time do these PHs change to named or do we have to kill them.

<br />
<br />
If you are lower geared you may just have to be a little more strict with your group. I.e. a warrior tank instead of a knight tank. In vxed/tipt, Defensive can be used on  everything except Jhiru. So, Chavoor fight should be easy for anyone with war tank because 60% of what he hits for is just another trash mob. And you can furious into defensive to give slow some time to stick.<br />
<br />
The PHes are down as you zone in, so after they pop that is your first chance for named, sometimes named with pop sometimes they won't. Once the PH spawns, or the named spawns, it won't change unless killed. The Ukun Bloodbeast is a gigantic pain in the ass to pull, there is 12 mobs in his room. Its the one straight ahead. I have pulled him with a bard from the hall above (he spawns at top part of room) and he had to do some highsun/fading and took most of his manapool to pull that one mob.<br />
<br />
So to conclude, if you want ukun bloodbeast, need to break his room, and there is about 12 mobs in there, don't think any roamers, and stay in there, breaking would be really tough, and then holding it would be probably pretty easy until you get a named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Good info but who is it aimed at? <br />
<br />
Well me and my friends in our guild love the challenge of GoD we aren't an EP guild or even VT, Hard LDoNs (which seem easy after GoD now) and BoT towers about our limit. We do have a core group though so we now what each others play style and what needs doing so while better gear might make it easier skill and patience count for a greater part in our group.<br />
Most of us flagged to Vxed, when we tried Tipt it was just too hard for our SK tanking the trash, since Jhiru was lowered and trash upped. Every fight was touch and go and just too hard for us.<br />
Farmed sewer 3 for named a bit, easy peasy we killed named with 5 of us and me being main healer, a non guilded friend then linked the drop to his guild saying Shaman Main healer not two clerics.<br />
That seemed to be the propaganda can't group unless two main healers in GoD trials. We do need two main healers in Vxed but we can take most of the named we have tried apart from that git Chavoor until our monk changed to his enchanter and we slaughtered him.<br />
The main thing is that we find GoD bloody good fun and that is what counts the most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the Jelki one from Kod'Taz+ I believe. <br />
<br />
<br />
For shammies:<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Yiktu = Balance of the Nihil <br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Eril = Daluda's Mending <br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Jelki = Breath of Trushar<br />
Chaos Rune = Ancient Chaotic Pain<br />
<br />
<br />
Very nice write up Torp. Just one thing to add...you don't need a tracker to see if named are up! We have the Vision spell to bind sight to mobs to check around. The only thing is you can't get through any doors, which doesn't really pose a problem since all but one of the named spawn relatively close to the zone in on the east trail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">as of last expansion, a chanter and a box easily duo(solo) this area.  mainly because as the poster noted, mobs here suck at agro, anyone can pull this area and for the most part get single pulls.  snare to pull, root sic pet heal.  the harder of the named, Trickster goes down fast to a hasted pet and isn't at all very resistant<br />
<br />
solo the mobs used to yield 7-9% aa exp at 65.  a lot of times I'd solo this area with my bard and call in a couple of folks when named spawned.  named are common.  you'll definitely see one after a few hours at most.  runes however are not common.  trash can drop a decent mask very rarely<br />
<br />
couple of notes:  the absolute minimum for this zone is 8k 1500 tank... if he's really well played.  for most intents and purposes you'll want a 9k 1600 tank.  the mites summon so be aware of that.  probably the most difficult mobs are nocs as they have spikey dps with rampage, and DDs.<br />
<br />
you can absolutely do this without a chanter.  in fact a high end (end game-god level) rogue and wiz will mow through mobs as quicky as a charmed pet.  so im assuming lvl 70s wont need to charm, but if you're below that lvl of gear if your intent is to farm i'd grab a chanter.  with a full group and chanter you have access to not 2 but every named in the zone, including very nice twink monk/bl claws and knight mace.  as long as you're in for a few hours why not clear all the way to bridge on one side and gate on other and have a chance for 5 6 named?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Killed like 15 of those nameds, not a single rune dropped. Might be my bad luck though.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dawulfie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I've killed 25-30 nameds in Vxed and seen one (1) spell rune drop.  Enraged Maternal Cragbeast in Tipt, 10+ kills, no runes, other Tipt stuff I've killed less often, never seen a rune though.  If you want your first two spells, get them from the sewers.  Trushar level Runes from KT are a common drop from nameds there.  We'd farm Sewers1 with Cleric, Rogue (tanks usually), Monk, Shaman, sometimes adding a Ranger and another class.  A farm run (clear enough to spawn named, go scout, kill/invis to nameds or quit out) takes less then an hour per run, half that if PH's pop.  Far easier then Vx/Tipt, and far more common of drops.  We'd get a spell rune in the Sewers about every 3-4 hours of farming, which is from my experience at least 25 times more common then runes from Vxed or Tipt.<br />
<br />
As far as if your tank is ready for Vxed.  Take him to Sewers1.  If a Shaman can keep him alive on unslowables in one non-defensive, he can tank in Vxed.  Even an 8500 HP tank can be iffy on stuff like Crags, They hit for 1550 max and have a pretty decent proc (want to say 700'ish off the top of my head), 5-6K &quot;burst&quot; damage rounds aren't too uncommon (10K 2KAC Rogue, so for a Warrior would be a bit lower).  Chavoor has rounds of 6-7K on a non-defensive tank.  Occasionally you get one that's more deadly then others, I've parsed two Crags who did in the neighborhood of 600DPS after slow and cripple.  You don't have to be extremely uber, only the Rogue in my normal Vx group is Ele Flagged, and he's tanking so he's down to around 200 DPS.  But he does have 10K HP, and our normal group is averaging 600+ DPS.  If your tank has 8.5K HP, your Cleric has a 4.5K Mana pool with FT10, and your group is putting out 450DPS, it's still doable but it's gonna be awfully slow and it's doubtful you're going to be able to get to, let alone kill the nameds.</div></div><hr />
