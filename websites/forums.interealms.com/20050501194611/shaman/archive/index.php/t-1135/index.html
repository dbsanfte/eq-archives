<br />
anybody seen it? anywhere? anyone? bueller?<br />
<br />
rumor said a katta quest once... i was thinking a rare in griegs maybe... but after 5 months of luclin being out you'd think somebody would have gotten one copy of it somewhere. <br />
<br />
please /bug /feedback email anything it takes to make this spell drop! it's the only buff i have that i dont group-cast, ugh i hate clicking on people trying to target them.</div></div><hr />

If it's in the game somewhere, they did one heck of a nice job hiding it.</div></div><hr />

Over 5 months of 400,000 customers killing in Luclin and no spell.  Remind you of something?  Hint:  &quot;Alchemy is working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
Are there *any* other spells of *any* other class still missing?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Assuming it is in game, you have to first consider the level of the spell and ALSO remember this is a shaman spell.  The spell level is 58 so it will only be dropping off L63+ mobs in Luclin.  Since it is a shaman spell it most likely is a rare drop off of a single rare mob.  Since L63+ mobs seem to only hang out in Umbral, Ak, Ssra, Katta, Acry, and Seru that narrows it down a tad.  Start killing and come back to me in a year with some results!!!  It ONLY took about a year to find Pox so finding Grp.Acumen can't be all that bad :p<br />
<br />
Second thought, didn't Chukzombie claim to have a full spellbook??  Lets ask him!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Probably drops just fine... off a Vex Thal mob....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I remember someone said they had it a couple months ago, of course they didn't post what had it. As if group acumen is that great a spell anyway.</div></div><hr />

/boggle<br />

I did get leviatation a couple days ago though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, still makes me laugh that a basic upgrade to something like levitation is &quot;very rare&quot; :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heyas, just found this thread, I posted a few months ago that i had a full Luclin spell book. Well since then they added Ancient spells (i dont know where they are dropping if at all, maybe VT) thats not totaly true anymore.<br />
<br />
I never counted group acumen as a live spell, it has never dropped even by accident, in otherwords its not in game.<br />
So yes i have a complete book (including tigirs  -yay-) if you discount ancient spells.<br />
<br />
Dont take what those guys at fanfaire said as gospell, many of them have only been with VI for a few weeks.<br />
Who know they might have gotten it confused with single target acumen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&lt;i&gt;Heh, still makes me laugh that a basic upgrade to something like levitation is &quot;very rare&quot;&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
Except that it isn't very rare.  If you want it, all you have to do is kill the Deranged Underbulk.  It's his common drop, he's not a very uncommon spawn, and the camp is rarely ever taken.  The zone is usually completely empty on Bertox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah I disagree on Levitation being rare, too. If you want it, and can convince some friends to go with you to the Deep, then you can get Levitation in under 2 hours I'd bet. That's a hell of a lot easier than some of our truly rare spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah the area isn't camped, but consider how many classes can use it (3? 4?), how many players 51+ exist (several hundred at least) of those classes, and the fact that it drops of 1 mob, in 1 zone, on a 20 odd minute timer, with PH's.  I'd consider that a rare spell for most people, since a lot don't have the ability to go get it, and noone farms the area to sell the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For the record if i did have group  acumen id be happy to tell everyone where it drops.  A shame it doesnt<br />
<br />
Our guild has rules about spoilers due to server competiton but giving a group acumen location would be ok. wish i did know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gonna hafta try Deep on some odd days or something then because the Deranged has been camped everytime I set foot in that zone.  Phrikkin phat pharmers phlattening my spell phlinging.</div></div><hr />
