site has a great step by step guide to getting the epics<br />
<br />
(nothing against Crydee his is great, i just like the step by step here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>victoriatana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice site.  I loved the part that said that the Silver Blade of Thunder could be a replacement for the ranger epic. :p</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but that version of the epic quest is just one big F*** YOU, Crydee especially since they don't even mention that the quest steps were lifted from my short version word for word. The only thing this version has added to my writing is to put in in a table and add how many people are needed [even though I pretty much tell you outright how to get past the encounter.]<br />
<br />
It's sites like this one that seriously make me consider changing my site from public access to private access with registration required. So please do not say that version is better [when I wrote it technically] and say nothing against you Crydee<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes, I have contacted the site owners to tell them very politely how I feel about them lifting the epic faq but didn't even bother to reply back, which is why I tend to get all pissy when people start promoting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trakken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally found Crydee's guide to be much more useful to me than this other one. I did notice that is was almost word for word just put into a bunch of boxes =/. Good work Crydee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ticat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no matter what Crydee, i still think yours is better :)<br />
and thx for all your hard work and i m sure it help a LOTS of ppl get their epic<br />
/salute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aahzmourgue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crydee's walkthroughs are the best.  It's what I used for my epic and a couple of other quests as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feniix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah I agree, Crydee's is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Creedfoia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that looked fishy... After all i did download a Excel file of the epic and that one looked almost identical to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
They can't be too legit eqranger they have a link back to themselfs under their links. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taldaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Crydee's better.  But then again there's no way he could lose.  They are both his.  Damn stealers.  Time to take back the streets!</div></div><hr />

im guessing original poster didn't know that the eqranger copy was lifted from your own.  Aside from that i have used crydee's site for numerous quests including getting my epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Crydee, you're guide is fantastic!  Thank you sir! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Doon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used crydee's guide myself, i couldnt have done epic without it bro many thx, however like any great info it will be replicated and will be advertised, but this should have had a disclamiar on it ATleast showing the source of the info and refernece to the originator Crydee.<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, with the help of a great many old and good friends, I was able to complete Swiftwind last night on my (new) ranger.<br />
<br />
Crydee, your guide was instrumental, the only thing I'd add is the levels of some of the rarer NPC mobs so that tracking filters can be used.  I was 51 when I completed the quest.  I noticed that most of the mobs were blue to me.  VSR was blue and I'm told he's 50-51.<br />
<br />
Other than that small enhancment, I don't think I could have asked for a better guide.  Thank you again. :)</div></div><hr />
