You can find my rant at the above address.<br />
<br />
The pending nerfs are poposterous and should NOT go live, if you feel strongly about this then PLEASE /feedback, petition, e-mail, SOMETHING, let your voice be heard.. i like EverQuest the way it is, and im sure the other 200,000+ do as well...<br />
<br />
If you guys feel this post is inappropriate go ahead and delete it or edit as nescesary, im just trying to help spread the word and get people to speak up / make EQ stay fun / the way it has been for years...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qwexton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To me EQ is not fun when I don't get the chance to kill a Kunark dragon after a MB team has already Visited.<br />
<br />
EQ is not fun when a group chooses a monk because he can tank better and deal more dmg.<br />
<br />
EQ is not fun for mages when all they do is make rods on a raid.<br />
<br />
EQ is not fun when I hit auto attack on an uber mob and sit there for half an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arroe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aye, i totally agree with Qwexton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm all for the changes.  You realise that along with the mod rod change, they're lowering the HPs on the mobs that required mod rods to kill, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SephrokThePathfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly i could care less about MB whether it stays intact or not, but Mod Rod 2 is really such a big part of the high end right now, and the fact that they CLAIM they are nerfing it to PREVENT zerging, they are actualy promoting zergings, as you would need more clerics without the rods to take on a lot of the encounters which you ALREADY need an assload of clerics for.<br />
<br />
And why change mod rods if high hit points are already countering it? Dont fix something that isn't broken.  To many guilds are built around the tactics that have been in the game for a year now, it is going to hurt, and hurt bad... after this change i'm betting my money that a lot of high end guilds will fall and quit EQ.. i know people in my guild who have already cancled their account and have given VI 30 days to &quot;win them back&quot;.  This is bull**** and destroys the high end game as we know it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Manaburn<br />
Well, as i said previously, it is already a way of life.. the &quot;damage&quot; (so to speak) has already been done, and is not reversable, it is to late for them to fix this **** up of an ability... fixing it now is only going to cause them problems. Sure, manaburn was overpowering (arguable, and this is of course my own opinion), what point is there in killing a mob instantly? None at all (other then loot). But they let that linger for how long now? Almost a YEAR? Fking idiots.. if they wanted to fix it they should have done so ****ing a year ago. <br />
<br />
Just because it is an established &quot;way of life&quot; does not mean it should stay that way. The &quot;way of life&quot; was detrimental to the game in many many implications and needed to be fixed, before it caused even more problems. You even acknowledge yourself that MB is overpowered, yet you want to keep in this overpowered ability? Come on. The hybrid exp penalty was a way of life, but would you be opposed to that being changed from its original form?<br />
<br />
Why is it to late? You give no reasons for saying its to late to fix an ability. What problems are going to be created with them changing MB now? I dont see any listed in your post. The only problem I can forsee is backlash from Wizards who will have to get used to this change.<br />
<br />
You say they should have fixed it a year ago...well the full implications of MB were not seen a year ago. They are now. Hence the change.<br />
<br />
I tried comprehending the monk &amp; mage rants, but for some reasons the sentances are getting cut off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Llanoldar Lluindar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Those poor uber guilds!<br />
<br />
Imagine not being able to do things exactly as the people before them did it.  They won't be able to work like machines anymore and they may hafta think!<br />
<br />
How terrible!<br />
<br />
And those poor monks won't be able to take groups from rangers both by being better tanks/doing more damage and by soloing camps we can group at!<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
This is a good thing for EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have to agree re: the modrods. While they are stating that HPs will be reduced on the mobs that need rod/cheal rotations I would not be surprised if they only  do it to the expansion boss mobs like emp/aow. This is what really concerns me. <br />
<br />
It very much looks like an attempt to reduce zerging, but promote a different kind of zerging based on expendable plate classes that have the PoP expansion and Meatshield(tm) disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.<br />
<br />
Read.  Understand.<br />
<br />
'Retuned' means 'changed'.  They will be CHANGING encounters to not require MR2 to complete.  Stop panicking.<br />
<br />
I don't enjoy 40 minute fights that depend entirely on the attendance of a couple of mages.  And believe me, the mages in my guild HATED being forced to chain summon rods to do encounters like IV.  Hopefully now the Luclin uber fights will actually be enjoyable and guilds will start doing them for FUN rather than loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SephrokThePathfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even if they simply change the HP's, you will still need a zerging force (compared to what you need now) to be able to take down mobs like Emp, AoW, Arch Lich, High Priest, etc..<br />
<br />
How long can 8 clerics last in a 2 second CHO  with 2 mages giving them a 2 clerics an extra CH every minute for AoW?<br />
<br />
Even if the Arch Lich/Emp fight is lowered to 15 minutes (from 30-40), the dps they put out will still require an arseload of clerics, thus, VI is promoting zerging and HUGE dependancies on a sole class (clerics).<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
My point about manaburn, the damage has already been done.  Fixing it now is a little late after 100's of dragons have been MB'd, and they no longer feel like anything more than a giant rat... CoF / RBB / scale prices are already at an all time low... with the market flooded with these items already, will there be any point to kill the kunark dragons? Will it be *WORTHWHILE* to bring enough people to kill them now? Some peopel say sure, and i can see you rside, but i personally dont deem it worthwhile to kill them, i wouldn't waste 2 minutes on them if it merely took that long to kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SephrokThePathfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just want to add, that those 30-40 minute fights PREVENTED zerging, you couldn't go in to Arch Lich without a strategy, you had to have a strategy... if you lower their HP, and 100 people can kill him with nearly no strategy or with 1 tank (no tank swtiches or they dont have to heal without defensive or anything) then they aren't doing jack shiz except hurting strategic guilds, and giving zerg guilds new meaning / power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If it isnt worth killing them then DON'T leave them to the lower end guilds who SHOULD be killing them, not to 6 bored wizards looking to make 20k. These mobs are valuable learning experiences for younger/newer/smaller guilds and they learn the elements to organizing themselves for larger targets, robbing them of these learning targets is just a means to keep them below the higher powered guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I feel for the necros that will need to fill the magicians' shoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think your focusing to much on the zerg aspect of these changes, and missing the other point.<br />
<br />
While your point does have some validity, what about the other issue VI brought up of these 40 mins encounters not being fun at all anymore? It's hit AA and go watch TV fight, not fun at all. Can you honestly tell me you enjoy a 40 min fight each &amp; every time?<br />
<br />
Your right that you couldnt go into Arch Lich without a strategy, but the strategy you went in with was boring as hell. They are trying to address that fact.<br />
<br />
What about a mob like Sontalak...he's definately not 100% zerg-able. You could throw 100 people at him, and still wipe quickly. He's got low hp, requires strategy, and is fun as hell to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Let's see.  Druids have a 3k heal.  Shaman have a 2k heal.  You're trying to tell me that you can't organise some kind of heal rotation with 3 priest classes in a guild that can organise a 33 person raid?  No offense, but I find that difficult to believe.<br />
<br />
I understand you're concerned about this change, but you're advocating keeping a system that is, quite frankly, boring as hell.  There is nothing, repeat, NOTHING, entertaining about some of these Luclin battles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Qwexton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heaven forbid people will have to actually think about their fights and use the utilities brought to the raid by all the classes.<br />
<br />
You people have tunnel vision I swear.  <br />
<br />
This will actually help guilds that use strategy in my view.<br />
<br />
Most people in those guilds have a vast knowledge of the game and will be able to come up with tactics despite the difficulties given to them.<br />
<br />
Most people want things to be so easy.  The fact that the game is difficult is the reason I play it.  If it was easy and everyone was Uber gods and I could Solo the AoW then there would be no point to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tamarack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If the &quot;uber&quot; guilds figured out a strategy once they will do so again... after all the stuff VI has added in the last year to make this game so damn easy the games not going to fall apart when they throw people a curve ball.  God forbid they add a new challange.  Nerf away I say.  I'm not just saying that because Rangers haven't gotten nerfed as it sure sounds like our day might be coming too.  These are good changes IMO.</div></div><hr />

But frankly, they are taking our ability to do some of the high end mobs away... there goes a big portion of my fun out the window... <br />
<br />
You REEAAAALLY think they are goign to go through and retune every high end encounter and balance them adequetly?  What i LOVED about Luclin is the fact that you could win with 30 people with the right strategy, but you could still loose with 100 people with the wrong strategy...  key point here bieng strategy, you needed strategy.<br />
<br />
Sure 100 people could loose to sontalak, but you can zerg him with 100 people and win out of luck and without a strategy... i personally think sontalak is kind of a bad example to use.. and how would you like EQ if every mob was, grab your #'s, throw'em at a mob like Sont and hope it dies? Sure there is some strat to sont but not as much as something like Arch Lich or High priest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If line of sight wasn't an issue in archery.. with the new changes to luclin mobs (that mainly being of lower hp from what I understand) then I think archery would be due for a nerf.<br />
<br />
As is though.. that and no minimum damage limit archery a bunch once you get into a few velious and a bunch of luclin mobs.<br />
<br />
I dunno, there could be some gimpage farming a la manaburn with am3/eq rangers I think. It's not as simple as manaburning by any means, nor as effective.. and that's probably the reasons it's not done as much. Sixish am3/eq rangers can do some sick damage to kunark-era stuffs. :p<br />
<br />
Maybe cause there aren't massive ranger farming campaigns like there are wizards on most servers this has never been an issue. For whatever reason, it still stands as a non-issue though.<br />
<br />
The thing is, a nerf to manaburn doesn't really affect the current high end game at all, whereas a nerf to archery mastery (though I think eq would get nerfed first, if they could figure out a good way to do it) would affect uh.. seru and that one blob guy, from what I understand. and whatever PoP ubers there are that archery actually works on. To play devil's advocate with myself, this is something that further separates am3/eq and manaburn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You hit the nail on the head Daesun.  That is exactly the reason why I left past Uber guilds and have pretty much remained guildless.  I just simply found high end raiding boring.  The first few encounters were interesting, but eventually people figure out &quot;the strategy&quot; and it becomes just another farming adventure.  I honestly don't know if this can ever be cured really.  I certainly don't have any suggestions at this point except to make each encounter random (i.e., npcs can be regenerated with random generated abilities, meaning no 2 encounters would ever be alike.  This would be very hard to program tho I suspect).  The game is what it is.  <br />
<br />
The game has ALWAYS been trivial if you think about it.  KNOWLEDGE has always been the key.  If all the Vets started from scratch on a brand new server they'd all be into their 50s within a month.  And for one simple reason, knowledge of the game.</div></div><hr />

Any of you who have paid attention to guilds like FOH, Triton, etc.,  will have heard the horror stories of setting up to do Vex Thal mob XYZ, pull, start the process and then the melees go away for 2 hours and watch TV til the fight is over. That's absurd.<br />

CH change is rather long overdue. I'd almost like to see the original CH spell be changed into a 2k heal, then add new spells added every few levels adding an extra 2k each time.<br />
Maybe 4k at 49, 6k at 56, 7.5k at 60?<br />
<br />
Manaburn nerf was needed. Without it, there would be no way to add 1-2 group raid style content in PoP without having it permafarmed by wizards. In an ideal world, manaburn could remain as is without change. Unfortunatly, folks who use it as a farming tool ruined it for everyone.<br />
<br />
Mod rods, in my opinion, suck. If they were only around to cut downtime, that'd be okay... but pushing mages into a PezRod dispenser duty is lame.  I'd love to see them all removed from the game and content adjusted approprately.  In their place, perhaps offer mages a summonable item which when used reduces the mana loss from a buff type spell.<br />
<br />
I can't comment on the monk nerf, I don't have any first hand experience on that subject. Of all the changes, however, it seems to be the most dramatic change affecting the greatest number of people in a negitive way.<br />
<br />
<br />
My greatest fear about this patch is those folks who are upset about getting nerfed are going to redouble their finger pointing at archery as &quot;overpowered&quot;. Its far too situational with all the problems to be any real threat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rotane Shagaminn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My experience so far with any encounter upto and including the Cursed/Emp fights is not that I can hit auto attack and go away.  They both require in my mind (perhaps not after kiling the mob 10 times but that doesn't count) constant adjustments by everyone.  The same with IV or SV and many other mobs.  On AoW even though it is a fairly simple fight compared to some of the SoL fights there are parts to my guild's strat that require some paying attention.  I don't know about Vex Thal yet so can't comment on that.  <br />
<br />
My guild's leaders and members have been working hard to develope strats to take on these mobs and have enjoyed the fights.  Cursed was killed by us for the first time tonight just as we were learning of the mod rod changes.  I enjoy the game so far and to learn it was being changed concerned me alot.  I am causiously optomistic though that things can remain balanced.  I also hope it does mean Magi's don't have to just churn out mod-rods (that would be nice for them).  <br />
<br />
5 wizards over running a whole raid to take VS or dragons isn't right.  I am sorry, and I wouldn't want to be nerfed but I couldn't agree more with that change.  The whole element of the Kunark Dragon was removed for the middle tier guilds with Manaburn.  I am happy for all those guild to have that back.<br />
<br />
The cheal thing isn't a change that will really affect present encounters so I don't have a problem with that ether.<br />
<br />
Monks?  Well, they tank better than most and do nearly the best melee damage (very close to rogues).  They also get FD which is godly.  I feel sorry for them regardless and probably would quit the game if I were a monk and the changes are as significant as they sound--monks die alot pulling as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats precisely what this change is about. Making Modrod2 into a mana regen device for downtime. It's next to useless in combat with a once a minute duration.<br />
<br />
As for pushing mages into pez dispenser duty. What else are they going to do? Their nukes are poor in comparison with druids/wizards. You only need the debuff once at the begining of the fight and the pet looks after itself. Mages are a class designed to SUMMON things. It's their ability. Their class defining reason for existance. They may not like summoning rods, but by the gods,  without them there to do it many many many raids would fail. In this they are essential to people. <br />
<br />
As for a summonable item that reduces the mana cost of buffs? What like the one they already have? Or the focus items already in game? :D   You will find if this change goes live. Mages will just go back to summoning the original modrod. It takes more mana to do, and is very inefficient but thats the way things will go.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't comment on the monk nerf, I don't have any first hand experience on that subject. Of all the changes, however, it seems to be the most dramatic change affecting the greatest number of people in a negitive way.<br />
<br />
It's kind of hard to say with certainty given that they didnt print any numbers. From the sound of it though they are just reducing the Monk's AC softcap from 1300ish down to around 1000ish. Perhaps a little lower to be on par with the other leather classes.  This change will probably only affect monks with access to NTov and SoL armours - ie L58+ monks in tier 1 &amp; 2 guilds. <br />
<br />
I really do suspect this modification wont be as drastic as people are making out. Monks will still pull the big mobs and tank pretty well given their avoidance skills. They will just need a bit more healing than they used to, and soloing may be tougher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Botting mages used to be not so easy due to the attention they required to keep up with rods but this change looks to me like it will make mages very easy to be played on a second comp. Just cast a rod on every caster prefight and then during a fight have a hotkey for /target &lt;name&gt;, /cast 1, pause XX, /target &lt;name&gt;, /cast 1... and use it when needed.

In fact, yesterday when I heard a guildmate talking about a &quot;Gorenaire raid&quot; wiping out, I did a double - take. The raid was given TWO tries before the burners took over. I think that is the first time in months that has happened. Now, up-and-coming guilds will have something worth raiding, paladins/warriors/bards/etc will be able to try earning their epic pieces again, and dragon loot won't be 90% limited to wizards. YAY!!!!!!<br />

Monk tanking has been nuts. Even monk friends I have agreed with this. Nuff said.<br />

CH, well...if PoP pushes players' HP above 7500, it is no longer a &quot;complete&quot; heal, is it? 10k of healing is overpowered, no argument there, but almost 4k of that was not needed in the first place. All they are doing is making the scope of CH more realistic. I'll miss seeing those 21k critical CHs though :) I will expect that if PoP pushes players' HP above 7500, that some sort of new &quot;Complete&quot; heal will come out to compensate. If not, then they better change the name of the spell to Massive Heal or something like that, because it is no longer Complete.<br />

T-rods...don't care too much about that change, either. I agree that they are a crutch, even for &quot;non-uber&quot; raids. They make recovering from a wipe almost effortless as it is now.<br />

I just don't see what the ubers have to whine about....heaven forbid they *gasp* try new strategies..(I for one think that would be awesome...learning how to do a mob all over again, its exciting to me)....or recruit more people....oh wait, more recruits = less ph4t l3wtz for me....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Anyone who says Mod Rod 2 was useless in combat has obviously never used them. Clerics Mod Rod, druids/shamans heal them, mage mod rods to summon more mod rods druids/shmans heal them. No pause in CH Rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">That's the point Hopwin. I don't know about you, but, if I was a Mage or healer, I'd get annoyed with Mod Rod 2. Basically, what it boiled down to was &quot;Ok, all the melees had to do was hit auto-attack and walk away from the comp, but the caster classes had to stay, sit there, and work their asses off to beat this thing.&quot; Seem fair to you?<br />
<br />
Doesn't to me, and I've never even been on a Raid. I'm only level 39, too low for a real raid yet. Been only in pickup group type things. Hell, I don't even have a guild anymore, and until I'm level 45-50, I don't think I will. Then, I might join a friend of mine's guild. Mithril Web, on Lanys. But, I've busted my butt for all this, so, I know what I can and can't do, so I'm pretty sure they'll accept me. Never know though. I think that guilds who have a boring strategy like that need to take time and rethink.<br />

Personally, I wouldn't try and use Mod Rod 2 if I didn't feel I had to. And even as a Ranger, I would still be there doing what I could at my comp to help everyone. Forget just being melee or caster. I'm a Ranger, in between, deal with the Versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">My point is that Mod Rod 2 IS overpowered, it allows unlimited mana and anyone who says otherwise has never used them. Siriath when a fight lasts 40 minutes, you have nothing to do but press autoattack and stand at the ass-end of a mob, Clerics Cheal the Tank, the Tank holds aggro, Mages summon rods, you play scratch and sniff with yer arse. There is no versatility other than nuking until oom, coming back in 20 mins when your manabar is full and doing it again. Nothing to snare, nothing to root, no one to heal. There are notable exceptions where everyone needed to stay on their toes, but nowadays even those are becoming  yawn fests due to their repetitive nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Exactly why I play a Ranger. Use a bow, and you'll stay more. I am no way saying get rid of melee auto attack, but what I mean is that single jobs get boring. You're stating that yourself. &quot;All I do is hit auto attack and nuke, then sit there when my mana bar is gone.&quot; Do not get me wrong, you need melee people, but, they need something to make the combat more entertaining and at the same time keep the people there. They think nerfing Mod Rod 2 is it. Maybe they are right, which I doubt, and maybe they are wrong. But what it does cause is for someone to say &quot;Ok, this cleric's turn to heal this group, the other sits back to med.&quot; It's not much of a change, and it's not even a worthwhile change in my view, but it does make each class a little less bored I would think.<br />
<br />
And I will grant you, I have never had experience with this, being that I am only almost level 40, and this is my main. But, I am just looking at it from a backed away perspective of everyone as best I can.</div></div><hr />
