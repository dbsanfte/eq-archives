<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I’m home from a night out at my favorite brewpub. Am I buzzed, yeah. Am I drunk, maybe. Have I thought about EQ the last half of the night? Hell yeah!<br />
<br />
First, all you people that just rant on anyone to feel good about your pathetic little self please stop reading this and go back to your sad little existence. (Even though most Shaman seem to be cool.)<br />
<br />
I love life, I love the world and everything in it. That being said I think I hate more people than I like. You know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Sitting at a bar with lots of good friends having fun and drinking good beer, what do I eventually think of? EQ. We all have put a bunch of time into our characters. A lot of us more than one. Right now I am without a guild but I remember everyone that I have been with in a guild and would do anything for them. I sit drinking my last Oatmeal Stout waiting to get home to check out my trader. I want to see if one of my friends from Canada, Austria or Slovenia are on. I miss them and want to see if they are on so I can help them for helping me get my sad little bear corpse rezz’d. If no one is on I want to lvl like a madman. If I’m too lazy to grind I want to find a newbie (even though there are few these days) to give them some gear and buffs. I remember when a guild member’s house went up in flames and we all helped out with donations. We have no idea who someone really is but we care about them because we really do know them.<br />
<br />
Anyway, most people in EQ rule. Shaman’s and this board rules. I hope enough people stay on EQ after EQ2 starts to keep it fun for a while until we all go to EQ2 which I think they will. I don’t expect to get any responses to this but just maybe a bump up so a few people can read it even though it’s just my going on and on.<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mandrake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you brought up a great subject... the juggling of two complete and complex realities.  I play everquest about a 10th of the amout that I think about everquest.  This is due to my roomates not letting me give up hanging out with them for hanging out with everquest friends.<br />
<br />
what they don't understand is friends in everquest (though i have few being a great big giant kitty newbie) are just as REAL as friends in real life...the ONLY single solitary difference is real life is a physical reality and everquest is not.  In fact i tend to believe we probably see peoples more real side IN game because of the magical third wall of the internet protecting our egos and unihibiting our inhibitions.   everyone has been more honest with people in game because things are just much easier to type than they are to say.<br />
<br />
that being said im starting to wonder what i wanted to say and how this realates to anything at all.  oh well<br />
<br />
can someone spend too much time in game?  if your dot kills a mob after you gate out of the zone...does it make a sound?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe im weird but i get off on helping others too.  Just random people, hand them gear that i would have sold to a vendor.  I was like lvl 9 running to black burrow to loot rusty weapons from corpses that were rotting. I was blind as a bat and couldnt see a thing, trying to get through the pitch black tunnel in everfrost.  Some high level spent 10 mins laughing at me, and finaly gave me a mask with some sort of ultravison on it. I wore that thing till like lvl 55 for the effect. Now i find myself doing the same thing that guy did for me. I also do free  tradeskill combines for anyone that will really use the item.  Guess im just a sicko but doing nice things pays off.  Feels weird having peole thank me for stuff i dont remeber doing for them when they were low levels. What ever the next big online game is, i hope poeple remeber to be nice.<br />
<br />
Dont think EQ would be as fun with out a few beers.  May the drunken shaman live on.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Red Bull + Vodka + Bored Shamangina = looking for a zone with plenty of newbies and playing Santa Claus with the lesser items off my Trader.<br />

If I'm almost completely sauced I won't group - but I still like doing something fun for others. I remember being level 18 in LOIO and my old guild leader bringing my Paladin a Wurm Slayer, some Crustacean Armor, and a Deepwater Helmet. I still have that same Wurmslayer in the bank, and the Deepwater helm never left his bags, although he outgrew it a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Sadly, there are more jerks than real newbies on my server anymore. There was one genuine newbie I found to be very polite, never used u or ur or 4 or plz (bonus points if you do that around me, I can't stand that crap) who couldn't often find groups at his level because there weren't too many people that grouped in the lower level zones, which led to him being frustrated. Then when he did get groups, the twinks would always make comments about how he needed to learn to play the class, didn't know anything, etc ... and got him frustrated. It happened on more than one occasion. I showed him where to find class boards, Allas, Castersrealm for spell info and locations, etc ... and he was doing pretty good. But I haven't seen him in a few weeks now. I'm hoping he's just tied up IRL and not burnt out by the number of jackasses out there. If you're 50+ and don't know how to play your class or much about it, I might say something - but making someonein their 20s feel like ass is just lame.</div></div><hr />
