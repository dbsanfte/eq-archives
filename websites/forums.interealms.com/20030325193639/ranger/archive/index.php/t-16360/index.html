<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok first I think this post should be in the Guides section but I notice that everyone seems to be in here so I thought that I would put it here to make things easier a bit.<br />
<br />
Now, I know everyone has lots of favourite spots to lvl for the above ranges but personally I find that :<br />
<br />
Level 30-40<br />
<br />
Stonebrunt definitely is the only place if you like to solo. Xp is seriously incredible. The pandas there seem to put out the most followed by the Highland Tigers. Each kill will seriously net me at least half a blue.<br />
<br />
Pros :<br />
1.)   Fantastic Xp;  (2.)  Learn to become an expert in fear kiting (got funny story at the end here); (3)  No trains, no idiots trying to ks, in fact a seriously quiet zone;   (4)  Wakizashi of the Frozen skies quest; (5)  Swiftclaw Sash Quest -15% haste (?);  (6) Mobs drop random gems and jewellery so you can earn a bit of pocket money while here.<br />
<br />
Cons :<br />
1.)  Incredibly bad pathing, you can get killed just running around; (2)  Mob frenzy - everything will aggro you, except the villagers; (3)  No one to talk to in the zone cos just about nobody goes there anymore.<br />
<br />
Advice :<br />
1.)   Watch mob pathing before you pull. Pull into the village at the start, heh heh there's a pathing issue in the village which may prove to be useful.<br />
<br />
2.)   If you're going out into the open to hunt, always always stay camoed.<br />
<br />
3.)   Anything with the word &quot;HIghland&quot; in their name will have heavy magic resist. <br />
<br />
4.)   If you get mobbed, snare everything if possible, run as far away as you feel is safe and do the camp out thing to lose aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lvl50-57<br />
This one is easy, Jaggedpine Forest Griffons and Anacondas. Long boring tedious but some xp is better than no xp.<br />
<br />
I know I missed out between lvl40-50 but during that time I was split between LGuk and SolB. So these 2 places have been fairly well talked about so no one should have any problems in those 2 places.<br />
<br />
Heh heh now for the funny story. I  went to Stonebrunt when I was lvl32, started to pull, root kite, etc ect. I was still used to fighting like a tank so would close in every now and then to engage. Then found out that this was an extremely  bad idea cos the mobs hit so hard. I resorted to fighting like a druid, snare, root dot, etc. This took me the longest time to finish a mob. Then one day a 58 druid was there hunting Titans and asked what I was doing after watching me fight like a druid for a while, so I told him and he said, &quot;Errr, dude, don't you have the Panic Animal spell ?&quot;. I had spent 2 levels fighting like a druid too.<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Griffs LBlue out about 56, and Anaconda's are to rare and overcamped to make it steady exp, if anyone has any other suggestions id be a happy chappy, in Bernappy drinking some Grappy...........please shoot me if i do that again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I just tried out Chardok over the weekend.  On Saturday I went in KEI'ed and just hit the mobs at the zone in area, made 2 blues in about 2 hours. These are just the mobs at the zone in. I was nowhere close to the fort too. Looks like a good place to try out for a while if it isn't too camped on your server. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, lol you should play on the Zeb server, JPF is usually empty for me. Well, relatively empty, there's usually 1 or 2 other rangers in the zone but that does not present any real problems although I really don't like having to fight over mobs I will if I have too (i.e. like when my ranger hasn't earned any xp for about a week then I become sort of desperate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yuma, are you sure that the griffs LB at 56 ?<br />
<br />
When I hit 55 in JP (haven't been back since; planar xp is too good when its available) I had tracksort set to /con . . . and there were a couple griffs who were nearer the top than even some anacondas and panthers.  I was doing the panthers, BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't know about Yuma but some of the Griffs were light blue at 56 (not all though). At 57 they're all light blue to me but the Anacondas are all still dark blue. You can still make xp there off the Anacondas but really boring though. I suppose it can be a &quot;Last Resort&quot; kind of place to go if one is desperate for xp and can't get into anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alfhild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In order to facilitate efficient levelling at 55/56 in Jaggedpine, you may want to engage in faction work with the townsfolk during the course of your tenure at Jaggedpine.<br />
At level 55, I have found that (roughly) only 1/3rd of the griffons,  2/3rds of panthers, and all anacondas are dark blue. As others have noted, the competition for griffs and snakes is stiff.<br />
Engaging in faction work early can alleviate this pain by allowing you to concentrate on the panthers.<br />
In your mid 40's, see if you can get into a poacher camp group (but beware of the named especially Yranik). <br />
Around 50, group against the Darkpaws and remember that the canines can be used for faction with Sargeant Kaelin.<br />
Also, in the course of fearkiting, keep an eye out for the 4 named poachers (Vaurien, Elishia, Reynald, and Zed) if not being camped since their heads can be handed to Randel for the Sigil Ring, miniscule XP and faction increase. Their heads can be handed repeatedly even after you complete the quest the first time. Though soloing them via root/shoot/dot may be inefficient, they (with wisps) provide an excellent means of increasing archery and conjuration/evocation skills (if required). As well, letting them beat on you when near a bub of health can help get your defence skills up which get neglected during fearkiting.<br />
I have killed 100+ panthers at 55 (while AAXPing) and found that the animals still regard me warmly and I have managed to maintain my ally status with the townsfolk.<br />
Another key point at 55 is to maximize your DPS in order to move onto the next mob. I have found that investing in some dex gear, even at the expense of HP/AC, increases my DPS significantly since Call of Fire can proc 5 to 10 times during an anaconda kite. As well, using a right-click snare, I can get the anaconda down to less than a bub of health, if not kill it, before having to renew snare. Just some thoughts while I end my night shift at work :) :o</div></div><hr />
