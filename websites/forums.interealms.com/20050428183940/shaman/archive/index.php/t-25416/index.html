<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Master hamersmith quest in there, I am 286 smithing and very little to make for improves, my quest is to kill a guy in there, but I hear it is the hardest dungeon in the game and you absolutely need certain classes, of which a rogue is not one of them. I am 57.5, not real motivated tog et 60 since it sounds like the high level places are not possible for our guild, we have one priest and no mages.<br />
<br />
Sounds like EQ all over again, blah.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm personally not to stratholme yet but from my beta experience and my guildies I know a fair amount about it.<br />
<br />
It's true that you need a very competent group to succeed in stratholme, usually a raid is formed of abut half a dozen to 8 people. Yes you need priests and mages, shaman are nice and so is a well equipped warrior, but that doesn't mean other classes are included. You also need damage, and rogues are great at providing it.<br />
<br />
That all said I would not set my hopes on completing the smith quest. Like said before it takes a competent group, which means pickup groups are a bad, bad idea. Loot disputes make them even worse of an idea. You'll need to wait until your guildmates get to high levels to really make any progress in there. <br />
<br />
Until then you will just be punished for being an efficient leveller. Blizzard didn't add much in the area of high end content for soloers, and pvp battlegrounds are a great idea but far off in the future. Lots of my guildmates already in the 60's just spend time in the auction house buying and selling for profit while waiting for the rest to catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But I thought if you are in a raid, quests cannot be completed? Not worried about asshats, this will be 100% guild only.<br />
<br />
Would really piss me off it is like EQ all over again, only the uber need apply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye this game does not cater to powerleveling at this point unless all your friends do it. Most of our guild (20+) is in the mid thirties but we have one powerleveler. He is complaining how most of the quests he finds are elite and need a proficient group to finish. So he is stuck with doing instances with us and not getting exp or playing an alt until we catchup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Might be part of the reason the dungeon seemed so difficult?<br />

Might be some hope yet Mill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hope so, I am so absolutely apalled at the useless proffesion of smithing, but I am so close to the top, i want to get this quest done.<br />
<br />
Will be a while anyway, alot of mid 40's to low 50's in our guild and only two people near 60. I assum we have to farm items in other instances to get mroe powerful, I am only using one blue item hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the way stratholme works it isn't &quot;uber only&quot; by any means. You just need to be smart and skilled. It isn't so much about the equipment you have, it's more that you have people who know how to do their job - pullers who can pull singles, healers who can spot heal, melees who can offtank.<br />
<br />
And Raids can't be used for normal quests, but some stratholme quests are enabled specifically for raids.</div></div><hr />
