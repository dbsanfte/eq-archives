If you're doing it for the fun of killing a dragon, the nest dragons are the easiest, yeldema being the only dragon that doesn't have an AE, and the others beside him being puss.<br />
<br />
If you're doing it for the loot, Ayllish in the valley is the best (7/6 talisman ... I'm 0/3 on them ).  She's pretty hard to solo with just a shaman, but if you are unkos, malo and slow and hell cripple too, its just a matter of time before she dies.  I do her in like a minute with cleric boxed, if you were boxing monk I imagine it would be pretty easy for you.<br />
<br />
The roaming dragons are all pretty easy except for the Dars, Von, Cargalia, Escorpa of the Ring, and Mraaka.  I imagine even Myga can be soloed.  Just remember that you get dispelled, and try to watch for adds, the only times I've died doing it is because of adds.  If you're boxing monk I think you could do all of the valley dragons except for Ionat (silence) and Draazak (cleric) but depends on how good you are at boxing i suppose.<br />

Edit - Stay away from Entariz (kland type AE) in valley and roaming saparas too.  Also the nest dragons are just out on the water, hug left wall from sg.</div></div><hr />
