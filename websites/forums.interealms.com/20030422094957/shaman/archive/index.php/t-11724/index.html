<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've a 54 shamy, and want to duo him to get some good xp.  He's very decently equiped, don't have a Maeglo profile, but rough is 1900ish hp with 960ish AC, ATK is close to 900 with spear.  My choices of partners are a 60 druid, 60 cleric, 61 shamy, 61 Wizzy, or a 63 necro.  what would be the best xp combo to advance the fastest, and please advise where you think would be best.  54 shammy is not currently flagged for any tier 2 planes, and only has key for seb.  Have JBB, drogmar, no Epic</div></div><hr />

Unfortunatly I dont see any melee on you list of posibilities.  Thats a shame because the meatheads are the ones that make the shaman a truly great class.  <br />
<br />
Of the options you have I really dont like any of them.  My gut reaction is the druid, because you and pet could tank and do the shaman thing while the druid nukes, dots, snares, and heals.  That wont work in the planes though because even with slow and cripple you are still not gonna be able to take that abuse for more than a few rounds.<br />
<br />
Shaman/wizzy might be fun.  Would suffer the same problem as the druid, but without any of the neat buffs, abilities and heals.  Faster killing power at the price of utility.<br />
<br />
Necro has posibilities.  Again, no planes, but fear kiting with both pets and both sets of dots might be interesting.  I dont fight with necros very much, so Im not sure how the dot stacking works with them.  Although at 63 necros are using a lot different dots than the ones that shaman and necros share.<br />
<br />
Cleric? if you are gonna have a cleric and a shaman you might as well get a warrior and make it a trio, cause theres not mucht that a shaman and cleric cahn do for each other except trade a few buffs.  The cleric would really become dead weight after you got the HP/AC buffs from them.<br />
<br />
2 shammies?  Over kill, and the level 54 one wont be able to do much.  why bother?<br />
<br />
My advise?  Find a SK or Pally and duo with them.  Both need less healing from you as they both have ways to heal themselves.  And your bufs will make them much much better, enabeling much better experience.<br />
<br />
Thats what I think anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hear a shaman/druid combo does very well.  I belive the necro should have a nice war pet at 63, he may make a good partner.<br />
<br />
I have found that those who want, can make any two classes work together.  I would give each a chance and see what you like best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well to update.  I've been using the Necro.  Summon 63 pet, buff him and dogdog.  I've been dong PoJ.  Doing prisoners and sentries of justice.  Necro pulls, at 63 he dosen't get any adds.  Pull with epic, snare/dot.  Pull to exit.  Dot with both toons, fear, and let pets eat the mobs back side.  By the time the epic dot wears off, pets have eaten mob.  I think it's 1 or 2 percent per kill for me at 54.  Thinking of moving to PoD.  Right now this is pretty risk free xp though.  Don't get in trouble unless someone else pulls a train to exit, even then I use Necro's fear as crowd control, just fear adds and let them run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zupe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some called me a little nuts due to the stacking issues, but I built a Bst/Sham duo team. When one can't slow the other can and it helps with aggro problems. That pet seriously whoops up and the bst does some very nice dps. Of course he isn't as efficient in DoT's as he normally would be, but I see that as a very small problem since he is equipped more to be a tank than a caster. Just another thought for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I duo with a 65 Beastlord in my guild and we compliment each other very well.  Beastlord pets are just freaking insane in damage output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">go pet class for partner.<br />
<br />
i 2 box a beastlord and mage with shammy. these pets tank better than monks and rangers and do massive damage. and if the pet gets low on hps , you can always summon another , whereas with a melee u can't.</div></div><hr />
