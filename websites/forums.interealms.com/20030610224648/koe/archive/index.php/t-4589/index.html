<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well from what I understand EQ has been tweaked for the Nvidia Geforce brand of cards like it used to be tweaked for 3DFX Voodoo.<br />
<br />
Best for the money is probably a Geforce 2MX. $75 US<br />
<br />
Best on the market is the Geforce 3 TI500.  It runs around $300 US.<br />
<br />
There are a few models in between and it really matters on budget.  The different manufacturers aren't all that different, most use the reference design on the boards but usually have a little difference in heat sinks and cooling fan.  Asus has a good product but is one of the more expensive.  PNY is cheap and decent.  Also matters whether you want TV/in out or other features or software.<br />
<br />
Check out www.pricewatch.com<br />
<br />
However, memory and processor speed to have a larger impact then they used to in EQ.  If not at 512MB already, I'd spend the money on doing that and maybe a processor upgrade (both so cheap now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just put a GeForce 2MX 400 - 64 MB card into my new PC and it runs like a champ.<br />
<br />
It cost me about $80. <br />
<br />
Before that I was using a Voodoo card and despite how well it used to do, as EQ changed with the expansions, it just wasn't cutting it anymore.<br />
<br />
I walked into Sanctus Seru yesterday with Windigo and was astounded by how beautiful it was.<br />
<br />
-Quinn<br />
<br />
P.S.  It being Sanctus Seru and &lt;b&gt; NOT &lt;/b&gt; Windigo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Suuuuuurrrrrrreeeeeee Quin You know you were talking about Windi :) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PNY GeForce3 Ti 200 64MB AGP Video Card (VCGF3TI128)<br />
<br />
$219 on Amazon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My Hecules Prophet GeForce 3 Ti200 should be in today.  WOOT!  The Prophet is the only name in Vid-cards.  Never had a hitch with any of them, and never heard of problems with them either.  Only payed 208 fer it too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well best on the Market....GeForce3 Ti500 (this is what I run) cost about $300 US.  You can get a GeForce3 Ti200 for about $200.  Then you drop down to GeForce2 Mx 400 about $100 but most places have rebaits on these from 10 to 25 dollars.<br />
<br />
Now bear in mind the GeForce is a chip just like the P4 and alot of different companies use the chip set in their cards.  They will all cost about the same amount but quality can be extreme.  So make sure you look for one made by Hecules(Prophet) or VisionTek(Xtasy) both of these are great and have never heard of problems for them.  Side by side both with Ti500's only difference I could find is Prophet has a faster refreash rate(but just bearly) the Xtasy I feel is the better of the two only .05 slower on refresh but has over a 1/3 more triangels per inch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radoen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you want a great card for your money go with Leadtek.  Most of the reviews on them have been great, and you get a lot for your money.  I have bought stuff from www.atacom.com and had good luck with them as they have good prices and ship quickly.<br />
<br />
If you want the top of the line card, the the geforce 3 TI 500 is your card.   If you can wait a few months NV25 or Geforce 4 should be out, and from what I hear it will have a lot of Voodoo Tech in it since nVIDIA bough 3dfx.<br />
<br />
a Leadtek geforce 3 TI 500 is $319 at atacom.com<br />
<br />
Geforce 3 TI 200 is almost as fast, but only $177 at www.atacom.com<br />
<br />
the geforce 3 which is faster then the TI 200, but a but slower then the TI 500 and older then both is $254.<br />
<br />
If you want a good card and don't have much money go with the 64MB MX 400.  It uses the geforce 2 processor, but will run SoL good and is only $81.<br />
<br />
you can see all the cards here. http://www.atacom.com/program/atacom_new.cgi?KEYWORDS=leadtek&amp;USER_ID=www&amp;cart_id=2495422_159_121_171_158&amp;SEARCH=SEARCH_ALL&amp;ordered_number=&amp;Disp_item.x=0&amp;Disp_item.y=0<br />
<br />
No I don't work for them, I just had good luck with atacom :-).<br />
<br />
Tom's Hardware just reviewed 21 Geforce TI cards, so check out what they say about the top dogs.<br />
http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/01q4/011218/index.html<br />
<br />
Good Luck in your search!<br />
<br />
I think I will be upgrading to the Geforce 3 TI 200 myself (if Geforce 4 is not coming out soon) as my beloved VooDoo 5 5500 is just not working very well since SoL got loaded. /mourn</div></div><hr />
