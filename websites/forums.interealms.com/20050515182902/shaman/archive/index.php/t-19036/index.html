<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think we are all pretty much in agreement on the issue of Shaman advancement in recent expansions.  We're just seeing the same old tired set of spells bumped up a few points or tweaked a bit.<br />
<br />
I've been reading some books about RL and historical Shamans and thinking about what could be applied to a game like this.<br />
<br />
There are 3 common themes in the literature I've read:<br />
<br />
1.  Shamans affecting physical well being thru cures, curses, poisons (both mixed and magically 'thrown' at people like direct damage spells), and evil spirits (take the last one as 'diseases'),<br />
<br />
2.  Shamans as sources of knowledge and wisdom,<br />
<br />
3.  Shamans as controllers of the spirits.<br />
<br />
EQ Shamans are definitely hit number 1 on the nose, the second they completely miss, and the third is relegated to our 'puppy' spells.<br />
<br />
Now, to think 'outside the box' that the EQ Developers have placed us by consentrating on item 1 above.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Currently, I suspect that any type of expansion of our 'information gathering' abilities about mob placement beyond the 'bind sight' like would be viewed as infringing on tracking abilities.   We once did get some 'Sence' spells, but they are pretty useless in the current context of the game.   <br />
<br />
Twoflower talked with me a bit ago about what if we could cast a spell and LEARN something about a monster.  Consider it a 'Sence Weakness' line of spells.   <br />
<br />
-  One could 'Sence Immunities' that would tell us that when given mob could not be slowed, mezzed, or rooted.  <br />
<br />
-  Another might be a 'Sence Resistances' that would list out a message such as &quot;%T is %1 to %2&quot;  where %1 would be one of (immune, highly resistant, very resistant, resistant, mildly resistant, vulnerable, and not resistant) and %2 would be given for each of (magic, cold, fire, disease, poison).<br />
<br />
- Some others could be 'Sence Detrimental'/'Sence Benificial' that would list out a message for each of the detrimental/benificial spells running on the target.<br />
 <br />
- And to show the full potential of this line of spells, a 'Sence Allegances' that would list out what factions the current mob is allied and opposed to.<br />
<br />
All of these would fit with the Shaman as the delver into the mystic realms of knowledge.  They also fit with Shamans not being the ones that do the damage but rather that they are the ones that help the ones doing the damage.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
As for the controller of the spirit realms, that is problematic from the standpoint that it would infringe upon the other charm classes.   I say 'other' because the original Shaman class was a charm using class to begin with but other than the ability to charm low level animals we lost that ability. <br />
<br />
I would suggest that along the line of Necro's getting a charm undead that Shamans be augmented with a higher level charm animal spell and a set of spell lines 'Break Spirit Bond' and 'Forge Spirit Bond'.<br />
<br />
'Break Spirit Bond' When cast upon groupped player's summoned pet (swarms and charmed pets don't count and maybe not warders or familiars) it would sever the link to between that player and the pet and bind the pet to the Shaman.   <br />
<br />
Spells in the 'Break Spirit Bond' would work as a benificial spell similar to TL giving the dialog a popup to confirm its use when used on players and only be able to used on players in the same group.  <br />
<br />
'Forge Spirit Bond' would work in reverse that it would transfer the current Shaman's pet to the targetted player in group.<br />
<br />
For balance reasons both these spell lines would probably have to act like 'store pet' and remove all buffs and gear on the pet unless the Shaman invested in AA's to preserve those buffs and gear. Additionally,  low level versions would have limits to the max levels of the summoned pets that Spirit Bonds could be worked upon.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Now it might be argued that this type of thing should be in the Enchanter field of expertise since they already have extensive spell lines for charming a pet for themselves.  But, this isn't about doing it for oneself, this is about having an ability to master something and then bind to help another.   This is a central feature in many Shamanistic practices.   To bind a spirit being to a person to help them in some way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd be content if they left our spells in thier lame conditions if they supplimented it with alchemy.<br />
<br />
That is give us very useful spell effects only atainable if you spend time in advance brewing things.  These items would of course either be no drop or shaman only.<br />
<br />
Things it could address would be heals better than we can currently cast, slows and debuffs better than we can cast etc.  Esentially things everyone on this board feels we should be able to do anyway.<br />
<br />
This would only work of course with well balanced droprates or costs for the components.  But I really like the idea that the best shaman at a raid is the best prepared one, not the one with the best manapool etc.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps a voodo doll you can attune to a specific creature and create debuffs on it.  A combination of say alchemy and pottery that can be used on raid bosses making debuffs land easier.<br />
<br />
Say with the right component (a voodo doll) you cast an attune spell on mob, from that point on any detrimental spell you cast on the mob affects it with a lower resist mod or something.  You couldn't slow a mob that is immune to slow but you could slow it more efficently.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really like alchemy and would like to see it needed / used at a raid or even group level.  I make a few 10 dose damage shield potions a month if that and have only bouht the alchemy aa because there was nothing left for me to buy but charisma.  Alchemy is such a cool idea, but made so utterly useless.  I say strip all the future bs spells they are proposing and make them all better and revolve around alchemy, i'd be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sense. ;)<br />
<br />
Actually, I think the whole &quot;spirit&quot; line is more than just our pets; it includes our buffs as well.<br />
<br />
Half of our buffs are useless.  Get them replaced with something that'd actually affect gameplay, and I'd be happy.  (Or fix the stats system so that stat buffs actually mean something - which won't happen.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I want us to summon the departed to us using their personal items as foci.<br />
<br />
Basically, this would be a rez tye spell, except NO XP is given and it wouldn't kill the rez timer.<br />
<br />
This would be basically the Necromancer summon corpse reversed and should have the same level limitations and possibly even the same components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the idea of summoning those who have died.<br />
To be honest, it just makes sense.<br />
Of course, how many clerics do you think would throw a hissy fit? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry if i sound too pessimistic, but you give Sony way too much credit, if you think they'd implement any new ability at this point of the game.<br />
<br />
The main reason for slightly upgrading spells and abilities is, that they are very insecure about the impact of new things on the game balance. <br />
<br />
They are way too scared to lose more customers over a false decision, not realizing, that a static game is doomed to die fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like the idea of summoning those who have died.<br />
To be honest, it just makes sense.<br />
Of course, how many clerics do you think would throw a hissy fit? :)<br />
<br />
None.  They get no xp back and it would take a component as I have it envisioned.<br />
<br />
All this does is allow you to summon someone to the body without making clerics leave ch rotations, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or...they could give us a new pet (shark with laser beams attached to its head) that casts offensive spells to help our dps and defensive/healing spells to help us in that area.<br />
<br />
Or..they could simply give us meaningful spells for once..such as realistic heals (that heal more than 20% of your common tank's HP) and semi-efficient nukes that cast in 5 seconds or less.  Potentially even giving us buffs that add focus effects to players (ext range 1-4, improved healing 1-4, improved damage 1-4, etc.), which is something I think would REALLY help us out in terms of class desireability.  Or buffs that add things like some of the time effects such as strikethrough or other such effects that i cannot think of at the moment.<br />
<br />
I don't want rez or any form of rez spells, the very last thing I want to be bugged for is random tells from people &quot;Hi, can you come to such and such zone and rez me?&quot;  The whole rez for 0 exp thing and leave a corpse that can be rezzed later is also pretty silly.  Also, instead of thinking of an ability we could have so clerics dont have to leave healing..why not give us a better heal so its possible for a cleric to rez someone?  Is it really too much to ask for a meaningful heal?<br />
<br />
The sense weakness line might sound fun, but how much coding would have to be implemented to take advantage of this?  Lots.  Its never happening, but might be a fun idea for future games.  Also, if it somehow appeared as a spell, who has the spell gems for this line of spells?  I certainly do not.<br />
<br />
Breaking and adding a spirit bond to make and break pets.... fun idea sort of, but it would either be way too powerful or completely useless with no middle ground.  Its not something I would want to do, imagine the tells &quot;Hi, can you give me a pet pls?&quot;  &quot;I need a pet still thx.&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">while your &quot;sense&quot; lines are a really creative Idea, they would be worthless in practice. All of the information about everquest is compiled in Illia's, Allakhazam, Wizard site has almost all the resistances of mobs, etc etc. Shaman revealing info would be worthless until they added genuinely randdom encounters. I remember asking a wizard the other day for identify. He didn't know what the spell did. He was level 44. Who identifies items any more? Nobody, the lore doesn't matter, all the quests are solved online for you. You just do the walkthrough.<br />
<br />
If you ask me, Clerics should have Armor class buffs and the Divine Intervention line removed, and given to us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reread it, it's not a damn rez spell.  Only a moron would bug us to get a 0xp summon to corpse.<br />
<br />
The whole rez for 0 exp thing and leave a corpse that can be rezzed later is also pretty silly.  Also, instead of thinking of an ability we could have so clerics dont have to leave healing<br />
<br />
It's not specifically for that, I was giving a example people would understand.<br />
<br />
why not give us a better heal so its possible for a cleric to rez someone?  Is it really too much to ask for a meaningful heal?<br />
<br />
They won't give us complete heal.  I thought of something that made sense for the class and is useful in situations where you either have no rezzer(LDoN) or can't rez(raids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you ask me, Clerics should have Armor class buffs and the Divine Intervention line removed, and given to us.<br />
<br />
Nah, it fits with their class more.  I'd rather see the hp values for cleric and shaman buffs switched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">- Some others could be 'Sence Detrimental'/'Sence Benificial' that would list out a message for each of the detrimental/benificial spells running on the target.<br />
Could be wrong here, but didnt they hint that one of the group or raid leader aa's would do just that in GoD? Not sure, can't remember where I saw or heard that. I do remember thinking that would be a cool feature, to see how many dots you had room to stack on a raid target after debuffs. Too tired to look it up atm, heh.</div></div><hr />

          It would be usefull in the old grieg's end. But they have revamped this zone to be a crappy pop zone type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I belive that the Allakhazam information is overrated and due to be shaken up.   It would be trivial for Sony to implement mobs that have random or semi-random immunities and natural resistances.   It's probably long past the time that they did exactly that and I would not be at all surprised to see it happening soon.</div></div><hr />
