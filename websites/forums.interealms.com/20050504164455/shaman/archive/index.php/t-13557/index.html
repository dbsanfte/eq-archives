Wow.... I mean WOW !!!<br />
<br />
Everything looks so perfect and well designed. No more timesinks for nothing. Spend your time actually enjoying everything you do, even travelling and foraging ? A graphic engine that beautiful that could actually work on my computer, riding a griffin ? I mean wow...<br />
<br />
I find the review all the more interesting that it comes from a well known Eq player, and not one of those testers on the web.</div></div><hr />

It actually has me interested in WoW when I wasn't before :o</div></div><hr />

I'm *really* looking more forward to Horizons and playing a dragon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think that the review was written so that it glorifies WOW.  I mean, it does seem he has a vendetta now.<br />
<br />
grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wonder how much he got paid to his name on that and put it on his guilds site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its a completly different speach pattern from the post below it. hmmm brain washing maybe?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rosco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Frankly I don't think there is any &quot;vendetta&quot; from Furor. <br />
<br />
Whether you like the man or not, he is someone who has spent a veeeeeeery large part of his last 4 years of real life into the game and has a knowledge of it like a very few of us will ever have, even in 1 or 2 years. He has lead the path many times, fighting Velious mobs with Kunark weapons, and to some extend &quot;beta-tested&quot; some part of the game for us.<br />
<br />
Of course he's the man who broke the monk class, but well... appart from that he made few mistakes and brought a lot to the players. Especially because he was so &quot;vocal&quot; about the change to be made to the zone design etc...<br />
<br />
So coming from him, I just think the man is really disappointed with Eq now. That's more the speech of someone who played the game to much and therefore saw its flaws to much, day after day. Now he's confronted with WoW and has the very same opinion of it he had of Eq 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
WoW is brand new, the graphic engine (coming from Blizzard !) WILL rock, they listen to their customer, they've made great games so far. Furor is not lying to us: there's a great chance WoW will me an excellent game.<br />
<br />
But thanks to men like Furor (sorry for monks though), Everquest is also a great game today.</div></div><hr />

That about sums it all up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So, can we get Thott a ticket to the Blizzard offices too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ac2 meets everquest.. ill pass,thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sambow87</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow, a lot more people listen and respect Furor when he actually writes something logical. I just have a question. I've played blizzard games since 95, with Orcs and Humans. All the way up to Warcraft III. I was even 51 on the ladder. But guess what? Did I get an invite to E3? No. But why does Furor get an invite when all he does is play EQ for his life? Not really rewarding the true fans of Blizzard. WoW looks great. I'm buying it. Everquest is too much work then it is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Furor gets an invite cause he's friends with Tigole.  Tigole used to lead Legacy of Steel on (I think) the nameless server and Blizzard hired him to work on WoW.<br />
<br />
And edit, he was invited to blizzard HQ, not E3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was impressed with the review, screenshots and stories about the content. But through the whole description I couldn't help but feel like the whole thing just might be a cry of attention from him as a last resort to get Sony to do what he wants. Kind of like the small child packing his clothings into a suitcase swearing he's going to run away from home after his mom wont let him have another cookie.<br />
<br />
Regardless, from what I'VE seen of the game MYSELF it is very, very impressive... even though very little gameplay (ie combat and questing) has been revealed, the graphics are nothing short of amazing. I want to see what it turns out to be like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sambow87</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">got ya :) Can't wait till I work for blizzard *crosses fingers*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good graphics, no downtime, nice quest system, etc...but boooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiinggggggggggg as **** on a stick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Did I get an invite to E3? No. But why does Furor get an invite when all he does is play EQ for his life.<br />
<br />
Because you don't have 100,000 hits on your web site everyday. <br />
<br />
Hmmm..   this game looks okay. Depending on How much they charge per month (compaired to EQ2), I might switch to WoW. SoE is getting WAY to greedy imo  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've read FoH's site for years now...one thing thats always made me laugh about Furor, is he writes as if HE single handily has made EQ what it is today. IMO his perspective is that he is the sun in which all of EQ revolves....Do the Devs read his site...yes...Do the Devs take into consideration some of his rantings...sure, he's(as well as other high end guilds) on the forefront of  the high end game. Do devs hang on his every word like he'd like to convince you....hahaha yeah, right.<br />
<br />
I think most fan sites are based on the high end game, therefore it would seem that the high end game is the Devs focus, but most need to realize that the high end game makes up a fairly small percentage of EQs client base. Most are casual/mid ranged players a year or so behind the current Uber High End.<br />
<br />
IMHO if you read the whole page, its clear theres an agenda there on the new update...its obvious...but I think it will be great when he and everyone who shares his mind set and contempt for this game, leave.<br />
<br />
WoW dose look awesome though and I will for sure try it out....have no intentions on leaving EQ as Ive never been set on &quot;winning&quot;, but good luck to all who do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>sambow87</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok, well point taken. But what if I ran a website for free condoms and got 100,000 hits a day? Would I get an invite then! Huh?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Depends on what you had on your website advertising said condoms :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Snarky of Cazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The whole update was played very straight and earnestly by Furor, who genuinely seems to be getting into WoW right now. But make no mistake; there was an unwritten underscore of an extended middle finger toward Sony in that commentary :)<br />
<br />
I didn't believe it at first, but Furor genuinely seems to have had it with EQ. I guess I can see it from both sides. On one hand, Sony has done a lot to make their game better, and they are genuinely trying to make EQ fun for everyone. But the high-end game is hell, and Furor has seen the absolute worst of it. Really, he should just dispense with the countdown and call it a career - he sounds ready. It'd be for the best, for everyone.<br />
<br />
(Plus, imagine what his account would fetch on Playerauctions ;)</div></div><hr />

 u know how much **** the buyer would get for buying furor if he decided to sell it ? most people treat ebay's like hell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The fact that Furor is going to play WoW is the first good reason I've come across not to play the game myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What Crusty said.<br />
<br />
Furor is not the messiah of MMorpgs, hes more like the very embodiment of whats wrong with the high level game of Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Have any of you actually played a Blizzard game?  I mean come on, its going to be good, it will be exceptionaly good...but it will be late.  This is a GOOD THING.  WoW will be the next everquest, Blizzard doesnt EVER do a bad job, and I for one will be playing this game.  <br />
<br />
Kudos to Furor for getting a sneak peak!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Jees, Straif, give us a break.  It's getting deep now.  Yes, blizzard makes some good stuff, but like someone else said, no one player will have much to do with it.  Anyway, if it were your company, would you really want an endorsement from someone who has, on a daily basis, trashed the game/company he's been playing for the last four years?  No thanks.</div></div><hr />

I offer the PK / duping mess that was Diablo1 multiplay and the current train wreck that is &quot;closed&quot; (read, cheat-free as advertised BY Blizzard) Diablo2 Battle.Net as a rebuttal to that argument.<br />
<br />
I used to play and love both until Blizzard just gave up on trying to stop the rampant cheating (D2 patch 1.10 has been in development for almost a year now).  I have also heard (because I don't play) that Starcraft Battle.Net and Warcraft3 Battle.Net are rife with cheats as well.  I am VERY wary of Blizzard's ability to put out a multiplayer game that isn't ruined by their molasass-like speed of stamping out problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I plan on playing WOW to check out the game.  I have been extremely satisfied with all of their games to date.  Personally, they tend to burn out quickly though.  WC3 for example was fun at first, but the perspective was too close to the map for my macromanagement addiction that most Blizzard games feed.  The game died for me after a month of online frustration.  Battles are too quick and too small.  WC2 and Starcraft are nice and still get played on my PC.  WoW has the look.  It also has the promise of a good game when it first comes out.  Will I burn out on it quickly?  Will it not hold my interest?  I think if it all depends on the friends I make because the engine looks solid.  I won't replace EQ though unless WoW is the hella bomb!</div></div><hr />

Those are not persistent world games, and they are client based.  Of course there is going to be cheating.  When ever you can edit all the files associated with the game, there will be cheating.  But, name some significant game play problems that were released with the games that made the game a pain to play.  The duping in Diablo did not have to be done by the player.  Blizzard did not introduce timesinks into the game just to make it harder or more frustrating to kill Diablo, did they?  No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Battle.net etc are also free as I recall.  Hard to justify a corporate budget for maintaining something that is not generating any persistent revenue.</div></div><hr />

PoP being developed and released before this fall's expansion (which is supposed to be dungeon-heavy) says it all. People like Furor driving the direction of EQ has driven it into the ground.<br />

You win. Game over. Ogle your stats and then leave.</div></div><hr />
