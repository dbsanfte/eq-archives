<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fatius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">uhm.. ok.. some friends and i are going to try and take down the turtle if we can.. i have a few questions:<br />
<br />
1) the group will be:<br />
<br />
54 necromancer (me)<br />
55 shaman<br />
54 druid<br />
52 shadowknight<br />
53 bard (possibly)<br />
 - we will likely be aggro kitingng it.. the shaman pisses it off immsensely with slows and debuffs and just runs it around while i and the druid load up dots and the sk and pets go to work - is it doable? none of us are in uber_guild_01 - but we all have a fairly reasonable set of items<br />
<br />
2) any specific immunities? lifetaps, magic.. slows etc, all info will help<br />
<br />
3) does he summon? if he does it'll be almost impossible.. i watched a 60 druid solo kite him once and noted no summonings<br />
<br />
thanks in advance, any other miscellaneous info is welcome.. and i'm aware that this isn't particularly ranger related, but i didn't know where else to post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Narreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lodi summons, so aggro kiting isnt an option after you do any noticeable dmg to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One thing about Lodi is he's a target for everyone running ShowEQ.  GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trelad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hes a baby..all i have to say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kalanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something important to know about Lodizal - he resists all spells out of melee range, like Fire Giants do.  Make sure your shaman knows that, or he'll have a hell of a time slowing.<br />
<br />
One slowed, he's a wuss. Only hits for 350, and if I recall right, doesn't even double attack. He does summon, and enrage.<br />
<br />
Also; as I posted in the quest section, eyepatch of plunder thread, his spawn time is 11 hours +- 20 minutes. Doesn't skip anymore.<br />
<br />
-Kal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fatius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for the feedback everyone<br />
<br />
few more questions.. does he despawn after so long after spawning?<br />
<br />
..how much hp does he have.. ?<br />
<br />
is it possible for the group i originally listed to drop him, using basic tanking methods?<br />
<br />
and does anyone know any good strategies for pulling him, we have no chealer and not being able to pull him with snare/slow may cause problems.. he may be a &quot;baby&quot; to you, but the hardest mob i ever killed had a mere 15k hp.. and this is my/our first time doing this type of thing..</div></div><hr />
