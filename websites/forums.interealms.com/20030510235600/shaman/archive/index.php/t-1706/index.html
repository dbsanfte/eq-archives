<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kardyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Paludal is the definite spot for your early 20s. I got from 19 - 24 there. If you solo, you can fight the sensi mushroom that is near the exit to shadow haven. It gives you like a blue and a half for quite a bit. You can also get into a group and fight the bandits on that level.<br />
<br />
For your mid and upper 20s, take the trip to South Karana and go to the Aviak village (known as KFC). start with the egrets, then darters (note, darters can outrun a SOW). Next fight the rooks and harriers. I wouldnt fight an avocet unless you are in the high 20s and you are buffed.<br />
<br />
Good hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Has anyone hunted in Netherbian and/or Dawnshroud for their post-Paludal levels? I'd like to stay on the moon for a while (having seen plenty of South Karana in a previous incarnation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After Paludal I went to Nether.  Fungus are weakest, then Trogs, then Netherbians.  Afterwards, head to Dawnshroud peak and hunt the mushroom temple - about 8 spawns you can single pull - GREAT place to solo or partner.  That lasted up into mid 30s.  Then start on Zelniaks, Tribals until over 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Marus Seru is extremely fast experience for the mid-high 20s. It's an outdoor zone, yes, but it seems to have a quality ZEM. Start with rockhoppers and progress to Stonegrabbers. <br />
<br />
Netherbian Lair is even faster exp, and you can start in a group as soon as you leave Paludal. I found the mobs regen made them out of my reach to kill solo until I reached 24, though. (I could finish one off and end with low HP and OOM, whereas duoing with a melee they were almost trivial.) Pre-24 if you put two DOTs on a fungoid or trog, their HP actually still rises a bit per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Would a 24 shammy / 20 Warrior duo do just fine in Netherbain then ?  or should I get the warrior to catch up closer to the shammy ?   <br />
<br />
BTW - Did 10-18 yesterday with my Warrior with my shammy Pl him .. Kurns from 9-16 then a couple quick levels in Paladal (1 hour for 16-18)  But it didn't come without people yelling at me telling me the tents are camped.. blah blah blah .. and one guy even told me to go back to kurns.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hawbes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I like how people dont seem to share that area. Oh well. I moved off the moon, and went to South karana, only because the exp seemed to slow down there, tremendously! Going into might be a better idea than sitting at the spires. Marus Seru was good for a bit, again, slow exp, DS wasnt much better for me. Any decent dungeons with exp bonuses for lvl about 24-30 out and about, having troubles finding someplace I havent been before.</div></div><hr />
