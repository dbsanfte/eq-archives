<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all<br />
<br />
I will be 65 in a day or 2 and I'm looking for some advice on 2 issues.<br />
<br />
I currently have 1000 AC and 2900 self buffed hit points.  My equipment is passable so I think I'm ok in that category.<br />
<br />
I have 24K to my name. I have Torpor and Malo.<br />
<br />
How should I spend my money?  Whats the &quot;best&quot; spells to get at 65?  Should I blow all 24K on Q or get the poison DoT?  I have Breath of Ultor already.  Or should I just work on my equipment since I already have Malo and Torpor?  Is Q &quot;that&quot; much better as well as Malo/Malos?<br />
<br />
Also, I have no AA's.  Obviously I want to start working on Cann V - but what should be my progression to get there?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quiessence does not slow/snare target.  Quiescense can be cast outside of group.<br />
<br />
Been a while since I used Torpor but I am pretty sure you could only use on group members.<br />
<br />
Malos is nice, but Malo will do for a while.  Quiscience all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get Qui then Blood.<br />
<br />
For AA:<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Canni V<br />
ND3<br />
SCM3 <br />
<br />
<br />
after that (which will take you a while) the options change based on your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I might go with innate metab over regen3, regen is kinda meaningless when you have Torpor/Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A pre-grats to you on being a Prophet! WOOT WOOT!!<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn ... *drool. I'm all about damage ... but ... I've got to say get Q ... ASAP... grind those AA's ... I got Canni 5 the other day, and my GL had purchased Q for me (33k, GACK but still better than 80k). Light help me, but I've never in my life seen a mana bar replenish like that. It gave me goosebumps. And when you warn the clerics, hit C5 and your health is sucked to your mana pool ... it's awesome to calmly say &quot;Healing ...&quot; and hit Q during the moment of shock and watch your health jump up.<br />
<br />
I'd say ... Q, Saryrn, Malos as your top three. Fo7 can just bloody wait, lol.<br />
<br />
And for AA's ... I went innate regen/innate stamina, MC3, and C5. MC3 is a prerequisite for C5, so you'll want to get Baron and the 12 for MC3 outta the way ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends on your play style. Get Q first, then figure out if you raid, group, or solo more.<br />
<br />
If you raid mostly get fo7, malos, then any order for the rest.<br />
<br />
If you group mostly then get fo7, malos, saryrn, others<br />
<br />
If you solo mostly get saryrn, malos, any others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's all about Quiescence.  There's nothing else to talk about.<br />
<br />
For AA:<br />
Run3 is still a must <br />
Regen/Metabolism/whatever<br />
MC3<br />
Cann 5<br />
then whatever between ND3, RC, SCR, SCM, HG, CA and QB, in no particular order.  <br />
<br />
Actually, get RC1 early.  <br />
<br />
I love VP3 also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is Q &quot;that&quot; much better as well as Malo/Malos?<br />
<br />
Yes, it is.<br />
<br />
Malo is good enough that you don't really need to worry about malos.  It is nice to have but not a priority, as long as you have one of them.  Blood of Saryrn lets you solo better but soloing is pretty worthless now.  Ferine Avatar is a good spell, but not nearly as good as Q.  FO7 doesn't matter unless you raid a lot.<br />
<br />
For AA:<br />
<br />
run3<br />
regen3<br />
mc3<br />
canni5<br />
vp3 &amp; nd3 &amp; scrm &amp; scm3 &lt;--- do in any order<br />
defensive aa<br />
healing aa<br />
<br />
Do a search for posts by me about AA if you want more details, I have written a lot.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO can't tell you what spells to get w/o knowing your play style. <br />
run3/regen3 is a must, don't doubt the power of 3hps/tic. Beyond canni v, it all depends on your playstyle. <br />
<br />
Ie if you solo a lot BoS/Bane all the way.<br />
If you duo with a tank class Quiessence!!<br />
If you do big raids F07 (ie 18 man raid, f*** it just cast focus).<br />
<br />
It also depends on the level of monsters you like to fight and where you fight.<br />
<br />
Jihem has some awesome posts he said something about:<br />
vp3 &amp; nd3 &amp; scrm &amp; scm3 &lt;--- do in any order<br />
defensive aa<br />
<br />
But he's being too general. IE if you solo a lot then vp3 is more important than most things. If you are taking a lot of AE's and canni ing too low, ND3 would be well suited. If you are raiding and getting killed a lot every time you aggro, LR5 would be better. And if even after canni V you are noticing you could use a ton more mana, scm3 is just nuts!<br />
<br />
The extended buffs are just convenience things and help with torpor/q, so IMO that's the last one I'd get in the list he mentioned (err not including healing aa).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I recently hit 65 as well and the only spell I had was Ferine Avatar (only cause it was a great price).  I litereally spent no money skrimping and saving, farming cash, etc until I had enough (18k) to buy Q.  I don't have torpor or malo but Q is absolutely great.  With Q and Tnarg's I've been able to keep 2 people healed while they each tanked a BoT giant (slowed of course) after the cleric went down.  You don't have to worry about slowing the person you cast Q on, you can cast it on someone pulling if they are getting beat a little without snaring them.  Q is good, Q is great, Q is wicked awesome.<br />
<br />
For AA's I got run3/regen3 pre-LoY so before we had Stoicism.  After I got my drog he ate so much food I had to stop leveling and get Innate Metabolism 3.  I would Recomend Run3/Innate Metab 3 if you have a mount or plan on getting one (i would it's a great investment).  The definately get MC3/Canni5.  I have MC2 and I'm 4 AA's from MC3.  Then only 5 more iirc til Canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you don't raid, then you do not need malos AT ALL. It is by far the least important rune spell...if you have malo. Malo is easier to channel, cheaper to cast, works with focus III effects, and the difference in 99.99999% of XP situations between malo and malos is essentially nonexistant.<br />
<br />
Q is the most important, easily. After that it does become a playstyle issue. If you solo a lot, BoS, if you group extensively, Fo7. Feral Avatar is good for soloing (on pet), and groups (on melees and pets), the issue there is how willing you are to put up with the recast. You might want to not consider looking for FA until after you have SCR3 and/or SCRM...an extended enhancement IV item wouldn't be too far out of line either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As has been said, it's mostly what you do most with your time.  For spells:<br />
<br />
solo: Q, BoS<br />
group: Q, FA<br />
raid: Q, Fo7, FA<br />
<br />
I don't have Fo7 yet and don't plan on buying it anytime soon.  I don't raid and group probably 75% of the time.  There's no way I will pay what is asked for Fo7 just so I save a little mana every hour and a half, it just doesn't make sense when you can do the single target version.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you raid and are going to be expected to have MGB Fo7 available, then it's a must.<br />
<br />
FA is amazing in groups and probably even moreso for raiding since you can then focus on just keeping FA up on the rangers, rogues, and monks.  True you will have to put up with the recast time and duration, plust it's not a cheap spell to begin with.<br />
<br />
As for AA's, the normal whatever+run3, then mc3, then canni5, SCM3 and probably a few levels of SCR or even SCRM.  After that you can really just get whatever you want, but if you solo or group very much (particularly in ldon) I suggest getting at least virulent paralysis 1, but level 3 is awesome.  I am not really a big fan of natural durability because I'm always buffed with virtue, but I do suggest lightning reflexes and improved defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah, whether you group, solo or raid, you still want Quiesence over every other spell.<br />
<br />
edit:  missed the &quot;Q&quot; part in Jaidin's post... oh well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Arriana is right about malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I keep hearing of pepole getting q for around 20k. But on my sever &quot;The Rathe&quot; q always goes for around 75k and torpor mid 20ish. Whats the deal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">15k on AB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For spells, get Q first.. then Blood. Since you have Malo, save malos for last.<br />
<br />
For AAs, after Canni 5, get scm3, then VP3(if you like to solo, this AA kicks major arse.) ND3 after that, then it really doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agree on Q.  If you're in a raiding guild, Fo7 is next important, if not, BoS.<br />
As for AAs, I did it this way (99 right now):<br />
<br />
Regen 3 (Might have done IM3 now though)<br />
Run 3<br />
MC 3<br />
Cann 5<br />
RC 1 (best two points I spent)<br />
SCR3<br />
SCRM (at this point, Ferine Avatar's worth owning)<br />
MGB (skip if you don't raid)<br />
QB 1 (I did for class title, but it's nice with Q)<br />
CA 3<br />
LR 5<br />
ND 2...<br />
<br />
working on ND3, and I also have picked up 3 levels of New Tanaan Crafting Mastery in there because I'm a tradeskill junkie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't understand why is Q important for raiding? <br />
Why do you want Q if you are soloing in the face? (specially since supposedly you proc more with torpor than q)..<br />
Why is Q important if you are in regular xp groups and don't need to heal much. (tnargs &gt; q in this case).<br />
<br />
I only use q when I canni on raids (majority of the time)... and Q is nice when you are worried root will break soloing and want to run like hell..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Rathe is a very expensive server, not only on spells but equipment. :(</div></div><hr />

Q allows a shaman to become a healing station for anyone in the raid.  Druids do not have a viable heal over time to use to counter ae's and such and they may likely be busy direct healing tanks.  Q enables a shaman to very easily keep a rage tank alive for many lower PoP and pre-pop encounters.<br />
<br />
While soloing, the difference between torpor and Q isn't huge if you plan on tanking all the time and never moving.  However, it's not practical to tank many xp mobs in PoP solo and you do not want to be snared when moving away from said mobs.  Also, if you are meleeing at 61+ while soloing...uh...ya<br />
<br />
In xp groups, Q makes it very easy for a shaman to be the *only* healer in tier3 and below PoP zones, or even tier4 with a huge amount of aa as well :)  Basically Q makes it so you don't need to use direct heals in xp groups unless you have a huge pull.  Also, in adventures where mobs and players typically move around a lot, you won't be snared while you and your groupmates are moving around.<br />
<br />
However good you think torpor is for you, Q allows you to give that and more to anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Get Malos last, it really is not noticeably better than Malo all things being equal.<br />
<br />
If you like to solo, get the Dot.<br />
<br />
If you raid, get Fo7th and MGB.<br />
<br />
If you single group XP a lot, get FA.<br />
<br />
Get Quiescence regardless, it is the best of the 65 spells.<br />
<br />
On AA's go straight to Cann5 and after that pick up the stuff you like the best.</div></div><hr />

You REALLY need to get Spell Casting Mastery 3.  Trust me, its damn good.  The mana savings is better than you can imagine.  I'd suggest people get SCM3 right after Canni 5, its that good.</div></div><hr />
