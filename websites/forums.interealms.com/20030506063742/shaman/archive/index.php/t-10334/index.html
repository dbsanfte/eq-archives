<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
A few days ago I accidently activated the windowed mode of EQ. I changed &quot;windowed mode&quot; to &quot;=FALSE&quot; in the eqclient.ini file (I think it was) to get rid of that as it was messing up the brightness of the game for me.<br />
<br />
But ever since then my settings never get saved! Windows that I move around, changes to bazaar price list, friendslist etc etc. Whenever I log on it automatically reverts back to like it was at the time I turned on windowed mode. <br />
<br />
I hope this makes sense to you. Any ideas on how I can make the settings save as usual??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you use a custom UI, try typing:<br />
/loadskin (custom UI foldername) 1  (/loadskin default 1    if you use the default UI)<br />
The 1 at the end of it tells it to save window positions<br />
<br />
As far as the windows changing positions, they should stay in the same place in windowed mode as in fullscreen, provided you didn't change the resolution you run EQ in.  Make sure you're in the resolution you want to be in - this is easiest in game, alt-O to bring up options and click on the display tab.  It can also be done in &quot;Options&quot; before you get to the password screen loading EQ, or in the eqclient.ini file, although that last one is a pain.</div></div><hr />
