<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the mid 50s, what is more important? In the 60? Endgame?<br />
<br />
Should I strive for ballance? If so, what would the HP to AC conversion rate be? Would it change as I level?<br />
<br />
Seems that I've read too many discussions on this topic that don't actually give clear direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Balance is always important - not much point having 3000 HP if your AC is 500.<br />
<br />
Personally I was aiming for AC while in my 50s, and after I reached 60 I started thinking a bit more about hit points. If you plan to get some AA skills, then you'll need to get enough HP that you can use Canni 5 (it is as good as everyone says) safely.<br />
<br />
As far as figures to aim for, that's very hard to say as it varies depending on what sort of level you play the game at. My AC is around 1000, and my HP around 2000, whihc I feel for me is pretty good, but for someone in a large raiding guild would be pretty poor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't look at AC when asking for an item.. Only hp that will gave me and / or effect.<br />
Usually AC follows.. There is not much high HP item without a normal AC on them =)<br />
Also, AC means less and less you fighting tough mobs. It might be nice for kunark mob or some velious one.. But with pop, AC means nothing to me, I still get badly molested )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just depends on your playstyle<br />
<br />
Sub 60 - solo - HP regen and 1000+ ac<br />
<br />
sub 60 grouping(doing alot of healing) - HP regen and mana<br />
<br />
60+ solo with canni 5&amp;torpor - HP HP HP HP HP (keeping ac 1000+)<br />
<br />
60+ raiding shaman HP - AC - resists - mana. Raiding shaman need to be durable more than anything else. <br />
<br />
Set a goal and pick gear accordingly. I'm looking for 3000hp, 150 all resists, 1150 ac unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A good balance between all things is important. Looking at your profile...you really need to pick up some more WIS and/or Mana gear.<br />
<br />
While we don't want to sacrifice everything in the name of WIS like a Druid will, having only 93 WIS tells me that you must do a lot of Cann Dancing. Cann helps us regain mana quickly, but it's always good to have some mana so available just in case things go bad. I'd say try getting your WIS up to around 150 or so if you can. You have lots of AC/HP for your level as it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I evaluate gear like this - Convert all other stats/mana/saves/ac into an equivalent number of HP.<br />
<br />
My formula is:<br />
<br />
1 AC = 3 HP<br />
1 Wis = 2 HP<br />
1 Sta = 2 HP<br />
1 Agi = 1 HP<br />
1 Mana = 0.05 HP (probably too low - but I don't care for +mana gear)<br />
1 Save Magic = 0.5 HP<br />
1 Save Fire = 0.5 HP<br />
1 Save Cold = 0.5 HP<br />
1 Save Poison = 0.25 HP<br />
1 Save Disease = 0.25 HP<br />
<br />
Strength/Dex/Int/Charisma have no value.<br />
<br />
I use this formula to determine upgrades, etc. Focus effects, and similar abilities obviously need to have seperate consideration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can only win EQ when your cha is over 500 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Like Toktuk said, you can go for a balance of all things. You dont have to go hardcore on one or the other.<br />
<br />
My goal has always been to get to 1000 AC, keep my wisdom over 200, and get as many hps as I possibly can (no, I'm not uber obviously). My self-buffed AC is 995 right now, but I can boost it to 1029 with Voice of the Berserker. Wisdom is around 224 or so, and self-buffed hps are about 2750. I'm trying to replace my bp, legs, and shield with tae ew stuff, and that should finally boost my AC over 1000 without having to use Voice, and it will give a nice hp boost as well. Not sure whether I'll gain or lose wisdom, but that's my lowest priority to be honest.</div></div><hr />
