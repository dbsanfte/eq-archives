** Experience System Changes - Round Two **<br />
<br />
In the test server update that occurred earlier today (server downtime), <br />
and in the PoP Zones Update that just occurred (PoP zones downtime), there <br />
were a number of tuning changes made to the new experience system and the <br />
PoP zones themselves.<br />
<br />
The effect of these changes should more closely match the intent that was <br />
described in the original message. The first round of changes, by the <br />
numbers, didn't.<br />
<br />
It went the right direction in all cases, and a number of the group size vs <br />
target type combinations were covered well. However, there were a number of <br />
cases where the target was overshot.<br />
<br />
Among these:<br />
<br />
- Not generous enough vs PoP NPCs for groups of all sizes, the smaller <br />
groups and soloists being the hardest hit.<br />
<br />
- Too generous with 4-6 man groups vs Non-PoP NPCs who can, in some cases, <br />
barely hurt their attackers.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're interested in helping test these most recent changes, here is the <br />
list of combinations that we're trying to make sure all reward <br />
appropriately:<br />
<br />
Solo - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range<br />
Solo - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range<br />
Solo - PoP<br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range<br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range<br />
Small Group (2-4) - PoP <br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range<br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range<br />
Group (5-6) - PoP <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind while testing out group experience, as always, group <br />
bonuses only apply according to the number of people who are in range. <br />
<br />
Feel free to try out as many combinations as you can. As before, we look <br />
forward to hearing opinions on these changes via the boards and Dev Corner. <br />
Thanks very much for helping out!<br />
