<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am now up to the stage of taking this guy down so need to know a couple of things?.<br />
<br />
Assuming ring has just been handed to him...<br />
<br />
1) Does this guy cast any aoe spells, or other spells.. EG Ice, Fire?<br />
<br />
2) Is he magic resistant, or resistant to any line of spells.<br />
<br />
3) Which line of spells hurt him the most..EG Ice, fire, etc <br />
<br />
4) Do you kill him at the same place of his reaver place holder?<br />
<br />
5) Can you just have the melee beating on him while the casters do their thing? ( Not sure if any mages available on the day)<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind Regards, Ridgey (Bristlebane)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was warned about a Grav Flux that he casts.  So our force all Lev'd up.  Never noticed him casting even once though.   Could be that it is an AE and since Lev was up, never got so much as a resist emote.   Could be that it isn't really there...<br />
  Landed slow easy.<br />
  My DDs seemed to work fine.  The whole 1 or 2 I remember getting off.<br />
  Kill him at the reaver PH, yes.<br />
  Mages for Rak, not Neh.   Melee away on Neh'Ashiir.  <br />
<br />
  Also, you didn't ask about where you can get him.   Seems almost undisputed he is on the last reaver, but we popped him on our third reaver somehow.   Nice, ut confusing.</div></div><hr />
