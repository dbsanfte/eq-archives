<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someplace new would be nice , i was really likeing the velious expansion pack.<br />
<br />
so where did you level at ?<br />
what do you suggest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">check the hunting forums...lotsa good posts for your level in the 30 - 40 section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 34, I really liked Dalnir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dalnir was good, but the CR's there were hell.<br />
<br />
If you go, make sure you have a solid, competent group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tizmaks in GD can be done duo quite easily I did about 2 levels per day there from 35 to about 40 <br />
<br />
Kodiaks in GD I did the same about a level or level and a half per day to 45 and its about a 5 second walk from the Tizzy's <br />
<br />
Giants in GD - Pull the fort respawn is very fast the xp's are good with a good group or duo.<br />
<br />
All of this was duo with a monk, none of the mobs were very MR, and the only casters are the Tizmak Shaman who dont hit hard but will slow your partner so keep Cure Disease up when pulling those..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's some ideas:<br />
Paw inside, get a group together and go in :)<br />
Sol A<br />
Lower Guk<br />
SK (gnoll spires, not the best exp, but good to solo while trying to get a group together for inside paw)<br />
Crystal Caverns<br />
Tizmaks in GD<br />
Animals in IceClad (giants are doable but bad exp)<br />
Animals in EW<br />
Stonebrunt mountains(should be some animals that are blue)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yuuki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Crystal Caverns is awesome at 34, I leveled from 34 - 40 soloing there. Lower Guk is good too at that level if grouped, don't think it would be a good place to solo until around 40 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree gloriana dalnir zone in is good only prob is the darn cleric dwarfs but just keep em dotted good and use a pet, find a fd puller and can get a lot of mobs<br />
<br />
the overthere is also good, stick to ckickens and sarnaks as they run when low on health but rhino's and cat's dont,<br />
also if your an iksar you can chill by the 2 named scorps and they will assist you with any sarnaks should you get in trouble<br />
<br />
crystal caverns has some nice loot and you can get the componets for the thurg gate potion there which is a nice thing to have. :)</div></div><hr />
