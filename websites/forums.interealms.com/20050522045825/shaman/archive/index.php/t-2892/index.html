<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So for shamans the best focus types will be (ones marked with ** I reckon to be the most important):<br />
<br />
Improved Healing + 20% Healing:<br />
<br />
Idol of the Underking - Off Yael in hole so not exactly easy, range and a nice item to boot<br />

Shroud of Veeshan - VP item<br />
<br />
**Extended Range + 15% Spell Range:<br />
<br />
Cryosilk Sash - hmm unlikely to be wearing anytime soon<br />

Square Helm - Not a bad item##<br />
Supple Scale Armband - hmm switching Velious armour or JBB?<br />
<br />
<br />
**Extended Enhancement + 15% Spell Duration:<br />
<br />
Amulet of Insight - Nice item, I would wear this##<br />
Dragon Scale Mask - ST, might give this a miss<br />
Rokyls Channeling Crystal - Excellent but im a shaman<br />
<br />
<br />
Enhancement Haste + 30% Spell Haste:<br />
<br />
Mosquito Hide Belt - Pure casters again<br />
Ring of the Shissar - Excellent item but most likely out of my league<br />
Yunnb's Earing - VP, need i say more<br />

**Mana Preservation - 10% Spell Mana Cost:<br />
<br />
Crystaline Torque - VL and quite possible##<br />
Nevederia's Left Eye - ToV<br />
Obulus Death Shroud (yippee one I actually had!!)##<br />
Sky Watchers Monocle - ToV<br />
<br />
**Spell Haste + 15% Spell Haste:<br />
<br />
Essence Lens - ST<br />
Frostreavers Embroidered Cloak - hmm not even going to look up where this comes from<br />
Hand of the Master - ToV<br />
Valtrons Necklace of Wonder - ToV<br />
<br />
Affliction Haste + 33% Spell Haste:<br />
<br />
Bracelet of Sky - ToV<br />
Circlet of the Falinkan - hmm quite possible quest, shame it isnt one of the more wanted shaman items##<br />
Girdle of Magnificence - not any time soon<br />
<br />
**Extended Affliction + 20% Spell Duration:<br />
<br />
Bone Clasped girdle - quite possible##<br />
Bracelet of the Deep Sea - ToV<br />
Coldain Military Wristguard - quite possible, shame what you lose as an item if you choose to wear this##<br />
<br />
**Affliction Efficiency - 25% Mana Cost:<br />
<br />
Boots of Superiority - ToV<br />
Boots of the Dead Dream - no it wouldnt be ToV again would it?<br />
Gem Encrusted Ring - Seb!! wow might be able to get this##<br />
<br />
Summoning Efficiency - 25% Spell Mana Cost:<br />
<br />
Circlet of Summer - ToV<br />
Enshrouded Veil - HS, quite possible##<br />
Overseer's Signet - Quite possible##<br />
<br />
##Items marked are possible for non uber guilded people though sometimes need a high level group or more.<br />
<br />
Hmm this is a rather limited number of items for a reasonable guild or even bunch of friends to be able to achieve. Surely this just increases the divide of the power of the uber guilds against anyone else? I can count 10 items that I would be interested and capable of getting and out of the ten only 2 I would actually make an effort to obtain as being possible and useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I could be wrong, but I think the Gem Encrusted Ring doesn't drop anymore (for some time now).  Funny that they would put effects on items like that.</div></div><hr />

Verants implimentation so far has been fairly random and doesn't seem to make much sense. We'll see what happens in the future. I still wouldn't be at all surprised to see effect changed this next patch still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gurrr... I just paid 12k for a Gem-encrusted ring. They had better not nerf the damned thing. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So these are the only 3 items that give enhancement haste?<br />
<br />
Probably the easiest one to obtain would be the Ring of Shissar.  And that thing is a huge pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One note - Idol of the Underking doesnt just drop off Yael.  We had one drop the other night.  I wasn't playing my shaman, but my cleric.  I think the highest person in the group was the enchanter -55.  We were doing the castle entrance, and I think it was a named mob.  Can't say for sure though.<br />
<br />
We have been in the hole quite a bit lately, still no spaulder drops.  And it's the only time I've seen the Idol drop.  So whatever mob it was, it is possible for a 51-55 group to kill, along with 3-4 adds at the same time.<br />
<br />
Just seems to be very, very uncommon.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, last the roll to the druid btw.  Sucked <br />
:mad: <br />
<br />
edit - I can't spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Idol of the Underking can drop from any mob in The Hole, just extremely rare (like all the loot in The Hole, except for specific named drops).  I got mine while camping the rat jail and it came from Slizik the Mighty (sp?).  A druid in my guild got it from one of the regular rats.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't wear this all the time, or even very often, but I still want one in a bad way for one simple reason: Malo's casting range is almost exactly the same as a WW dragon's aggro range. It would be nice to be assured of landing Malo on a dragon that hasn't noticed you yet, instead of inching forward and crossing your fingers that you don't get too close and end up having to channel it. (Not that difficult, but it's slightly nerve-wracking.)</div></div><hr />

Would also probably be pretty useful to raid to increase the range of your heals when taking out some of the kunark dragons if it means you can keep out of their AE range - especially if you can keep out of fear range.</div></div><hr />
