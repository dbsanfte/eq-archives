[U]Just curious about how much points of damages you are all dealing in regular xp groups in PoP, only with your nukes/dots ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I am in a good group I frequently dont do ANY damage.  Malo, slow, buff, back up heal.   I guess the puppy is helping a bit.  In less uber groups I start to add BoS and epic for a few K in damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at least one tears of saryrn<br />
at least one velium strike<br />
dog is what? 30 DPS<br />
<br />
I estimate 3.5-4k  while performing other roles such as slowing and healing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In outdoor zones and with c3 (almost always) after malo and slow I can chain ice strike with canni4 and not really lose mana.  I usually hit the mob with five+ ice strikes (675 to ~850ish depending on bard).<br />
<br />
I sometimes forget about puppy and dont bother with rains or dots in xp groups usually.  Although with a good sk / pally it's nice to be able to equip the extended affliction, affliction effeciency, and affliction haste items again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am almost always filling the roles of primary slower and healer.  Doing that, I usually don't have enough time to throw out damage, but when I do it is usually just a blood of saryn and a spear of torment (missing velium strike).  I have my pet up almost always, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Usually I chain tears of saryn with torrent of poison if I dont have to heal at all.  If I have to heal I just throw in a velium strike or two whenever my mana is up or can5 is about to recycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
It really depends on the situation for me.<br />
<br />
Today, helping some lower level friends in PoI (while hunting Sillicorrosive grease for the Cloak of Greater Pernicity) I typically led with Slow (I was pulling) and then cast Bane &amp; Ebolt.  This would have me tanking (Torpored) for half to sometimes the entire fight.  Occasionally I'd recast Bane if the group was really slow.  This is a very ABNORMAL situation for me, since I was basically slumming in Tier1 searching for the grease and helping friends out at the same time.<br />
<br />
USUALLY, in a normal Tier3 exp group, I get one to two Tears of Saryn in on the mob, and occasionally a Velium Strike as a finisher, depending on the group's DPS &amp; my mana level.  On a named, I'll cast some DoT's after aggro is well established.  If the group's DPS is poor, but we have a SK/Pally as a tank, I'll use Bane early (Torpored) and then cast a single Tears of Saryn, possibly adding a Velium Strike as a finishing nuke.<br />
<br />
If the group has a CC person (Ench/Bard) AND a good cleric I trust, I will cast Tears &amp; Torrent back to back when the mob is about 60% health (or more if the tank is uber), and finish with a Velium Strike.  I have to give up an extra gem to do this, so I don't do it often unless I know my groupmates.<br />
<br />
In Tier2, I'll normally act as main healer and slower, and I'll cast an epic dot (that will never finish) and either a single Tears or Bane, group DPS depending.  I'll sometimes put that ancient JBB on and use it just for something to do when I have a bit of free time, but that isn't often and the DPS it puts out is paltry. <br />
<br />
Dogdog is out there putting out his usual damage in most cases.<br />
<br />
I tend to use the epic dot as a &quot;time-spacer&quot; for myself in many situations, as I often get impatient and want to nuke (w/ a rain) or dot early.  The long epic cast time is usually enough to guarantee that I'm safe to cast something else as soon as it lands.  I don't count this as damage really (it almost never finishes), and I won't use it at all if the possibility of adds means danger for the group because I have put a horridly long duration (&amp; mostly worthless) DoT on a mob.<br />
<br />
If I have a mage (summoned) damage bracer on, I find myself chain casting Velium Strike more often than I've listed above towards the end of the fight.  With the bracer, I get hits of 1100 to 1110 every so often, which is always nice.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends on rate of pull. With fast pulls maybe 2k + whatever the dog does. If they are slow, 4k or so maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Depends a lot.  In regular XP groups, I am often lazy.  I'll slow and dogdog and maybe BoS or VS a couple times.  Sometimes, I have a silly group that wants to screw around.  I've landed BoS + Ancient: SoN + BoU + Pox on a mob before (Go directly to aggro!  Do not pass Go!  Do not collect 200 platinum!), which is, iirc, some stupid DPS &gt; 100.<br />
<br />
On raids, I'll often VS things, and will BoS sturdy mobs where appropriate (when clearing for the Rallos script, Hinvat Deathbringer *always* eats a BoS).  Really obnoxious long battles will suffer more dots, also - I've generally keep BoU + BoS up on the Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra's in Vex Thal just to prevent myself from dying of boredom (can't drop all 4 dots though - KTXAHR hits hard when it gets testy with you =P ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not sure of the points of damage, but I made a discovery recently that surprised me.  I was duoing with my wife, and I'd just dinged 61 but she was still 60.  So I degrouped.  Back in the 50's we'd do this and I would sort of &quot;power level&quot; her - she'd do more damage so would get the kill.<br />
<br />
I laid on my usual epic dot, a poison dot, chained a few JBB's, refreshed dots as needed.  Oh, and sicced dogdog on it too.  Turns out that was a bit of overkill - I did more than 50% of the damage.<br />
<br />
Now, given our debuffs, I don't think we have any business being able to out-DPS a warrior for a 1-2 minute fight.  Especially a reasonably well-equipped warrior who is capable of holding aggro through all those dots and mini-nukes.  I was glad to see the planned upgrade of melee capabilities - my guess is that that change is going to be primarily focused on the Warrior, with some gravy going to rangers, paladins, and shadowknights.</div></div><hr />
