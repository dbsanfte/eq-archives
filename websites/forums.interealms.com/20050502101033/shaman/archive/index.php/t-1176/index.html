<br />
This is getting way out of hand... 7 posts on the front page alone with plz help me with my pathetic equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id rather people put all their threads in one spot then spread it out through multiple forums.

All these equipment threads are making it hard to follow the bb drama :D<br />
<br />
(edit) Oh and having an equipment section is very nice since then you dont have to dig through alot of other things when you are looking for *gasp* old equipment advice (edit)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first starts like this:  Hi, I'm lvl 30 -45, just started going AC/HP instead of WIS and need help deciding on the 'least craptacular' gear for my money...<br />
<br />
The second starts off:  Ok, I've got 'OMG-No Drop sooper-dooper Earring' that gives me +50 to every stat, but ya know...I'm just not happy.  What do you think about 'OMG-Another Earring most people will never see' ?  <br />
<br />
Plus there is the perpetual &quot;I got a fungi for my lvl 5 twink Shaman...is that good?&quot; which is usually asked in the most innocent voice possible.<br />
<br />
But really, couldn't all these threads just go in the Quests/special Items sections?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IMHO no one would use the forum because no one would go there to give advice or it wouldnt get the same traffic at least so people would become impatient and just post in general anyways...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frehya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think this becomes just a natural progression.  Those burned out on reading and responding to these threads can &quot;retire&quot; skip over them and let the next wave of players that came up help out..and so it goes.  <br />
These threads being on the &quot;big&quot; board have the best chance of actually getting the help they requested.  <br />
I have been on a specific dog breed list for some years now...same thing happens.  Let the newer blood that has some knowledge put in their time helping now and when they are burned out, there will be those people that received good help able to step into their shoes.  Isolate it to its own section and you might only get newbies there asking and getting no answers. <br />
Or so the theory goes.    :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
6 months ago it was a great board, but now it has ben invaded with<br />
<br />
- newbies asking neverending equip question<br />
- newbies whining about fungi tunic on twinks<br />
- newbies trolling<br />
- older member of the board being *******s to the newbies<br />
<br />
Its not bad you would say, its normal, but they do it all the time, all the time and all the time. Its just annoying.<br />
<br />
I see the beginning of that on the crucible.<br />
Be very careful mods, even if censorship isnt well seen by the masses, it is necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">have to agree with arc there mb used to be awesome retired my monk yet still post there on occassion. Monk was main but hey..now i'm on my shaman having a great time on new server hehe 24 and rising on fv!<br />
<br />
equipment doesnt seem to be as rampant but might be a good idea to get it off the main general board....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What's &quot;pathetic&quot;? The fact that being in EQ since the first day of beta 3, and still being only lvl 51 and wearing BD tunic, RMB's, some Ry'Gorr and such stuff, all that just because I have a life outside of the game, which I like more, and am a member of a small guild - pathetic gear? Or my char is pathetic, because he's not wearing any &quot;uber&quot; gear?<br />
<br />
I've done with this &quot;pathetic&quot; gear more wonders then many &quot;uber&quot; twinked chars. It's the skills which make things different. Now, at lvl 51, I have finally been able to go to some plane raids, though haven't got anything from there. 3 Fear raids, from these 1 was just a &quot;walk&quot;, because apparently some other 'uber' guild went in before and cleared the place, and other 2 raids were 5+ min raid and 7+ hours CR (not a guild raid, guild too small, I asked to join raids of others). Been 2 times on PoG, both raids were quite a success, save the fact that not a single shaman item dropped. At least I am now very &quot;steady&quot; with imagineable and unimagineable Tunare factions - it can't get any worse heh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree  Banadan<br />
<br />
A little real life perspective is nice. :)<br />
<br />
This is very simple.  If yoo don't like equipment threads then exhibit a smidge of self controll and don't click on them.<br />
<br />
Mez just to stupid to understand what da problem is. :)<br />
<br />
Guud Bashing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">IMO he used the term pathetic out of lack of a beter word to describe what is an overall redundancy of posts.  Its the same things every day, over and over again.  Maybe a little give on both sides would help to alleviate the problem.  These posts for the most part have been answered.  Even with the older messeges being gone they have been answered in the last month.  Those posters are more then capable of looking up information just the same as others are capable of not clicking the threads.<br />
<br />
All it takes is a little cooperation.  Having a board dedicated to just equipment would not be a bad thing and judgin by recent post moves Sun and Than could just relocate any threads in general section.  Of course thats a lot of moderating and I have no idea how time consuming that my be with their schedules, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have to agree with the original poster.  When I first found this board and had a question about whether or not a fungi was still worth getting after the price hikes, I was surprised there was no equip section.  After a long time posting on monkly-business boards and various other class-specific boards, I really figured I'd catch a flame posting an equip question on the general board.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's &quot;pathetic&quot;? The fact that being in EQ since the first day of beta 3, and still being only lvl 51 and wearing BD tunic, RMB's, some Ry'Gorr and such stuff, all that just because I have a life outside of the game, which I like more, and am a member of a small guild - pathetic gear? Or my char is pathetic, because he's not wearing any &quot;uber&quot; gear? <br />
<br />
Just because someone has uber gear, it doesn't mean they play eq every waking moment and have no real life.  I get tired of people inspecting my low lvl chars and sending me tells &quot;man do you leave the house?&quot; just because I have nice gear.  All it really takes is a few lucky rolls in seb or something.  In my case, I won a roll on an rbg &amp; heiro cloak twice.<br />
<br />
Again, I would like to see an equip forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like the equip threads and have learned a lot from them. <br />

I'm just getting into the higher levels and may need to seek or read about more equip stuff as I am looking to get resist gear and replace other older equip.<br />
<br />
To those of you who have been lv. 50+ for months (or years), this stuff may seem boring, old news, repetitive.  From the poll someone did recently, most people on this board are over lv. 50.<br />
<br />
However, for us younger folks, this type of dialogue can be extremely helpful.<br />
<br />
Not sure how I feel about a separate equip.  forum.  Whoever posted that no one would go to the forum except those needing help, that seems likely.  That could be a problem for those seeking advice.  Kinda like the hunting forums.  People who have gone thru the levels do not seem to spend time posting very much in response to questions from younger characters.  /shrug.<br />

<br />
<br />
Here is what I see...<br />
<br />
I have been on this board for almost 3 years. Back in the old days this board was great. We talked about strategy. We talked about quests. We worked through the alchemy formulas etc we talked about all the happenings with the shaman class in general b/c everyone was growing and finding new things etc. I will call those the &quot;glory&quot; days of this board.<br />
<br />
It just seems now that all of that has left and we are reduced to talking about how to twink, what is the best gear for X-Y range etc. All of this can be obtained in 1 forum. There is no reason to trash of the &quot;GENERAL&quot; forum with all this crap. Please note, in my post above I said 7 equipment threads on the  FRONT PAGE alone. If you want to take the time go back through all the pages since the board wipe and see how many posts there are. I will bet you find over 100.<br />
<br />
It is not that I think those questions should not be asked.. is that I think they all need to be put in their &quot;own&quot; spot. So that those of us not interested don't have to muddle through them all. <br />
<br />
So in essence, and perhaps it is a bit arrogant...  I would like to see them removed to their own board so that we can see a shift back on the general board to the stuff that is new and exciting to the shaman class. Not this mundane(sp?) help me with twink_gear_01.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">isnt that why the magelo profiles thread are around for us to look at each others gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just wanted to add my 2cp from a lower level &quot;newbie&quot; (less than 6 months playing EQ) perspective:<br />
<br />
While I have nothing but respect for the elder shaman on this board, at times I feel uncomfortable posting new topics as I honestly do not know if my topic/issue has been discussed 10,000 times (the recent board wipe compounded that problem as the search offers limited insight). The few topics I have posted have been submitted with admitted apprehension. Most of the time I just lurk and read the various posts (and flames/complaints about how these topics have been beaten to death). <br />
<br />
To my &quot;newbie&quot; eyes the seven equipment posts on the front page are valuable resources as I upgrade my own gear. In contrast, the 10 &quot;is a fungi tunic any good&quot; threads are worthless to me because I know that a fungi is great and I will probably never see one :). Hence, I do not read the threads that do not interest me.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that an equipment forum would be apropriate - just from an organizational standpoint if nothing else. As an avid equipment thread reader I dislike sorting through the 600 other threads about soloing yeldema in 10 seconds, etc.  :) I guess it all depends on your perspective.<br />
<br />
Another suggestion based on Targar's comments: What about a high-level shaman forum? A place for the veteran shaman to talk about the issues that are important to them. Heck, even let some of the more avid veterans strictly moderate the place. The paladin's board has a similar forum and it seems to work pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the problem isn't too many equipment threads, but not enough &quot;high quality&quot; content threads.  As the game matures, more and more of the content has been figured out.  There's not really a need to figure out alchemy, or the quest for our epic, or how to do any but end-game dungeons... they've all been figured out by now.  (That we don't have a library where we keep all of this knowledge is annoying, but the subject for another thread...)<br />
<br />
Even on the tactics and strategy side, most of the battles have already been waged.  What's left?  For end-gamers, there are still topics to cover- but not as many as before.  For newcomers, there's the same old stuff (starting race/stats, equipment concerns, etc.)  That's what you see on the board now- posts from end-gamers asking end-game questions, and &quot;newb&quot; posts covering material that's already been covered many times before.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the &quot;Glory days&quot;- lots of new content, things to learn and explore- is largely gone now.   The game, and this board, have moved into a new phase.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a &quot;Library&quot; forum, where those among us that didn't start their shaman on release day can go to get info without feeling like they're offending the board regular by posting questions.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the equipment threads are often my favorite ones... as I actually sometimes feel like I can contribute something.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Targ,<br />
<br />
The problem is that there's only a finite number of things to discuss. Back in the old days many of our discussion were about equipment as well, the only difference is that back then it was new, there were different items to get without having to spend a lot of effort. There are less topics compared to back then only because of most of the topics we once enjoyed have been beaten to death by now. <br />
<br />
Group tactics, solo tactics, how to get your epic broken down into each step, strategy for breaking planes, dealing with slowing, etc have all been done numerous times. There simply isn't much to discuss anymore, since the only real mistries are some of the high end mobs, and people don't openly discuss them for a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
There you have it, the game's getting old, there are very little things of wonder left to talk about. The number equipment threads have not gone up over the years, the number of other discussions have gone down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yea those are all valid points.<br />
<br />
However, let me tell you my own experience or a small vision if you will.<br />
<br />
First lets look at the safehouse. It was orignally a rogue board. But go down and look at the number of people on there. 200+ at just about all times. Do I want the cruicible to turn into that? Not really but I am drawing on this... They have a great deal of &quot;other class&quot; trafic. Personnaly I would find it invaluable if we had a lot of warriors enchanters etc visiting this forum to give their insights. That is why there is &quot;nothing&quot; to discuss. We have limited ourselves to Shamanize. This is partly b/c other classes also don't want to have to wonder through all these (in this example) equipment threads.<br />
<br />
Also I think we would see a shift in what is discussed. For example, I made a post about IV the other day that basically turned into a flame fest. I originally just asked for a respawn time on IV's guards. Not a strategy..nothing more than a respawn time. People started flaming this way and that saying blah blah  go find out for yourself etc. (which we had and have done).<br />
<br />
If we started to talk more about things like strategy, hints and secrets I think that eventually we would open up to more of this. Tell me, where do you go to do your research about something in the game? The cruicible is not my first or even second choice. Anyway I would love to see this place become a forum where we have a lot of participation from other classes to discuss things shaman or otherwise. After all this is the GENERAL Forum... not the equipment forum (which I propose to make).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I picked up EQ in November because that was the soonest I was able to convince myself the pay-to-play system was worth it.<br />
<br />
-- Story begins now --<br />
<br />
Soon as I'd picked a character I liked the feel of, I set about hunting down all the information I could possibly find. The game seemed so huge, so I figured if I ever wanted to actually get anywhere I'd need to know all that I could. I _never_ would've gone the AC/HP route if it wasn't for this board. Wouldn't even occur to me. I mean, why would a priest need AC/HP? That's why I have a tank right? And for soloing I was used to the pre-Dogdog root-kiting methods. So I eventually found &quot;here&quot; and read everything I could get my hands on. I was actually surprised at the amount of useless equipment information. Sure, I was only a newb, but I wanted to at least kit myself out well enough to get by. I resorted to digging into the EQShaman guides and did the Totemic quests because that's what it suggested to do... and I could probably afford to do it. I had ZERO idea on how to make money, and NO capital to begin with. Heck, I hailed the Bouncers and piled up corpses because I didn't know what LORE was or how to destroy the PvP book. True newb material here. But anyway, my point is all the material being discussed was for the high level crowd. &quot;Where's the best place to hunt for JBB?&quot; &quot;Is Fungi worth it?&quot; Heck, anything over 200pp seemed _outrageously_ expensive that I wouldn't be able to afford for a long LONG time. There was simply nothing for me. My thought plan was; 1) Get Totemic, 2) Get to 46, 3) Get Rune Etched (HA!). Any information I DID manage to find was two years old and just about useless anyway. Half the items people twink with didn't even exist and the ones that were being recommended nobody even bothered to camp anymore, so buying them up cheap was out of the question too.<br />
<br />
I managed to make it to 34 before I simply had to ask for help. There just wasn't anything current I could sink my teeth into. Everyone was already 50+ so their requirements (and $$$) were much MUCH larger than mine. So I asked... said I was extremely poor, etc, etc. Got about ten replies of &quot;Get a flayed turmoil skin belt... they're cheap at around 2k&quot; and such. Great. I'd never seen 2k in my life (and even now only seen it once). However, there was one gem (from whom I don't remember the name of. /cry) that was _exactly_ what I was looking for (and I've followed almost religiously). Shortly after that someone decided to make up a FAQ that had some equipment information in it, which also has proven to be invaluable. I don't know what ever became of this FAQ, but I managed to cut the bits out of it I needed. I've also got about ten level 44 to 51 shaman Magelo profiles bookmarked. God I wish there was a way to search Magelo for them...<br />
<br />
-- And now it ends --<br />
<br />
So yeah, that's my story of not finding what I wanted through countless searches. Eventually asking and not getting told what I wanted anyway because you were all too &quot;tired&quot; of dealing with equipment threads and just threw the same junk at me as you did to people with 15K under their mattress. Eventually finding what I needed because someone just &quot;happened&quot; to post it and not in the abyss you called an archive at the time.<br />
<br />
What's more, because I see this a lot too, saying &quot;At 51 I was naked and wielding a cracked staff&quot; doesn't help either. Well, it kinda does because then you don't think you suck QUITE as much as you used to. The demands placed on characters by players are a lot higher now. Like I said above, the reason I asked for help at 34 was because I was _literally_ picked on by an Iksar with more AC, more HP, more wis and more MONEY than I had at the time.<br />
<br />
Personally, you don't want to read an equipment post... don't read it. They're usually pretty easy to spot. You're doing yourself a favor because you won't bump it and then you won't have 7 equipment posts on the front page.<br />
<br />
And if you _REALLY REALLY_ don't want to see them... take that MASSIVE wealth of knowledge from the &quot;golden days&quot; and write something that covers it. Actually MAKE a FAQ with this stuff in it. Host it somewhere. Index it. When you see someone post a question that's been asking 10,000 times before and you're simply sick of looking at... post the link. That's probably the last you'll hear from them. Next time they have a question... they'll check the FAQ and then post on the boards if they need to (hopefully). So yeah... do it once and never do it again. <br />
<br />
And if you don't keep a library of information that people can actually read without hunting through a thousand posts then don't be surprised when people actually ask questions. I'd have done it myself already but I simply don't know enough to even think of beginning.<br />
<br />
I also realise this is really really long and most won't take the time to read it. Those that do may be offended, but meh... I can deal with faction issues just fine.<br />
<br />
Now I'll shut up and wait for everyone to put me in my place.<br />
<br />
Here's my junk for interests sake. Took me 3 levels of soloing HGs to buy it. (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163272)<br />

Because people are broken. Magelo IMO contributes alot to this. Joe Uber gets off on flaunting his l33t gear, and isnt interested in sharing strategy that could benefit other shaman anymore, but rather making sure his gear is l33ter then the next fellows.<br />

We have done this.. I have done this... so many times I don't want to do it anymore. But ya know what? It does not change a thing people will still ask the same exact question that is answered 10 different ways to sunday in the FAQ.<br />
<br />
Thus you still going to have all the same equipment crap up here.<br />
<br />
Do I or a moajority of the older community mind equipment threads? Not entirely, its the ones that have no research in them at all.<br />
<br />
If someone was to ask.. I have been thinking about trying to get this and was wondering what you guys think about it... is much different than the MAJORITY who simply post their gear in every slot and ask.. need upgrade advice kthxs.</div></div><hr />

It is easy to just click on some Magello profiles to see what others are wearing than to come brag (whatever he was doing) about every slot and every upgrade he has gotten and then ask us to evaluate each flippen piece for him.<br />

<br />
Posted a table with all shaman armor for every race. Don't have it anymore since then and now we have gone through several HD formats.<br />
<br />
Where do I look for armor? eqmaps.com and their kick ass search functions. Costs you $3 a month or something.</div></div><hr />

Until then i dont see why the board needs to go unused.</div></div><hr />

If you're looking for info on something specific, start a thread.  You may get flamed a bit, but some of us will try to help.  :)</div></div><hr />

/cry :(<br />
Dammit... I sooooo wanted that FAQ. :( :( :(<br />
I sat there clicking the refresh button hoping I could get a link too.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to like the board wipe less and less. I understand why it was needed and stuff, but it beginning to feel like everything I wanted to know was &quot;back there&quot; and has now been lost to the void.<br />
<br />
Thank you anyway Targar, especially for replying so quickly. MUCHO appreciation. /kiss<br />
<br />
Just a question though, because I know I've done this in the past, why wasn't stuff like the armor table you mentioned hosted on FTP space? It's not overly have to abuse Geocities, Homestead or the like... and having a nice fat wad of answers like that can really help people that are willing to look at it (and if they're not they can go to Erudin and die for all I care). I know I keep a backup of almost all the semi-decent information I've posted before (other games, other boards) on my private webspace that I can reference to and provide if needs be.<br />
<br />
And having only just managed to convince myself paying to play a game is worth it, best money I ever spent by the way, I'm not quite ready to pay for straight information. Not yet anyway. I'll just keep fighting with Magelo and inspecting twinks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">There used to be an equipment forum, but it wasn't used much. In all honesty, the equipment threads I see are clearly marked. If you don't wish to see them, simply don't open them.<br />
<br />
I know that may sound terse, but really, Thantu and I don't have time to sit there and read each thread looking for equipment posts and then move them to another forum. I'll see about adding another equipment forum to see if that lessens the load a bit. <br />
<br />
Right now, I'm finishing up a move in RL, so give me a few days. I've got some new stuff planned for the site soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Most of the best advice ever put on this board is long since gone.  It tends to vanish over time.  Searching through pages isn't going to get you much.<br />
<br />
People are going to post here because that's where stuff gets read.  Period.  I never check the other &quot;mini-forums&quot; here, and I'm probably joined by the vast majority in that.  For the most part, I don't care.  I've been 60 for a while and I already know where to hunt, and I know what the spells are, etc.  When skipping forums about that, however, I also skip the opportunity to reply to anyone asking about those things in that kind of forum.  Which is fine by me.  <br />
<br />
But actually, I might be tempted to help -- and sometimes am -- when I see a thread here in the main forum.  If people need info, their best chance of getting it is in the main forum, so that's where they'll continue to post.  <br />
<br />
As to there being too little new here to read for the old-timers, that is indeed because the game has been around so long.  What else is there to say?  Mostly the good stuff is what people wouldn't want to give away anyway -- how to make a certain camp much simpler, where to send your twinks, how to complete a certain uber quest with mobs someone else might want to camp or fight you or your friends for for if you spilled the beans.  Most of the stuff there is to say either has already been said or people are unwilling to share, so...the boards are actually not as much a place for the old-timers anymore, at least not to the extent they once were.  <br />
<br />
They really are for the guys now asking all the questions others think are dumb or must probably be intelligently answered somewhere, who knows where but don't bother me about it.<br />
<br />
We were all newbies to the class once, though, if not to the whole game even, and the class and the game were damnably full of puzzles that were very hard or extremely time-consuming to figure out, and we've all probably come across many times where some tidbit of knowledge has been immensely helpful.<br />
<br />
So when the old-timers get too blase to help or even are tired merely of seeing the same old thing, they should remember that they don't own the boards, and what's trivial to them might be vital to someone else.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, it's new blood that keeps this or any game going.  I've played a lot of online games, and sooner or later old-timers tend to get sick of newbie questions and sometimes even start to flame and intimidate newbies.  That's cutting off your nose to spite your face, though.  If this game relied only on the crusty old farts to keep it going, it would start to sputter and die a very premature death.  We actually need the newbies more than they need us, if the game is to continue.<br />
<br />
So if their threads seem tedious or duplicative or a waste of time, skip them.  They have at least as good a chance as us to keep the shaman community and the whole game active and alive.  They may even be here long after we're gone.</div></div><hr />
