<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was almost a Troll... was VERY close. I ended up choosing Barbarian because <br />
<br />
1) my gf at the time thought they looked better <br />
2) i hated working on faction (this was way pre kunark)<br />
3) they had the coolest leather and plate graphics of all races<br />
<br />
I I knew then what I know now (halfling druid comparision) you bet I would be a fatee now.  Maybee even an ogre. If I had to choose now I would be torn between Vah Shir (leveling speed) and ikky (i like the luclin male models)</div></div><hr />

Oh and I really wanted a Barbarian Spiritist Hammer.  When I started there were no spears, and this was my weapon to beat all weapons.<br />

I love my char and all, but if for some reason I was forced to start over, I would choose Iksar.</div></div><hr />

That, and the male barbarians, just looked way too butch and not so much ugly, but, not good looking.  So I chose a female 8)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In beta I played only a human paladin. I thought it was ok, and at release I started a paladin as well. After 2 weeks I wanted to just try something different, and I had remembered from beta that I had grouped with a shaman once and he had 3 things that I wanted to have in a caster. Sow, healing, and offensive spells. That is the ONLY thing I knew about shaman when i started mine. They had offensive spells, sow, and healing. Well, I chose troll because I just like the idea of trolls as a playable race (and we don't have minotaur as a choice =/). I split points between dex, agi, some into wis, and a few into str. My base wis is 86 yay. Anyhow, if I were going to do it all over again, I think I would go with a troll again because I just like them. Second choice would be Ogre though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well about 50% of this board is 50+ barbarian shaman</div></div><hr />

A Northman Shaman just sounded fun...and it is!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Troll all the way.... go go regen.<br />
<br />
Course, Ikkies have regen, too... but they have more faction problems than even trolls do...<br />
<br />
Yeah Trolls start with low wis - but that doesn't matter so much once you get to around 200.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing I DON'T like about trolls is the exp penalty... didn't realize how severe 20% penalty really was... and too late to do anything about it now.  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Troll<br />
<br />
No other choice.  I remember seeing a Troll shaman that was really high level (about 30) when I was playing my n00bie first char - human shadowknight.  He just looked so damn cool - and he scratched hit butt and stuff when standing around - and that casting animation when he ran at the end of the spell - had to be a troll.  Love it and wouldnt change for the worl either (although I still wish I had gone inoruuk - damn snare necklace)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">my character development - DE necro 'cause I read they were the strongest - never made my way out of Neriak using the maps in the manual.  Remembered barbarians from Diablo - made a warrior, go him till 5. Got a drive-by sow - gotta have that permanent. Made a barbarian shaman (didn't want to have to learn another newbie zone) and been happy ever since. And charming too, so the 90 base wisdom hurt a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Started playing EQ to be part of a barbarian warrior family.  Was an interesting upbringing. ;)  Calizana is forever 51 now as I quickly became disillusioned about warrior life.  Calbrazan is the daughter of Calizana and (can you guess?) Litchebane!<br />
<br />
Barbarians just looked way better way back when.  Should I start another shaman? Dunno what I would pick. I like to look good more then be the perfect race/class combo.  I feel its more in how well you play and know your class vs. your race.<br />
<br />
(Hhhmm, sucks to be in that 1-50 range. *pouts*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">my friends picked erudites so i wanted to start close to them :)<br />
and i actually thought the extra wis was gonna matter more, little did i know about regen :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I started Shalara at release.  I was going to be playing with 5 RL friends/family, and since *everyone* was level 1, there was no sow, no ports, and not all of us had any beta experience.  We decided to all start humans, barbarians, or half-eves to begin in the Qeynos area to make things easier for us to get together ASAP.<br />
<br />
Kunark/Luclin didn't exist.  I knew nothing about xp bonus/penalty, or regeneration.  The JBB didn't exist.  There was no Fungi Tunic, just the Rubi BP rumored to exist in a place no one was high enough to tackle yet.  Heck, I didn't even really know much about the class.  I'd originally planned a ranger, but we ended up with a monk, rogue, warrior and bard, so I thought another melee wouldn't be so good, and hey, shaman had all these UBER stat buffs which would make our melee even better! ;)<br />
<br />
I still wouldn't pick Iksar if I could switch race instantly with no re-leveling up.  They are just too too ugly for me.  Pre-60 I had wished I'da known enough to start a troll.  Having been 60 so long though, I think the only race I would prefer to barbarian is Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I chose barbarian because I liked their overall &quot;look.&quot;  When I think of a shaman, I think of a humanoid race.  Trolls and Ogres (only other choices when I started) were misshaped, ugly, and the evil persona did not fit my image of what a shaman should be.<br />
<br />
Later I learned of all the different bonuses, negatives, etc. of each race; but if I had to do it all over again, I'd still choose barb without question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Barb Shaman.  My wife wanted to be a Barb Warrior and they (Shaman) were the only Barbarians that could cast :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zulan Spiritshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yeah, I started my Troll Shaman during the first few months of Kunark.  Before then I was actually a Dark Elf Cleric.   Picked him because I wanted to rp a Priest along-side my Troll SK and War buddies.  I actually faught w/ them in the Swamp during the Clerics first 10 lvls before moving over to South Ro.  Never even touched anything in Nek's newbie zone.  <br />
<br />
I started the Troll Shaman as my DE Cleric neared his 30th lvl.  I remembered seeing a young Troll Shaman running around the swamp during my early days there and wanted to bitch-slap myself for picking a punk arse Cleric.  Never really got around to playing the Shaman much until well after I'd already deleted my 45 Cleric and retired my 55 Monk.  Should have been all over the Shaman from the getgo.  <br />
<br />
Back then the Trolls were massive green and ugly sob's (mine w/ a purple glass eye ;p).  I used to love bashing those little kobolds w/ his tree-trunk arm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I wanted good faction, SoW, the ability to tank, and I already knew the Qeynos/Blackburrow area from my first character. Barb Females made the funnest fighting sounds so I rolled one up. I didn't know about regen and Kunark didn't exist yet, even with what I know now I'd probably stick with Barbarian because we are just damn sexy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I made an Ogre primarily because I had never played that race before. The stats, the look, no stun from front, night vision, access to JBB/ OT gate hammer/plate armor were also a plus. If I had already played an Ogre, probably would of went back to Iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I made a barb cus we could wear medium and large armor too ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The reason there are so many barbarians is because so many of us started long before Kunark. And barbarians do look cool. ;) <br />
<br />
Rathelon was originally a barbarian warrior, but when I learned that shamans got spirit of wolf at 9th level (I was 8th warrior at the  time), I re-created Rathelon as a shaman. Knew next to nothing about the shaman class, didnt even know they got pets until a good while later, but I knew what spirit of wolf was. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I didn't really care about any gameplay considerations when I made my troll shaman. I saw it said &quot;High difficulty&quot; on the character screen, but I like a challenge :)<br />

<br />
I chose the barbarian route mainly because I had previously made a barbarian warrior, knew Everfrost like the back of my hand, and knew that, on a cash/xp basis, there really isn't a better newbie zone in the game.  Non-twinked, was in full banded, with 1k in the bank, by level 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Barb shaman cause I started playing in Beta 2 and very few zones were up... by the time I got to beta 4 I knew Everfrost very well and it was sooo cool to take down those red con Mammoths in a group of us in our teens &lt;g&gt;<br />
   Also I chose barb because we were all unsure about faction issues and there were no spoiler sites back then to tell you what to expect... all you knew was that it was going to be much harder for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I picked a barbarian becasue I didn't know any better and I thought that with the eye patch I looked like a pirate!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Picked barby cause my first char was a troll war and when I hit the hell lvls with him and kept dieing and loosing all that exp I got real pissed and deleted him.<br />
<br />
Barb cause of faction,  starting area,  faction,  they were at the time the smallest shaman race besides Iskars,  and they get to wear kilts.<br />
<br />
Main reason was I was tired of scratching my ass all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Picked a barb shaman because I had no clue about racial abilities whatsoever.   I put starting points into a lot of stupid crap, str so I could kick extra ass!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Snap is pretty much the only character I've played.  Just having too much fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I thought very long about what to make...<br />
<br />
Troll was never an option cuase they look so damn ugly.<br />
<br />
First i thought of Ogre...but the 15% less Exp and only unstunnability, not going into gfay (that was my most important zone at that time), Being BAD and STUPID wasnt an option for me in the end. Then i dont really like the Armor looks of Ogres. Yeah they look really cool with new models as long as naked...<br />
<br />
I dont like cats...<br />
<br />
I dont like Lizzards<br />
<br />
I like Humans(just hast to look like one), who are strong and wise and Good...And Barbs look great in Plate and okay in Chain...<br />
<br />
Yeah i think i spent 1 week thinking that through and to decide. I made my har around 2 months ago and im 51 now :) So i had a lot of help from Spoiler Sites and to look all through.<br />
<br />
I think its kinda sad that so many barb shammys are out there but its the most attractive Race imho (at least for a lot of people)...and that thing didnt overlay the other things i found out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">It's easier to be a Barb. Faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">One thing I note is the &lt;50 stats. <br />
No one's starting Ogres, Few are starting trols. <br />
Kittys? Flavor of the moment. <br />
Iksar? Look cool to some, AC+Regen. Same faction as trols on 3 continents and the moon, better in Kunark, worse in Anatonica. <br />
Barbarian- easiest and to many best looking.<br />
<br />
My guild? 4 Barb Shamans (3x60, 1x56), 2 Ogre Shamans and Me...<br />
<br />
me, I have an Inny Trol. <br />
<br />
I did check the spoiler sites, such as they were, before I made my Shaman.  Back then stats were thought to do something, and the biggest jewlery buff was like +5, so our stat buffs looked huge. We also had some &quot;Frenzy&quot; line which I thought might be some thing to buff up and speed up warrior companions.. silly me, that's the Chanter's schtick.  <br />
<br />
As for EXP penalty.. no one knew the #s yet. Unstunnable from front.. not well known. <br />
<br />
Armors? Well there was basically nothing a Barb could wear that a troll couldn't except  medium banded. <br />
<br />
Trolls were supposed to be the hardest, and I loved the 'regenerating wall of green flesh' bit in the manuel, and hey I thought they were cool. <br />
So I have an Innunoruuk Troll, with the starting points in terrible places. <br />
<br />
If I had to restart? Troll or Ogre. I don't like Iksar. Sorry folks, just don't like the lizzies without at least Tatar sauce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I shall answer for me, and my friend who does not frequent this board, but plays a 52 barb shaman.<br />
<br />
Me: I chose Ogre because Ogre and Gnome are the two best races ever! :)<br />
<br />
Ok for me, me and my cousin and friend decided to make a group to fight with each other all the time. My friend wanted to be a cleric, and my cousin a war. I have played many classes and already had a rogue and shadowknight and all. So they asked if I would consider a druid or a shaman. So that we could get around easier. Well druids suck (at least they do from 1-16, heh thats how high mine got before deletion) so I said I would play a shaman if I got to choose our faction (Evil - nonevil) They wanted non-evil so we could travel easier, I wanted evil so I could kill more stuff :)  So I chose Ogre without a 2nd thought towards Troll. Trolls are ok, but nothin' says lovin' like a 9foot tall ogre sicking his pet wolf on you! Not to mention I had an Ogre Shadowknight, and just loved the town and the race!!<br />
<br />
My friend the barb shaman:<br />
Well I introduced him into EQ. I was playing and he came over and started watching and said it looked like a boring game. Then I decided to let him play, but not one of my characters, I wanted him to start his own, so he could control what it was he wanted.(heh my characters were only like level 4 at the time, so it wasn't a big deal really) I got the character select screen, and he started to move into the range in which he thought I would get up and let him create a character.. did I? NO! I hit quit, then closed out of EQ, and forced him to start it up and watch the begining intro!! While watching it, he saw the barbarians  fighting, and saw the old bald man cheering. he then said! I want to be some guy like him!! (me figuring old bald man = wise shaman type guy) said yeah we can prolly get you something close to him. Let him log in, and create, told him that Barbarian was the race of the old man, then explained the classes they could be to him with my limited knowledge. I can't remember why, but he said he wanted to go ahead and be the shaman, even though they sucked. (Haha I heard shamen sucked cause clerics heal better so thats what I told him, keep in mind I had played EQ for a total of about 3 days then IM SORRY!! )<br />
<br />
Well there you go.<br />

Also, some friends were starting EQ at the same time and they also wanted to play barbarians. Knowing what I know now, if I were to go back, I'd play a troll. Most of the racial abilities are not really that valuable, in my opinion, but regen is awesome. While iksars have regen also, I like being big, so I would choose, hands down, to be a troll. Unstunnability would be nice, but not quite as useful for most situations as regen. Anyway, if I ever decide to start another shaman, he'll be a troll. I like my barbarian though and have invested a lot of time and energy into him, so I doubt I'll start that troll anytime soon. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I am in the game over 3 years now.. When I started the char, there simply weren't any furball shamans around, or any scaled spellweavers either. There were just barbarians, trolls and ogres. I went with barbarian, because I never played or will play an &quot;evil&quot; char. But no, I am not a &quot;good&quot; char either. I do have my &quot;benevolent&quot; moments, but other then that, 'em darn people tick me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">When I rolled up my shamie there were no kitties or handbag shaman as options.  I chose Barbarian because I was a big Conan fan and I liked the faction.  If I were to start over I'd likely be a stinking furball just to be different (also I hate being blind in the dark).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Lacka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I chose Barbarian because I play on a PvP server. I wanted to be a shaman, but didn't want to be on the dark team.  At the time, that only left Barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Started playing right around Kunark Release at a friends suggestion.  First char was a HIE wizard and it just didn't suit me.  Next char was an Ogre Shaman that I liked a lot.  But as fate would have it, my friend had just started an Iksar Necro, so I restarted my shaman as an Iksar so we could play together.  No clue about xp penalties, effectiveness of regen with canni, ac bonuses, etc... Just wanted to hang out with a friend, which I suspect helped guide a lot of people's first choices. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Made my barbie back when faction was really tough, had a lvl 20 or so human warrior at the time and would play the shaman when I couldn't get a group.<br />
<br />
I re-rolled my shaman when he was lvl 8 because the fizzles just drove me nuts of not haveing enough wisdom.  I miss the name Mugwump, but Jenguran is kinda nice too. And now my main btw =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Khaline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">KITTY!<br />
  I watched the game played for some time before i actually bought it and started playing myself...and i waited until luclin came out to do so...i loved the Kitty look and i knew everyone else would be making a BST...so i made a shamaness...i am currently a Epiced 51 Mystic on my server...and prolly the only one there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I love my barb shaman but after looking at the numbers posted I feel like a halfling druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Heh,<br />
<br />
I chose Iksar because they USED to look damn awesome casting. . .Hell yeah, with a big spear in hand the heal animation was a groovy lookin circle. . .All gone now   :mad: <br />
<br />
Also chose Iksar so I wouldn't HAVE to scrabble around for the funds/friends needed to get a JBB. . .Yep, took it right outta the equation.<br />
<br />
See, before I started I talked to, oh, 40 or so shaman. . .A LARGE percentage of em didn't even have a JBB, even 50+ people.<br />
<br />
But my spell animation and neato 'Man from Atlantis' swim anim are gone. . .gone. . . <br />
<br />
Oh well  <br />
<br />
