<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I've been doing some guards recently, so I pulled out the disease dots because of their high hp's. I have the CMW with BA3, and I have never noticed this happening before, as I can't tell you the last time I used a disease dot lol. Anyway, I was noticing that on Plague once in a while, and just about every 3rd tick of Scourge, I wouldn't get the message &quot;Your CMW comes alive blah blah&quot;, and I didn't get any extra damage. With ebolt, which I have have used quite a lot since getting it at 49, I ALWAYS got the message, I can't remember ever NOT getting it. First of all, I thought that you should always get the message, regardless if the RNG gives you no extra damage (I also always thought you would get something every tick, even if only 1 point of damage). So, if you shouldn't get the message every time, next question is why does it work a lot less on disease dots as opposed to poision? Also, since it was occuring much more frequently on Scourge (Level 34) then on Plague (Level 49), is there some kind of adjustment built into BA items, so that they primarily work only on the spell range of the particular effect? In other words, since Scourge would be affected by a BA2 item, does that mean when you have a BA3 item, that it doesn't &quot;work&quot; as well, because it is really only &quot;designed&quot; for level 49-60 spells? I never thought so, I know it sounds crazy, but what I'm seeing leads me to think that. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It should always work with BA3. Poison or disease.<br />
You're either bugged or somehow not seeing it. Mine works fine, both disease and poison.<br />
Yes you should always see the message, as well as some (no matter how minimal) damage increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always saw the message on each and every tick, with a bonus or not. <br />
Was even bored today, and using a mage summon BA4 bracer, and put on the Coldain Military Wristguard for BA3. I got the Rallican's Steel Bracer comes alive for Breath of Ultor, and then below that the Coldain Military Wristguard comes alive message for Pox/BoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Konnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have seen this too on low level alts. It seems the damage is rounded to a whole number and it can be rounded so the extra damage is zero, in which case you don't get any activation message.<br />
<br />
Disease dots to do less damage per tick than poison ones of the same level, so there would be more chance of the whole number being 0. Similarly Scourge is lower level than Plague so it does less base damage and hence has more chance of the addition rounding to zero etc.<br />
<br />
As a quick test I tried casting sicken and tainted breath. I didn't get any extra damage at all from sicken and didn't get any message either. For TB I only got a message on the 9dmg ticks, but not on the 8dmg ones. (When you consider these spells you see why there is no minimum of 1 extra damage, although it wouldn't really break the whole game).<br />
<br />
From your observations it sounds like the extra damage might be being rounded down, which would suggest scourge (base damage 24) should miss about 1 tick in 5. If the extra were being rounded to the nearest whole number it should miss about 1 tick in 10. The way to check would be to see if it ever did 29, since 24 boosted by 20% gives 28.8.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really seem like a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK thanks for the replies. Konnor, you're right, it's not a big deal at all....just wondering if I was bugged, or if there was a problem with the effect itself, so it didn't affect other dots, the ones that I use frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BTW if you are soloing I think you're missing a bet by not using disease dots.  They are more mana efficient than poison dots (almost 1/3 more efficient) and they keep working even if you get busy and don't have time to refresh those poison dots.<br />
<br />
As long as a disease dot is going to finish, I use it.  I stack Pox, Plague, and Breath on a mob right at the outset.  Sometimes I don't even bother with Bane if the disease dots + epic are going to do it.</div></div><hr />

Although it's a different focus effect, I have the Ring of Shissar and Shawl 8.  Both are Extended Enhancement - ring is 3, shawl is essentially 4.  I've noticed that for spells 60 and lower, the ring glows.  For spells 61 and higher, the shawl glows.  I think the engine looks for the itemsthat will effect the spells... and goes with the lowest one.  Effect is the same, so it doesn't matter - but it's confusing at times.</div></div><hr />
