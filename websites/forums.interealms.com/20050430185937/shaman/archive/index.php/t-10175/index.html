man, next time I should hand to chanter's NPC; half of their spell easily for 30-60k and use this cash to buy shaman spell</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm already doing that Shaman, but for druid spells.<br />
50% chance of an unsellable, worthless spell from the otter.  Even the worst druid spell tho can be sold for 5k.  And the best sell for 30k easily . . and quickly . . and there are at least half of them that fit that description.<br />
I'll let someone else make the gamble with the shaman spells.  Meanwhile I'll be watching the bazaar for spells I need and saving up my pp.  So far the only &quot;winner&quot; shaman spectral spell I've scored from turn-ins has been Blessing of Replenishment.  The rest have been unmitigated CRAP so I swore them off and am playing the market for spells instead of praying to the otter.<br />
Gonna be a different thing with runes tho, assuming I ever get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heya,<br />
<br />
I have turned in 2 spectrals so far and gotten...Aye...Single and group DEX buff.<br />
<br />
Sametime I have been handing EPs (around 20-25) for other class NPCs and almost everytime I have received very usable/wanted spell. So, I have started thinking that maybe next time when I get spectral a let some non-shaman turn it in and see what comes out as result...Heh.<br />
<br />
Well prolly this is just my paranoia, but is there pattern her? Could there be &quot;some sort of class check&quot; . We all know that VI's random number generator is...ummm...not very random at least.<br />
<br />
5 Ancestral Guards and 3 Greater Immobilizes still rotting in bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hoeju</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think a lot of shamans are handing spectrals into other vendors because I see far fewer shm spells for sale than other classes.

<br />
I'm pretty happy, though not of the level I spent less for my 64 dot then I would ever for pox /sigh :(<br />
<br />
How are the Spectral spells price wise on your servers?  I see Velium Strike 60+k ugh.. and malosinia for like 35k..<br />
<br />
Won't have to worry about spectrals nearly as much since I was able to pick up the spells I really really wanted lol.</div></div><hr />

I have all of my useless str/dex buffs other than single target dex (heh - and that is the one I would occasionally cast too). I have Blessing of Replinishment, Talisman of the Boar, and last night I turned in my first Rune for Focus of the 7th. <br />
<br />
I have zero PoP dot, nuke, or rain spell upgrades. I have basically none of the new Spectral/Rune debuffs.<br />
<br />
The fact that I am the only Shaman I know with Primal Essence and Group Acumen just makes matters worse.<br />
<br />
I am 100% buff-o-matic :( . The other Shaman in my guild gets to buff umm ...... group agility ..... that's it.<br />
<br />
I guess I should just accept it as my lot and start working on Mass Group Buff and Spell Casting Reinforcement.</div></div><hr />

I have heard that if you turn in multible spells at once (i.e. 4 at a time), that you will not get duplicate spells in that turn in.  Has anyone tried this yet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is working on proving that theory now. So far turning parchments in consecutive order has yet to produce a duplicate for that set of turn ins (provided you dont turn in enough to get thru the entire cycle of spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild leader who is also a shaman turned 4 etherel parchments in at the same time and she got 2 copies of one of our 61/62 spells so the answer is no there is no guarantee that you will not get dupes.  I've gotten to the point that if i win a roll on a parchment I won't even loot it.  The warrior i group with 90% of the time loots it and turns it in for me.  Out of the first 4 parchments i turned in I got 3 copies of greater immobalize.  Just been buying my 61 and 62 spells in bazaar and im only missing tnargs and single target stamina at the moment.  Not going to worry about them until i hit 62.  Only seen one spell for sale in bazaar on Fennin Ro that was above level 62 and that is blood of saryn or whatever its called...started out at 110k and last nite was down to 80k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sshiverr, i agree. Early on when pop was released, i got dupes too, but recently im wondering if it hasnt been changed. We have had mutiple people turn in 8+ parchments and not gotten any duplicates. Thats almost too conicidental if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Im curious about the timing of when you guys turned in your parchments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the otter sucks. i stoped taking ethreals, unless everyone had when i had gotten 7 tnargs mending.  i was lucky enough to buy/trade for 90% of the usefull 61,62 spell. <br />
<br />
then i started on the spectrals.  first turn in i got group stamina, not bad.  second i got velium strike, coulda been better but at least usefull.  Followed by that i got BoR and single str.  BoR is nice.  single str is stil inthe bank.  THe last spectrals have yeilded me grp str, grp sta, velium strike.<br />
<br />
With runes its been kinda annoying.  we have 4 copies of malos in my guild, and only 3 shamans.  we REALLY want focus of 7th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've yet to get any spectral but my ethereal parchments have been like this.<br />
<br />
1) Cloud of Grummus<br />
2) Ancestral Guard<br />
3) Focus of Soul<br />
4) Greater Immobilize<br />
5) Tnarg's Mending<br />
6) Focus of Soul<br />
<br />
I bought True Spirit about 2 weeks after PoP came out.  I'm still missing a couple 61-62 spells but nothing I'm really worried about except stamina would be a nice upgrade.  I check the bazaar frequently on the Seventh and I see very few shaman spells 61-65 in comparison to other classes.  I've seen Imbue War a few times as well as aim of gindan quite a bit lately and each are usually 10-20k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I turned in 4 ethreals to the beastlord trainer looking for infusion of spirit. All at once.<br />
<br />
1) Scorpion venom<br />
2) Scorpion venom<br />
3) Scorpion venom<br />
4) Scorpion venom<br />
<br />
/auc WTS : Scorpion Venom, 62 BST spell, for 500pp..... <br />
<br />
Finally bought IoS in the bazaar for 2k, after turning in 12 - yes 12 parchments to the bst trainer.<br />
<br />
I had to turn in 6 ethreals to the necro trainer to get Petrifying Earth. Had three - yes three copies of Rune of Death. Sold for 500pp each.<br />
<br />
So far I've been buying my spectral spells. I'm not in BoT or HoH so I don't see spectrals drop.<br />
<br />
1) Blessing of Replenishment - 15k. Worth it with the amount of pleveling I do with various low level alts.<br />
2) Talisman of the Boar - 12k plus my shield of bane warding. I MGB this now and the other shaman in my guild mgb's focus, it saves time.<br />
3) Velium Strike - 5k. Got lucky on this one.<br />
<br />
Pet Earth I got through the necro vendor.<br />
<br />
Still looking for Malosinia, Malicious decay, Breath of Ultor, or Tears of Saryn. Havent' seen then for sale yet - someone asked me to buy Tears from them awhile back, but he wanted 20k and I was flat broke from buying Talisman of the Boar so I had to say no.</div></div><hr />

Might be on to something.  Have people that have been getting dupes of spells that they don't need actually have that spell scribed in their spell books?   I know that a bunch of people refuse to scribe crap spells in their spell books, but could not having the spell scribed be the cause of getting so many dupes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well BoS isn't that bad...but still from guilds perspective it is the least useful shm spell - was hoping Quiessence, 7th,  or Ferine Avatar.<br />

<br />
Also, I managed to get Infusion of Spirit a week or so ago - but so far it seems completely useless. It does not stack with Focus or Soul, so it is useless for melees since it gives less hit points than Focus. So, I figured it would be useful to cast on Clerics. Well, it turns out to not stack with Yualp 5 - so useless for clerics too.<br />

<br />
But maybe its just my server Quellious that has spells prices like that - also just seen VotB for 20000 (a damn self only buff that doesnt do a whole lot!), Avatar for 30000 and to top it all of Spirit Quickening for 3500 :-)</div></div><hr />

I'm ticked off just thinking about these frigging horrid Spectral turn ins. I swear I'm going to find a way to kill that damned otter.<br />
<br />
Out of roughly 20 Spectrals thus far I would estimate literally 18 of them to be one of the following:<br />
<br />
-Talisman of the Gindan<br />
-Talisman of the Diaku<br />
-Strength of the Diaku<br />
<br />
The other two were Malosinia and Tears of Saryn.<br />
<br />
I did however fluke out on the two Runes I've won so far... Blood of Saryn (common) and Focus of the Seventh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">lol<br />
<br />
You guys are cracking me up.....nice stories... I liked yours Moyes.  Don't know how many caught what you said, but it made me laugh.<br />
<br />
Anyways, here is my order of spells that I have received so far.<br />
<br />
1. Cloud of Grummus<br />
2. Talisman of Tribunal<br />
3. Spear of Torment<br />
4. Agi of wrulan<br />
<br />
So, I started getting a little bit upset, cause I could see my luck going downhill.  Won a metallic liquid from PoV and traded a guy for two parchments, as well as turning in my fifth one.  After he saw what he got for me, he turned in a third one and gave it to me too.<br />
<br />
5. Talisman of Wrulan<br />
6. Greater Immobolize<br />
7. Greater Immobolize<br />
8. Focus of Soul<br />
<br />
At this point I said **** it, and went out and paid for Ancestral Guard, Endurance of the Boar, and Tnarg's Mending.  Paid about 2k for all total.  Took me another week before someone finally was selling True Spirit, but I got it for 8k.  So, the next few days , I turn in a few more parchments and got<br />
<br />
9. Ancestral Guard<br />
10. True Spirit<br />

I hate my luck....I got the last parchment when I was the first one to roll, and rolled a 1 out of 100.  Everyone laughed and ended up giving it to me for my awesome roll....but I did get 3 blues in about 30 min with this group at lvl 61 full exp so I was not complaining..hehe</div></div><hr />

I guess I must have gotten stupidly lucky or something, although I still haven't gotten true spirit after oh so many spell turnins.<br />
<br />
Have to thank atarak for my first non store bought spect spell though, ulthor rocks :)</div></div><hr />

Why does this spell exist?  Why does the group version, which I'm sure that I'll see next, exist?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To give you a char discription, semi-okay gear, permabroke,  not much play time, in a big guild, level 56 so am far from 60 but when i actually get uninterrupted time to play i get spurts of high fast exp in little time.<br />
<br />
What are the best options for me to do with this parchment?<br />
for parchments to come?</div></div><hr />
