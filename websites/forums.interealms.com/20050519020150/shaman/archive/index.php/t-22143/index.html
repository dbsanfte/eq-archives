<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Main toons are 65 monk + 65 shaman, who I duo.  They are tuff.<br />
<br />
I also got a 56 wizard on the shaman's account.  He's received nice toys from his older shaman and monk brothers in their travels.  I love to play the wizard as much as I do the monk and shaman.<br />
<br />
Prob is --- I can't get groups with him at all.  I sit LFG for hours sometimes.  It's not like the monk/shaman duo, who I can always find something to do with... the wizard is pretty much solo and relies on pick-up groups since most of the guild is 65.<br />
<br />
Monk + wizard combo doesn't work too well, obviously, as they lack serious utility and namely... healing.  Since the wizard fights in areas that usually produces a lot of resists, I've always dreamed of playing the shaman alongside the wiz so that I can Malos mobs and help the wiz land spells.<br />
<br />
But the wiz is on the same account as the shaman.  So I've asked to have the wizard transferred to the other account and I'm waiting on that to happen.<br />
<br />
My question is, what do you guys think of a shaman/wizard combo?  My shaman can easily tank in Tier-2 and even Tier-3, as he has a full spell book and LR5, etc...<br />
<br />
I figure I'd pull mobs single with the shaman, do the debuffing thing and get Q on me... and once things were under control, go nuts with the wizard nukes.  Snare at the end to prevent runners.<br />
<br />
The more I think about this, I don't think it's a bad combo...  the wizard will eventually be able to bring down some helacious nukage.  As long as my shaman can tank and keep agro, the wiz can sit back there and drop bombs all day long.<br />
<br />
The wizard already has an almost complete spellbook thru 65, even though he's only 56.  This includes Agnarr's Thunder and Strike of Solusek.  He's just waiting to ding so he can scribe them.  A few AAs to get his crits up and that would be a fairly damaging duo.<br />
<br />
Anyone ever done this?  I don't hear of a shaman/wizard combo often.<br />
<br />
EDIT: fixed the first sentence -- of course I don't duo a 65 monk and 56 monk; that would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why single pull with Shaman?  Why not quad kite with Wizard and have Shaman DOT and apply Dogdog?<br />
<br />
Or am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, 'cause quad-kiting isn't viable everywhere.. only in a few spots where mobs don't summon and you have wide-open spaces.  It's not easy to control another character while quadding either.  At least for me.  The quadder has to always move.<br />
<br />
And quadding doesn't really require a 2nd toon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, with full defensive AA and a certain cleric buff, you should be able to tank and keep yourself healed while the wizard nukes the mobs down...<br />
<br />
The question is however, if its efficient enough to ever leave the experimental stadium. If you conserve mana with the WIZ you have next to no DPS (except dots, wich is a bad thing to lay mana on if you want to have mana for heals) , and if thats the case youre going to run out of mana for heals...<br />
<br />
So to make it work you need to heal yourself while the wizard makes a full burn. That has to mean downtime...<br />
<br />
It all stands and falls with the balance of your defense and you healing being able to keep up...<br />
<br />
Buf you can accept downtime its a pretty safe combo since you can evac with the wizzy if things go haywire...<br />
<br />
Have a go and see what you make of it. Sometimes the least likely combo will be the best... (like with a certain halfling with some kind of magic 'one ring' he regretted looting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like a decent combo to me, the thing mst shaman want more of besides healing is dps. WHat do wizards lack besides dps is utility. Ya got two classes who's biggest weakness is the others strength, they should complement each other perfectly. Wizard adds snare and evac, can help root park etc, sounds like a winning combination to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What a Wizard lacks is duration DPS.  I've played a Wizard to 60 - yea he's not 65 but I stoped playing him durring Luclin and before PoP 100+ days was enough at the time.  <br />
<br />
Wizards do have massive DPS potential -  Malx will help maximize that potential BUT were talking short term fights.  In my late 20's till the mid-30's I duoed my Wizard and my Monk.  It worked pretty well as the down time for the Monk to bandage+sit regen ballence d nicely with the mana regen (I use the term loosely) of the Wizard.   There are 2 limitations to wizard DPS - available mana and aggro.  This is different from a shaman where our limitation is potential mana and hp.  As has often been stated here the size of the mana pool doesn't matter as long as you have the HP's to convert to mana, for shaman this works.  For wizards the mana pool is all important.   So as long as the shaman can keep aggro (poison dot's+concusion should do it) AND the wizard has mana left it will probably work.  OTOH I guarantee you the shaman will be ready to go back to the grind in half the time of the wizard.<br />
<br />
My wizard is on my shamans account too.  If I had a choice (money+computers) I would have a 3rd account and box my wiz+sham+monk - now that would be an awsome combo.<br />
<br />
Farrdaar - 60 Wiz<br />
Sunnee - 65 Shaman<br />
Haunk - 65 Monk<br />
<br />
P.S. yes I still relate to myself as my wizard even tho I play him the least :)   Man how I hated running around in circles for XP.  People always want Wizards for raids do to their DPS but they don't like em for groups due to thier down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, like I've said, I've decked out my wizard fairly nicely.  I'm trying to make him into an efficient, long-term damage wizard...  he's got mana preservation 4, ID 4, spell haste 4, a larger than average mana pool, and the beginnings of FT and mana regen.  Wizard familiars provide nice mana regen.<br />
<br />
He's only 56 at the time, but I've already got an AA plan mapped out for him --- I want SCM for mana savings, SCF all ranks to make him crit (thus getting more bang for the mana expenditure), and SCS to reduce agro on nukes.  Of course he'll get Harvest of Druzzil to increase mana regen, and his improved familiars.... <br />
<br />
Already at level 56 it takes me having a hot trigger-finger to make him lose his mana...  I nuke like crazy using my most efficient nukes and he never seems to run out, especially if i'm out-doors on a horse.  I don't think mana regen will be an issue come level 65 and a few AAs.  SCF, SCS, and SCM is about 50 AAs, which doesn't take me long to get.<br />
<br />
I'm a draught guy and rain guy, and I also have the level 52 quested nuke that has insane damage/mana efficiency, Frozen Harpoon.  So I can extended a mana pool nicely, while providing nice DPS.  Of course my wizard is no where near teh DPS of my monk yet, who hovers around 100 DPS and can hit 130 DPS with the right buffs, and even approach 200 DPS during offensive disciplines, but I'd like to see the wizard top that someday.<br />
<br />
My favorite 3 classes in EQ are the shaman, monk, and wizard, simply because of concept.  I love the shaman concept of a spiritual magikman who gains advantage by enhancing the performance of those around him while hindering the performance of the foe, while not glamorizing himself with eye-candy.  I love the idea of the monk, combat specialist adept at hand-to-hand battle and infiltration.  I love the concept of the wizard --- master of arcane knowledge and magical destruction and transportation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've duoed with a wizard bot at the tables in pofire quite often. Now, I am not sure if you have access to that spot, but your question was in regards to viability and not location.<br />
<br />
I'd main play the shaman and malos/slow the mob and keep it rooted. Snare the mob with the wizard, lay on the dots and nuke to your hearts content. Cast root again while the wizard is casting the nuke to time it to re-root when the dd hits. Most often it will break root, but bust out a low level root and mana is a non issue.<br />
<br />
I found this to be extremely fast, efficient and very safe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My girlfriend played (we retired) a wizard and we were an amazing duo.  Granted we spent three years perfecting it and sat next to each other which obviously is a huge help.  Eventually our old roommate quit and gave us his chanter who she worked on pretty much as a second main and learned to two box extremely well.  <br />
<br />
As far as long term dps goes its extremely dependant on the gear and aa.  With high worn FT, allegiant familar, harvest, harvest of druzil, and just generally knowing how to play a wizard well she rarely ran low on mana and consistently put out some sick long term dps.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly what you are looking to do with the combo but I almost always tanked and held agro with poison dots.  There is very little I could think of where a shaman can't tank and heal himself with Q in situations where you'd be duoing.  She two boxed the wizard and chanter in Sol Ro quite a bit and I tanked/healed just fine.  <br />
<br />
Another nice thing about wizards is they are extremely easy to two box.  I two boxxed my shaman and her wizard on quite a few late night ldons and really it isn't much more work at all.  Wizards have little else to do but nuke and they do it very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sounds like an under-rated duo then.  Thanks for your input guys, lookin' forward to getting that wizard up to snuff.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea, snare can be extremly handy. I've only duo'd with a few people who can snare, but I would blind kite them as long as I had agro(really how hard is for us to keep agro). THey would run the blind path then head straigh back for me. Dog dog chewing on it's tail, and the wizzy throwing in some nukes, it worked out quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What's most cool to me about wizards is how calculable their damage is. Horses make meditation constant, instead of just between spells, and with Malo-x in, the only unknowns (real 'sit' time &amp; resists) almost completely goes away! <br />
<br />
This as opposed to melee damage, which is incredibly variable. The math behind it is very concealed in EQ. It fluxes based on player atk (which is actually an approximation of accuracy+power, summed out-of-sight of the player), mob ac (also an invisible sum of avoidance+mitigation), mob defensive skills, what buffs you're wearing, the player's ability to stay in melee contact, phases of the moon, whim of the gods, etc.  Besides all that crap, melee dps over time takes a HUGE dive if there's any downtime at all, whereas casters can be seen as extending their &quot;active time&quot; by medding before/after a fight, and just concentrating their damage while burning mana.  Not to knock melee damage in general , btw.  All this crap just makes it hard to calculate.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, back on wizards? all you have to do is add up their mana regen, and multiply out by how much damage/mana they get for their spells.  In practice you'll probably beat that number, even, since from the start time to finish time, you get to go from fm to 00m, if you want to, and not just use the mana regened during the exercise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have a 53 wizard.  I rolled him at the same time as Thorzion because I was looking for a different option to a ranger, which was my main back in 2000.  The shaman won out in the end, but I always spent a little time on the wizard, getting a pick up here and a level there.<br />
<br />
Recently, I started playing the wizard a lot more.  I spent a few K getting his gear up to snuff, and what I couldnt get in focus effects I have in Tribute now.  He runs around with FT7, MP3, ER3, ID4.  Given all that...its agro that limits the DPS he can do, not mana,  Even on adventures when there is no time to sit down I rarely if ever drop below about 50 mana, but Im more than pulling my weight in DPS (I generally go through about 10 dots per adventure for rune because I ride so close to the agro line.)<br />
<br />
I often wish that my wizard was on a seperate account so I could play Thor and the wizard together.    It is a great combo; one of my recent regular mates is a 64 wizard and we work really well together.  With me and dogdog controlling the mobs attention he is free to let loose any way he can.  <br />
<br />
Its one of the underated dou's in my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Get a mana robe and it'll work fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dualbot with a wizard all the time.  Basically, I treat it like I'm soloing, but with snare.  At about 50-60% I start chain nuking with the wizard and proceed until dead.  Wizard rarely gets aggro since I'll have a bunch of dots on by then.<br />
<br />
If Wizard runs LOM, I just solo.<br />
<br />
I'm definately not saying this is the most efficient way, but it's safer and more pleasant than straight shaman solo.  My shaman makes about 75% of the XP he'd make straight solo (per minute), but of course the wizard is making XP as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Last time I did the math, a 65 wizard with aa's &amp; basic foci (MP/ID IV) can run like 130dps without actually beating his mana regen, just doing Ice Spear/Ancient Ice.  That's = Bane + Blood from shaman.  With the added ability to snare, and spike to 500dps on demand... well, yeah. They're wizards :)<br />
<br />
edit: 130dps over Hours, btw, not just dps over fight duration. Any downtime the wizard gets while you're pulling/whatever just concentrates his damage more, doesn't cost him in the long run.  Definately the best 2box guy for damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My wife and I duo as shaman and wizard.  We're both only 49 right now but we're not having any problems except when she get's nuke happy! :-)   <br />
<br />
I know it will get rougher as the mobs gain more hp and hit harder.  We're duo'ing in LoY zones right now where the mobs seem to have more hp and hit harder than other places we've tried and I can still tank for us without any Cleric buffage, but with KEI and horse for mana regen along with regen and canni :-)<br />
<br />
Of course, my jb bracer makes me need to canni less often and i'm mostly just using it for damage after my best mal and slow :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My initial main is a wizard.  He's now almost 63 (but has spells to 65).  I have been alternating a 3 box, between him and my 65 cleric.  They can cook things down, that's for sure.  HP's/mitigation suck, that's for sure, so you don't want him grabbing aggro.  However, as long as you control it, yeah they work fine.<br />
<br />
With the SK/Shaman/Wiz combo I can do well up to HoH and BoT.  SK's aggro (snare/fear) really allows the Wiz to blast away, without aggro concerns.<br />
<br />
They work fine, as long as you take care of the lil' fellas and don't let them get beat on, and add good utility to a two box team.<br />
<br />
I'm also working on an ogre BL (44 now).  However, it looks like it would be a tough 3 box with two melees, so he's probably going to sub in as a two box combo, or bring him out for single groupage.  There's a couple of nice BL drops (Elaborate Wicked Vambraces, Barbaric Leggings, and the H2H wep from Maufin) in Droga that he's been the recipient of.<br />
<br />
I love Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Saffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I was a smaller Shammy, I used to play with a Wizzy friend in Plane of Storms.  He would snare a frog in the forest and kite him up and down nuking, shaman would slow him in case he got hit and heal if needed also dotting and nuking in return.<br />
<br />
This worked well for a long time and in fact got me from 46 to 65 in about 3 weeks :)<br />
<br />
By that time, your wizzy should be able to do it all solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">honestly it's a pretty bad duo in my opinion...  the best the Wizard has to offer is snare.  two boxing and kiting just has too much effort and room for error written all over it.  and the Wizard is totaly counter intuitive to root/rot since nukes will break root so much.<br />
<br />
I almost perma 2 box with my SK alt and it is a great combo with my Shaman.  I get snare and FD for difficult pulls, dps is not the best but I can tank some fairly tough stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Is it a workable combo? Yeah. I have used shaman/wizard combo in a few 'camp' spots. Generally let shaman solo mob to 60% and then toss in wizard for dropping mob fast the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
Is it efficient? For the shaman, yes. But wizard dmg output is most efficient quad kiting. Single mob killing is more mana intensive. Far stretch, and not really fair to say, but I equate it to grouping with a necro so they can simply mana-pump instead of use their best tools.<br />
<br />
At 56, saying quad opportunities are rare is false. There are sooooo many places a wizard can quad well into their 60's quite easily. That isn't the point to the question raised by this post - and the answer was given above: yeah, they are a viable duo.</div></div><hr />
