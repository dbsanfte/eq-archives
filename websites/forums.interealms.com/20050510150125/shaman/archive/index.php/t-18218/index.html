<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've never heard of an rpg where a hybrid (paladin, ranger, etc.) could heal better than any priest class.  Paladin's already have some pretty crazy healing abilities to be envied:<br />
<br />
Wave of Marr (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3427&amp;source=Live)<br />
Supernal Cleansing (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3485&amp;source=Live)<br />
Light of Marr (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3430&amp;source=Live)-1 second casting time, talk about your emergency heal.<br />
Touch of Nife (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3429&amp;source=Live) 1125 hp heal isn't bad either with a 5 second casting time.<br />
<br />
If their healing gets any better, Paladin's will start being regularly asked to be main healer in exp groups, if they aren't already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cortez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, please, you make it sound like the entire Paladin community is up in arms about wanting increased healing abilities. I have a lvl 65 Paladin and am quite happy with the healing spells that I have right now - we help out with spot heals (our quick heal is very useful when the enchanter has a mob beating on them after mez drops) or when the stuff hits the fan (group heal has turned a tough situation into a piece of cake on several occasions). <br />
<br />
There will always be a few individuals who want their class to have EVERYTHING (seem to remember some shaman and druids talking about wanting the ability to rez...magicians whining because beastlords have better pet heals, etc) but to imply that an entire class (or even a majority) wants something like this is just not accurate...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think what more to the point that paladins are worried about is the loss of the tank of choice in most high end groups now...they fell that if warriors get these new abilities that they will lose their &quot;role&quot; in the game and people will pass them over for groups.<br />
Which, of course, is complete and total horses***.<br />
Lets see, a warrior with some nice gear and his new abilities gets aggro and gains it nicely and tanks pretty well now, allowing casters breathing room to cast at will....he still cant WoM, ToN, HWoP, remove curse, LoH, Brells, Stuns to interrupt casters CH's, Dispel Magic,REZ MY HAIRY KILTED ARSE, cure poisons/disease, and in a pinch hit point buff pretty similar to a cleric of equal level. If there is a Sk instead of a paladin tanking for me, lets see, he can snare, atk tap, summon my corpse (I die a lot), life tap for group heals, ac tap, and resist debuff (yes they are the only hybrid that can do that). Heck give me a ranger even, snares, Strenth of Tunare, Call of Rathe, CoTP, natureskin if no clerics or paladins are around (better than nothing else), Flame lick for insta aggro.<br />
Sorry hybrids arent going to lose out to warriors for groups now, even with the changes that are coming, it will just make people less leary of casting when grouped with a warrior as a MT.<br />
Some of my best friends are paladins (RL and in game). If you ask a non uber end game paladin that just enjoys the game for what he has he will tell you hes fine and that he doesnt need anymore.<br />
If SoE buckles and grants paladins better healing, then the first time one of them gets told to sit and med that hes the main healer and he had best like it, he will P**s and moan for years.</div></div><hr />

I agree.  I think SK's have a lot to offer, but it's not as obvious as the pally spells (not counting agro management since they both have that.)  I play a warrior and I think melee changes are needed, but I don't want them to go too far and put knights in the same boat pure melees are currently in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warriors deserve something.  They are the most specialized of all classes.  They have almost no utility besides tanking.  They have no stealth abilities, no heals, not other handy utility spells of any kind what so ever to offer a group.  Warriors deserver to be the best tank, because that is all they have.  <br />
<br />
Pallys still have healing and other utility spells.  Rangers still have tracking, and other spells.  SK have their pets and FD, and other spells.  Monks have their stealth abilities and FD.  Rogues get great DPS, and their strealth, and now with LDON trap skills.  Warriors deserve to be the best at melee, since they have no other thing to offer a group besides melee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if war/pal/sk all taunt equally well, they are still distinct after melee changes. Warriors are the premere tanks, and the knights offer utility (paladins for heals/rez, sks for fd and far higher dps than people think they can manage), and that is exactly how things should be.</div></div><hr />

Unikely.  If warriors end up being .0001% better than paladins an MA's, 99% of the pick up groupers in EQ will never leave a newbie zone without a warrior, because they are TEH BESTO AND OMG I WILL DIE WITHOUT A WARRIOR.  <br />
<br />
I have had groups with a chanter AND a beastlord in them BEG me to join them because &quot;we need shaman slow.&quot;  Same thing.  <br />
<br />
The idea, of course, will be to &quot;balance not overbalance.&quot;  I can only assume that all the people who believe that will actually happen also believe every television commercial they watch, that rogies were &quot;working as intended&quot; 2 months after release, and that Asheron's Call 2 provides 'a balanced, immersive and dynamic fantasy world with deeper gameplay than the genre has ever seen' too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OMG ... I have never even considered saying no to a warrior if I am looking for a tank ... why has this become such an issue?  As a shaman I can out taunt all 3 of them if I really wanted ... and if my slow doesn't hit they all take the same amount of damage deprending on their gear.  Are we talking about exp groups, raids, solo?  <br />
<br />
On my second account I have a troll warrior .. and while I have kicked myself for not making an oger (frontal stun thing) I have never said to myself .. I wish I made a paladin .. Ya know what I want in my group .. good players not over aggroing fools.<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ since day one &lt;wooppideedoo&gt; and remember back in the Kunark days when people wouldn't group with hybrids because they actually took more exp or generated less exp per mob.  I think that if a group needs a tank, they will get a tank reguardless.  I am glad that SK's and Paladins have become great tanks but warriors should be able to go toe to toe with them ... seriously what makes them special?  Every class needs one thing they do better than any other.  <br />
<br />
There is one thing that I hate about EQ and thats perception .. the comparison between war-pal-sk will never be exact .. just like comparing player A to player B.  I have grouped with some ****ty paladins, SK's and warriors over the course of my EQ life ... I remember that one week in BoT we had a paladin come to join our group .. he must have been a Ebayed or hammy-down Paladin because I think I had more HP than he did.  He also didn't know the first thing about aggor/taunt.  If this change is coming because of lose examples I think its stupid.  If the change is all hype, dito.  If Furor was out taunted on some Time mobs .. I dont give 2 crap-o-las .. <br />
<br />
Just fix the taunt button =)<br />
<br />
Oh and one thing while I was reading that pally link .. someone was bitching about how losey their dps was and in their sig it showed them undead critting for 4K .. haha silly paladin.</div></div><hr />

Gart, it isn't healing that makes paladins such good xp group tanks, it is stuns combined with more than adequate tanking. Paladin healing really is orders of magnitude worse than real healers. Of course, it is also orders of magnitude better than warrior healing too. <br />
<br />
Aggro is the reason paladins are in such demand for groups, not healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Let's compare the best heal that shaman's get to the best heal that Paladin's get.  I chose Tnarg's Mending because with all of the boosts you can give it from focus effects and aa's it allows you to heal much more hitpoints in the same period of time that Kragg's takes to cast.<br />
Shaman's:  <br />
 Tnarg's Mending= Level 62, 450 mana, Heals for 1300 hp, 3.75 casting time, 2.25 recast.  <br />
Throw in Quiescence=Level 65, 200 mana, heals for 300hp per tick for 4 ticks (more with extensions), 6 casting time, 2.25 recast.<br />
<br />
Paladin's: <br />
Touch of Nife=Level 61, 450 mana, Heals for 1125 hp, 5 casting time, 2.25 recast.<br />
Supernal Cleansing=Level 64, 300 mana, 250 hp per tick, 1.5 casting time, 30 recast.<br />
<br />
I only listed the statistics for our most similar spells since Shaman's do not have any form of group heal or super fast almost instant heals (Light of Marr).  Notice that Paladin's actually get spells nearly equivalent to a real healer, one level earlier than the real healer.  How is Paladin healing orders of magnitude worse than real healers again?  I agree with you that paladin's are in demand for their aggro, but their healing ability cannot be ignored.  Look at rangers.  They are a hybrid of the second best healer in the game, and their healing ability is not even in the same galaxy as Paladin's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm well aware of the power of Paladin stuns.  It's but one aspect that combines to make them an overpowered class, imho.  It's just in that thread some paladins appeared to be suggesting they should get to heal better.  I thought that was pretty comical.</div></div><hr />

That would be a valid argument if paladins had cannibalize. Compare paladin heals to druid or cleric heals. Please don't tell me you don't realize the vast difference between cleric/druid healing efficiency and speed and shaman healing efficiency and speed is due to the mana regen provided by cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Look at rangers. They are a hybrid of the second best healer in the game, and their healing ability is not even in the same galaxy as Paladin's.<br />
<br />
Ranger's healing ability compared to paladin's healing ability has remained relatively constant scaling up through the levels. That's not an accident.</div></div><hr />

whenever i am looking for players and go / all lfg 65, the only thing i pay attention to is what guild the player is in.  upper tier guilds = more preference.<br />

No clue what idea you are trying to convey by this sentence, but if you are suggesting that shaman heal better than clerics or druids, you're wrong.  <br />

Neither does Tnarg's. Our best heal by far only hits for about 20% of an 8K tank's hit points without a crit heal. You really think a hybrid class based off of a class with that poor of healing ability is getting an upgrade? Keep dreaming. Paragon is going to have to get you by.<br />
<br />

Exactly as fast as without innate hybrid haste...which only affects detrimental spells with a cast time of 3 seconds or greater. For paladins, that means innate hybrid spell haste affects 1 spell (a mid 50's undead nuke) out of our entire spell book.<br />

<br />
It's very simple. You were comparing paladin heals to shaman heals without taking into consideration the fact that shaman heals are much lower in healing speed and efficiency than druid/cleric heals because of cannibalize. Shaman heals are balanced around the fact that shamans can regenerate mana about as fast as it can be spent with the only real cost being the opportunity cost of having to canni and Q. Canni5 reduces that opportunity cost dramatically.<br />
<br />
Tunare's Renewal 58 DRU <br />
Increase Hitpoints by 2925 (75% max) <br />
Mana: 400 <br />
Casting Time: 10 <br />
Recast Time: 2.25 <br />
Range: 100 <br />

<br />
Why is it that TR heals 50% more than Kragg's when every other detail of the spell is identical? It is 50% more efficient and has 50% more healing per second.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's Mending 62 SHM<br />

Mana: 450 <br />

<br />
NI heals 35% more hp per second and is 21% more efficient than Tnarg's. Other than mana cost and amount healed, the spells are identical. Same cast time, same refresh, same range. I wonder why it is that the 2 primary healing spells for shamans would happen to be so much less potent than the the healing spells with the exact same role for druids? <br />
<br />
Shaman healing spells are balanced around canni, or castrated because of canni, however you want to look at it. Comparing the healing spells of a class without canni to your own spells and trying to draw the conclusion that said class can heal almost as well as a shaman is a flight of fancy at best, and disingenous at worst. Engage in casuistry much?<br />

Apparently you are suggesting that Paladin healing is inadequate, although you are careful to be obtuse about it.  <br />
<br />
You are wrong.  It's basically a laughable position to assert.  Essentially your view is that Paladin healing should be balanced against clerics/druid healing and that shaman are sort of a wild-card due to cannibalization.  <br />
<br />
My understanding of your view is that... it shouldn't really be a surprise to shaman that Paladins may (or should) end up getting better heals that equal or surpass shaman because we can cannibalize.  <br />
<br />
Feel free to clarify your position.  You've had 2 shots at it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It's very simple. You were comparing paladin heals to shaman heals without taking into consideration the fact that shaman heals are much lower in healing speed and efficiency than druid/cleric heals because of cannibalize. ...<br />
I like how you neglected to mention that Druids recieve a second incomplete heal at 64 and Shamans don't.<br />
<br />
Karana's Renewal  <br />
Increase Hitpoints by 4680 (75% max) <br />
Mana: 600  <br />
Casting Time: 10 <br />
Recast Time: 2.25 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5<br />
Range: 100 <br />
<br />
With AAs Druids can stretch is out to about 5500 max HP heal. Shamans can heal for 3600 at maximum with a Tnarg's crit, 1800 base for 150 less mana. Whoo Hoo. The point is not that our heals are inefficient, because everyone knows they are and they know exactly why, it is that Shamans flat out not capable of keeping up with high DPS mobs. The amount healed per second has fallen so far behind clerics and druids that Paladins are edging in on Shamans simply because they can heal at approximately the same rate, if not for nearly as long. Torpor used to counteract this by being extremely efficient and Quiesence seems to last forever for the amount of mana it costs, but it heals 300/tick. Period. In a ten second span, assuming Q is already on the tank, a Shaman heals for about 4000 damage by expending 900 mana (not including Q, 1100 if you do include it). In that same span a Druid heals for 5500 expending 600 mana. Not only are we spending almost twice as much mana, we're healing for only 75% as much. <br />
<br />
Now compare to a Paladin. Wave of Marr has an absurd mana cost, but the potential to stretch to a whopping 6:1 healing ratio, compared to about 3:1 for Tnarg's, and it heals 2/3 as much. Supernatural Cleansing heals only 50 hp less per tick than Quiesence for 100 mana more with an identical duration, but a much higher recast time. Light of Nife has about a 2:1 healing ratio and tops out at 850 base, again 2/3 as much as Tnarg's. A Paladin can theoretically heal a single target for about 2500 hp in ten seconds or so without crits, albeit at a very high mana cost. And then there is the minor fact that a Paladin can do at least 80 DPS for as long as they damn well please.<br />
<br />
I don't think that Shamans should be better healers than Druids. However we are rapidly losing ground because of the mana regen afforded to us by Cannibalize. High mana regen spells and easier access to FT gear have lessed the advantage of being able to eat your arm for mana. We need a large HP heal badly to stay competitive, even if it comes at an absurd mana cost .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I agree with Aselus. Regardless of mana efficiency, if you can't keep up with the DPS of the mob, it doesn't matter how efficient or inefficient the heal is. And what puts Shamans further behind is that cannibilize is not a passive process, it is active mana regen so time spent regenning mana is time that you cannot heal, do dps, whatever. You have to factor that in. And I don't believe that the difference in heal spells is due solely to cannibilize, partialy because of what I stated below. I think that slow is also factored in as well. I actually am fairly content with healing as it is now. I totally ignore the &quot;complete heal&quot; we have, use all my AAs and my healing focus item, and Tnarg's works okay. I guess it irks me that Druids want a better heal when theirs blows ours away with no healing AAs needed and that isn't good enough.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't understand, what all that recent linking from various class boards is about (except for the occasional fun of some inter-class flaming, no problem with that to a degree, hehe).<br />
<br />
When you look more deeply in some threads, you will find that posters with extreme views like Galidin (sp?) are likely in the minority. Heals aren't even their main concern, more stuff like aggro, stuns, tanking and such.<br />

Even if some of them want healing upgrades, they hopefully have the common sense to wait inline BEHIND us  :D .</div></div><hr />

<br />
When people mention all the neat things a ranger can do (Track, buffs, etc) they need to realize that the raid only needs 1 ranger to do all that.  We have our bow, but on most raid mobs its useless cause archery is broken.<br />
<br />
Rangers deserve a better heal then chloroblast.   A simple 1k ish heal w/ a 5 sec cast time would be fine.  We are a druid hybrid after all.  We get the healing AA's, but the only rangers that invest in them are those w/ Lifetap weapons or w/ nothing better to spend AAs on.<br />
<br />
Beastlords deserve a better heal also.  I'm not sure how much because I dont play the class.  But why no make the class with the best of everything and the worst of nothing even better?  (/sarcasism off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">If you are simply saying that shaman are currently more efficient healers than paladins, there isn't much dispute.<br />

Paladin's already have some pretty crazy healing abilities to be envied: [lists spells]<br />
If their healing gets any better, Paladin's will start being regularly asked to be main healer in exp groups, if they aren't already.<br />

Khozik, I agree with you.  Paladins heal fine and don't need anything more.  The real issue is whether that class needs a nerf or not.  It's a happy accident for Paladins that they now have aggro lock capabilities together with the ability to tank an aggroed mob.  It doesn't have to stay that way for them to remain a powerful and viable class.  To be asking for more at this stage is a remarkable display of class self-centeredness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Quoting Aselus:<br />
I like how you neglected to mention that Druids recieve a second incomplete heal at 64 and Shamans don't<br />
<br />
I didn't &quot;neglect to mention&quot; that fact. I didn't mention it because my case was already made, and making mention of KR would only further illustrate my point.<br />
<br />
Quoting Aselus:<br />
The point is not that our heals are inefficient, because everyone knows they are and they know exactly why, it is that Shamans flat out not capable of keeping up with high DPS mobs.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what I said. &quot;without taking into consideration the fact that shaman heals are much lower in healing speed and efficiency than druid/cleric heals because of cannibalize&quot; Notice I mentioned healing speed in there? That has always been the balancing factor for shamans: they could sustain healing much longer than either a cleric or a druid provided the incoming damage they are healing is below a certain threshold in terms of damage per second. Anything above that threshold they simply cannot cope with. Shaman healing spells are very lacking in power compared to clerics and druids, but the spells themselves are not the entirety of shaman healing: mana regen also plays a significant role.<br />
<br />
My beef is with the fact that paladin healing spells were compared to shaman healing spells directly without taking into consideration what makes shaman healing spells the way they are, namely the mana regen from cannibilize, which obviously paladins don't get.<br />
<br />
Quoting Aselus: <br />
The amount healed per second has fallen so far behind clerics and druids that Paladins are edging in on Shamans simply because they can heal at approximately the same rate, if not for nearly as long.<br />
<br />
Chain casting Tnarg's mending yields a heal per second rate of 266.67~ hp/sec for 2.889hp healed per mana. Chain casting Light of Nife yields a heal per second rate of 262 hp/sec for 2.125hp healed per mana. Essentially the same speed, but 36% more efficiency for Tnarg's Mending. That's 36% more efficiency in spite of the fact that shamans have SCM, specialization, AND cannibalize. That's just the raw spells.<br />
<br />
Check out those numbers fully buffed, AA'd and foci'd. Chain casting Tnarg's yields a heal per second rate of 430 hp/sec (1937 hp each 4.5 seconds) with an efficiency of 6.61 hp/mana (1937 hp for 293 mana). Chain casting Light of Nife yeilds a heal per second rate of 390 hp/sec (1267 hp each 3.25 seconds) with an efficiency of 3.73 hp/mana (1267 hp for 340 mana). Shaman heals end up being 10% faster hp/sec and 77% more efficient. Factoring in healing crits only further seperates the healing efficiency and speed of paladins and shamans. Keep in mind that shaman healing speed is supposed to be low relative to other healers and that shaman healing efficiency is also supposed to be low relative to other healers. Paladin healing speed is supposed to be relatively high - &quot;emergency heals&quot;, remember? Without some way to reduce the spell gem refresh time, even the paladin super fast 1 second heal doesn't really give much in terms of hp/sec healed.<br />
<br />
Compare paladin heals to druid's heals (a class that doesn't get canni!) and you will see an even bigger difference in raw healing efficiency and speed:<br />
<br />
382 hp/sec with (454 hp/sec) KR for 7.8 hp/mana (11.6 hp/mana - mana pres and IH foci don't affect this)<br />
291 hp/sec with (579 hp/sec) NI for 3.5 hp/mana (8.02 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
Just the lowball numbers compared to paladins is pretty indicative. Druids heal 46% faster and do so 267% more efficiently. Comparing the absolute best that each class can do (healing and haste foci, spec, SCR, etc) a druid will heal 48% faster and do so 115% more efficiently OR will heal 16% faster and do so 211% more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Do paladins need to heal better? If they were to be primary healers for a group, yes. To be supplementary healers? No. It also depends on what you mean by &quot;better&quot;. More efficient? Faster? More unique?<br />
<br />
My favorite quote was from Aselus:<br />
And then there is the minor fact that a Paladin can do at least 80 DPS for as long as they damn well please.<br />
<br />
Please, get real. Are you trying to tell me that you can't cast bane on every mob that comes into camp? Bane by itself is 70 DPS. Add in dogdog and you are pushing 90 DPS or so. My wife frequently hits 150+ DPS during our LDoN dungeon crawls and she is our slower and healer AND has no burning affliction or improved damage focus. Assuming I have FA and speed, I can spike above 80 DPS with either a lance of the flame knight (drops in sol ro tower), resplendant war maul (tallon zek) or a spear of fire (plane of fire mini named). I generally average around 65-70 DPS. If we have a cleric/druid along to heal my wife can easily sustain 120+ DPS slowing, dotting, and nuking, and if she has C5, she can push 180 or so sustained. I'm not sure what DPS had to do with the whole conversation, but if you are going to bring up paladin DPS as some sort of balancing point, I can't help but laugh at you.<br />
<br />
Quoting Litchebane :<br />
And what puts Shamans further behind is that cannibilize is not a passive process, it is active mana regen so time spent regenning mana is time that you cannot heal, do dps, whatever. You have to factor that in.<br />

I thought I specifically pointed out the opportunity cost of having to repeatedly cast cannibalize.<br />

<br />
OK, I will try one more time to answer your questions and then to try and make my initial objection more obvious. BTW, after seeing more of your posts, I would say my comment about casuistry was very apropos. <br />
<br />
I am in no way suggesting that paladin healing is inadequate in terms of balance. Paladin healing does need to be balanced in relation to cleric/druid/shaman healing. Does that mean paladins need to be able to function as primary healers in a group? No, it does not. It does mean that healing is a relative ability: it is either worth the opportunity cost of casting the spell or it is not. How many rangers do you see healing themselves during combat, or after for that matter, when grouped with a healer? How often do you see a warrior binding wound on him/herself during/after combat when grouped with a healer? Assuming they have a healer in their group, it isn't worth it because the other healer can heal several orders of magnitude better. Paladin healing needs to be at the very least &quot;worth it&quot; some of the time when grouped with a primary healer, since I think most of us agree a paladin shouldn't be able to function as primary healer for an experience group except in extreme fringe cases.<br />
<br />
I had to laugh at the &quot;better heals&quot; comment regarding shamans and paladins but to clarify, my point is: don't compare paladin and shaman healing simply on the basis of the speed and efficiency of the spells available to each class and then extrapolate that to draw conclusions about the healing abilities of the 2 classes. If you want to make conclusions about healing ability, you need to bring into play other things that affect healing ability, oh like cannibalize. I'll quote below where someone did exactly that (draw conclusions based solely on the spells), which is what I responded to.<br />
<br />
Quoting Tobyus:<br />
Let's compare the best heal that shaman's get to the best heal that Paladin's get. I chose Tnarg's Mending because with all of the boosts you can give it from focus effects and aa's it allows you to heal much more hitpoints in the same period of time that Kragg's takes to cast.<br />
Shaman's: <br />
Tnarg's Mending= Level 62, 450 mana, Heals for 1300 hp, 3.75 casting time, 2.25 recast. <br />
Throw in Quiescence=Level 65, 200 mana, heals for 300hp per tick for 4 ticks (more with extensions), 6 casting time, 2.25 recast.<br />
<br />
Paladin's: <br />
Touch of Nife=Level 61, 450 mana, Heals for 1125 hp, 5 casting time, 2.25 recast.<br />
Supernal Cleansing=Level 64, 300 mana, 250 hp per tick, 1.5 casting time, 30 recast.<br />
<br />
I only listed the statistics for our most similar spells since Shaman's do not have any form of group heal or super fast almost instant heals (Light of Marr). Notice that Paladin's actually get spells nearly equivalent to a real healer, one level earlier than the real healer. How is Paladin healing orders of magnitude worse than real healers again? I agree with you that paladin's are in demand for their aggro, but their healing ability cannot be ignored. Look at rangers. They are a hybrid of the second best healer in the game, and their healing ability is not even in the same galaxy as Paladin's.<br />
<br />
That sort of thing just causes misunderstandings about the real healing abilities of paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Graal, how are you so privy to what is going on at SOE that you know Shaman heals are SUPPOSED to be low in speed and efficiency relative to other healers and that Paladins are SUPPOSED to be high in speed at heals? Hell up to just before PoP we were basically dead even with Druids as the number 2 healing class with them using a better direct heal and us using a HoT spell. I guess you are assuming supposed to based on healing upgrades since then but you are being mighty presumptious. As far as effiency, I don't feel like running the numbers but I bet our heal over time spells are close to as efficient as any heal out there when you include mana consumption although obviously slow to work. I think Paladin healing is fine the way it is, hell I would kill for a group heal of any kind.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of casuistry, just what is it that you want for pally heals?  You spend so much time just debunking other people's comparisons between pally and shaman healing, it's difficult to see what your point is (beyond proving other people wrong), except that you say pallies ought to be balanced in relation to shamans/druids/clerics.<br />
<br />
People seem to throw that word &quot;balance&quot; around so much, I'm not even sure what it means anymore.  Then you go on to say that you don't think pallies should be primary healers in a group, so what do you want?<br />
<br />
Personally, I've thought that pallies (60+ anyways) have some pretty sweet heals--their group heals and quick cast heals rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I do not see how what I said could cause any sort of misunderstanding about the real healing abilities of paladins.  I did not not pull out my thesaurus and find some rarely used word of the day to throw in my post  :rolleyes:.  I feel that Paladin's healing is very similar to Shaman's, and that Paladin's have some tools that can make them more than a decent healer.   For a hybrid, Paladin's are exceptional healers.  My one and only point was that I do not think that Paladin's need any boost in their healing abilty.  I did not at any time say that Shaman's need a boost in their healing abilty.  I never said that Paladin's needed a decrease in any aspect of the class.  <br />
<br />
You are not including all of a Paladin's tools to heal, yet you keep bringing up a Shaman's cannibalize ability.  A Paladin wanting to fill a healer's role could put Supernal Cleansing on the tank, then alternate Touch of Nife, Light of Marr and probably sustain over 350 hp/sec of healing on a single target at a rate of 910 mana per 6 seconds, without any focus/aa bonuses.  I do not know what a 65 paladin's mana pool is like so I do not know how long they could hold out at that rate, but you still have LoH to fall back on for emergency's at 0 mana cost, and Wave of Marr for when your entire group is in a pinch.  How am I causing any sort of misunderstanding about a Paladin's healing ability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Are you trying to tell me that you can't cast bane on every mob that comes into camp? Actually, yes. Just how much mana regen do you think Shamans get? In my average group (in a guild that hasn't killed Terris yet) LDoN normal mobs have a lifespan of about 30 seconds. Anathema isn't even worth casting for the three or four ticks I'll get out of it, much less Bane.<br />
<br />
If we have a cleric/druid along to heal my wife can easily sustain 120+ DPS slowing, dotting, and nuking, and if she has C5, she can push 180 or so sustained. Bullhonkey. If you miss so much as one tick with Bane over two castings, you drop from 70 DPS to 65. If you slow before you cast you drop to 60. If you slow and toss a heal you drop to 56. If you get a slow resist, slow, toss a heal, .... You get the idea. Your wife may burst up to 180 DPS, but averaging that is a big fat load of crap. Then there is the problem of not getting aggro when dropping that many DoTs on a mob. Added pet DPS is nice but really nothing to write home about. Dogdog tops out around 30 DPS with mage items and lots of buffs and is extremely fragile.<br />
This is the sort of thing that causes misconceptions about Shaman DPS.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what DPS had to do with the whole conversation, but if you are going to bring up paladin DPS as some sort of balancing point, I can't help but laugh at you....<br />
<br />
Does that mean paladins need to be able to function as primary healers in a group? No, it does not. No. But how often do you see Shamans as primary healers in elemental planes or hard adventures? Not very often. Quite frankly I don't really want to be a primary healer. My heals can stay just good enough so I can be a backup all of the time. But when a Paladin can spot heal for as much almost as much as I can, why not take the sustained DPS of a melee and a better tank other than a possibly redundant slower? Throw an Enchanter in and get better DPS for charm and better mana regen for the group! You now have two classes that have made the Shaman all but obselete save our buffs. Focus and Avatar are now the only thing we bring to the table.<br />
<br />
The fact that Paladins have virtually snap aggro, on-par tanking with the best of the best, group heals, spot heals, sustained DPS of 70 DPS with haste and the BoT staff (and yes I checked with the Paladins in my guild for this one) is quite good enough. It is not inconcievable to beleive that at this time Paladins are the most powerful class in EQ, but I think most people would argue Beastlords are better by a slim margin. The point remains that Paladins do not need better heals unless everyone else scales up too.</div></div><hr />

After your remarkable display, I'd say you were the clear champion of casuistry.  <br />
<br />
Come on, you are actually suggesting that Paladin healing is inappropriately compared to shaman because shaman have cannibalize.  Yes, clearly cannibalize and mana regen are an aspect of shaman effectiveness of healing.  This is not a profound observation.  <br />
<br />
Fundamentally, to suggest that Paladins need better healing is absurd.  That's where the rubber hits the road, and expressing shock that Tnargs is 36% more efficient without factoring AA is the best display of casuistry possible.</div></div><hr />
