<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been thinking about slow mitigation lately and I have a question on how exactly it works... Does the mob mitigate a slow to a certain percentage? or to a certain hard number? For example, if hpothetically:<br />
shaman slow = 10<br />
Enchanter slow = 8<br />
Beastlord slow = 6<br />
and the mob mitigates my slow to say 50% will the slow numbers stack up as 5 for me 4 for an enc and 3 for a beast? or will it be 5's across the board? I hope that's a clear question heh.<br />
<br />
Note: Those numbers really have nothing to do with anything and I just made them up to try and illustrate my question. I.e. they don't scale properly to ingame numbers  or anything like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We assume slow mitigation means we still have the advantage. At least that's what Sony told us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When slow mitigation first went in (PoP went live), it was a hard cap.  So we all slowed the same, no matter what.  Plus there were negative slows, which means you actually sped up the mob (Fennin Ro comes to mind).  After a few weeks and a lot of uproar about the both, they fixed it to a percentage, so in your example, it would be 5/4/3.</div></div><hr />
