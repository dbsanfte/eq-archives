<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I ventured into the realm many of you hunt in regularly:  I soloed.  I had just finished a guild raid in Kael, and was one half blue away from level 50.  It was late, but I was anxious, and curious enough to see how well I could hunt on my own.  I'm not that good at it yet (as I died), but it was VERY rewarding none-the-less.<br />
<br />
I hitched a lift with a Wizard at the raid to NK, and hoofed it over to Jagged Pine.  My normal exp group and I had been hunting there (read my book &quot;Poaching Poachers for Fun and Profit&quot;), but had avoided the gnoll caves either because we were too timid or because they were taken.  This time I wanted to try the gnolls, so headed north from the gem to set up camp.<br />
<br />
A friendly druid was there, and we worked out an agreement on the pulls.  I whipped out my pet (Hello Genn), gave him speed and strength and an unbalanced mace, parked him on the side of the cave mountain, and set out to pull a chew toy for him.<br />
<br />
The epic wasn't working yet for me, so I pulled the first with slow, and brought doggie one out to meet Genn.  Genn lept to my defense as I approached where I parked him, and soon after the 2 doggies were mixing it up.  An e-bolt at the gnoll warrior, and I once again had his attention.  With a liberal application of Poison DDs, along with the occasional bash and poke from me, Mr Gnoll went down with little fuss.  What amazed me was the experience gained... 1 percent of the level in that kill.  BTW - I started 100 percent on health and mana, and ended 70 percent health, 60 percent mana (I did have KEI).<br />
<br />
Next pull, I tried the JBB crutch instead of the Poison blast... this round was a bit dicey, but the mana I saved made me ready for the next one that much sooner.  I lost another 30 percent health, but maintained about the same mana (only cast slow and ebolt).<br />
<br />
After medding/healing up, I went in again, pulled again with slow, and this time as I approached camp I rooted the mob, cast weaken, then cast ebolt.  At the end of this battle, I was down only 20 percent health, and about 10 percent mana (had to rebuff the pet).<br />
<br />
Things were moving smoothly along, and I was getting between one and 2 percent of the level PER KILL... sheesh =).<br />
<br />
But things weren't all ducky -- there is a caster there (of some necro persuasion), who I pulled just after dinging 50.  Pet had Spirit quickening cast on him, and even after me getting dispelled (took KEI dagnabit) and dotted I thought I was in good shape.  What I didn't count on is the friend warrior that he brought.  Using the technique above I managed to kill the necro, but the warrior broke root right after and with the dots still on me finished this ole shaman off. *unding*<br />
<br />
I paid for a rez, and managed to get the level back with the help of the poachers at the camp the cleric was working.  What I wanted to say was two things:<br />
<br />
1) Soloing is incredible.  I love it!  I was able to take out 2 gnolls while the druid was root rotting a single one.  Experience like that could get me a level in a night.  Thanks for the inspiration to try soloing.  I'll probably not solo much, or if I do it'll be towards AA-- can't pass my friends with exp too much.<br />
<br />
2) The technique used -- pulling with slow, weakening, dotting, melee/JBB seemed to be the best for the warrior types, but did not work well for the caster types.  What techniques do folks use for casters?  Nuke the bejeezus out of em and be done with them?  Melee with bash?  Pull with a dot instead of slow?  I'll try some things, but I was hoping to gain yet again from the collective wisdom of the crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your basics for soloing melees is good, may want to save the mana from weaken though unless you are just having dogdog tank it from start to finish so you can med.<br />
<br />
For casters the best thing to do is put them down as quick as you can.  I usually pull them with Plague, throw Ebolt on, and have a good DD memmed.  I switch slam into my main hotkeys just for casters.  Pay attention to thier casting messages and slam at the right time. (a bash whenever it comes up is useless, a bash after a mob begins to cast is a lifesaver)  If I get an interrupt I start casting the DD right away, if they channel thru it I wait to take the hit, then begin casting so I dont waste the time casting a spell that has a good chance of being interuppted anyway, and get my some melee hits in in the hopes of maybe breaking his.<br />
<br />
Fact is we as a class flat out own, destroy, dominate and rape melees.  But like everyone else but warriors, casters kick our ass, take em down quick, its thier game plan too.</div></div><hr />
