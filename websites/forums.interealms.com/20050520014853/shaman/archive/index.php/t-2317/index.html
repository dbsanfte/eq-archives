<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With all the foci added to the game, I can't help but wonder if the best way to balance casters is to allow them disciplines similar to what the melee folk get.<br />
<br />
Short-duration (1-2 mins), high-recycle time &quot;uber&quot; effects would give us the flexibility to complete with some of the amazing stunts that our peers are doing now.<br />
<br />
They'd there'd be some overlap amongst the classes, but each class would get something unique, too.<br />
<br />
For example, as shamen:<br />
<br />
Gift of the Spirits:  Spells take good percentage less mana<br />
Haste of the Spirits:  Cast much faster<br />
Rage of the spirits:  Hit much harder<br />
Spirits of Decay:  Dots, do more per tick<br />
... and the like.<br />
<br />
I find it amazing what the meleers can do innately that we need to rely on items to approach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm since melee disciplines are gained solely by leveling my only concession would be that ALL caster spells be purchasable at a vendor. Only &quot;Ancient Spells&quot; would remain a drop.</div></div><hr />
