<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">FFS - was the shadel bandit ring giving 15% longer buffs really too over powering?<br />
<br />
Now I can use it to summon a pet a bit quicker, and it isnt even my current pet :(<br />
<br />
I dont see the point of putting some of these effects on equipment that is used by loads of high level players.  It wouldnt be so bad if the different levels of the focus effects did different percentage improvements rather than being restricted to the level of spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some where too easy to get maybe, but if focus was put per caster balance / melee balance, why the hell is it going to be hard as hell to get some effect III items? Which are supposed to be for the 50-60 lvls and spells? What kindof balance was that? Hello Verant. They ain't that uber. **** if they are taht uber just nerf them down and don't make them another EverQUEST to get.<br />
<br />
Oh well, sucks to whine when they give casters something, atleast they try, but personally I am sick of highlevel shaman spell hunting with uber rare drops of uber mobs so having them put effect III focus things into same gathegory just rubbs me wrong way. Gonna take ages to get all casters focus items from places NToV or VP or something. <br />
<br />
Oh well I hope effect II items work with (good enough effect to be of use) for lvl 60ies too. If not then use old items like always I guess and VI just once again put something for the endgames to try to achive / play for ....<br />
<br />
Kiss my balanced ass VI, thank god I am not druid/mage/necro who could have used all balance help they could for real... /comfort<br />

Now where did I put my medication....... :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, the Shadel Bandit Ring isn't exactly hard to get. I would assume Verant wants the more rare items to have the best effects. I think some stuff is out of whack, considering the supple scale armband is about the same difficulty to get or easier than the shadel bandit ring but has a level 3 focus. I would love to see the bandit ring have extended range 3, i'd use it full time again if that was the case. Overall expect to see some more changes shortly on the items as far as balancing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wore a supple scale armband (for the FR) on a ToV raid last night. For all my buffing, healing, debuffing, it never twinkled even once. If it only affects DD spells, it is a pointless shaman ability.<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to start a real poll on the subject, but how about informal first:<br />
<br />
For 60 shamans, how many spells below 45 do you use?<br />
<br />
I use SoW, Bih'Li, Grow/Shrink, Levitate, Enduring Breath, Invis....and unless I'm buffing a sub-45 person...that is IT. Every other spell I use is 49+. Grow/Shrink can never benefit from any focus item to begin with (except maybe mana conservation, but they are cheap as hell, so this does essentially nothing). Focus II items are useless trash to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm a bit confused by the changes here.  I had thought that the Focus Items were associated with Verant's caster balancing program.  Now it appears that the level 3 focus items may be moving onto items only attainable to 'Ubers'.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that non-ubers are stuck with level 2 items - which at level 49+ become increasingly irrelevent?  Is caster-balancing for Ubers only?<br />
<br />
The medicine totem is an extreme example: apparently this is now for level 19 healing spells or less.  Doesn't that make it twinks only?</div></div><hr />

just deleted mine last week clearing out my bank for a tradeskilling frenzy :/  Thank goodness I didn't dich my ob death shroud too!<br />
<br />
I wonder if they nerfed the Happy Love Bracers, which had Range III.  They are the   best.  item.  ever.  if for no other reason than the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I cannot belive that Verant thinks that spell level limiting items are a good idea. It is so ass backwards in this type of game.<br />
<br />
To have level 2 effects on items that you need to be 50+ to get is just plain stupid. <br />
<br />
Why the hell is it so hard to have the effect work for all levels of spells, but the number be the total amount of change. A level 1 item will do 7% A level two 14%  and a level 3 21%<br />
<br />
That right there means items will not lose value if they have a level 2 effect, they will still be useful just not as useful as a level 3. <br />
<br />
Instead we get a damn item that is useless to us as an enhancement because we are not able to go get the Uber death item of spell casting reinfocement 3. Sure it is still as good as it was yesterday in terms of HP AC and MAna and such but<br />
<br />
If a FBSS stopped working at level 35 then this implimentation would make sense. <br />
<br />
As it stands this entire change is poorly thought out, Poorly implimented, and basicly a complete load of Horse ****.<br />
<br />
God damn Verant couldnt take a piss and hit the floor the first time around, they would have to try three times to even do that right.<br />
<br />
If you want caster balance then make changes that people can use. Not an overly complicated series of all or nothing items with ignorant level caps that wouldnt make sense even if I had been clubbed on the back of the head a few times as a child.<br />
<br />
There is no FUN involved in ditching gear that I have fought, sweated and bled over. So that I can have a better effect for my spells. <br />
<br />
The all or nothing approach is just so damn stupid. Make them incrimental upgrades that affect all the spells in the line. Then when you get a affliction enhancement 2 item you are happy rther than tossing it into the crap pile because it only works on spells that you stopped useing 11 LEVELS ago. (and with alt xp for me at least 29 levels ago)<br />

IMO, the effects on the level III gear are not comparable to the level of the gear you get them on. At best there is one manditory effect...MPIII. All other effects are situational and can be swapped out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">saying this implementation is stupid is an understatement.  Makes ZERO sense at all.  I mean now it only makes sense to give any level 2 or under item to a twink as on anyone else it's likely useless.  This implementation actually encourages twinking.  It should be the other way around.  Level 3 items shouldn't work on spells under level 44, level 2 shouldn't work on items under 30 or whatever.  But the way they got it now makes NO sense at all.</div></div><hr />
