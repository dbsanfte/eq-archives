I've spent a lot of time on mining runs though too, got smithing to over 100.  I've also spent a ton of time on green/grey quests from alternate newbie areas.  So I guess I could be levelling faster, but I'm happy with the way things are going :).<br />

I'm finding the most fun in testing the limits of the class and taking on mobs 3-4 lvls higher than me, and elites within 1-3 lvls +. a good first aid skill is essential, as well as 300hp+ heal pots. I'm spec'ed in shield block, lightning shield, shock +, and crit melee. I figure the faster I take em down, less chance they have to do the same to me :). frost shock is the win in most cases, cast and back up/run oor until it refreshes, then hit them again. I occassionally drop a snare totems if they resist fs, but generally I don't use any totems and save the mana for heals/shocks. <br />

Have also tried several trades and am sticking with Enchantment (path less traveled) and herbalism.  Am in a guild with a membership of over 20, many RL friends and folks I've played other games with.  Since we have a load of leatherworkers and blacksmiths already, I figured I'd do something different that would stack with their trades.<br />

Anyway, like everyone else, I just love this game.  Hope they raise the level cap to 300 so I can play for the next 10 years.  :)<br />

Also, if you plan on doing a lot of healing in groups, load up on int gear.  At level 21 each int is giving me about 15 mana.  Im up to over 1k mana with my new Crescent staff.

I didn't start until Saturday after turkey day, and only a few hours a day since.  <br />

I really like the way WoW works, as I am comfortable that I can casual play my way and make noticeable progress.  I see a lot of people in twenties, many more around 8 to 12.<br />
<br />
I like quest sharing - as someone mentioned above, I was never &quot;the first&quot; to do anythin in EQ, even if I avoided spoilers, etc.  I enjoyed sharing two quests with guys slightly higher than me, who simply had not found the quest giver in a little outpost in the Barrens.  And, if you are grouping, it can get everyone interested in the same targets  8)</div></div><hr />

You still have to give a valid credit card number to start playing, right? Somehow I doubt that the parents of all these &quot;dumbasses&quot; gave them their credit card number with no expectations of at least one charge. I am sure the odd parent bought the &quot;I just need it to play for a month and then I'll cancel before you have to pay, honest!&quot; line, but a majority? I'd love to be proven wrong, but I am afraid I am not. Maybe in a few months when the parents realize that $14.95 will be a permanent addition to their credit card bills...</div></div><hr />

they do that so you can't spy, in beta we had alot of problems with lvl 1 orcs following large groups of 30+ players then suddenly dissapearing and even bigger groups of 35+ alliance guys coming and wiping us out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*waves byebye to EQ*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Salece</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">My only character, Ekuylia, is now a level 41 human paladin in the Lightbringer server.  She is now wearing full mithril plate (except helm and boot).  The warhorse come in very handy in the suicide missions I'm now running.<br />
<br />
Why suicide?  Because with 242 smithing and 255 mining, the only way to raise those skills is to mine mithril and thorium. The only places to mine those #%!#@ are in zones I'm not supposed to be in, like Blasted Land and Burning Stepp.  So I have to now basically run in those zones, mine the ores, and hope to get out and move to the next vein.  With so many ?? lvl beasts around me, I got killed a lot.  In fact I was killed like 5 times in one hour last night in Blasted Land (with armor of 4500, I got wacked by an lvl ?? elite Felworth with 1300 melee dmg).  Cost me like 1.3g to repair armor, the entire thing was a very expensive affair.  Hopefully once the learning curve smoothen out, I'll die less often.<br />
<br />
By the way, I specialize in smithing weapon.  Had to do a trail first, which involve making 2 black maces, 2 mithril axes, 4 moonsteel blades, and 4 iron axes.  I need to mine iron like a madman.  <br />
<br />
On the bright side I did make the trip by land from Ironforge to Stormwind by land.  Even with a warhorse, it's not easy to outrun lvl?? mob in Burning Stepp and Searing Gorge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Salece, try the Charred Vale (Next to Stonetalon Mts) for Mithril.  Highest mobs are around 28 - this evening I saw no fewer than 8 Mithril veins and I wasn't even looking for the stuff!<br />
<br />
The Charred Vale is only 2 easy zones away from the Rachet boat dock (from Booty Bay).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Think I may give up smithing completely. What a totally useless skill so far. 225 smithing, 255 mining, and no one wants what I make, blah.<br />
<br />
Charred Vale is the cat's meow for ore, making the rounds I have farmed hundreds of mithril, tons of iron and the occasional truesilver.<br />
<br />
Another place overlooked is the ocean north of the troll villlage in desolace, underwater :)<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Disagree with giving up the skill.<br />
<br />
I've found that I sell very little in the AH since there are usually folks there selling stuff for barely over vendor prices.  Also, for smithing, I've found that it seems like a large percentage of mail/plate wearers are also mining/smithing, so they make their own stuff (at least I do, I'd never buy player made in the AH).  <br />
<br />
Perhaps when a lot of shamans hit 40 and gain the ability to wear mail, our stuff will be more valuable.<br />
<br />
That all being said, even though I am mining/smithing basically for myself, making money is very very easy with cheap stuff.  Copper and bronze armor sells back to the vendor for 10s or thereabouts and is easy money, especially with honored faction :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">near the mermen looking thingies, the nagas, I was finding mithril and occasional truesilver, had water breathing from a shaman. Pretty damned cool underwater place too, reminds me of Atlantis, or what I think it would be like. Forget if you are alliance or horde, the Shadowprey village has a decent amount of pretty easy quests there too.<br />
<br />
Love the zone, not too highly contested for the horde, and the humanoids are great to pickpocket, and drop tons of silk and some mageweave, easy kills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Mill, in IF (for Alliance) there are two Dwarves standing side by side sort of apart from the hustle and bustle. For all intents and purposes they look like overseers.  Both have fancy titles which escape me atm. I know they talk to me (BS 174, Mining 228), but offer no quests.<br />
<br />
I am guessing either: a) These guys are for high end smithing and mining (more likely the former) or b) Blizzard hasn't implemented BS'ing at that level.<br />
<br />
Or c) I am wrong and it's something completely different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Some tradeskills seem more hassle than worth.  I don't think you're going to get rich on any of them.  Personally, I'm going tailoring and enchanting, mostly for guild issues.  If you've got a small guild that can back your skills (pretty much everyone has different abilities), you can move pretty well on them.  One day I had 47 items in my mailbox when I logged on, between linen, wool, silk, and various green items for disenchanting.<br />
<br />
I've lost a ton of revenue (oh how many green items I've disenchanted), but being able to enchant is pretty huge - I've already got 35 hp on chest enchants, it'll be worth it in the long run.<br />
<br />
Smithing makes some decent green items while skilling up, pass them to a friendly enchanter and you may get some very nice stuff out of it.</div></div><hr />
