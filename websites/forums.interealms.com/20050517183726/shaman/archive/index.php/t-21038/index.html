This when Guided med.<br />

must gain the power of the elements to gain entrance.<br />
<br />

<br />
[Wed Apr 21 19:34:14 2004] You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
<br />
[Wed Apr 21 19:34:14 2004] You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
<br />
[Wed Apr 21 19:34:14 2004] Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to <br />
<br />
you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
<br />
[Wed Apr 21 19:34:14 2004] Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />

<br />
is your problem. You need to go hail Alder and Elder in the sick bay to finish your bert flag. Then you should he able to tell  Fahlia Shadyglade i will go to torment then you should be able to unlock to fix your saryrn flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here (http://b5.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13530.topic) are flag memory messages. As taraddar said, it looks like you haven't completed your Bert flag.<br />
<br />
Post by Juujuu in this thread (http://b5.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13829.topic) covers picking up missed pre-flags and post-flags if you should need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I get that message too, and my problem is I missed out on the KOS flag....some wally evaced my group whicl trying to read maps (doh), I then trained to the door and got dragged to the Saryn kill so got that flag.<br />
<br />
Did you hail the guy after killing KOS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">http://www.graffe.com/quests.php?id=7  &lt;~~ this is a link to an awesome site that i found for PoP advancment.  I tells you step-by-step what to do where to go who to hail and what to say.<br />
<br />
I looks like you are missing some hails, and possibly KoS too...i would check the site and go and hail EVERYONE again (yes i know its a pain in the ass &gt;&lt; but at least you know that you will have had that part done :) )  GL hon i hope i helped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramandur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did alot of thinking when it accured to me, did Saryrn on a pickup raid <br />
and was dragged up therefor i miss KoS :(<br />
<br />
Another reason to avoid pickup raids i guess..<br />
<br />
Thanks all for you time and help..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sam, Yours is really good to, the only thing it lacks on the PoP chart is the hails and stuff.  I know that was one of my biggest problems.  But other than that very nice job, how you have the time and patience to do any of that is beyond me, thank you for your effort :)</div></div><hr />
