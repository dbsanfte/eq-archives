Dont be shy hockey fans! I will be closing it at 3 pm PST today and would love to have a full 12 team roster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just signed up =)  <br />
<br />
I don't know a hell of a lot about Pro hockey, I'm more of a college hockey fan (I HATE those damn tiny rinks)  but I just figure that you need someone to beat on in the league LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Udenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">mmm.. college hockey.. <br />
<br />
Gotta ask... What team?? (or even division for that matter.. )<br />
<br />
For me, it's SCSU Huskies..<br />
<br />
(12 days till the start of the season.. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">GAH!!!!  SAINT CLOUD?!?!?!  Their just a bunch of drunks LOL. Famous quote from an SCSU hockey player:  &quot;Well I didn't make the Gopher squad, so I'll just go play for Saint Cloud&quot;<br />
<br />
Minnesota Golden Gopher Hockey BABY!!!!<br />
<br />
All kidding aside, I don't think there is any doubt that the WCHA is the best division in college hockey.  There are so many respectable teams, except for those damn Souix.  I can't wait for the hall of fame game.  The Gophs are gona kill those silly Souix.  And can I just say one more thing?   TROY RIDDLE IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Thank you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Udenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah.. Gophers??  Bah...<br />
<br />
Please remind me.. How many times did we beat you last year???  And who won the WCHA Championship last year??  <br />
<br />
Aye, WCHA is one hell of a league..  And even though you don't like em, you gotta respect the Sioux..  they have had one hell of a run the last few years..<br />
<br />
Not sure about this year.. St. Cloud's lost a few key players (most of all Scotty Meier)...  Should be interesting to see who picks up the slack this year..<br />
<br />
Have you ever come up here to see a game at the NHC??  I gotta tell you, I've been to every game for the past 2 years, and some of the SCSU vm UM games down there.. St. Cloud has one of the best atmospheres in the whole league.. Only other places that I hear even come close is Wisconsin and ND..  Mariucchi is just so dull as far as atmosphere goes...  <br />
<br />
Hehe, this is going to make the season more interesting.. :)<br />
<br />
And yeah, we are a bunch of drunks up here.. Makes them play so much more harder (except perhaps on saturdays occasionaly, where they have too much of a hangover.... :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I have to agree with you that Mariucchi is dull, only becouse they reseve too many seats to the crappy corporate suits that either don't show up, or don't cheer.   the student section is awesome, if we could just get some students down into the corporate seats that place would be one of the best also.  It sucks not being able to get tickets to the arena and seeing half the seats empty.   The Gophs look pretty solid again this year. and even better next year with the addition for Gino Guyer, and we will finally get rid of Howser (good goalie when he keeps his head in the game)<br />
<br />
I think it's gonna be another hard faught season in the WCHA.  I just hope my Gophs have what it takes to come out on top.  It's been WAY too long since we have lifted a national championship banner in Mariucchi =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Udenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, your student section does give Mariucchi some saving grace.. although it doesn't hold a candle up to the Dog Pound up here in NHC..<br />
<br />
Aye, I don't know how well the Huskies are going to do this year either.. they don't get the coverage that the Gophers get (they aren't as high profile as UoM is either..)<br />
<br />
If I think it's going to go the way I expect, I think that both Weasler and Moreland are going to choke this year.. *sigh*<br />
<br />
Howser, he leaving or something?? or he getting dumped?? I was fairly impressed each time I saw him play.. of course, that was only when SCSU was playing him.. &lt;g&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Howser is a senior this year (THANK GOD!)  his major fault is that if the defence is working thier butt off and not allowing shots on goal, he gets lazy and lets in 3-4 stupid goals.  If he is getting pounded he'll stop 40 shots in a game.  That's proabably why he plays so well against SCSU.  We have a freshamn goalie (the name escapes me) coming in this year and will share time with Howser to get some experience.  <br />
<br />
Howsers career is summed up by one game for me.  The First round loss to Maine in Last years Tourney.  After playing a superb game between the pipes and battleing to a 2-2 tie in regulation, a stray puck come toward Howser in the net after 2 minutes have passed in overtime.  He looks up to see 2 Maine players flying down the ice after the puck.  A goalie who had thier head in the right place would have covered the puck and went for the faceoff.  Not Howser, he tries to play the puck up ice and WHIFFS.  The Maine players pick up the puck and shoots it in the open goal for the game winner.</div></div><hr />
