1. update your video card drivers....<br />
2. if you are using Winxp right click on the EQ icron and go to compatability:<br />
<br />
  A. click on the compatability tab<br />
  B. click on run in compatabilty mode<br />
     1. Pick windows98/ME.<br />
<br />
Had somewhat the same problem, I could get to the ELUA and <br />
it would lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had the same thing with the frozen cursor in the EULA window. The workaround that I used was:<br />
Ctrl-Alt-Del and then left click on mouse<br />
leaves the task manager running in the background but it does release the mouse and I didn't run into any other problems for the rest of the night. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was having a similar problem yesterday. <br />
<br />
Before this patch, when a new patch came out and I tried to start EQ, my firewall(zone alarm) would pop up a little window saying the program has changed. I just had to say ok to give eqgame.exe access to the internet. <br />
<br />
Well, the patch that came out yesterday caused EQ to just lock up, so it seemed. What was really happening is that the little firewall confirmation box was popping up, but not coming into view above EQ like it always had before.<br />
<br />
I reset the computer again. As soon as the first splash screen for EQ came up, I hit the alt +enter for window mode. That way when the firewall confirmation box popped up, I would be able to see it.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
