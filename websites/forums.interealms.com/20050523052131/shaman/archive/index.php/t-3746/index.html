<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am only 57, but I make it a habit of trying to get all of my spells for a level prior to getting to it.  My guild is fairly capable of getting a lot of stuff, but some Shaman spells are hard to come by, as you know.<br />
<br />
For a little over a week, I camped Ice Giants and I set up a chain of supply with a few other Ice Giant campers and at the end I had 100 Stinging Wort potions. While still gathering toes, I spoke to the guild leader of one of our server's uber guilds about the potions and they wanted them!<br />
<br />
We discussed a lot of trade possibilities and finally concluded that Malo would be a good trade for them.  He thought he had a copy but it turned out they did not.  After a few days more, we decided that they would pay me 20k for all 100.  He knew all of the costs involved and that they were paying a premium rate .  We talked about the fact that they would expect better prices later on.  Point is, he wasn't scammed.<br />
<br />
So, I now have 28k in the bank.  Last night, before I logged, I checked the Bazaar quickly and saw a guy selling Malo for 32k.  So, I hit my guild up for 4k and bought it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of my guildees have expressed that they are not so sure it is worth it, especially with mages that can cast Mala.  Now I am having second thoughts about it and wondering if I should start hunting for someone who is REALLY desparate to get it and trade it for a fungi or something.  :D <br />
<br />
Your thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Malo is absolutely worth it, kudos on such an enterprising way of obtaining it and after all that work thinking about giving it up, pft! If you come across a spare copy en route to 60 then think about what to do with the spare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">KEEP IT.  IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR IT LATER.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Werd.<br />
What my peeps said ahead of me.<br />
Keep the Malo spell and level up till u can use it.  Also, get Torpor.  That's yer next big project.  Get those two spells and you will be just fine upon turning 60.  In fact, you'll be ahead of the pack of screaming velkewhores who grind up to 60 and then whine about spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends how long you see yourself taking to get to 60. If you're a super slow leveller, I'd say get a fungi. But if you see 60 coming soon, the spell sounds too rare to get rid of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good to hear that you guys agree with for the most part.  It was easy money and it's a rare spell.  Besides, a good portion of the better gear in the upper levels is not even purshasable, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You found malo for sale?!?!!!? /GASP<br />
<br />
Inny has at least 4 people a day WTB, I have never ever seen WTS malo...oh wait I did, then when they looked closer it was mala.<br />
<br />
I paid 60k for torpor and would happily pay that again for malo, I just hate getting 5 slow resists on random001 lvl 60 mob, then /w all cleric 56 60.<br />
<br />
Keep it, hug it, care for it, then scribe it the second you hit 60. Do not ever be tempted to trade it for pp or equipment. malo+torpor &gt; any buyable shaman armour or weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1 copy of malo placed for sale since bazaar went live on Xegony.  Price?  80k  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agreed, Keep it.<br />
<br />
I ended up getting Torpor for 50K + Heiro and would have kept it myself except I had a 60 guildy who is a really nice guy and hooked him up with it.  As a general rule, I try to get the shaman I respect in guild enabled with spells before me because simply I know I'm going to get burnt out at 59 for a while so I don't forsee 60 til maybe October/November time frame (and I raid quite a bit).<br />
<br />
<br />
That and I just HATE doing grind xp (Velks, Sol B, Fungus Grove, etc..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mages are usually pretty busy with other stuff on raids, usually with making modrods and CoH. If they're casting a debuff at a big target it's usually trying to spam a Malosini in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Keep it.. don't matter if you level slow or now ;) cause everyone knows.. the moment you need it.. you aren't going to find it for a while lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Keep it. If nothing else you'll really want the spell. You won't always have your guild mages around to mala and even if you do malo is better. Sure it's only 10 better than mala but malosini is only 15 better than malo and i regularly use malosini to overwriet malo to make things easier to stick.<br />
<br />
Besides you only went 4k into hawk to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The only thing you should be trading malo for is something that is so ungodly rare that it makes Malo look like some mage spell.  (I can't think of anything that rare, can you? :) )<br />
<br />
In my opinion, people that trade fungi tunics and crap for malo/torpor are doing the right thing.  Fungi's are for sale every day on my server.  Expensive, yes, but they are around.  Malo/Torpor are not.  Don't ever sell it, and don't ever let anyone tell you that you wasted money on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I gotta echo everyone else here, definatly never ever part with Malo.  And for 32k you got a pretty good deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Keep Malo.  Tell those mages to STHU and poop out some more mod rods.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Malo useless because of Mala? /bonk whoever said that.<br />
<br />
When you go on raids in places like ToV, where the mobs are extremely difficult to slow, every little bit of debuff counts. Malo is a gaurenteed debuff on every single NPC there. And believe me, in the long run, that extra &quot;10&quot; debuffed per mob will make the slows that much easier. In addition, with you maloing, Mages can focus on more important things such as mod rods, nuking, and CoHing.<br />
<br />
Keep it! It's way too rare and useful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Keep it.. malo is godly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">...  47) Get your spells when you can. Don't quibble over small amounts of plat, especially when dealing with key spells like Cann IV, torpor, malo (although Cann IV isn't that rare, it really kicks Cann III in the ass). All other spells, including Bane of Nife and Pox of Bert, qualify as nice to have, but not key. Plat is replenishable,finding rare spells for sale isn't so easy. Don't miss your opportunities. <br />

Pox was 7.5k. Torpor was free gift from my good buddy the emporer :D Still need malo though, and i will prob solo emp to get it if i can ever pull myself out of the bazaar heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Malo is basically non-existent for sale on Xev. (I get bored whacking things and turn on auction channel)<br />
<br />
As much time as I have spent in Crypt (an a55 - load) I have seen Malo - ONCE - and ONLY ONCE.<br />
<br />
The Shaman was offered 50 k the next day and turned it down.<br />
<br />
Course what do I know - thought Malo and Mala stacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Oh sweet jebus! Don't even let them BEGIN to think that they're right on that score.  Here's why.   More than one reason so read on if you think I'm crazy.<br />
<br />
Mages are weak and puny and scared.  Almost all of them in my experience will not cast mala until the last possible second.  Often not even till after malo is cast.  Low aggro? They don't necessarily care.<br />
<br />
To be fair, mages die easy.  To be realistic, mala isn't gonna get anyone killed.  But try getting that into the head of someone who has gone 50 or 60 levels doing two things: staying the HELL out of danger because he's a caster with garbage for armor and pitiful hitpoints AND IS THE ONLY PURE CASTER WITH NO ROOT, and ramping up his ego on DD blasts so he can crow about all the damage he did while saving up mana for it because he's doing nothing else.<br />
<br />
I've seen huge arguments on the tiniest expenditures of mana from mages, since they want to rain spell and blast everything whenever possible, yet still want to suffer no consequences for anything they do.  In short, the lamers among them are thinking DD full bore, and frankly have no desire to risk anything.  It's often not, does the raid succeed, but -- Do I shine?  Especially if there's a shaman around or an enchanter around to do the dying for them.<br />
<br />
Ok, YOUR guild mages never shy from casting mala when needed. Never.  Ever.  Mine either.  Ok, so we're agreed?  I'd also like to mention that I happen myself to be not only admirable but perfect.  Now that that's settled, let's move on.<br />
<br />
Anyone with real solid experience in the reasonably high end game or anywhere close knows how razor-thin margins can be.  And has plenty of personally disturbing memories of how long the corpse recoveries can be -- you know, the kind of memories you fear will somehow pass into your sperm and warp the minds of your future children.  Mala is ONLY a bit less debuff than malo?  Means little to nothing?<br />
<br />
Baloney.  It means EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
So much so that you shouldn't even be buying malo yourself -- your guild should be buying it for you.  It does a LOT less for you than it ever will for your guild, by a mile.  You need it for very few experience mobs, but they need it for almost EVERY mob they raid, whether the mob can be slowed or not.  <br />
<br />
Any shaman with malo is a god-send to his guild.  Malo vaults them to an entirely different level.  Malosini?  It is to laugh.  Often can't stick without malo. <br />
<br />
Malo is a very low aggro spell, but the horrible thing about it is that it costs both time and mana both.  It brings the shaman into aggro range and keeps him there.  While chanters are playing chicken with tashani cuz they don't want to die(or heroically doing tashani and THEN dying) and your bards are or are not playing occlusion of sound(and many raids for many guilds don't even have a bard who can do that), your shaman is out there heroically burning mana on malo and then possibly malosini while right in the mob's face and then compounding his troubles by casting slow(or, god forbid, plague of insects).  Meanwhile, the clerics are concentrating on the warrior tanking the mob.  Shamans have torpor right?  So they never die....?  Mmm hmmm.  Sure.  <br />
<br />
Maybe the only needs to cast slow once to make slow work, or he needs to cast it three times and then dies.  Who knows or cares?  The shaman's job is to die when necessary to get the slow in.  And we die a LOT.<br />
<br />
If your guild needs mobs slowed NOW and doesn't want to have to be held hostage to both the courage of mages and the courage AND survival of chanters, a lot of responsibility and a lot of death is going to fall on the head of the shaman.  Unless a monk or SK dies on the pull, the shaman will almost always die more than anyone in the raid on slowable mobs unless your clerics suck or you just don't have enough of them.   Your shaman will play an incredible role in raids on slowable mobs with both malo and slow.<br />
<br />
Does he DESERVE malo?  Hell yes, if your guild deserves malo, that is.  Does your guild NEED malo?  Even if you have 800 copies of mala?  Try a few tough mobs and get back to me.<br />
<br />
I know a guy who auctioned for malo for like four months.  It was almost as pitiful as my auctioning for torpor.  You should have seen the prices he was talking about!!  Certain things don't really have a price, though, do they?  Or should they?  Frankly, if you need something and it costs 10x more than it should to buy it but it's your only chance, what do you do?  Probably buy it no matter what the consequences, or be happy living forever without.  A shaman without malo sucks compared to one he does for raids.  You WILL be notably less valuable without it to any guild or any raid.  Brutal fact, but that's it.<br />
<br />
If you ever get it, do not even dream of ditching it for any price.  Not even 10x what it's worth.  There are literally people who quit the game because they can't get key rare spells like this one.  They're not necessarily quitters by nature.  Would you quit the game for lack of a fungi?  A rune etched icewurm fang? 20 fangs?  Money is worthless sometimes.  You will never be the shaman you want to be without your key spell, and malo and focus are the KEY raid and guild spells for a shaman.  (Torpor being the key solo/group spell -- focus is right up there too, but 1000x easier to get than torpor.)</div></div><hr />
