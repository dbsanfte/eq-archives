<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am reading the boards, and a thought popped into my head that just won't leave, unless I post it. <br />
<br />
If the following were an real offer by SOE, would you do it?<br />
<br />
'Hi folks! We have read all your feedback on Shaman problems, and you know what? Dammit you are right. We wrecked your class, and have decided to eliminate it. At the same time, we are going to off Berserkers, cuz we just can't get it right. You will have the following options the next time you log on<br />
<br />
Your shaman will become one of the following classes, of the same level and AAs, with equivalent gear. (E.g. if you have an ornate bp, it will become the bp of the new class, if you have an epic, it will become the epic of the new class)<br />
<br />
Choose:<br />
A) Beastlord<br />
B) Enchanter<br />
C) Cleric<br />
D) Berserker (which will immediately be deleted by us)<br />
<br />
For berserkers, you may choose any other class, because dang it all, we just feel real bad for tricking you into playing this. <br />
<br />
We may bring back Shaman some time in the future, when everyone has forgotten what a mess we made, and can bundle it with a new expansionl<br />
<br />
All our love<br />
<br />
SOE guys'<br />
<br />
<br />
ok, a bit tongue in cheek there, but if such an offer was truly made to convert your shaman, would you do it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">D), so i could use that offer to turn myself back into a monk, so i can really really feal a SoE nerf, beucase i know that class would be deleted soon, and i could go class hoping again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...to convert your shaman, would you do it?<br />
I did.<br />
<br />
In addition to my Shaman I also have a 52 Cleric, a 53 Warrior, and a 55 Druid, all on seperate accounts. In the past when I multi-boxed all four I felt complete.<br />
<br />
I could buff.<br />
I could heal.<br />
I could melee.<br />
I could nuke.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not a chance. I love playing a shaman and haven't found any class with the same style of play. I'm still not positive about what it is that really makes me enjoy playing Foradce, maybe it's just that fact that I'm always too busy to get bored, or all the little things added together, but no matter what other class I play I always seem to come back to Forad after a day or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I might well go enchanter, given the option.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd go with the hidden option<br />
<br />
Cancel Billing<br />
<br />
I have a 55 Beastlord, and though he has a lot of things to look forward to post 60 I just don't enjoy the play style of a Beastlord compared to a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Chanter I never tried, never had an interest in playing one either.<br />
<br />
Clerics, too one dimensional. I hate being the main healer as a Shaman even in content where I can keep up with heals easily. I'd make a horrible cleric. ;)<br />
<br />
As much as we have a lot that needs to be worked on, I love the diversity of the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Given the scenario above, if this was to actually happen it would be my last day in EQ.  Ive put way to much effort into my Shaman to change classes now.<br />
