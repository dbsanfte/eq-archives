<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You make the call.<br />
<br />
All of our abilities have been trivialized, or given to other classes, or eliminated completely.<br />
<br />
I think SOE has basically decided that the Shaman class HAS to go. They are basically not giving us ANYTHING in ANY area we asked for. Inadequte heals, nukes, DOTs, buffs, debuffs, the list is endless. Not only that, they have given us VERY clearly defined choices to &quot;switch too&quot;, depending on the role we wish to play (since Shaman can play so many roles, and many of us disagree on what our &quot;role&quot; should be in some cases). Lets take a look.<br />
<br />
Want to be a better healer? With some fair debuffs, outside DPS ability, and an outstanding set of buffs and MGBable abilities? <br />
<br />
Druid is for you.<br />
<br />
Want to be a better DPS class? Think your pet sucks, and want him to be &quot;MUCH better&quot;? Like the idea of a &quot;Battle Shaman&quot;? <br />
<br />
Beastlord is your best option.<br />
<br />
Like that debuff thing? You enjoy Crowd Control and the ability to save teh day when &quot;Things Go Bad&quot;? <br />
<br />
Enchanter looks to be a good option for you.<br />
<br />
Want those KILLER DPS DOT? The ability to solo in nearly every situation? The incredible mana-regen? <br />
<br />
Looks like Necro-time. <br />
<br />
The problem SOE has is that cannot possibly up our abilities in ALL these aspects, so they are stuck. If they up heals, the DPS/Debuff people will whine. If they give us better DPS, the Heal people will bitch. If they improve our buffs, they just make us MORE BOTtable than we are now. <br />
<br />
SOE took our list, and then spread that stuff around to other classes. I think they know that most of us would just switch classes (I would) and they will view those that quit as &quot;acceptable losses to establish balance and rip apart the class that has been SCREWING it all up&quot;. <br />
<br />
I hope a developer comes and reads this. I have not seen a post from anyone at SOE here for a LONG time, yet the same issues continue to plague us. Yeah yeah, they are throwing us bones, giving us the ILLUSION of repair, but look at the whole package. For every bone we got tossed, our mirror-ability class got a better one (slow being the exception, but who cares, 70, 65, 60 + mitigation in 30 second fights is a competely irrelevant ratio)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do see where you are comming from, we have abilities from half the other classes out there (or they have abilities from us), and other than slow(barely), we are master of none... that still leaves us with a ton of abilities though... all I think we really need is heals that scale better against druids, and a slightly better dps. <br />
<br />
Give us group Quiesence for 600, and a 2.5k quick heal for 400 (which is certainly not overpowered compaired to higher end mobs these days) so that we can patch heal better, then give us a 1600point version of Velium Strike, and a 1300 point version of spear.<br />
<br />
Those would not be huge upgrades, but they would allow us to help heal durring AE encounters, patch heal for a noticeable ammount, and when we didn't have that to do, add slightly more dps. I like the fact that I can do a little of everything with my shaman, I just would like my jack of all trades ability set to scale a little better against current content. I get elementals invites enough, but I still have NEVER recieved a GoD invite.</div></div><hr />

TRUE they are not giving us effictive Healing upgrades .<br />
TRUE they are not giving us effective nukeing upgrades .<br />
<br />
However it seems that with GoD some of our Buffs will be meaning full once again , At least if implemented properly .<br />
It allso seems will will have a Group MGBable Heal .<br />
<br />
So we are in my opinion getting SOME of what we asked for .. Its just that .. like allways .. it not in the &quot;Meat and Potato's&quot; areas where we actual NEED clear upgrades .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">However it seems that with GoD some of our Buffs will be meaning full once again , At least if implemented properly .<br />
<br />
<br />
We aren't going to get groups on our (de)buffs. If we're lucky, they'll add 10 to 15% DPS/mitigation/avoidance to what we already have. Hardly a reason to take us over a beastlord or enchanter.<br />
<br />
Some toes will have to be stepped on to make us viable again. I think that the easiest &amp; most consistent path would be through increasing our healing power, so that we could take the MH role again. Clerics &amp; driuds should get some sort of compensation though, so that we're all equally desirable for groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2.5k quick heal seems a bit excessive for &quot;patch&quot; healing. IMO, the new quick heal suggested for OoW at present looks sufficient, albeit with perhaps a reduced mana cost, and would rather see 3.25 or 3.5 cast time than 3.75. heal over time, 600/tick sounds like plenty, especially given the &quot;healing boon&quot; aa we may well be receiving shortly.<br />
<br />
so are those enough to get us a group by themselves? of course not.<br />
<br />
however...when you factor in the debuffs, buffs, slightly improved nukes with further nuke aa, and the fact that we will be getting a better pet than we have had, i suspect we will be perceived as a MUCH more attractive prospect for groups. especially with the new Call of the Wild aa coming soon.<br />
<br />
given the changes on the horizon, i think that all we need are mana cost reduction and slightly improved cast time for the OoW quick heal, as well as improved dot aggro situation in order to be a very attractive addition to a group.<br />
<br />
the solution to a lot of the high-speed encounter issues may well not even be putting is in a situation where we are looked at to be the 2nd healer. we may find people choosing to group us with druids AND clerics as a debuff/buff/heal support/nuke or dot person, where we will be allowed to fully use our abilities. <br />
<br />
i have done this a couple times, and have gotten awesome response from people in the groups.<br />
<br />
additionally, with enchanters viewed a lot in high end game as effectively a dps person due to charm pets, a six person group that looks like say warrior, rogue, enc, sham, druid, cleric suddenly looks a lot more attractive. the overall stackability of priest classes improves a lot as the changes we see become implemented.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
by the way...yes, i did mention the pet as a perceived new feature. while i recognize that Necro, Mage, and Beastlord pets will be substantially better, the 30-40 second fights in new content will mean that all possible offense contributed help significantly, and if we are able to keep champion loaded for the melee in group, it will also add a nice boost to our pets' dps in high end content. the 10% add, assuming 65 dmg max per hit (sounds like a good round number for the sake of estimating) will scale up to over 70, with the atk and str buffs stacking to effectively add +280 atk to the pet, which means both his accuracy and the avg dmg of his hits will be very high.<br />
<br />
<br />
on top of all that, tell me that when you are facing a mini you wouldn't want someone with advanced spirit call 2, healing boon, the standard pet, debuffs (if unslowable, annul still helps reduce attack time on a lot of these self buffing mobs), champion, AND a 3rd healer all coming from one person? if we are going to comment continually on the frustrations we have with mobs that are unslowable or heavily mitigate slows, we have to also acknowledge that that has an impact on beastlords. sooo...w/o slow, beastlords are paragon and dps. on an unslowable mob, we can throw a heal over time on the MT (letting druid and cleric, or two druids or two clerics as it may be) focus on direct heals while we then malos the mini, have our pet engage, use adv spirit call, and either throw on a 30 second DoT, or a few nukes. this, of course, all occurs *after* we have put a fresh Champion on the MT, as well as maintaining it on any monks, rogues, rangers, or say...enc pets that we may have with us.<br />
<br />
<br />
bst can replace us as slowers in some content, but on unslowable mobs they are not even competition for the same slot. yes, they are better sustainable dps. but they can't replace us as buffers (the gap widens with the new expansion coming), they can't replace us as support healers (2nd or 3rd healer positions), and while they are better dps than us for sure, our dps is closer to theirs than their heals are to ours.<br />
<br />
enc? also can replace us as debuffers. and their dps is very high with charmed pets. but...again, this moves them, like beastlords, into competition with DPS classes more than having them remain in competition with us.<br />
<br />
i have been in a LOT of groups lately with encs, and am finding our ability to coexist is improving as roles change with the new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">However it seems that with GoD some of our Buffs will be meaning full once again , At least if implemented properly.<br />
<br />
but [beastlords] can't replace us as buffers (the gap widens with the new expansion coming)<br />
<br />
You're joking right?<br />
<br />
Which of these two lines would you pick?<br />
<br />
10 mana/tick................................................10% damage modifier<br />
Increase ATK by 239......................................170 ATK<br />
Increase All Resists by 65.............OR...............7% chance to avoid melee<br />
Increase Max HP by 793..................................680 Max HP<br />
<br />
Just remember that a 10% damage modifier is not a +10% dps increase.  And a 7% chance to avoid melee won't translate into 7% as well.  The fact that I'm comparing our hybrid's buff line to ours and I'm sitting here scratching my head because I'm not entirely sure which one I would prefer depresses the hell out of me.  I don't care that our hybrid can't maintain buffs like these on a full raid because of mana.  The fact that they have an equal or better line than us is just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't stop there.<br />
<br />
Rangers buff nearly as much as atk as us and they can do it with a mgb'able spell.  Paladins buff way more hp than us.  An enchanter can buff one third of the atk we can, give melee 70% haste and a cleave affect - all in one spell.  By the way, that spell lasts for 42 minutes, not 6.5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The buffs in OoW bring us up to par with our hybrid, but they most assuredly do not make our buffs as meaningful as you would seem to think.  And they sure as hell do not make us the king of buffs.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is this.<br />
-We need a long lasting, group Avatar, that not only has a 10% damage modifier, but also has additional affects like endurance regen and ferocity.  The name on this spell is Champion.  Previous spells were named Avatar.  Make it live up to the name.  Failing that, they need to upgrade the BST Avatar with a 10% damage mod, make it a long lasting group spell, and then trade Avatars with us.<br />
-We need effects like shielding or stun resist on focus.  As it stands now, the only reason you'll take focus is for the measly 680 hp on it.  When melee prefer to use a clicky shield effect over focus, baby shaman weep.<br />
-We need an upgrade to bih li; 63% run speed (just under SoE) with either 30-50 attack on it or strikethrough/accuracy.<br />
-We're one of only a handful of classes without a self-buff.  SoE needs to upgrade our damn bear spell.<br />
-Add a cleave affect to Ancestral Aid, so that it not only heals our group's hp and endurance, but also lets the melee rain down critical hits.<br />
-Not only do druids add more healing and dps, but you just cut the difference in damage modifiers between our class and our twin to just 5% with their strength buff.  It's a slap in the face considering that the rest of our buffs are so lackluster.<br />
<br />
Even with all this, we won't be the king of buffing anymore.  SoE has dilluted the potency of shaman buffs to the point that nobody would care if they had them around on a raid.  In an era when tanks have 11k+ hp, 680 more matters very little.  When melee have max atk, 140 more won't matter all that much more.  And given that this is all we really have to offer in the buffing realm on raids, what does that say?  Do you really think a 10% damage mod - which I repeat, will not be +10% dps - or a 7% melee avoidance buff will make up for our inadaquacies?  No, it won't.  <br />
<br />
We are not making up lost ground in this expansion on buffing because everybody else is running faster than us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only see that AA being useful on raids myself. I don't see it doing a thing to solve single group exp issues. Remember, Druids apparently get it also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for online friends, I think shaman would be done as a class.  We are simply no longer needed.<br />
<br />
We are easily replaced by beastlords or a couple of bots.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman, it is the only class I have played the almost 6 years I have been in EQ.  I hate seeing  what Sony is doing to the class and not being able to do anything about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I... all I think we really need is heals that scale better against druids, and a slightly better dps. <br />
This is a large part of my point. We have been moaning about what we &quot;need&quot; endlessly for months and gotten VERY little in return. Mostly, just morsels to try and shut us up. <br />
TRUE they are not giving us effictive Healing upgrades .<br />
TRUE they are not giving us effective nukeing upgrades .<br />

<br />

Window dressing. Our best buff remains Focus, which is fully BOTable with its long duration. We need meat and potatos to survive. Shrimp Cocktail is good, and all, but I want Steak and a Big Baker, know what I mean?<br />
Some toes will have to be stepped on to make us viable again. I think that the easiest &amp; most consistent path would be through increasing our healing power, so that we could take the MH role again. Clerics &amp; driuds should get some sort of compensation though, so that we're all equally desirable for groups.<br />
This is very true, (except the &quot;druids need&quot; part) but in the end, we all know SOE just isnt going to give us anything to risk having a class as powerful as we once were. Face it, if we could Main Heal in cutting edge content, there is NO REASON to have a cleric, other than MAYBE to rez. <br />
<br />
SOE is basically keeping us one-step behind everyone else in all our abilities (except slow, which I discussed in the initial post). Kings of trivial content, though, extremely powerful, no question about it, just not being balanced against current content along with everyone else. The healing gap gets bigger and bigger when using their &quot;Percentage&quot; thing (note, how the slowing gap gets smaller and smaller at the same time through mitigation and shorter fights). We are outbuffed by almost every class, including our hybrid. We are out DPSed by EVERY SINGLE CLASS in the game (but of course, not on paper, where you can have 2K a tic in DOTs running), almost every debuff in the game becomes less and less important as the fights get shorter and shorter. <br />
<br />
The world or EQ has changed, and SOE is obvioulsy NOT going to change Shaman to fit into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SOE openly declared that they woulndt address class balance issues with expansions, the sad fact that oow is looking to be every single bit as fubared as god was and that soe couldnt possibly do anything at this point to convince me that they give even the slightest tinyest crap about this class is why I hit end billing, my 65 shaman and 65 chanter and 50+ rogue are done, as are several other accounts friends and I were paying for to have a pocket res'r around and things like that.</div></div><hr />

i have been in a LOT of groups lately with encs, and am finding our ability to coexist is improving as roles change with the new content.<br />
One thing that I see a lot of people assuming is AA making up for shortcomings. Out of the box, freshly dinged 65 or 70 a beastlord with no AA vs a shaman with no AA which would you choose? I will even let you assume that they have all spells, epic, similar bazaar gear, with a smattering of LDON purchased items...straight up the beastlord is more useful for single group encounters, even vs unslowable mobs.<br />
A beasties DPS is far more useful than a out of the box 1600ish point heal from a given focused shaman blast, its likely that it will sway the fight enough that they the given healers, be it druid or cleric, will be sufficient (granted in GoD your having to think outa the box on this one, but given levle 70 with OoW I am betting this will change). Now give said shaman Advanced Spirit Call AA at full ranks...does that make his ability to give a good DPS burst go up? Sure, when he can activate that AA. The beastlord can always have his pet up in single group encounters and it provides more DPS than our dog dogs.<br />
Your really fooling yourself if you think that advanced spirit call (15 min timer yes?) is as useful as a beastlord in your group. I will admit Malos does help with nukes landing, but thats not as big a deal as anything else a beastlord can do...Now as far as enchanters go, sure our roles rarely overwrite each other these days, 99% of the chanters I know HATE to slow, and would rather take a beating than be the main slower in a group. That leaves them free for a DPS role, CC, etc<br />
Our buffs in OoW are nice upgrades to what we have now..thing is that OTHER classes are getting upgrades to what they have now too, making our big leaps in buffing ability actually just a keeping up with the Jonses movement.<br />
Making Focus more useful...either by adding a few resists (+20 to MR, PR, DR wouldnt be unreasonable and be marginally useful) or by adding Strikethrough, Stun Resist, Shielding (my personal wish) or even Cleave would make it a buff that would make people go &quot;WOW, nice buff man&quot; instead of &quot;Ho Hum, Focus plz&quot;.<br />
As for other things to our buff line...Champion as it stands now will be just another Albatross to hand us and make us pack around, sure its got some nice spiffy stats (useless) and adds some nice atk (if your tanks/DPS people are at or near the atk cap ~2k it adds near no DPS) and has that 10% damage mod (meaning if you hit for 60 it actually gets calculated to 66). Sorry, making me cast that every 10 min or so isnt going to make me or any melee I know all that happy. Most of the DPS people I group with already tell me to hold FA they dont need it.<br />
Blast heals? Making a &quot;fix&quot; to our current state by making Cannibalize upgrades Ancient is sorta like sticking a silk shirt on a pig...looks pretty until you realize that you got sweaty and muddy for no good ****ing reason. Necro hit point to mana lines have been consistantly upgraded every expansion while we got a nice AA with LUCLIN for gods sake and are stuck using Cann 4 for VERY small returns on our effort...my mana pool is nearly 5k (right at it with KEI/VoQ) and I am by NO means uber, Cann 4 is TORTURE and I think its time to change SOE's attitude of continually saying and acting like were fine as frog hair...were not.<br />
OoW is promised as some sort of Christmas for a lot of classes, and I hope to GOD when it comes out that it really is, cause I am really tired of getting spoon fed crap.</div></div><hr />

Assuming the current state of OoW spells and AAs is close to final...<br />
<br />
We asked for buffs beyond stat buffs. We got them.<br />
<br />
We asked for group avatar. We got it.<br />
<br />
We asked for fixed duration invis. Looks like we may get it.<br />
<br />
We asked for a mgb hot. We got it with gravy.<br />
<br />
We didn't ask for res. We got it.<br />
<br />
We get a cannibalize spell that is over 4x as powerful as the current one. Plus a neat new ability to cast from our hp pools.<br />
<br />
We asked for fast and mr-based dots. We got them.<br />
<br />
So, apart from healing, which still seems to be a few hundred points out of touch with reality, what exactly is missing from this picture?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I did not.  I asked for buffs that don't rely on stats.  The majority of us did.  So friggin what if staminia can be &quot;overbuffed&quot; by 40 or something.  Its shown that sta gives dimishing returns past a certain point. <br />
<br />
We asked for group avatar. We got it.<br />
<br />
I asked for group avatar sure.  Got me there.  With its useless 140 to stats once again, and its lame 6.5 min duration.  Half the rangers in my guild won't even take it now.  Replace str with 10% increased DAMAGE not a modifier.  Replace agility with 10% increased DODGE not avoidance, and replace dexterity with +10 to combat effects.  Then you're talking about something I asked for.<br />
<br />
We asked for fixed duration invis. Looks like we may get it.<br />
<br />
Who cares.  <br />
<br />
We asked for a mgb hot. We got it with gravy.<br />
<br />
I must admit, thats the single one thing I'm excited about.  <br />
<br />
We didn't ask for res. We got it.<br />
<br />
You're right, we didn't ask for rez.  We asked to do what we used to do.  We asked to be priests who could keep someone alive.  We asked for the 80% of our 60-65 that are now useless to be useful.<br />
<br />
We get a cannibalize spell that is over 4x as powerful as the current one. Plus a neat new ability to cast from our hp pools.<br />
<br />
Two issues here.  A)  Canni. Yeah, that will help.  Only.. I'm confused.. is mana an issue for us?  Not for me.  For me, the tank usually dies before I run out of mana:) And B)  Our heal.  Give me a break.  Our new heal still is less than a druids old pop heal.  We still are the worst healer, and our debuffing line has continually been nerfed.  Everything mitigates now, if not immune.  Our fast heal is still WAY off.<br />
<br />
We asked for fast and mr-based dots. We got them.<br />
<br />
I didn't ask for dots.  As a matter of fact, I believe that many of us would like to see all our damn dots go away.  I'll trade ya 2 poison dots, and 2 disease dots for a pop lvl druid nuke:)  I'll keep curse though, its SOMETIMES does its full dmg when I'm in a weak group.<br />
<br />
So, apart from healing, which still seems to be a few hundred points out of touch with reality, what exactly is missing from this picture?<br />

<br />
By buffs beyond stats, i meant buffs with effects rather than stats. Thought it was clear. <br />
<br />
I'll reserve judgement on the damage and avoidance mods until i can see some parses. Having been fed stat buffs for years, i'm pretty happy to see something new though. <br />
<br />
Stam buff is nice. It adds hps and endurance. I don't hate the fact it goes over the cap either.<br />
<br />
I don't believe a 140 raw attk, + 10% damage mod group buff is crap, even if it only lasts 10 mins.<br />
<br />
Fixed duration invis is great. Sorry you can't see it.<br />
<br />
I don't get your point about the res AA. To me this looks a decent skill.<br />
<br />
The point about the bigger canni and casting from hps to me seems to be that it will free you from having to chain cann4 in betweeen cann5 refreshes, allowing you to cast other spells! Not having to wince 10 times a minute to me is a good upgrade.<br />
<br />
In case you missed it, we've always had powerful dots and weaker nukes. (Please don't quote me the &quot;well at level 42 we can outnuke druids&quot; bs.)<br />
<br />
Now think about what you are asking for... you want bigger nukes and bigger heals. You really think that SoE is going to make a chain wearing, slow casting, resist debuffing, hot healing, haste buffing, dotter with a pet better at being a druid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Right Darjeeling. Too bad you're clueless.<br />
<br />
We get the buffs allright. AFTER every other class gets them. And our buffs last for less time, take 3 times longer to cast and more mana. A &quot;good change&quot; indeed, my butt. We get outperformed even by our redheaded stepchild class BST.<br />
<br />
Bah, I don't feel like typing in all the mess you posted here, read yourself up there. Someone posted a small list of choices up in this topic, and frankly, having also melee chars, I would have taken the left column instead of the right one, at ANY moment. Too bad for shamans, the right column is a shaman one. Too bad to me as a shaman, that right column doesn't get me groups even in GoD, what's there to say about upcoming OoW.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I made myself a BST class and am working my way up. No PL'ing, I level him the 'usual way', may not be as fast, but sure works OK. I already can say that from all the classes I have played, BST works best. And if things with OoW wont get changed before release, there's a good chance that I'll retire my shaman as useless class and will play BST instead. BST as a class has future, SHM is becoming useless.<br />
<br />
EDIT: yeah, forgot to add - I am STILL WAITING to see what OoW will bring, like 80-year old single virgin woman is still waiting for his prince on the white horse, but similarly, I don't have too high hopes. But there are still few days until it's release, so I'll wait. I will see what spells we get, what AA's we get, how and from where we'll get the spells.</div></div><hr />

Darjeeling, you are helping me prove my point by showing us all the little tiny perks and bones SOE is tossing us, so they can point and say &quot;You got THIS, and THAT&quot; instead of dealing with out BASELINE NEEDS, more Healing or more DPS, period.<br />
<br />
Even your list is totally suspect. There are a few nice things there. The MGBable thing, the rez, but there are some that just plain suck. The MR DoT for example. Our current one is 420 base damage per tic. The Necro version is 430 base. Thats like a 2.5% difference. The OoW versions, however, and a bit farther apart. Ours 546, theirs 670, or over 20% difference. See the problem? They point at our Heals and the &quot;Ratio&quot; over and over, yet they COMPLETLEY hose any existing ratios whenever they feel like it. <br />
<br />
Canni, fixed duration invis, over-cap stats, these are all just candy. No substance, no meat. +Melee skills on buffs, MGBable HoT, rez, those are real, but the impact is yet to be determined. However, I am pretty darn sure they arent going to replace a 2K fast heal or a 1500 damage fast nuke. Without one or the other of these, I do not think we have gained any ground from where we are.<br />
<br />
Still waiting though. Balancing and true Beta testing begin the day OoW goes live. Adjustments WILL be made. Lets just see if any go our way, or if we get the status quo &quot;You got Slow . . .&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks for agreeing there a few &quot;nice&quot; things. Guess that means you changed your mind about SoE trying to &quot;eliminate&quot; the shaman class.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Even if i agreed the proposed spells and AAs were &quot;candy&quot;, which i don't, there's far more on the table than we've had in most expansions... even the one's we were supposed gods in. And don't forget shamans on the crucible still moaned and whined then too.<br />
<br />
For Dots, i'm fine with necros pulling ahead with dots. I'd like dot aggro addressed. But even if they don't then i'm fine with geting a 3k dot in 30 secs and a 3k dot in 42 secs.<br />
<br />
For healing, i'd prefer to be closer to druids. I think the ~700 pt gap is too large.<br />
<br />
For the rest, well it's not earth shattering, but it's a pretty decent step up from being able to buff stats to max. Which is more than i had expected.<br />
<br />
And i forgot to mention the aoe slow with a -100 MR. That's a great spell.</div></div><hr />

If the -100 resist check is going to go live, I will stop posting on the Crucible(talk about an incentive for Sony :D. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Even if SOE would add AoE slow with -100 MR checks for shamans, then that 'area of effect' would most likely still cover only 4 mobs. See, the shaman 'area' in SOE's eyes should be much smaller then the 'area' for other classes. Or maybe the SOE will think that -100 MR and Slow and Canni is too big of a boon to us and reduce the amount of targets to two. And then claim about the big improvement.</div></div><hr />

The entire concept is being made tounge-in-cheek, Dar, and everyone knows it. But I think there is some REAL basis for the developers to discourage people from choosing shaman, or forcing shamans into other classes. <br />
<br />
So far, the changes are encouraging. Even before, when they upped the HoT and Regen numbers, I was encouraged. But overall, I STILL see us sitting WAY WAY behind in the two areas that MOSTshamans are concerned with, Healing and/or DPS.<br />
<br />
Oh and I didnt quote it, but I disagree with your Necro opinion. I dont mind being behind them either, I dont even mind being a little more behind than we are now, but from 3% to 23% is a HUGE jump. Make it 10-12% and I will shut up. Make ours 610 if theres is 670. <br />
<br />
Overall, the little things do add up to a plus. Saddly though, there are a BUNCH of little things that seem to off-set a lot of the pluses, which is why I stick to my original statement that we havent really &quot;caught back up&quot; at all. Appetizers and Salad are great, but I want my steak and potatoes now please.</div></div><hr />

First off, welcome back to the Crucible Darjeeling.  I don't recall you posting for some time.  The so called &quot;fools&quot; who &quot;scream&quot; and &quot;whine&quot; on these boards have been exposed to information showing that their class has dropped off in it's usefullness.  Weither or not they have all read it or not is debatable.  It's clear though that specialists are particularly desired in ideal groups for challenging current content.<br />
<br />
The only thing shaman are suppossed to be the leaders of is slowing and mitigation has taken an overly harsh chunk of our effectiveness out of the game.  Mitigation is good, but it's application to trash mobs is a little heavy handed.  SO much so that when the shaman community ran the numbers when GoD first came out, we came to the conclusion that a cleric healing mitigates damage more effectivly than a shaman's slow spell due to short fight durations and the all to frequent presence of mitigating trash mobs.  This pretty much limits the usefullness of our primary ability.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, our abilites fall behind other classes, so we compare our skills to these classes and find wider and wider gaps.  We fall further behind necros for DoTs, druids for healing, even clerics and rangers (no way a hybrid should nuke for more than a caster class) for DD, our buffs are falling off as well and are arguably not worth the mana.  SoE seems to insist that we lead in buffing stats, but the community has proven time and again that stat buffs have diminishing returns that are pointless once the recipient has maxxed their own stats with gear.  Rumour has it that this ability to buff beyond the cap in OoW is even further diminished (there's a thread somewhere in this forum that gives numbers, if your interested, I recommend the search feature).  One can make the argument that having a shaman doesn't really do anything for the party if they can get druid, BL, bard or another cleric.<br />
<br />
I'm sure most of this is apparent to you, if so, I'm not sure why you've sided with the SOE fanboy club.  I don't think anyone with half a brain thinks that shaman are useless, but the current content has put the class in a spot where shaman are competing for groups based on our weaknesses (fast fights) against the strengths of other classes (burst mitigation and burst DPS).  To be honest, the only real function in this content is for shaman to round out groups,  but shaman are not as appealing for more ideal or structured groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  I'm not saying that our improvements are not upgrade.  I guess what I'm saying is, our improvements are about 1 expansion behind.  Our oow improvements are what we should have had in PoP, perhaps toned down a bit, but close.<br />
<br />
And, unfortunately, the content we now play in (GoD for me mainly) is skewed to favor fast healing, and fast damage.  Our spell line, while improved, doesn't change our class to meet this new content.   <br />
<br />
For the rest, well it's not earth shattering, but it's a pretty decent step up from being able to buff stats to max. Which is more than i had expected.<br />
<br />
Guess we just have different expectation levels.  With the top 10 lists, dialogue with developers, etc.., I guess I hoped for something more in the line with a role change, moving us away from a spell set with long battles in mind.<br />
<br />
 don't believe a 140 raw attk, + 10% damage mod group buff is crap, even if it only lasts 10 mins.<br />
<br />
I do.  See the duration of a rangers atk buff, and the greater values of the bst buff.  <br />
<br />
Why is EVERY ability we have done better by another class?  We slow 5% more than a enc.  That is literally the ONLY thing we do better than another class.  <br />
<br />
But I agree.  I'll have to see some parses of the combined buff set we are given before I call it total crap.  But sure seems like tiny bumps here and there to a spell set that still isn't designed to handle GoD content.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Darjeeling, good to see some sensibilities on this board.<br />
<br />
How many of you play other classes? How many of you read other class boards? Get out and see the world from a different perspective and you will see all classes are equally as 'useless' as shamans.<br />
<br />
They didnt nerf Shamen they introduced a ****up with GoD. 3/4 classes have been seriously impacted by GoD, and even then thats just at the extreme high end of the game. They're releasing the other half of the GoD expansion to fix things and you guys are still whining. Guess what, the problem isnt SOE, it's you.<br />
<br />
I've played EQ 5 years and if I paid any attention to the whining on all the class boards I qould have quit years ago. Instead I'm still enjoying myself playing all the so called 'gimped' classes that every class seems to think they have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tarru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">the whole give and take in this thread about the so called fixes to our class in the upcoming expansion is kind of silly the top 10 list was what needed fixed before the new expansion to make us useful in the content that was already out and being played. the things we are getting in OoW are nice ... well some of them are but they are still an expansion or so late so in the end we will be the same amount behind.<br />
<br />
the problem as i see it is that we should not have to pay to get our class fixed and playable in the current game and this is what SoE has done they took some of our sugestions on what we wanted to see done to make our class more playable and created OoW to up their sales so the sheep can look at it and say &quot;look they are giving us most of what we have been asking for&quot;.<br />
<br />
as much as i have loved playing my shaman from 1-65 the joy has now left after 65. grinding another 5 levels and finding spells for those levels not to mention focus items for those spells just to be the same amount behind is not something i want to do. and rerolling another toon is way out of the question if im going to have to start over it will be in a new game and after playing WoW over the weekend on the stress test that looks like a good idea. WoW may have the same problems as EQ and it may turn out to be as bad or worse but i would rather put my faith into something new that has a chance of being better than keep it with SoE who has shown time and time again that they only care about the cash and not one bit about their players.</div></div><hr />

I see, so it must be my complete imagination that all my abilities have been marginalized, trivialized, or made completely obsolete by the direction the GAME has taken. <br />
<br />
I realize there is a lot of whining here, I have even commented on it. I have done some whining myself, as well (this thread, for example). I suppose there will always be people who just take what they get and say &quot;Thank you sir, may I have another&quot;, but I am not gonna be one. <br />
<br />
Are we healers? Barely. This is the most glaring, and ridiculous, problem we have. I see a glimmer of hope on the horizon though, but that means changing our Ancient and making that heal a &quot;normal&quot; spell. <br />
<br />
Are we a DPS class? Big no. Our best DOT went from 2.5% less than a Necro to 22% lower. Our best nuke in OoW isnt even as good as the Ranger Ancient from Gates. Our Ice nukes still take far too long to cast to be reasonably effective. <br />
<br />
Are we buffers? One trick pony (we will see what impact OoW spells, in their final form, has on this though, there is a chance we COULD move up the Buffer list. But we will obviously never be NEAR as powerful in this department as we once were)<br />
<br />
Are we debuffers? I guess this is our forte. Lets see, Malos, Slow, Cripple. The game mechanics have created a situation where our best de-buff has shifted. It used to be Slow. Now, I feel more like a Malos whore than anything else, honestly. I barely use Slow in LDoN Normal. I rarely slow any mobs in Gates trials once we have a charmed pet. I find it disturbing that a druid can heal better vs un-slowed mobs than a shaman can vs FULLY slowable mobs in todays &quot;High-Speed&quot; version of the game. <br />
<br />
So please, all you &quot;Shaman are just fine&quot; people. Define my class for me. Explain why someone should choose me over one of the other classes that does all my day-to-day tasks far better. I agree that Gates hosed a lot of classes, but that doesnt make one single bit of difference in ONE IMPORTANT THING. It hosed mine. They can work on getting themselves adjusted, I will work on fixing myself.  <br />
<br />
There is a common theme running throughout these &quot;whiner&quot; threads though. Its that we are VERY VERY close to being &quot;adequate&quot;, and that the changes we are suggesting to add a bit more utility in todays &quot;version&quot; of EQ are minor, and that the corner IS in sight. It just needs to be turned. We don't need more fancy window-dressing, cutesey-wootsey type crap to clutter up our spell books. We need some substance. A heal that actually makes the MA's hp's jump a bit, a nuke I am not embaressed to cast because a Ranger is dropping BOMBS next to me, and a buff or two that are closer to the TOP of the list than the bottom (Focus is the lowest of the major HPs buffs).<br />
<br />
SOE, however, seems determined to keep us in the &quot;2nd rate class&quot; category, and its a category I am not comfortable in. Maybe thats the problem. Some people are just fine being on the &quot;Drop in the bucket&quot; list. I am not asking to be re-made into a God again, I just don't want to be at the bottom anymore.</div></div><hr />

You're kinda of hipocritical here.  You speak of reason and then you not only generalise badly, but you also slander people without pause.  That's a pretty broad brush stroke for a person who hasn't addressed raised issues in a rational manner.  SoE hasn't hasn't addressed the top 10 list with anything other than &quot;we'll look into it&quot; after they asked the community for the list.  OoW lists look like an improvement, but do not address that list as Tarru has correctly stated.  If you have rationally looked at the class concerns, and you have numbers to rebuke the findings of others, I'd love to see them.  Otherwise you're just trying to provoke more of the mindless senseless back and forth pissing contest that you claim to dislike.<br />
<br />
People get affected by the jump-on-the-bandwagon-omg-the-end-of-the-world-is-nigh mentality pervading these boards.<br />
While it's true that some posters have overstated the issues and are a little zealous, the same can be said of a handfull of &quot;I solo in BoT and shaman rock ... wohoo&quot; shaman.</div></div><hr />

Against anything but nameds, I can be single healer/slower for KT groups. That's another rogue that can join. So what's my dps now? That's all I got to say.. this is a group game.<br />

So, your point is there's a lot of pissed off shaman ... point made.  Might be a reason for it too you know :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
If you meant to make the point that all these guys haven't done their homework than please feel free to use the search feature and back your point up.  Provide counter facts, number parses, whatever, but don't think for a second that you've refuted the argument that shaman have a just case to express concern and that you can dismiss them all as whiners just because there are loads of threads expressing frustration and anger over the mitigation of shaman class abilities.  If anything, you're proving yourself wrong.<br />
<br />
Just to help you out a bit, here are the results of a quick search showing well stated cases for the shaman class, some numbers, a graph or 3 and well ... you read and digest it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">All my links were from the front page. You had to search yours. My point is the hysteria being spouted is emabarassing, has nothing to do with actual in-game experience, and makes this board a joke to read. <br />
<br />
Most of the people jumping on the shaman-is-dead bandwagon are doing it not because of anything that happens in game, but because of what they read on this board.<br />
<br />
Your links are acknowledged, i've read most of them before. <br />
<br />
For the record, as i posted earlier, i'd like to see the fast blast heal upped a couple of hundred points, and, as i posted separately some time ago, a new 3k 10-sec heal.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see dot aggro fixed, so we could do more than 100 dps on bosses if we wanted to and not get squished for it.<br />
<br />
Does this mean i think SoE is trying to eliminate shamans, or that the class is dead, or that the end of world is at hand and i better kill myself now, omg omg -- well you be the judge.<br />
<br />
In fact, as i posted earlier, i can see some pretty good things in the OoW line-up and i'm far more optimistic about this expansion than i was before velious, luclin, or pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">All my links were from the front page. You had to search yours.<br />
And this is a huge part of the problem and largely the reason for all the easy to find threads you linked, that is that shaman have coughed up numbers, models, well stated cases, and even graphs and most are unsatisfied with the response from SoE.<br />
<br />
I used to get pissed at my cable provider because they gave me service, but very poor quality (they had a monopoloy in my area).  I had to steal a static IP (they had gone DHCP) and I had to enter some names and IPs into my hosts list because their DNS servers were up and down like a toilet seat.  After calling them whenever they went down (or trying to, the line was always busy), I got so mad I called them only when it was working properly and when they'd ask why I called I replied that it meant I had to call less often this way.  After writting in, calling and generally losing my cool, I moved and got a better provider in the process.  EQ is the same way.  They have a monopoly because they have your friends, and they have your character you worked on for 5 years.  Bitching and moaning is good for releasing stress and trying to get value from your service fees.<br />
<br />
The more frequent threads you linked to are a symptom of poor customer relations with SoE, not stupid shaman.  While I agree that it's getting out of hand and that some people are being too emotional, I see it as a natural progression of the frustration with a poor performing service provider.  I'm glad you're more optimistic about OoW.  I'm happy they delayed the delivery.  All said though, I won't consider returning to EQ or any other SoE product until they address the top 10 list to my satisfaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I do, you don't even need to play a shaman to see the problems.  Just look at the numbers.  And I'm not even talking about parses.  Just look at the spell numbers. <br />
<br />
With PoP, we had weakest direct heal, weakest hp buff, weakest caster nuke, buffs that were irrelevant due to stats, and dots roughly on par with necro's, although, the dots rarely ran their full duration.  <br />
<br />
With Oow, go ahead and read Blazz's comments above for some examples of what many of us consider ludicrous (like ranger nukes being bigger than ours).  But forget all that for a second. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is this:<br />
<br />
1.  Of the two competing priest classes, we used to have ONE advantage.  Slow.  That advantage was directly nerfed by content changes.<br />
2.  Every ability we provide can be provided better by another class, with the exception of slow, which has been nerfed by mitigation and immunities being more and more common.</div></div><hr />

I can only disagree with one of your points, and that is that Shaman cannot be effective healers in &quot;much&quot; of the content. This is simply not the case. It is ONLY this newer content that Shamans healing effectiveness is severly limited. I can still effectively do my duties (Malos, Slow, Heal group) in 90% of the games content, even in XP groups in the EPs. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Solutions: Once again, I will say how I feel. A slight bump to our fastest heal and nuke (a 1600-1800 fast heal, a 1K fast nuke) and I think we will be effective again. IF, and I say this with some reservation, IF they are going to change BoT to 460 a tic, that would be wonderful, and added the changes I have suggested, it would make us &quot;whole&quot; again.  <br />
<br />

Of course. I have never been a HUGE &quot;Shaman are DEAD&quot; kind of guy. I told you the original post on this thread was made with some &quot;tounge in cheek&quot; humor intended. <br />
<br />
I have continued to hold to the ideal that we are THIS (holds fingers less than 2 cm apart) close to being &quot;VERY solid&quot; again. I felt we needed an 1800 fast heal in Gates, and now a 2K one in OoW. I felt we needed a 1K nuke in Gate, and a 1200 one now. <br />
<br />
There is no denying that Shaman are well rounded, and efficient in much of the games content. I finally got KT flagged, and I was in a group last night, and I was pleased to see that many mobs didnt mitigate slow. The fights were still pretty short, and our group was just &quot;average&quot;, but still, I was able to Malos, Slow, HoT the MA, and get a couple tic on Bane or a SoT in before most mobs died (not the blues, of course, they dropped like rocks). With the new Gates slow and HoT its quite possible I could become &quot;sole healer&quot; in much of KT. Wouldnt be quite the density of pulling and XP as a regualr group, but it could be done. But, as its been said here before, I woulld have to work my A$$ off to fill that role, while other classes do it as casually as I Malos and Slow. <br />
<br />
I am not quitting my shaman. I love it. I am actually MUCH more optomistic than my posts probably make you think I am. We are on the edge. Even if we get NOTHING new, and everything remains as it is RIGHT now, we are not as bad off in OoW as we were in Gates. <br />
<br />
However, all that being said, the squeakiest wheels are the ones who get the oil in this game, so you can bet you bootie I am gonna squeak and squeak and squeak until I see SOMETHING, even a small thing like moving that heal from an Ancient to a regular, but I want SOMETHING in the 2 areas I named. Healing and fast DPS. Thats what EQ is now. I didnt make the game that way, SOE did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I finally got the Blast heal from GoD last night.<br />
<br />
I have not had a chance to test it out in game yet. Due to it being 1:30 am last night when I got it.<br />
<br />
What was wonderful though was that we don't have DKP. We tend to random to who needs. Well last night on the Geomancy stone A druid a Beastlord an enchanter and myself wanted in on it. They asked me to find out what spell it was. And after learning it was a DD for the chanter and beastlord and a Dot / debuff for the druid they all bowed out and didnt even ask for a roll. <br />
<br />
I love my guildys. <br />
<br />
Is the spell enough to let me main heal in Ferubi. Not sure yet. Ill give it a try.. And for named In Barindu as well. Ill give it a try. Now If I cna get my hands on the Hot spell I will be at least as well equipped as I can to attempt it.<br />
<br />
I do like a 4 K crit heal though. I like it alot. Wish it was more but it is the best we get for now. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Since Blazz and I know each other, and talk occasionally about this sort of stuff--even though we are in &quot;competing&quot; guilds lol--I'm gonna weigh in just a bit here. Take it for what it is worth, everything is IMO, and YMMV.<br />
<br />
I tend to agree that the issues here aren't as much &quot;shaman&quot; issues as they are game design issues. SOE made a HUGE mistake in releasing GoD before they released OoW--as any of you who are doing beta for OoW undoubtedly know, its crystal clear that OoW was supposed to appear BEFORE GoD, not afterwards. OoW is the Velious to GoD's ToV. It is the Luclin to GoD's VT.<br />
<br />
So, in essence, they threw lvl 65 people into the HARDEST portion of what should have been lvl 70 character testing zones. And even at that, the early portions of GoD aren't that bad--an elemental geared shaman WITH the 3 &quot;easily&quot; accessible GoD spells can be single group healer in every GoD zone up to and including KT (though its not much fun in KT). I am Time geared, with some Ikky stuff--AC around 1700, HP around 8700, mana around 7300--and I can be solo healer in Yxtta, in KT, and anywhere else my guild has gotten to thus far. Breath of Trushar really does make a huge difference, and Daluda's Mending is noticibly better than its predecessors. I can't speak for post-Uqua zones, since that freaking Bartx hasn't died for us yet.<br />
<br />
But the point is, YES, shaman took the shaft here, but NOT because they are shaman. They took it because SOE was stupid enough to throw us into a situation we absolutely weren't ready for yet--we hadn't had the opportunity to lvl up to 70, to get the OoW spells, to get the OoW gear. And they added insult to injury by making even the 3 GoD spells very hard to get, and the zones, frankly, too easy to get to, which encouraged us to try stuff that was designed for lvl 70 OoW-geared characters.<br />
<br />
Do we have problems doing that? Of course we do. And so do most other classes. <br />
<br />
Do I want to see those problems solved? Of course I do. And I should NOT have to buy yet ANOTHER expansion to see them solved. It is insulting that SOE would provide us content that is beyond the horizon of most characters' abilities, and then tell us we have to pay more money to gain the abilities and skills and gear to be able to pass over that horizon.<br />
<br />
All that being said: the list of OoW spells and AAs DOES look promising. Its not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination. It won't fix our issue with being unable to be solo healer in high-stress situations (and it especially won't if they keep our best OoW heal as an Ancient spell). But I really really think that SOE has made the decision that shaman are never again going to be able to be solo healers in high-stress situations, and they are going to expect us to either live with that, or walk away. In the meantime, they think they are throwing enough other bones to us to make us an acceptable group member WITHOUT that solo healing ability.<br />
<br />
Fixed rate invis is a bone, but I like it nonetheless. Buffs that add specific mitigations is something we've asked for for a long time, so now we get them. Champion will still suck, but tanks WILL want it--and after all, we HAVE asked for a reason for shaman to actually be included in groups, not just botted, and a spell you have to cast every 10 minutes definitely requires you to be present all the time. Many of the other items, while not perfect, are probably as far as Rytan and SOE are willing to go to make us more attractive.<br />
<br />
Only time will tell if they are correct in that assessment. For now, I know that I have a harder time getting groups every day, and I look forward to logging on less and less. But I also know that I'm not dead yet, and if nothing else, OoW looks brighter than GoD did a week before IT was released.<br />

DPS is not going to get us in  groups over a druid  back up healer unless they make our dots so good that we could just solo easier than we could get a group.  we are not going  be allowed to outdamage a bst otherswise bst would be in an uproar.  so the only solution i see is to give us some better heals that or just make us a better slow but that could be too good heals could not hurt anyone druids will still get groups that already have enchanters and we will get groups that have no enchanter yet or if you dont wanna get one bst will not take our place because we will be able to heal  so it cannot hurt to give us some heals i am not going to quit the game or stop playing my shaman for this because i have loved them from the begining of the game and honestly think they are the most powerful class untill higher lvls.</div></div><hr />
