Hey Telloran, come on up to Tyngsboro sometime. Katie O'Connley's on Middlesex just south of the Tyngsboro bridge. Take 3 north to exit 34. Head east off the exit until you get to the river. Turn right. It's about a mile and a half down on the right. We're there most Saturday nights, some Friday nights, and about every other Wednesday night (pool league). Bring your singing voice.... You can ask for Michael and mention pool. Someone will point me out to ya.</div></div><hr />

I chose the word 'sex' for a reason...  it has to do with plumbing and is sort of an absolute. A person with a penis who feels he should have been a woman will answer 'his' sex as male and 'his' gender as female. Not sure if we have any of those on the Glade, but I was looking for whether people were raised as boy or girl, not what they feel like.</div></div><hr />

LOL!!!! We ARE talking Chihauahuas here. You know, ankle biters, landsharks, yappers. Heh.<br />
Seriously though, its not that hard to transport  that many small dogs, most of which are between 3 to 6 pounds. I have several large carriers and a stationwagon.</div></div><hr />

Incidentally, I didn't mean to include pets on this not because I dont think they are as important to people as children, but because I don't think they influence your political views as much...</div></div><hr />

I'm a preacher's kid which might explain a lot, or nothing at all.  I'm smart (but not as smart as Vader) but really stupid sometimes.  Great with physics/thermodynamics/computers, not-so-great with people/finances/fashion.:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm highly opinionated because I'm always right... but I won't join a conversation/debate unless I think I can accomplish something or at least add something intelligent to the mix.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just wanted to add, I'm a big dog person.  I don't care much for little dogs.  <br />
<br />
I'm not a cat person but I don't mind 'em if they pull they're own weight.  If your cat has ever caught and killed something inside your house... keep it.  If you've got cats AND mice... get an exterminator for both.</div></div><hr />

This was totally uncalled for. I will support you when i think or feel you are right but by the same token i will also  tell you when I think you are wrong and this was plain wrong. <br />
What was the purpose of that remark other than to inflict discomfort at someones expense|?   Did it make you feel good? You feel superior now? You like it when you are disrespected like that? i don't think so.  And if YOU don't like it why do you do it to others?<br />
I think you should apologize for that remark and delete it.  Its intolerable attitudes like that  that has society in such a mess.</div></div><hr />

After dedications, yes Mormon temples are only open to members of the Church. Before that though, there are usually open houses so anyone can come take a look inside.  I believe there is an open house right now or very soon in Navuoo, Illinois for the temple that was just rebuilt there. If you're curious and live near there, go check it out. They are VERY cool looking inside. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just looked it up. Open house from May 6 - June 22 (That's a LONG open house). Visit www.lds.org for ticket info. Not proseletizing folks... just offering an opportunity to check out the architecture. :)</div></div><hr />

Hobbies:  EQ, trying to stay on top of this computer fad (it's all gonna go away soon, trust me!  ;)  ), reading, riding my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harley-davidson.com/motorcycles/motorcycles_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=432841&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=440145&amp;bmUID=1020367192984&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; (Mine's a 2000 model, but they haven't changed much.)<br />
Religion: Agnostic (Christian)<br />
<br />
I can imagine that a lot of folks get confused on the religion thing, but it's just the easiest way for me to explain it.  I generally feel that a person's relationship (or lack thereof) to any diety figure is between that person and IT.  My upbringing was as a Methodist, so that is the manner in which I visualize my relationship.  I have no right or desire to enforce my viewpoint upon others, however.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I've played EQ since Beta and have ONLY played a ranger for any period of time.  Is there another class?  ;)<br />

It seems to me that its more like not allowing the public into the FBI headquarters.</div></div><hr />

There are regular meeting houses for Sunday meetings, church activities, sports, get togethers, dances, etc. Anyone and everyone is welcome to come to Sunday meetings, check out activites, and such. Temples are a bit different. They are for certain ordinances that are reserved for faithful members of the Church. Not even every member can go into a temple unless they are ready (i.e. a certain level of &quot;worthiness&quot; designated by the Church). It's kind of hard to explain and I'm sure some people will think it's discriminatory, but I assure you it's not. Exclusionary perhaps, but anyone that is a member and is worthy can go into a temple. :)</div></div><hr />

Every religion is a cult to someone who isn't a member... Christianity was even referred to as 'The cult of Christ' for a few centuries. Tolerance means tolerance, whether you like it or not :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

That or a pissed off Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Be advised, you won't have to worry about Travolta, he's slow and clumsy, and will probably just be doing disco, but the shortie Cruise has a mean left hook.<br />

LDS or Mormonism is considered by many conservative christian groups as a cult.<br />

I went to the temple a few times, you have to get permission from your bishop, and a little test thingie. Then you get to baptize the dead ( don't ask ). It was really fun though.</div></div><hr />

And to head off the inevitable questions... In a nutshell it comes down to this. We believe everyone ever born should have the chance to recieve the ordinances that go on in the temple. Doing it via proxy (not just an internet term!) is one way people have the chance to accept it or reject it. Of course that means you have to beleive in an afterlife and alter your view of &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;hell&quot; a bit (not much) along with agency and opportunity.<br />

My dad was showing me alot of the old churches there which had super low doorways.<br />
<br />
I asked him if people were shorter back then, and he told me the people who built the church made the doorways small intentionally so that anyone who entered the house of the Lord would have to bow first.<br />

Not sure if it's true, but I always remembered that and thought it was kinda cool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-04-2002, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not Mormon. I'm pretty sure you all know that by now. However, when I lived in Boulder, a pair of missionaries tried very hard to convert me and my first husband. One thing I noticed was that the church was more of a cohesive family than any other church I've known. They just expected to take care of each other. If someone was sick it wasn't a<br />
question of whether they needed someone to sit at the hospital with them, or they needed someone to cook meals for their family, the only question was which day was it your turn. They simply took for granted that the church was going to take care of its members.<br />
<br />
In all other churches I've seen, there have been only a few people who organized all the assistance, and if you weren't in their radar, or you made them angry somehow, you didn't get mentioned for help. Most churches, the most they really did for the average member in a crisis was to pray for them. The Mormons prayed, and then they got out and did the mundane things that made the crisis a little better - and it didn't seem to matter who you were or how popular your family was. If you were a church member, you were helped.<br />
<br />
I couldn't agree with the theology, but the community itself was almost enough to convert me in spite of that. Regardless of popular opinion about LDS church policies, I will always respect them for their caring attitude and loyalty to each other.</div></div><hr />

Religion: Raised Catholic, parted ways with the church over some views I simply cannot hold with morally, and have since made my own personal peace with god.  I like to tell folks I am an &quot;apathiest&quot; (not a real word, but hey ;));  I have to live my life morally regardless of whether there is a god or not, and I need to make sure the world is a better place for my time here.

Political Orientation: General disgust with both parties.  I am very liberal on social issues, particularly in areas such as Public Health and equal rights for minority/non-traditional groups.  A bit more conservative fiscally, in part because of the joke partisan Democrats have made out of perfectly wonderful policy ideas in the name of pork and excessive PC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sex:  Female <br />
<br />
(hah, made you look)<br />
<br />
Real Sex:  Male<br />
<br />
Age: 24<br />
Marital Status:  Perpetually Single (what's that saying about an object that approaches something, something else approaches infinity?  I think that applies to me here)<br />
<br />
Parent:  Yes to a 1 1/2 year-old orange and maroon cornsnake (and boy was the mother shocked)<br />
<br />
Hometown:  Gwinn, Michigan (from the cleaner upper peninsula, not the polluted icky lower peninsula... heh heh)<br />
<br />
Current Location:  Clearfield, UT<br />
<br />
Education:  Lowly HS degree.   Apathy, unmotivation, and procrastination are dangerous combinations when mixed.<br />
<br />
Occupation:  Work with Aethereal as a subcontractor for the military.<br />
<br />
Favorite Food:  Home-made mashed potatoes<br />
<br />
Favorite thing:  Making anyone and everyone laugh whenever it is possible and appropriate to do so (and when my mood permits)<br />
<br />
Least favorite thing:  Irresponsible drivers.  This encompasses people who aren't paying attention via cell phone call, people who aren't courteous, people who can't understand what a blinker is, people who think that a blinker doesn't mean &quot;merge&quot; that it means &quot;please speed up so I can't get in&quot; etc etc.  Forunately, I have absolutely positively and quite assuredly not a single ounce of road-rage in me.  I can be in gridlock and be just calm and zen-like.  If I didn't have music, I probably would be a bit on-edge.<br />
<br />
Favorite music:  Instrumental rock (Joe Satriani) and most forms of hard rock<br />
<br />
Least favorite music:  Country (I love bluegrass... but can't stand most forms of &quot;country&quot;)<br />
<br />
Blood type:  A+<br />
<br />
SSN:  ###-##-###8<br />
<br />
Current mood:  Moderately down<br />
<br />
Religion:  LDS (pesky Mormon)</div></div><hr />
