<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was directed at the paladins, but with luck it will pertain to us as well.  Brenlo talks to Pallies (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Paladin&amp;message.id=128#M128).<br />
<br />
<br />
  Basically, the pallies said that they feel useless in GoD because they cannot tank any of the mobs required to pass the Ikkinz trials, and other than tanking they offer little (sound familiar?).  Brenlo responded that they are looking into making the encounters change based on group makeup to actually make passing possible (though still hard).<br />
<br />
<br />
  I am REALLY hoping that they don't just code it to check for a warrior or a Knight and scale the tank's job, but also to check other aspects of the group (like as in.. if you have a shaman... MAKE THINGS SLOWABLE, or make fights last for a while).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Please, do not jump onto the thread and start asking shaman questions.   The pallies need some attention just as much as we do and it would be wrong to try jumping in front of the camera during the closeup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice to hear, but I kind of tend to agree with the pallies that responded to Brenlo.<br />
<br />
Re-tuning the trials JUST when class a is in it to act differently is not the answer.  If you do that, you're setting a standard that will have to be carried out for the rest of the game.  I really don't think that's going to happen, and I think it would make coding situations RIDICULOUSLY hard, as you'd have to code several instances of the same mob(s).<br />
<br />
It's a nice idea when you first hear it, but if you think about it, it's inherently flawed.  The fixes have to be made to the class and the class abilities, so that no matter what new content brings, they'll still be able to contribute.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the link though Caanus, good to hear they're at least listening. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is nice to see Brenlo at least respond to peoples concerns.  But in all honesty, all the top end guilds have already passed the trials.<br />
<br />
I figured it is these trials that separate the Men from the Boys (guild wise).  If they make them easier, we are going to have the same problem with overcrowding, which will lead to a big delay in progressivness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Boo hoo, warbear.  Now that you're aboard, raise the oars so no one can get in the lifeboat philosophy rears its head in the game again.  A little less self-centered and balanced way of looking at things is more in order.<br />
<br />
I don't think the holy trinity idea was a good one to bring back at all.  They wised up to the flaws in that philosophy before, to the relief of most everyone in the game.  Going backwards was no way to go forwards<br />
<br />
I completely sympathize and empathize with the paladins.  And shadowknights.  It makes no more sense to render them unable to tank single group content than it does to make shamans not even worth while as secondary healers in that content.  They're tanks; they want to and should be tanks.  We're debuffers; we want to and should be debuffers -- oops, forget that, that'll never happen for this content.  Well then, we want something else useful to do.  <br />
<br />
The fact that we can get gimped through by friends or guildies if they are particularly uber or if we're lucky is no saving grace.  It's the same thing paladins and SK's are facing.  Even time geared hybrid tanks can't tank their way through the trials -- visit their boards to see that.  The best geared SK/pallies on whole servers get wiped unless they are very lucky AND...have two clerics in their groups.  Even time geared shamans are terrible additions to a group in some of the trials -- and generally not that hot in the other ones, where mobs die fast enough that our slow lands when the mobs are half dead anyway. <br />
<br />
Could it be that paladins/SK's/shamans are &quot;balanced&quot; or this expansion by having them sneak through by letting them have a spot in a group that uses charmed pets? Don't know.  <br />
<br />
But making any class a distinct disadvantage to have along in any role, much less their normal, expected role, is hardly fair or a boon.  Well, perhaps it's a boon to those who say, &quot;Hey, I passed and/or got gimped in!  So nothing needs to change!  You kids stay off my lawn!&quot;  For those folks, the more restrictive and unenjoyable the game is for pretty much everyone outside their particular situation, the better.<br />
<br />
But there is a &quot;rest of us.&quot;  I can't agree that paladins or SK's in full time gear can't get through single-group trials only by being gimped along.  Those guys are by far at the level of the others passing the trials regularly, and well above most.  There should be a place for them, just like there should be a place for everybody else.  <br />
<br />
Heck, even shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tend to agree they should do something about these Ikkinz trials, though more than likely it will be poorly thought out and either 1) not fix the problem 2) be exploitable to the point of making the trials trivial.  I cringe at the thought of having to funnel one or two people at a time through the 3 trials for flags, because at least 4 of the spots in the group will be fixed (warrior, puller, cleric, another healer).  When will the code determine how much the boss will hit for?  On creation? On engagement?  You could start the trial with a knight and swap in a warrior to make it easier, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you fail currently on any of the GoD trials it's because 1) your skills are poor 2) your gear is poor.  We still have some members of our guild who don't have either Vxed or Tipt.  Vxed is so simple, it's just 2 hours of killing mobs and then carefully pulling one room.  You can even recover a win on a wipe. Tipt is a little more difficult, but I've been in successful Tipt groups with a warrior, with a knight and with no tank at all (well, a pooka tank).  It all comes down to how skilled you are if something unexpected comes up.  It seems to get anywhere in this expansion you're going to have to have 50-60 severely dedicated and skilled people working on it.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Actually, the only problem with these raids is getting TWO healers to go along.  It's usually simple to find a tank, a cleric and a monk or bard.  Getting a second healer to go along on Ikkinz trials is difficult, especially if they're already flagged.  They should adjust the boss's DPS (and possibly its slowability) by which healing class(es) is/are present.  If only a shaman is present, make the boss slowable and put out ~300dps when slowed and maybe tune its hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What i posted on my guild board about this. Still haven't changed my mind.<br />
<br />
I've got mixed feelings about this and figure sony will probably screw it up anyway.<br />
<br />
On the one hand I hate any situation where any one class is required. Cleric, warrior what ever. There should be multiple viable options for something. Right now I think tipt is viable for knights because you can charm a pet for extreme dps of course that just makes a different class required. Annihilater on the other hand is a can o whoop ass waiting to be opened.<br />
<br />
On the other hand retuning mobs specifically for the presence of specific class is a bad precident. What's next mobs that don't hit as fast just because you've got a bst slower instead of shaman? Or don't hit as hard because you've got a druid healer instead of a cleric? The classes should have difference and advantages and modifying content for different classes negates those differences.<br />
<br />
The problem really is defensive is too effective and to required on these mobs.<br />
<br />
If properly implimented on just these couple mobs it probably won't be a bad change overall but it still worries me a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally... I would love a situation where the entire encounter retuned itself to fit you.  If you only have a BARD to slow I don't mind if the mob hitrates drop far enough that after his slow lands you get the same effect as another group which brought a shaman after HIS slow lands.<br />
<br />
  If the best tank you happen to have is your ranger, and the damage scales to fit that fact, I'm all for that too.<br />
<br />
  Can you imagine how nice it would be to form a group with ANY 6 people and walk in to somewhere that you know will require skill and attention, but not be impossible, NO MATTER WHO YOU BROUGHT?   It'd be a flippy dream come true here.</div></div><hr />

Why would anyone bother to bring a shaman then? Any slow is as good as ours so why not bring an enchanter or bst or bard who brings alot more other things too. Why not use a monk for a tank since they would deal more damage than a warrior and tank just as well since the encounter automatically tuned it's self. Hell why not just make all classes into a single new super class thats all the same abilities and capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Personally... I would love a situation where the entire encounter retuned itself to fit you.<br />
<br />
I'm with you Caanus, in the abstract.  It would be GREAT to be able to have events tune themselves to your group, allowing you to bring any 6 people you wanted, and still have fun.<br />
<br />
My opposition to this suggestion wasn't for that reason.  I think that part of it would be wonderful.  The problem I have with it is that it doesn't actually FIX the problem.  It merely works around it through some inventive coding.<br />
<br />
Now, for things such as trials, or any instanced zone for that matter, if done right, this fix could work.  Mind you, to make it work, the devs would basically have to code all the mobs for each zone many, many times.  If you want all the possible combinations, you're talking about having NINETY ((6 members per group) X (15 possible classes) = 90) different versions of each zone.  This means 90 different versions of all the mobs in the zone, each tuned slightly differently to allow for the different group combinations. (pally, sk, warrior, rogue, ranger, cleric?  how about pally, pally, pally, rogue, enchanter, druid?...you get the picture..)<br />
<br />
So, as a &quot;fix&quot;, this would require the devs to code up (and yes, I realize it would probably not be nearly this many versions) 90 versions of each of the mobs in the instanced zones of the current, and future expansions, all in an attempt to make sure that the classes can all contribute well in their current state.<br />
<br />
That, in and of itself, is a big enough problem.  But here's an even larger one:  What happens in the non-instanced zones?<br />
<br />
The answer?  Nothing.  If you base the &quot;fix&quot; for classes being unbalanced around the content, meaning the content is actively tuned when each group zones into an instanced zone, based on the makeup of the group, then you have done nothing to better that class in and of itself.  This means that the classes that were having troubles before the mob-tuning &quot;fix&quot; are going to have the EXACT SAME problems AFTER the mob-tuning &quot;fix&quot;, in any zone that isn't A.) Instanced and B.) Coded in multiple versions to allow for tuning based on group makeup.<br />
<br />
So is every new zone in every expansion from now until the end of the game going to be instanced?  And are those instanced zones ALL going to have up to 90 versions created each, to allow for this tuning to properly work based on group compilation?  I highly doubt it.  If these stipulations are not both true, then the &quot;fix&quot; will fall by the wayside, and the classes are left unchanged, and still just as unbalanced as before.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I like the idea, in the abstract.  It would be my dream as well to be able to take any 5 friends and jump into a zone and have some fun.  The fact is, it just doesn't solve the problems classes are having.  It skirts the issues, which, in the long run, doesn't do anybody any good.  Not only does it not fix the actual problem, but it would probably cause about 10 times more coding work for the devs than an actual fix would, while still requiring them to take an in depth look at class strengths/weaknesses to allow them to properly tune the mobs of the different zones to the classes makeup of each group.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I do appreciate the link, and the thoughts.  It's good to think about these things and see what different types of fixes we can come up with.  I just don't think, personally, that this is what we need.  We (and the other classes) need someone to actually look at, and fix class balancing, allowing all classes to at least contribute a worthwhile amount to current and future content.<br />
<br />
If they want to change the pace of the game to blindingly fast, 30 second encounters, with mobs with 3000dps...fine, just equip us to help against those mobs, that's all I ask. :)<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, to tune the trials for other classes all you need is to add a single &quot;potion of damage mitigation&quot; which drops early on in the trial.  Acts like a percentual rune, taking of 20% of damage for a specified time or damage amount.  Easy to code, and does not require a complete revamp of all zones.  And make the effect specific to the zone it drops in so people can't go farm those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These trials are not impossible.  They offer a nice amount of a challange, which require skill and dedication.<br />
<br />
The only problem is, these trials seem to be designed around specific classes (essential classes), which causes a big problem when it comes to every other class.  As long as you have ; <br />
<br />
 Cleric<br />
 Warrior<br />
 chanter (can be substituted for a dps/slow class, in certian trials)<br />
 hard dps<br />
 secondary healer (cleric/druid)<br />
<br />
  you can succeed at these trials.  The problem is that, NOW that leaves no room for anyone else.   That is why you hear shaman, pallys, SKs, necros, etc. complaining that they are unballanced.<br />
 <br />
 Changeing these trials to make them easier will only lead to more and more people that shouldnt be at that stage in GoD, getting in the way with other people that are ready to progress.<br />
<br />
  The only TRUE way to fix this, is to let the non-essential classes fit into one of those job catagories above.     Why don't the Devs see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think what will likely happen is that they will scale the mob dps down down if a warrior isnt in the group, so that it is equivalent to what the mob would be doing a defensive tank. From that post it would appear that they are concerned primarily with the knights. If they do that it will make paladins the class of choice for these encounters. Warriors will be less desirable, depending on which option offers the line of least resistance for groups, but could still do it. SKs will be left as the red-headed step-children, as usual.<br />
<br />
I doubt the changes they are thinking of will affect other classes too much. I'd be very surprised in the nature of the encounter changed other than to reflect the type of tank you had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would rather have variety within the same instance then variety between instances. I will take any type of variety I can get though.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  That is sorta the point I was making.  Why not take an enchanter instead of a shaman?  No reason at all.  Why would anyone want to bring a shaman?  Because they like talking with him/her or think they are skilled as a player.  NOT because it is required to have malos/malosnia and the absolute best slow.   If they could actually pull the coding off it'd be amazing for the game as you could choose which PEOPLE you want to work with instead of which CLASSES.<br />
<br />
<br />
  As for coding 90 zones, they would only have to do that if they made it all set numbers.  If they introduced variables for certain aspects of the mobs then it could be done without all the extranious zone code (Mob Hp variable set by presence of Rog/Wiz, Monk/ranger or other.  Mob hitrate variable set to presence of shaman/enche, BL/bard, or other.  Mob damage range and cap set to presence of warrior, knight, or other).<br />
<br />
   Overall, it would take a minor tweak to the current engine, and open up a whole new range of variables for them to screw up with each and EVERY patch after it... but if they outsourced to a real programmer it'd be dang nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You would only be able to do that in instanced zones Caanus, otherwise it would be too open for exploitation. And in any case I fail to see the value in doing that at all. If mob hit rates scaled based on the best slower present, for example, it would truly make shaman undesirable as group members since their presence would cause mobs to hit for more. If they did that I for one would never invite a shaman into my group again unless I really had to.</div></div><hr />

It's just too many variables, even in instanced zones.  That's not even taking into account that this fix won't do ANYTHING to help in non-instanced zones.  Who's to say the next expansion won't have GoD toughness or higher mobs in non-instanced zones?  Then what?<br />
<br />
Fix the problem, don't code around it.  If you do, it'll come back to bite you.<br />

<br />
I agree with you to a point, but what is your solution? They can either change the trials so they don't require the holy trinity of cleric, warrior, chanter. Or they can buff up every non essential class to such a level they are also preferred for trials.<br />
<br />
One option just effects trials, the other options changes entire classes and how they affect all content. I don't understand what you want.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be antagonstic but is sounds like you are more worried about sharing content than any solution.<br />
<br />
Hell I don't even understand that fear. Most this crap is instanced, the few non uber guilded people that would be able to do this content wouldn't be in large enough numbers to do more than enjoy 6 man instanced stuff anyway.  Only thing it would do is open up some content for the casual folks bored to death with LDoN hards, they wouldn't be racing the big guild PoT/EP people to the good stuff, so to say:)</div></div><hr />

Enchanters, bards and beastlords just don't fall out of the sky you know.  You should be able to put a trial group together with general, basic components: tank, healer(s), DPS.  Not warrior, cleric, bard/monk, druid/shaman/cleric, 2 DPS classes (sometimes one if an enchanter is needed).<br />
<br />
We're not asking SoE to let wizards tank if an all caster group goes into one.  We just want a tank class and a priest class along with dps to be able to do trials.  I don't see anything unreasonable about that.<br />
<br />
Shamu's rune suggestion would work. Just make the rune clickable/usable by tank classes only.  Or make the zone cast an AE every minute and if the tank class is holding an item they picked up, he will acquire the rune, kind of like the reverse of Uqua.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree with you there but the solution isn't not to hand out gimp versions zones if you don't have the perfect class. The solution is to make sure you have multiple options for viable tanks, multiple options for viable healers etc and not just one option for the critical spots.</div></div><hr />

no. just based on the level average. So even having less members in a group does not have an effect.<br />
<br />
To the original idea of tuning the encounters  depending on the classes present I think that it would be very difficult and quite possible exploitable. A good point of the trials in GoD is that up to a certain point you can switch group members in and out. With the above concept that would be hillarious.</div></div><hr />
