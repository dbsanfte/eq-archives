<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else loving this game as much as I am? <br />
<br />
I know that it's been slagged off a lot so far, but I've got to admit that I've not had this much fun since the original.<br />
<br />
The thrill that I got the first time I walked out of the gates of qeynos and found my first gnoll to bash.......ahhhh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a blast :)<br />
<br />
I love it so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye this game is a blast....  they did a great job with the spells a great job...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm continuing to find myself stunned and amazed by the game.  I haven't had this much fun since I started EQ1 all those years back.  Just started some major crafting last night and I have to say the crafting system is the best I've ever seen in an MMO as yet =)<br />
<br />
I have a feeling I won't be logging into EQ for quite a long time, if ever if this game keeps playing at it's current level lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was hooked from the day I logged into beta:  The tutorial and Isle of Refuge are flawless.  I've always thought EQ1 had an intangible type &quot;hook&quot; from the moment I started playing.  I never put my finger on it, but I had so much fun just doing lame ole kill-n-return quests in Everfrost with my Barb and it was like candy. =p  Nothing's had quite that feel for me since, and nothing has held my attention more than a month or two.<br />
<br />
I find myself playing much slower this type around, because there is sooo much out there to enjoy that I find I missed the first time, since I was in a rush. =p  There's so much lore, and so many characters/quests out there.  It's a blast!  I think a lot of people will have even more fun the second time around, when people start hitting 50 - thinking they've done all there is to do - and make that first real alt.  Hell, it's a whole different starting-game if you make the simple change of home city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the game is awesome, not found any bugs yet myself. When u zone into town first time after newbie isle is so impressive, and then the way the con system works and no more getting whooped by undercon mobs cause you are KOS. The tradeskill sytem fun, takes time to get uused to it but very well thought up. Quests well i just have so many, and after the one i did last nite to get access to Blood Vale well that is just amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jumblies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The need to add a feature to turn off Player names and guilds etc... in a multi group situation I cant move at all.... I know that this might be a bandwidth/graphics card problem... but they need to all a feature to turn off all the eye candy when you dont want it on.  also.. targeting is nearly impossible in some situations. (talking about mobs here... not group members)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing I think they missed the boat on is entity collisions.<br />
<br />
Each player or mob should have a sphere around it which other players and mobs cannot intrude on.  Right now, things are too &quot;crunched together&quot; in certain instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love it...I have just finished my Qeynos citasenship quest and am looking forward to many more.  Already lvl 6 and loving it.  I still find myself doing a lot of EQ1 things.  Backspace for map and A to attack stuff.  It will take some time to get used to but other then that I LOVE IT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can re-map your keys to &quot;close&quot; to the EQLive equivalent.  I was forced to do that for the backspace key, I just couldn't stop hitting it for my map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I'll agree with you on the collision thing. =/  Never understood why they stuck to their guns on that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Probably because it would have created problems in places like Stormhold.  You could have picked a very narrow hallway, had a tank get in front and pull a group of say 4 mobs.<br />
<br />
With a large collision sphere the tank could have kept the mobs from getting to the players in back, and additionally, kept the back couple mobs from engaging at all.<br />
<br />
I &quot;understand&quot; some of the potential pitfalls, I simply think that it needed to be addressed in a different way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That or cause some griefing tactics. A couple of well placed Ogres in a narrow hall could really hamper travel. :)<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Haha - I remember zoning into SolB once (way beack when) and someone had stood an ogre warrior AFK in the entrance hall - there must have been about 3 simultaneous trains headed to the entrance while he was there - the pile of corpses was awesome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I LOVE the game too. I can't play it on my own computer because I need upgrades, so I've only played a little bit, on my daughters comp when I visit her. (pitiful huh?) Anyway, today I played the most at one sitting I've been able to play so far and I had a great time. Finished the Class quest and figured out how to get around via-the Down Below. I really love that at this level, at least, you can pretty much solo, play for a few minutes and still get something done. I love so much about the game I don't even know where to start.</div></div><hr />
