As an indication of my guild strength, we've wiped 3 times straight on spawned Faydedar, and everone else is between 2-10 levels below me, so It'll have to be a solo/one group effort most likely.  The bazaar is also an option, I probably bring in a few K a week after expenses and buying guildies small upgrades.<br />
<br />
My considerations at present are epic (completed the hole today, hope to complete by the end of the month), Circlet of Fallenkin, and Talisman of Benevolence.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your time and suggestions.</div></div><hr />
