<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&lt;b&gt;Wee tips by Gart&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;For Alchemy:&lt;/u&gt;<br />
<br />
1)  Put the bag you want the herbs to go into on the top left inventory slot.  Then buy your herbs. Control-click buys one herb, shift-click buys a stack of herbs. <br />
<br />
2)  Then move your bearskin potion to the top left inventory slot.<br />
<br />
3)  Make your potions.  As each is made, simply drop it into your auto inventory window.  It will land in your bearskin bag.  After 10, open the bearskin bag and combine.  Repeat endlessly until you lose 15kpp and get your skill to 180 max at level 58.  <br />
<br />
4)  Once you hit 103 skill, just make Grow potions to get skill increases.  At 10pp a shot, it appears to be the cheapest avenue these days.<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Other:&lt;/u&gt;<br />
<br />
5)  Go to the bazaar, and find the merchant in the row of merchant who sells the Traders Satchel.  Costs about 2pp each.  They hold 10 giant sized items, ergo they are very good for bank storage.  They weigh 20 lbs, so not good for character use.  <br />
<br />
6)  Get some weight-reducing bags.  They are surprising handy.<br />
<br />
7)  Do the shaman epic quest up to the SoW boots stage as quick as possible.  Insta-cast SoW is an amazing item.  Saves a spell slot, and you can cast while running.  Hotkey it and never die because sow runs out again.  Also helps protect buffs when fighting dispelling mobs outdoors.  <br />
<br />
8)  Bind in Timorous Deep on the pillars over the Firepot room.  This gives you access to the Firepots, and to Timorous Deep.  The Firepots are located in the SW corner of Timorous Deep.  At lower levels, this may not be as good an option in that you are typically more responsible for your own CR then.  When raiding, that's less of an issue.  However, I personally love the porting independence it offers.  Velious is the primary headache as you have to pot to Greater Fay, port to Nexus, then grab the port down to Great Divide and run whereever you need to go.  A disadvantage, but outweighed by the benefits, imho.  <br />
<br />
9)  Get a Froglok Crown.  Get a Cloak of the Ice Bear.  Insanely cheap and still extremely useful items.  At 60 I still use them for resist gear.  <br />
<br />
10)  Hunt in dungeons when you can.  The gameplay is different, and you can learn things that are good to learn.  Be prepared to die the first time you go into any dungeon, maybe the first several times.  However, once you learn the cadence and layout, this happens less and less.  The experience is better, the loot is better and it's far less boring.  <br />
<br />
11)  Don't kill yourself just trying to experience.  Control your obsessive-compulsiveness.<br />
<br />
12)  Items don't mean that much.  A plus 10 item v. a plus 5 item?  Plat-cost wise the difference might be enormous, but you won't notice any real difference.  Certain items can alter gameplay - chiefly ones that let you do stuff without costing mana, or help regen you.  Don't get caught in those little loot games.  <br />
<br />
13)  Print out maps.  I use maps in real-life, and I have more sensory feedback in real-life.  I don't buy any roleplay reasons against maps myself, but that's your call.  As a raid leader, it pisses me off when people can't find zones and can't get around.  You just waste other people's time when you can't travel.  <br />
<br />
14)  Get your spells when you can.  Don't quibble over small amounts of plat, especially when dealing with key spells like Cann IV, torpor, malo.  All other spells, including Bane of Nife and Pox of Bert, qualify as nice to have, but not key.  Plat is replenishable, finding rare spells for sale isn't so easy.  Don't miss your opportunities.<br />
<br />
15)  Work on AC/hp at the low levels.  Start working in resists as you level up.  At some point, you will be most concerned with HP, but it takes a bit to get there.  <br />
<br />
16)  Try to avoid silly spawn arguments with folks.  It's not worth it ultimately, everyone looks like crap and it's not fun.  It's supposed to be fun.  Reputation does matter, it's better to have a good one.  <br />
<br />
17)  Don't bitch about trains if you hunt at zone-lines.  Lamers who camp zone-lines and then howl about unannounced trains are, well, lamers.  It's your job to be alert.  Shut up, loot up and take your medicine.  Then find another place to go if you can't tolerate that.  <br />
<br />
18)  Explore zones.  I met a guy who at level 55 had been to 8 zones.  I don't understand that.  <br />
<br />
19)  Don't believe that you have to be a high end raiding guild to do &quot;fun&quot; stuff.  You will see more and get more more quickly, but it's definitely possible for casual guys to do the same - it just takes longer.  That's reasonable frankly, and it's pointless to fight that.  <br />
<br />
20)  It's a game, do what's fun.  Surprisingly, people will stay in guilds they aren't happy in, or do things they don't want to do and then complain about the game.  That's not the game, that's you.  Don't do what's not fun.  <br />
<br />
21)  Learn to make fish rolls.  Trivial at 135, and they last forever.  You can buy bat wings and fresh fish off a few merchants.  <br />
<br />
22)  Buy Ping Fuzzlecutter's 5000 formula in West Freeport.  He's the little gnome out by the tents outside the gates of West Freeport.  They are an enduring drink and last forever also.  <br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Guilds:&lt;/u&gt;<br />
<br />
23)  If in a guild, don't immediately spam your /gu with screams for ports and resses.  Always check your zone first.  Send polite tells offering a payment for what you want to the right classes in your zone.  If no one can help, then move to a druid ring/wiz spire BEFORE screaming for ports or CR help in /gu.  It's terribly unfair to expect folks to waste THEIR time to save YOUR time.  And don't abuse it, and don't EXPECT help if you solo in out-of-the-way places and die.  If you get it, be happy.  If not, you figure something out or suck it up.  <br />
<br />
24)  Organize raids to get OTHER people loots.  Constantly asking for help getting yourself loots is a good way to get ignored eventually.  <br />
<br />
25)  Don't flame people who chose to leave your guild.  It's their dollar and their time.  If they aren't happy, that's fine.  Wish them well.  Sure, epic-hoppers are lame, but it's still silly to blast folks who simply want to try a different style of play or a new dynamic.  <br />
<br />
26)  Guilds are fun, if it's a guild with reasonable people.  It's a social game, and harder/tougher/better items/zones require you to be social if you want to see/do/get them.  Normal human interaction carries it's own frustrations and rewards.  Don't spazz when folks have a bad day.  <br />
<br />
Plenty more, but just some random thoughts.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice compilation :)<br />
<br />
While I personally agree with most of your philosophies, some people may not and thats ok too.  The advice does not reflect the opinions of a person who is more of a power gamer (not that I am, I am the anti-power gamer), but they'd likely enjoy a different approach.<br />
<br />
If I could amend one small statement, that while in itself, +5 here or there doesn't make much of a difference in a single slot, holding that philosophy in multiple slots tends to add up.  If spending the extra cash to nail a decent item that brings you up to par, then thats one less slot you need to bother with and can focus on another slot untill more gear hits the bar.<br />
<br />
I do not believe gear makes the shaman, gear makes the shaman better.</div></div><hr />

That's my current feelings on the Fungi/Regen Tunic. The Regen Tunic Regens 1/3 less, but costs 1/12 the price. Common sense if ya are a blue collar shaman.</div></div><hr />

Its called curtesy.  If you are so jaded to believe that the curtesy should not be given to those in your train path I feel sorry for you.<br />
<br />
Edit: Personally I think your the lamer for thinking this... Otherwise I agree with the other ones... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shift-click buys one herb, control-click buys a stack of herbs<br />

Actually pressing shift and buying buy's a stack of items.  Pressing Ctrl and buying the item purchases 1.  Also the same principal lies in picking up items in your inventory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Zoneline hunting. everywhere but ME I believe this, only because it's SOOOO easy to avoid someone's train in ME if forwarned.  But that's just me and I happily accept I'm going to get trained hunting 4 arms at the ME/UP zoneline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Zenyn.  For some reason that's a mistake I make constantly.  Essentially every time I buy something.  <br />
<br />
Hrothgar, if I can announce a train I will, but if I'm turning, twisting about, or whatever, forget it.  The point is, if you hunt on the train tracks, don't complain about trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good list.</div></div><hr />

         just for clarity a curtesy is something the uneducated do in the presence of the unelected.(eg Wimbeldon atm).Courtesy on the other hand is something that civilised people display toward one another.I don't think that Gart was advocating the non-disclosure of zone trains.He was simply stating that the possibility of being trained was an innate risk of choosing to camp at a zone.As with most things in life (even in cyber life) there is a cost attaching to any benefit.The downside of a near and available escape route is that you are sitting along many people's escape route.<br />

Agree. Also, a lot can be achieved by one group of folks if they have their heads on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dont assume that everyone at a zone is camping the zone line<br />
<br />
Perhaps:<br />
<br />
1. They just zoned in<br />
2. They just zoned in<br />
3. They where just leaving<br />
4. They were waiting for someone else<br />
5. They were LFG<br />
6. They just zoned in<br />
7. They where camping the zone line<br />
<br />
No i understand that sometimes it is difficult to call a train, but i dont think that if you get people killed at  a zone line by not calling the train, that its ok to think &quot;screw em they were at the zone&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously how hard is it to type &quot;/ooc train&quot;, it takes about 1 sec, or even hotkey it. But to not call at all because you can't be bothered about it shows a lack of courtesy and respect towards other players.<br />
<br />
EDIT: New and improved post with the number 5 only occuring once, and with added number 7 at no extra cost!</div></div><hr />

i go afk at lmoat, it's also where i go lfg in KC, when i'm there. i can't stand the idea of the fookin idiots who sit at zone in lfg, when they know that there's a train every 3 mins there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Context : The part of a text or statement that surrounds a particular word or passage and determines its meaning.<br />
<br />
aka<br />
<br />
Any fool should know how to notice a misspelling and correct it by reading the sentence surrounding the misspelled word.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is you should go back to lurking.  Why is it some &quot;lamers&quot; feel like they need to assert some form of surperiority by correcting spelling on an internet message board?<br />
<br />
the DL/KC zone is immediatly pops into my mind here. inside KC people sit at the zone line invisibly, and then whine if a train comes and kills them. then they make bright comments like &quot;ok which of you ****ers trained me while afk!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
KC on the two servers I play on has a designated &quot;safe&quot; side where you should be able to go afk as any train brought to the other side will leave anyone sitting on the &quot;safe&quot; side.  Yet people who have been in zone and have been repeatedly asked, very politely in most circumstances, which side to train still train the side where people are sitting.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Ok I understand some situations like dungeons with lots of turns to a zoneline it will be tough but in open areas I dont see why anyone cant just type &quot;train coming to xxx zonline.&quot;  It is like these people either like to yell at the &quot;whiner lamers&quot; or just like to kill people.  It doesnt make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I liked eamonn1's post. Dry, slightly acidic in tone, but clear in argument.<br />
<br />
Hrothgar, on the other hand, you called Gart a lamer (!) and seem to support zone camping.<br />
<br />
Unforgiveable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you have time enough to type, it's not really a train.<br />
<br />
If you try to type in the middle of a real train, you're dead either during or immediately following your typing attempt.<br />
<br />
Which is not to say people shouldn't make train hotkeys.<br />
<br />
But it is to say not to expect unreasonable things of people -- like typing while trying to get out of a maze, or when there's too little time to get to the zoneline, etc.  <br />
<br />
And Gart's original point is that you are putting yourself in harm's way if you camp zonelines.  Indisputably true.  While that doesn't mean you &quot;deserve&quot; to be trained, it does mean that you really were making it extremely likely.  <br />
<br />
It's more than fair to say that's not too bright a thing to do.  And that if you insist on doing it, you're willfully engaging in behavior that endangers you and your group.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make proud.&quot;  Instead of worrying about who's in the right and who's in the wrong, and being confident you were in the RIGHT when you died, it's a lot smarter just to move your ass out of the way and find someone else to argue with(who's the argument with, anyway? the guy who trained you? god? fate?).  I remember reading a cop saying it takes more than one ******* to crash when two streets come together at a &quot;yield&quot; sign.  One is just not enough.  How much you want to seal the deal on your own pointless doom is really up to you, though.<br />
<br />
I often invis when entering zones, medding -- or even just walking around.  There is NO downside to taking care of yourself properly and not depending on the kindness of strangers to keep you alive and happy.</div></div><hr />
