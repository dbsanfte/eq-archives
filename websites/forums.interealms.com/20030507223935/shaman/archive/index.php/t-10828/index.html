<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are like me and prefer dungeons to outdoors you'll love this spot. Your hair will be tingling at all times cause if you die it's not going to be a fun CR :) I made approximately 2 blue bubs an hour there at 60. In fact I finished out my last yellow bub there and wish I had done this earlier. Don't waste time at ZI/ZO the XP is crap there. This spot is the upper tunnel near ZO.<br />
<br />
Some facts about this spot:<br />
<br />
1. Pretty sure you need to be 60 to single pull mobs here.<br />
<br />
2. Two BoNs + alpha pet is all you need to kill any mob in the area. Mobs are totally gimp on resists so slows and dots land without any need of a malo/malosini.<br />
<br />
3. Have your resist gear on, forget about AC since 50% of the mobs are wizzy/necro types. Slap on talisman of epuration for PR and DR and use your resist magic/fire/cold spells. With those and resist gear I'm 120+ on all resists and most spells bounced right off me even from the dark blues. When they did land I barely got scratched.<br />
<br />
4. Mobs are on 26 minute timer giving you plenty of time to make your way down tunnel as far as you like to go. Hell I went so far down I don't even know where I was at.<br />
<br />
5. Loot is about 3pp per mob with possibility of 1-2 gems per trip to help offset the cost of a KEI. Tribal war mask and ivory imubed collar dropped also.<br />
<br />
The spot is the upper tunnel near the ZO. You need to have levitate on to reach the tunnel. In order to get up there you head a little ways up to ZO and then turn around. You should be facing the gatehouse. Now hug the left wall and run real fast and you should reach the upper tunnel. There is one spawn there to greet you so have pet memmed. Root and slow it and summon pet.<br />
At this point in the tunnel mobs are about 50% light blue and dark blue but as you make your way down they all become dark blue and very nice XP.<br />
<br />
Spiritstone is really handy here. I just bind outside and when KEI runs out I port to EF then take book to Pok/nexus and get KEI and gate back.<br />
<br />
Have fun here and don't die :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would like to try this spot. Mostly to do something new. I was just wondering if you kill your way down from ZI or if you can invis to the levitation tunnel?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can invis past every mob up until the first skelly in the lev tunnel (very often the very first mob too...makes it annoying as you wont have pet up most of the time)<br />
<br />
This truly is a very fun part of the zone to solo.  Make sure that when you get near the Watch Captain (its the first &quot;T&quot; in the tunnel, after the first left) that you stay to the left at the T and dont let any mobs run up near the doorway.<br />
<br />
CR's here are certainly NOT fun, hope you have a necro friend :)<br />
<br />
I have been soloing past the observer and down to the bridge.  I can now get two mobs at a time (instead of 3...BK and two others wasnt pretty) and get the BK single.<br />
<br />
I dont suggest going anywhere much past that though as at 60 you wont be able to single anything, actually pulling 3-4 in some spots, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Whats great about Chardok though is that you can have a great time solo/duo/trio, get some loot, hone skills...then you gotta fight your way back OUT :)<br />
<br />
Heres a great chardok guide for anyone interested.<br />

<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
If you start going past the observer or into the mines you will want to start pulling with low low aggro spells.  Malosini is a decent one, even better I think is burst of flame.<br />
<br />
I tend to pull, root, slow, send pet, epic, BoN (which almost *always* breaks root) then tank/canni/jbb.  Use bear and keep your resists/hp buffs up, especially if you decide to go against the observer...he likes to chain cast ice comet and various wizzy rain spells (so far Im 3/5 vs observer)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just FYI, unless something has changed, that's not necessarily true.  An occasional Sniffer whill see invis, so it's best to con any Sniffers before you run past them.  Those things gave me grief on more than one occasion when I was trying to grind through the hell-59 in chardok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My favorite spot in Chardok - but it's a bit risky getting there:<br />
<br />
Run through the fort to the first bridge, ignoring any aggro.<br />
<br />
Jump off the bridge.<br />
<br />
CAMP immediately to clear aggro.<br />
<br />
Any mobs aggroed from the fort area will take about a minute to get down to you under the bridge.<br />
<br />
Under the bridge is a safe room with some slaves in it.  You can easily pull the captain from there.  I was doing this at 58 with a partner and making great XP and good drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG, this is so much easier! It's really not that risky either. In 3 runs down there I've only aggroed one mob, that being the first undead dude near the gate. No big deal you got plenty of time to sit and camp after you fall down into the pit. Great spot to rest and go afk. I also just realized that this was the area I made my way down to via the upper tunnel. So yea you can either fight your way down here or just jump off the bridge.<br />
<br />
Even at 61, at least 80% of the mobs in this area are dark blue and the captain can be single pulled. I decided to make my way down further, took a left toward the mines and not torward the bridge which leads to the royals. However once I pulled a slavedriver I got two and gated to be safe. I know I could have taken them both but wimped out, will try them again next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have tried to single the captain and always get his guards too.  How do you guys single him?<br />
<br />
Also...part of the fun is working your way down into Chardok, not just jumping off the bridge :)<br />
<br />
As for the sniffers seeing invis, I havent had that problem until the sniffers that are further down in the zone (past the fort or past the lev tunnel entrance) so you are correct, but I just havent seen any near the zone in / out / fort.<br />
<br />
Also a quick note, if you go down there with an evaccer in group, beware that when you evac you will appear in a spot at the zone out where one or two mobs will aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What level are you, Jaidin?<br />
<br />
I slowly inched toward the door until I could click it open. As soon as I opened the door the captain aggros but the other two mobs didn't. Usually the other two mobs are legos and fleshrippers which are tougher than the other mobs in the area so probably higher level. Maybe it was just luck on them spawning at just the right level to single pull the capt. Has happened before with other mobs like in Seb when 99% of the time I can single pull all the mobs up to the rock but once in a blue moon I get two boks on a pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 60 I got all three, however when I opened the door they didnt come and I had to cast on the captain.  That was probably my mistake, I will try inching up to him until he aggroes next time.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">an Enslaved Iksar Miner is great exp in chardok if your level 60. Bonus exp at level 60 starts at 55, which all the miners are. Not sure, but I believe that was the best exp spot for me pre PoP besides the cursed ramp snakes in Ssra. You can get an add or so on the pull, so have to be careful. Duoing down there is great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At level 60 getting down to the skeletons in the mines is the trickiest part.  Once you get down there you'll get mostly double pulls which are easily root parked, or if you're thinking ahead and know which pairs are where, you'll root one to pull the other. ;)<br />
<br />
The tricky part is when you get down past the BK turnoff in the &quot;lev tunnel&quot;  The first big room you come to as you clear down that tunnel will have 2-3 mobs in sight and I've always seen 3 aggro together on the first pull.  At 60 it IS possible, but make sure you're FM when you get to that first room and be ready to root park stuff quickly.  Recommend pulling by rooting one right off the bat, back up and root another asap, then slow and sick pet on the last one.<br />
<br />
Just a heads up...  I've recommended the lower tunnel for xp as well as the skellies to a few people and several complained that they got stomped by the 3 pull halfway down heh.</div></div><hr />
