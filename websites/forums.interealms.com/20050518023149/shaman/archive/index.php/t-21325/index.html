<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Persop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In all my time here people have mentiond, at different times, particular strategies they used with specific mobs. Strategies they were really, really proud of. <br />
<br />
<br />
Things like with Black Dire (Mistmoore), running him to zone, logging and comming back in. <br />
<br />
Pass on the info and show what you have done :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On my Ikky beast, i love running to the Ruins of Kaesora ent, in the field of bone, smacking the elf thats guarding it once, and then run my scaly little butt back to the Cabilis gate.  Takes around 4-5 guards (and pets) to finish em off.  Its a cool fight, that elf takes a beating hehe :)  Its also possible to get the ape to run to the ent, same type of fight, but ape summons so it takes a lot longer :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Breaking the Sleeper's Tomb zonein and soloing my way into MotG's room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This may seem pretty lame, but the first time I figured out I could blind kite mobs. This was pretty early in my journey. I was in Frontier Mountains and I was tired kiting while running around. I threw a blind and they would run away as long as I had agro, I thought it was the coolest thing ghetto fear kite!!!!!!!!! If only I had a snare!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was gonna post the same one Griz already did :)   Solo'ing sleeper's till MotG room takes some serious patience.<br />
<br />
  To post something original I'll instead go with Solo'in on old version Bristlebane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when i found out i could solo PoTact pit.. yeah yeah.. trivial content, i know :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My enchanter friend needed sacred water or whatever it is from valor.  It was then I first realized I could tank triple 700 mobs :)  It seemed like suicide but we did it, it was just really damn cool. Me and him duoing the first 4 or 5 islands in air was cool too, got to pegasus island to get his twinks epic piece</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Back when I farmed Inner Acrylia for like a month straight to get my 65 spells, I found out that when there is a mob that sees invis (like at the gate leading into the jail cell area), that if you run past them real fast, they won't agro. Nothing great, but when I started farming there I had really low hps and mana pool, and taking two on with no pet was a pain. It made my farming a lot easier :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spending an hour soloing that 50k hp Gantru Dralkenr in UP right after Luclin came out. But Nektar the moktor slayer was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so it wasn't so bad  :D</div></div><hr />
