<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok first keep in mind im lvl 51 so at higher lvls no idea how this will play...<br />
<br />
This stupid little spell i forgot about and NEVER used before lol.....Flash of light.<br />
<br />
Grouping with a bst partner a lot and  as i slow he would toss flash of light a lot to make mob lose track of him...and in turn  me....<br />
the spell acts like a mini fear.....<br />
well once I got tugurs ...and playing in KC bam ya big agro.(in a group without the bst)...i start using the flash spell on the mob right after slow and bingo he loses me fast...<br />
Later grouping with the beast in a duo at ent and i almost never got agro cause he would toss flash as i tossed tugurs..<br />
At higher lvls im sure the mr factor will kill this trick..but u might try it and see what u get..<br />
<br />
Ok its late ...been playing too long and eyes are fuzzy...so please excuse the run-on sentences ..lack of proper grammer and punctuation ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use try using root instead.<br />
Blinded mobs go running off and grab friends if they aren't in melee range of something.<br />
It's a very bad spell to cast in most dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">never had one run off unless soloing of course ..then they go fleeing but with mellees on it it stays put..its an odd spell...kind of dumb stuns it for a sec and it switches agro....been messing with it for couple days now.......<br />
again just something i have been playing with and thought some others might see what they find out...with this new disease counter adding insane agro on our poor little shammie heads ;)<br />
<br />
ex necro player so ya fear in dungeons is BADDDDDD ....but the bst had been using it like crazy so started playing with it (flash of light)...but hey zone was 2 foot away also so why not experiment lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FYI blind is an uber taunt.  Ever wonder why those pallys are always blinding mobs? Now you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamangod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why are paladins taunting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So the wizards wont have to tank? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Id expect its because paladins make excellent tanks on all but the most uber of uber mobs ?<br />
<br />
Have people that bash hybrids never played with them ? /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agreed. A Pally can make an excellent tank.</div></div><hr />
