Total DPS: 39.10<br />
<br />
When you consider that he resisted Lotus Spines 6 times, and Rujarkan Bile 5 Times... That's 3325 potential damage that was lost, which would have increased the DPS by 18.07 for a total of 57.17, which on a mob like AoW isn't too shabby.<br />
<br />
BTW Dakks = Someone's druid bot, who suicided with a mod rod ~_~<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot Tainted Bite, which went off 3 times, so tack on an extra  105 damage from that and 150 from the DoT. Grand total 58.56dps! win!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not impressed, in fact this parse makes the case to upgrade rabid even stronger.<br />
<br />
also, with 99% haste on rabid, is including the 41% haste item needed?  I know SOV has some +atk and the bardsong is overhaste<br />

Never know with the haste item, people always throw around haste cap numbers and stuff. I assume a FBSS would have probably had the same effect.<br />

I think the max I have gotten is 117 with the TA.  I know what you mean though cuz one time and one time only I got a 230 with the Bone of Bertoxxulous.  Never got another one that high.  Been a while but I think it maxxes at 226.  Random as hell IM sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The reason totemic and jaundiced bone armor were set to have plate graphics was entirely a visual issue.  There hadn't been any sort of visual upgrade to character graphics since the game came out a year ago (at that point), and so they just decided to make kunark armor look &quot;cool.&quot;  I'm not tolan's (ranger) was plate, the rogue armor was plate, etc.  It doesn't make them a plate class.<br />
<br />
Since velious, they haven't given shamans/rangers/rogues plate *looking* armor again because they have added more graphics for chain (as well as plate) so that it doesn't look so blah.<br />
<br />
Shamans are not, never have been, and never will be a &quot;plate&quot; class.  My monk can go put on some serpentine bracers and a PSC, and if I shopped around long enough, I'm sure I could find plate-look armor for every visible slot.  That doesn't make him a plate class.</div></div><hr />

yesterday, I was MHing in a Dranik's Scar expedition with a few lower level friends from a former guild of mine...we had 2 rangers, 1 SK, 1 Wizzy, 1 enchanter, and me.<br />

I was the highest lvl, and we started a lvl 70 exp. things were going moderately well, (save for the 2 times we'd get a bad pull and the SK would go down a split-second too soon, love CotW) we all had a good time...<br />
<br />
anyway, one of the rangers had to leave, and we manage to get a cleric in the group....then we noticed something...when I stopped healing, and started DPSing, mobs were going down much faster and we were killing alot more. We didn't have any down-time with me MHing, save for the instances where the SK went down, and we were chain pulling. Dog was up in both instances.<br />

Anyone got a kleenex? I think I have blood running out of my eyesockets!<br />

Sigh, another 45 seconds of my life I will NEVER get back down the tubes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I &quot;feel&quot; like I'm doing pretty good damage with my Cudgel of Glowing Clay (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20455) but I've never done any parses. I routinely see max hits of 111 and 222 crits with only self atk buffs on exp mobs. I just got might though so I expect those numbers to go up just a little. Granted it can't touch spell dps, but it's nice to mix things up a bit from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">DPS numbers without logs are...useless.  I FEEL like I'm the king of the world, but just like 130 sustained DPS with melee..it just isn't true.  <br />
<br />
Maybe for a very short time you might get lucky with the procs, but no way you sustain 130dps without double attack or dual wield.  NO WAY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">well, I picked up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17901&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Staff of Eternal Flames&lt;/a&gt; in Fire the other night. Loving this weapon by the way. routinely hit for 210 (w/ might = 220) and respective crits (420 - 440). (most common crush 110, most common crit 363, btw)<br />
<br />
on this weapon, I parsed my DPS with my 60% haste, and I averaged ~60 DPS in each fight, no casting, just plain melee. I can see how you could hit 130+ DPS with this weapon (or similar), but it'd require max haste and bard overhaste.</div></div><hr />
