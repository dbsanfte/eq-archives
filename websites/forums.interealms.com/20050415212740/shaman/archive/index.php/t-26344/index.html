<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arkades Windtalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail, I am Arkades (ar - kay - des) Windtalker of Veeshan! I'm relatively new to the Shaman class, and this is my first character on the Veeshan server.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to say hi! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi, welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greetings!<br />
<br />
Dont get discouraged by reading too many of the threads here.  Shaman are a wonderfull class that are capable of bringing a lot to a group.  Make liberal use of the Medicine Cabinet at the very top of the forums; we have years of knowledge stored away up in there.  Also probably a good idea to bookmark Samanna's Reference Desk  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arkades Windtalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol, no worries, my main is a Magician on Tunare, so I'm familiar with the class balancing issue complaints. :P<br />
<br />
Thanks for the warm welcome! :)<br />
<br />
Also, do you think this name works? For some reason it takes me a long time to get used to a name. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, windtalker is the perfect name for a druid... just get loads of wiz stat gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arkades Windtalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What would be a Shaman type last name for a Barb in your opinion? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, based on the posts around here I would recommend Arkades IhatemybrokenclassandwishIwasachanter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's nothing wrong with Windtalker. Don't mind the grumps. Most people playing Barbarians go with some kind of Nordic and/or Celtic naming. Others go with thier joke-last-name-of-the-week. I mostly go without, although I had Agrohog for about a month, then... well, it's blank again.<br />
<br />
Welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arkades Windtalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, on the Mage boards it would be Sithro Gotdamnitiwishiwereanecro. :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, I picked Windtalker from the movie with the Indians. I figured Indians had Shamans. :)<br />
<br />
Arkades coms from the the word, &quot;arcade&quot; *I like video games* and I see Barbarians as the type who pillage using giant ships... Hence Arkade... And I put an S on it to make it sound better. :)<br />
<br />
If I were to change it, now would be the time, only level 5.<br />
<br />
I am considering changing it to, &quot;Arkadeus&quot; to make it easier for people to figure out. Ah well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arkades Windtalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay guys, names REALLY bother me, so I'll let you all decide.<br />
<br />
Arkades... Or!... Arkadies?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the double post, but it's annoying the hell out of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Everyone in group will just call you A or Ark, so... I pick the one on the left, whichever it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arkades Windtalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I just found out there's someone already named, &quot;Arcadies&quot; and either one would probably be a rip off..<br />
<br />
My God, just my luck, same freaking server! Lol<br />
<br />
Screw it, I'm going Frog. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Howdy<br />
<br />
go frog - and as for last name...<br />
<br />
who cares. Most people play with /showname 1 anyway (from when i have talked to people) - so make it what you think is good. Who else is better to decide what will make you happy other than me? err you...yeah...</div></div><hr />
