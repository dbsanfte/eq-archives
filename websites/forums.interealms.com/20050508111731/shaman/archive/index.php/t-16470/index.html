<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This comparison is meant to be applicable to the question, &quot;If I had to provide dps for an LDoN adventure, which one should I use, velium strike or bane?&quot;  Info all comes from Lucy and personal experiences.<br />
<br />
bane<br />
420x5-6 ticks=2100 or 2520 damage<br />
490 mana<br />
5.5 casting time<br />
24 recast time<br />
4.3 or 5.1 damage per mana<br />
71 or 85 dps (dividing by casting+recast time)<br />
<br />
velium strike<br />
925 damage<br />
300 mana<br />
7.8 casting time<br />
2.25 recast time<br />
3.1 damage per mana<br />
92 dps (dividing by casting+recast time)<br />
<br />
bane with burning affliction IV (1-20% increase per tick)<br />
2121-3024 damage<br />
490 mana<br />
4.3-6.2 damage per mana<br />
72-103 dps<br />
<br />
velium strike with Anger of E'ci (1-23% increase)<br />
934-1110 damage<br />
300 mana<br />
3.1-3.7 damage per mana<br />
93-110 dps<br />
<br />
velium strike with Anger + fury of magic 3 (13% chance of crit?)<br />
(note: in my experience, a crit with anger is double damage + 1-23% of half that double damage)<br />
934-1110 damage 87% of the time, 1859-2035 damage 13% of the time<br />
1054-1230 damage by weighted average<br />
300 mana<br />
3.5-4.1 damage per mana by weighted average<br />
105-122 dps<br />
<br />
bane pros<br />
Once it lands, the damage is guaranteed full<br />
You can do other stuff while it's dotting<br />
More efficient than velium strike<br />
bane cons<br />
Once it's landed, the mob can't be mezzed for 24 seconds<br />
Can be fully resisted<br />
Agro<br />
Not practical when mob is half dead<br />
Since recast time is so long, can't really use it to rootrot other mobs in addition to one you're fighting<br />
Requires a Burning Affliction IV (really hard to get) item and Canni 5 (lots of AAs) to be competitive<br />
<br />
velium strike pros<br />
Cold resist is sexy<br />
Can be partially resisted so that spell isn't completely wasted<br />
Useful regardless of mob health (unlike Bane, where it's a waste to cast if a mob is at 10% health)<br />
Less agro than Bane (I think-- but if you keep doing it you may get agro)<br />
More dps than bane<br />
A shaman can generally keep up with velium strike castings with Canni 5 and Canni 4<br />
No real worries about mezzing and switching targets and stuff<br />
velium strike cons<br />
Again, can be partially resisted<br />
Can't really do anything else while nuking over and over<br />
Requires an Anger of E'ci item (not so hard to get) and Fury of Magic 3 (30 AAs, what a pain) and Canni 5 (more pain) to be competitive<br />
<br />
If I had time, I'd include Tears of Saryrn in the comparison, but I have to go to school now!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spell haste also affects velium DPS more greatly than it does bane DPS.  The new and old rizlona's might also be good to factor in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, I found &quot;Tears of Saryrn&quot; pretty useful combined with Spear of Torment.<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryrn:<br />
mana: 450<br />
dmg: 650x3=1950dmg - if you have no mezzer in group, and cast it at least two mobs, it will make 4 hits, making dmg = 650x4= 2600dmg.<br />
<br />
I find that it resist very little compared to our earlier versions of the spell, and also it fizzles very little. <br />
<br />
By the time the rain is over, you'll only have to wait a sec or two before you can cast it again... Meanwhile while makin it rain,  you may canni a bit, or nuke with Spear of Torment (or Ice Strike for those who have that).<br />
<br />
Note that if you have a mezzer in group, you wont be popular if you are using this spell and breaking all mezzes... ;p<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Casting time is 6 sec,<br />
recast time is 12... so in 18 sec this spell does between 1950-2600dmg, = 108,33 to 144,44 dps. <br />
<br />
A con is that you can't kill a mob by a rain spell (unless they have fixed this without me knowing it, and that I've had extremely bad luck with resists) so lets say a mob is at 2% when the last wave hits and has less than 650hp left, then he will auto-resist it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tears of saryrn is God in LDoN.  Mobs don't even live long enough to bane them (heck, I was trying malos+slow on my 1st ldon mission and mob would be dead before the slow landed).  I can usually nuke once...vel strike or tears... then mob is dead. <br />
<br />
My favorite strategy is just to pull a 2nd mob (with slow, hardly anything resists) onto the 1st and tears.  Can't beat that dps, especially with the crap resists on LDoN normal missions.<br />
<br />
If dot actually runs full course in an LDoN normal mission, that's killing pretty slow...<br />
<br />
DoTs have pretty much been relegated to a soloing tool (been that way for some time now...)  Maybe they'll be good in 'hard' missions where mobs have more hps, dunno... haven't done one yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">KriFos they fixed rain spells so that they will kill your target :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, they didn't.  I still get all full resists when mob is 10% or lower... as recently as last night.<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea, I actually used to use Tears of Saryrn a lot, but sometimes it's just not practical-- or should say, it's just a huge pain to use it sometimes.<br />
<br />
After you slow a mob, it'll be angry at you a little-- you have to wait for the tank to get agro, then back off and rain (or try to target something next to the mob opposite you and cast on it).  With velium strike, you don't have to readjust or wait-- you can just start nuking once stuff is slowed.<br />
<br />
By the time you're done with slowing responsibilities with multiple mobs, the first mob is already low on health, and it's only worth it to velium strike.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's really annoying to rain a non-malosed mob, so you spend all your time malosing and slowing mobs instead of actually nuking them.<br />
<br />
Plus, when you swap out tears of saryrn to haste people or whatever, when you swap it in it's got that long 12 second refresh you gotta wait for to use it again (the only other non-essential spell I have up is Ferine Avatar, but it's a 1 minute refresh so I keep it up all the time).<br />
<br />
...I eventually just ended up velium striking everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding why I don't use both, I like to keep Ferine Avatar up for the melees.  Plus, while a shaman does have the ability to keep up with mana, Baning and then velium striking can be harsh, especially since some of the Bane will be wasted when the mob dies early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Any statisticians around?<br />
<br />
What're the probabilities of:<br />
1) Three resists (0 dmg)<br />
2) One hit, two resists (650 dmg)<br />
3) One crit, two resists (1300 dmg)<br />
4) Two hits, one resist (1300 dmg)<br />
5) One crit, one hit, one resist (1950 dmg)<br />
6) Three hits (1950 dmg)<br />
7) Two crits, one resist (2600 dmg)<br />
8) One crit, two hits (2600 dmg)<br />
9) Two crits, one hit (3250 dmg)<br />
10) Three crits (3900 dmg)<br />
<br />
Given 15% resist chance and 13% crit chance on each wave?<br />
<br />
(15% and 13% are somewhat arbitrary picks-- if you could represent an answer using R% for resist percent and C% for crit percent, that would be great)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Depends on the make up of the group. If you have mez CC, you can stick with nukes on primary target, but lots of times, you don't have a mezzer. In root-park situations, I can slow primary, slow add (which causes it to charge me), root add, Bane add, nuke primary. Then when the group is done with initial target, the add will be half dead and you can drop a nuke on it. Of course, I dont have Bane yet, but I use this method with my other DOTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think tears has an initial resist chance (and you get resist message on all 3 waves).... Barring the 'full resist', I think it then checks on each wave.  I could be wrong about this, and the 'full resist' might just be getting unlucky on all 3 wave resist checks, but... intuitively, it feels like there is an initial chance for the spell to be full resisted (I back this up by stating that the vast majority of the time, when the 1st 2 waves are resisted, the 3rd is as well... improbably high if it was just a single check for that last wave).<br />
<br />
On PoP mobs, 2 out of 3 waves landed is by far the most common outcome.  On LDoN mobs, expectancy is between 2 and 3.  (And between 3 and 4 on 2 targets, which makes it a nice spell).<br />
<br />
I agree with the poster who says tears is a pain to use.  I could use it effectively when pulling, cause I could bring ton of mobs into camp and tears them.<br />
<br />
Normal really needs no cc of any kind until you have like 5 or 6 mobs (even then can just slow them all and let them beat on you).  I have no respect for these mobs at all.<br />
<br />
I would have to admit though that I do use velium strike more often than tears.  It does more damage on single mobs than tears (espec. with e'ci focus), which is what you're usually fighting (in PoP, anyway).  I hardly ever dot in xp group... aggro issues just make BoS not worth it most of the time... <br />
<br />
The sad answer to your question about what to use in LDoN is it really doesn't matter =)  That's one of the reasons I like to pull/queue mobs in LDoN, just cause we such low dps.<br />

<br />
Tears of Saryn = great.<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment....well, that's crap!  675 dam for 275 mana.  Velium is 925 for 300 mana.  For 25 more mana, you get 250 more damage.  Gee, lemme think about this one.   :p<br />
<br />
Yes, I know it casts fast.  Even so, I'd use ice strike (675 for 250) over spear (if I didn't have velium strike).  And anger of e'ci items are cheap as hell, as opposed to poison nuke focuses...OF WHICH THERE ARE ZERO.<br />
<br />
I only use spear in situations where I cannot use velium, and we NEED the DPS, like a raid where we're low on people.  I prefer to FA myself, put on my RBG, and melee with my 45/44 2hb than nuke with that crapass nuke.  It offends my delicate sensibilities.<br />

<br />
(15% and 13% are somewhat arbitrary picks-- if you could represent an answer using R% for resist percent and C% for crit percent, that would be great)<br />
<br />

<br />
I stayed up til 4 am last night doing similar calculations, but I guess I'm way off (actually, your numbers seem a lot more conservative and better, and they probably show that Tears are worse than what I'm showing them to be here) (EDIT: see following post to see recalculations using your numbers) :<br />
<br />
(amazing the things you can do when you're procrastinating studying for Bio)<br />
<br />
Assumptions: 15% resist rate, 13% crit rate<br />
<br />
0.34% chance of 0 dmg<br />
5.0% chance of 650 dmg<br />
25.74% chance of 1300 dmg<br />
47.4% chance of 1950 dmg<br />
18.6% chance of 2600 dmg<br />
2.7% chance of 3250 dmg<br />
0.13% chance of 3900 dmg<br />
<br />
...average Tears of Saryrn damage with Fury of Magic 3 = 1868 dmg<br />
<br />
4.2 damage per mana (1868 dmg/450 mana)<br />
104 dps (1868/(6 casting time + 12 refresh time)) <br />
<br />
(breakdown: )<br />
0 (.3%), 1.4 (5%), 2.9 (26%), 4.3 (47%), 5.8 (19%), 7.2 (3%), 8.7 (.1%) damage per mana<br />
0 (.3%), 36 (5%), 72 (26%), 108 (47%), 144 (19%), 181 (3%), 217 (.1%) dps<br />
<br />
Compare that to Velium Strike damage with Fury of Magic 3 + Anger of E'ci (see other comparison thread for details)<br />
<br />
3.5-4.1 damage per mana<br />
105-122 dps<br />
<br />
...or Bane with Burning Affliction iv<br />
<br />
4.3-6.2 damage per mana<br />
72-103 dps<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryrn pros in LDoN:<br />
damage increases even more with at least two targets<br />
damage can be spread among multiple close targets<br />
agro is smaller than both velium strike and dots<br />
allows for two canni 4's while you wait for refresh<br />
can sometimes partially resist<br />
Tears of Saryrn cons in LDoN:<br />
very resist dependant spell<br />
can hurt yourself (need to pause or readjust or target appropriately to cast)<br />
need to malos probably to achieve 15% resist rate<br />
damage you achieve is really quite variable and unpredictable<br />
slow and bulky enough to be too late to cast when a mob is at 10%<br />
each wave tends to be all or none, but can be partial<br />
breaks root<br />
unwieldy around mezzes and rootparks<br />
slow refresh time (hard to swap in and out)<br />
<br />
Looking at the above numbers and pros/cons, I've come to the conclusion that if I<br />
have the AAs and the right focuses, Tears of Saryrn is just too unwieldy, unpredictable,<br />
and inflexible compared to velium strike or bane for the tiny amount of edge that it<br />
may or may not give.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It may be that I am missing some critical piece of information, but why does nobody but me use Spear Of Torment?<br />
<br />
I have the scaled avatar's gloves, which give me a 0-20 percent mana savings.  If I am using a mage focus item, I get a 0 - 20 percent increase to damage.<br />
<br />
So instead of 675 damage for 275 mana, I'm actually getting (at a minimum, since this does not include the savings from SCM3 which would apply to either Spear Of Torment or Velium Strike):<br />
<br />
675 - 810 for 220 - 275 mana<br />
<br />
Admittedly, this is still not as much damage as velium strike, but it casts fast.  My normal routine is something like this:<br />
<br />
SoT -&gt; cann4 -&gt; SoT -&gt; cann4 -&gt; SoT -&gt;[repeated a few times] -&gt; c5 -&gt; Q<br />
<br />
I find that if I am able to do a c4 between nukes, I'm able to keep my mana pool in better shape.  If I am using Velium Strike, I get less cann4s in, which leaves my mana pool hurting.<br />
<br />
It also stands to reason that if you cast 100 spear of torments, and 70 velium strikes, you are going to have more crits with the spears. <br />
<br />
SO:  What am I missing?  It seems like everyone else prefers Velium Strike.</div></div><hr />

Similar pros and cons to velium strike with the added cons that there is no simple item you can get like ornate sceptre for added damage, you need ornate gloves for mana efficiency, and there is a fizzle adjust of 10 on spear of torment.  It's poison based.  Also, spear of torment tends to be all or none damage, right?  Not sure.  I would probably switch to spear of torment if I had scale avatar gloves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the Optimal DPS though if you have EP Gloves all damage focus items and whatnot. Alternating between the 2 nukes, SoT and VS, will most likely net you the best DPS due to recast time. Not sure though.<br />

<br />
Both Velium Strike and Spear of Torment have recast of 2.25, same as any other spell, so no, recast doesn't come into it.<br />
<br />
For plain DPS, Spear of Torment is better, but is less efficient.<br />
<br />
With Scaled Avatar gloves the efficiency is very similar, assuming no other mana saving effect. With Rosrak's gloves (elemental), Spear of Torment is actually more efficient.<br />
<br />
Personally, I prefer Spear of Torment to Velium Strike, because I prefer the shorter cast time, which gives me more time to canni, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to go all into the number crunching, though. I use Tears of Saryrn if a mob will last long enough, and there's no mezzed around. I use Spear of Torment for a quick blast.<br />
<br />
I don't have any nuking AA, and it'll be a while before I do.<br />
<br />
925 is more damage, and with mage focus it can go over 1000, but when you see wizards and mages hitting routinely for 2000-3000 without even critting, it doesn't seem that important.</div></div><hr />

Ornate and elemental gloves have the exact same focus effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ornate and elemental gloves have the exact same focus effect.<br />
<br />
Nope, I thought that originally, but look again:<br />
<br />
Ornate: http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=13569<br />
Elemental: http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=13579<br />
<br />
Effect on Ornate is Saryrn's Venom, 20% mana saving on Spear of Torment.<br />
Effect on Elemental is Saryrn's Torment, 25% mana saving on Spear of Torment.<br />
<br />
By my calculations, this makes the difference between Spear of Torment being marginally less efficient than Velium Strike, and being slightly more efficient than Velium Strike.</div></div><hr />

Improved Damage effects only work up to the percentage that's listed on Lucy.<br />
Burst of Flame does 5 damage.<br />
Less than 20% of 5 damage is less than 1 damage.<br />
It looks like EQ rounds all fractions down, so you never do that 1 damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">This was just something I was thinking about, but regarding the SoT Vs. VS discussion, assume that you had 30 seconds in which to do your DPS each fight:<br />
<br />
Velim Strike<br />
7.8 + 2.25 = 10.05 seconds per velium strike (except the last one, obviously, which will not include the 2.25 second recast time)<br />
<br />
So, you could do 3 casts in ~28 seconds.  That would cost you 900 mana.  That would do 2775 damage.<br />
<br />
Spear Of Torment:<br />
4.2 + 2.25 = 6.45 seconds per spear of torment (except the last one, obviously, which will not include the 2.25 second recast time).<br />
<br />
So, you could do 5 casts in 30 seconds.  That would cost you 1375 mana.  You would do 3375 damage.<br />
<br />
Looking at this, the question seems to be &quot;do you want to do your damage efficiently or do you want to do the most possible damage in the same amount of time?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is all assuming no focus items and no crits.  Using spear of torment, you will have more chances to crit, but for a lesser amount.<br />
<br />
I'm not the strongest math-wise, so I'm not going to figure out what the numbers would be if you had a focus item, or if you were to crit once during those 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is that both spells have something to offer, and your preference is largely going to depend onwhat you want from the spell (unless I completely messed up the math and am now being laughed at and ridiculed by many).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hmm you analyze Velium Strike with a Anger of solusek item but don't annalyze Bane with a Burning affliction item+ Crown of ambivalence item=p<br />
<br />
Look again, friend :)  I have Velium Strike without anything, Bane without anything, Velium Strike with Anger of E'ci, Bane with Burning Affliction IV, Velium Strike with Anger of E'ci and Fury of Magic 3.<br />
<br />
Crown of ambivalence wouldn't play TOO much of a role here because (1) we're mostly interested in dps, and (2) since the mobs die so quickly, any dot extension might be wasted, so it's better not to consider it in calculations and just say that ambivalence will of course make Bane better.<br />
<br />
You'll note that I didn't analyze spellcasting haste either, or haste of solusek, would make a vast difference between nukes and dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>NipperRipper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hey Grammar,<br />
I believe your numbers are right. I was assuming that after casting the spell you had a 13% chance of getting a crit, but it is more likely that after getting a hit you then get a 13% chance of getting a crit. So if I redid my calculations assuming that 15% you would get a miss, 13% of the remaining 85% you would get a crit (11.05%), and the rest you would get a normal hit (73.95%) then our numbers would match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">On the other hand, quite a few shaman have scaled avatar boots, which will give you mana preservation IV, making Velium Strike the victor when considering efficiency, even if you do get the gloves.<br />
<br />
That's a mistake that people keep making when comparing poison nuke vs cold nuke mana efficiency.<br />
<br />
A great many shamans have a mana preservation item of some sorts and preservation items do not stack.<br />
<br />
A 20 percent mana savings gained on the poison nuke is not pure savings if you still have mana preservation of some sort working when casting velium strike i.e. preservation of xegony on elemental boots.</div></div><hr />
