<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gizbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was in CoM the spectral courier poped twice all he droped was this scroll thing no students log is there a new mob for that or do i just have the worst luck in all the world. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 droppings of the courier and no log, is not bad luck, it is very typical. I believe I had to kill him about 10 times, granted they were spread out over many different times, but he finally dropped the log, on the 10th kill..  Good luck, maybe you'll get him sooner..</div></div><hr />

Matches my experiences and when helping friends.  Sometimes it was near-immediate, other times it was over days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It took me two or three tries to get the Spectal Courier to drop the Student's Log also. Don't get discouraged. Hang in there and it will drop. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, I must have got lucky. I got my scroll the first time I killed him. I didnt even know it was that hard to get. A monk and I temaed up to get it because he needed a quest item off the same mob. He popped within 10 minutes on hunting. Now if I could only get that damn tear! AARRRRGGGH! :mad: <br />
