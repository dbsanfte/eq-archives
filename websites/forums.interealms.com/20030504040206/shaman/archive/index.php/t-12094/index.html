<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So its that time again, farming for malo and other 60 spells for guildmates.  We have been clearing Guardian Wurms and Ancient Elder Wyverns from Skyfire on a daily basis, yet it seems we only average 2 spells for about 7 kills per trip.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember with my past level 60 shaman that they would on average drop closer to 5 to 6 spells per clearing, usually 1 or 2 spells per mob with the occasional empty corpse.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

I think Guardian Wurms were ninja stealth nerfed. After PoP came out I decided to solo these guys for spells for cash but I never got anything really. I probably soloed about 20 Guardian Wurms over the coarse of about a month and got like 6 crap spells. I think they were nerfed as PoP lvls do make them fairly trivial. I dunno, maybe I was just very very very unlucky.</div></div><hr />
