<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, did it with a friend on Saturday with 58 Pally, 57 War, 55 SK tanking him and everyone with a heal spell healing (3 groups total, 3 clerics, 2 shammies and 2 druids I think, shammies and druids all sub-58).  Had all melee him charge him at 20%, lot of dead peeps, but he went down.  I did mine 2 weeks ago with 3 fire pets, no problem. YMMV<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You definitely have enough.  I did it this past weekend using two main tanks and only one had just over 4K hps fully buffed(paly).  The other main tank was just under 4K, like 3968 or something.  I did my turn in, tried to heal myself but it didn't work, i had 3100 hps.  the two tanks moved in while the healers kept them alive - only 2 clerics, one played by me.  We had no KEI chanters, so all they had was CII.  After a little while of the main tanks going at it all others went in.  They all got wiped and Rak went down and we had one tank standing, the paly.  average lvl of the raid was 53(according to raid box) and we had 3 groups.  We did it again a short time later for another shammy with one mage firepet.  Pet started and after a time the tanks all joined in.  We all felt pretty good because it was a big accomplishment with the folks we had, at least we felt that way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have the cleric CE you right before you do the hand in (or alternately if you have it, you can torpor yourself), just to give you a buffer of HP. Helps to keep you alive, usually long enough to get a heal off and someone to taunt him off<br />
<br />
edit: oops my mistake, you are only 52. However the other shaman can torpor you (if they have it, and are in your group), but Celestial Elixer works just as well.</div></div><hr />
