<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so they don't wanna let us heal the way clerics or even druids do.  Instead of tweaking, adding 100hp to our heal for 50 mana or something, why not give us a different angle.  Some examples:<br />
<br />
- moderately small heal, fast casting, very high mana<br />
- very large heal, but over 3 or 4 ticks (faster and larger than Q, but significantly more mana)<br />
- An HP transfer type heal.  Not talking 1:1 or anything silly, but let us force away some of our health to heal a groupmate.  I know this is a little like Necros, but we'd have more like a blast heal.  I think this fits along the cannibalize paradigm really well.  Maybe allow us to dump 10% of our hp to heal 10% for someone else; obviously, there are serious balance issues here to consider, but I think with the right mana and reuse timers it would add a nice level of stackability to shamans in a raid situation.<br />
- &quot;manaburn&quot; heals.  No, not exactly, but let us drop a % of our mana on a very large heal, perhaps even nearing complete heal.  I know this is taboo, but its a level 39 spell for christs sake, we should be able to cast it for 1/3 or o1/4 of our mana.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.  I don't want to see shaman become primary healers necessarily, but I'd really like to feel more useful in a raid situation when there are 2 others there.  Please note that I've no GoD spells, much like a very large portion of the rest of the shaman I know, and I hate to think that the only way I'll be balanced is to obtain them.  Difficult to obtain spells should not be the only way to make us useful again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't take this the wrong way, &quot;Tnargs 2000&quot; would be nice I guess, but I was trying to elicit something a little more creative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sidvic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since it looks like they are adjusting the HoT line for us, I'd like to suggest a few things there:<br />
<br />
1. Make the new HoT really big - 1000 a tick or better.<br />
2. Move our HoTs to the shortbuff box.<br />
3. Permit some limited stacking of HoTs - move ours to a different slot than the clerics HoTs.<br />
4. Permit our healing AAs to work on HoTs.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I'd also like better direct heals, but I suspect we're not going to get a huge upgrade there and, whatever we get, we'll still be well below clerics and druids with fights that I have to believe are only going to have more and faster dps being dealt out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to have to disagree.  As they currently work, our HoTs aren't ever going to be the use a direct heal spell will be.  I don't care how high you crank it up, it's still got 6 seconds of pounding between tics (and it's still single target).  So, assuming you try to balance with a big HoT, that means you first cast a HoT.  Then a quick heal. Pause 3 secs, quick heal.  Pause 3 secs, quick heal.  Etc.  You will have to quick heal between tics for high dps mobs.  You're still casting 3 spells for every one that a cleric or druid might cast, you're forced to do some pretty exact timing, and god help you when your HoT wears off.  That also means you can't malos on inc and slow.<br />
<br />
We desperately need a single target fast heal quick enough and large enough to give us a second chance to slow--and we currently don't have one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What we need is a way to keep a tank alive against an unslowed mob.  In high level content the length of the fight, compared to the mitigation level and cast time of Malx+Slow is just totally out of whack to the point that it doesn't pay to Slow the mob.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with having Slow removed from the current / new content (by encounter/mob design).  What I have a problem with is not giving us the tools to deal with that content.</div></div><hr />
