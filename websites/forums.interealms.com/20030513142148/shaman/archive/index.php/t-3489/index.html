<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick outline for Vah Shir Shamans, since I did not see anything else here that really applied to them. Do your obvious things such like turning in your guildmaster note and your citizenship quest. Guides on the citizenship quests can be found on Allakhazam. If you go through all this, it will take you to level 3, or almost there. After that, fight in the pit. <br />
<br />
Check out eqtraders.com (Shaman do brewing quests) or allkhazam.com for a list of the class specific quests, you will want to watch for and save the drops you will need for later parts (xakra bile, scorpion blood, etc), and complete all the ones you can as soon as you can. These will get you a nice newbie cloak, a pretty decent shield, some XP, plus you will learn your way around Shar Vahl and Shadeweavers Thicket.<br />
<br />
Having gotten your basic cloak and shield, you should be level 5 or so by now. Here I would recommend working more on your quests as needed, and starting the Ghulam armor quests in Shadeweavers Thicket. These will get you boots, legs, and the xp from the fights should carry you through to level 7. Stick pretty close to the road, and the crossroads guard will help you out if you get into trouble. Blue cons are pretty easy, white and yellow are manageable if careful. Once you get level 7, move to the Paludal Caverns, covered in my next post.<br />
