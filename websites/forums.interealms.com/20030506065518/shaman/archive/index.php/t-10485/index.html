<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fondor73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, not playing my main anymore, selling gear to twink a shaman to play as my new main. Right now i have about 33k budget, and still about 20k if not more, in gear to sell. Can someone(or multiple people) post some good equipment suggestions for all slots(alt will be level 1 so please no level requirements/restrictions)? thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fondor73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/bump, anyone have suggestions? maybe? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CatteNip_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok I will try and remeber how I sorta twinked my shaman.. I just started on SZ so I kinda went to the wis/Resist.. which i am going to change when i get down with this deployment.. Anyway!<br />
<br />
Chest - I got a froglock scale BP  has AC23 Wis and extras<br />
Legs - I have gatorscale - wis again<br />
wrist - go for bone chip bracer<br />
Primary - slime coated harpoon.  Wis and nice Dmg.. will healp with low lvl melee.<br />
Secoundary - charred gaurdina shield/ SBS(for PvP)<br />
Range - Jaded spear thing  wis/Runed bone fork(PvP)<br />
waist - <br />
<br />
those are just the ones off the top of my head.  The route i took for twinking was I tried to get gear that would give focus on my spells.. like extended efflication - mana preservation - and the one that make buffs last longer.  Everytime I cast I get like 3 effects going off. Sorry for such a vage respnse but no one else has posted.. Also I bougt resist gear.. and i feeled all my slots.  Get a ikkie regen BP for when you get canni.. I got all my gear for less the 10k.  Just shop smart and do not drop all your plat on one big item.  You have alot more plat then i did so maybe that Tae EW chainmail would be sweet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats a nice budget.....check my magelo for ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get an Ikky BP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have to agree on the ikky bp. I have one and it is just so cool. I would also suggest some cool focus effect items. Having the full set of affliction focus effects is a lot of fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>psykopath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I spent a little bit under 30k for my shaman.  You can look at my magelo to get an idea of what I bought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ganonbum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could probably get better with your budget, but here's what I got with 20k. Still need to grab earrings and a few upgrades, but all in all not too bad. I picked up the death shroud for 3k, super steal as it goes for 10k or so on solusek ro.<br />
