<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well this arguement isnt going to be for all levels so lets just make it clear and say, im talking about the 60+ monk.<br />
<br />
The other day i was in PoM playing around when the zone was fairly new still, a few days after revamp. Well im in there have a good time with buffed up and hasted/ mage alpha puppy. Im DoTing and raining and meleeing, having a grand old time when this monk zones in. I see him running around and as i usualy do i am watching his health to see if he needs help, its just a common practice for me anymore. Anyway, PoM isnt like soling BoT ofcourse, but the mobs do hit pretty hard for a melee to solo id say, but this monk was burning through mobs faster then i could with puppy/DoT/Rains. Now this isnt what suprises me, monks are known for the dps, its one of their roles, but what gets me is that he is doing this all without down time. He is just moving from mob to mob and burning through them really fast then picking up another.<br />
<br />
So this makes me wonder, even though you cant be to bright if you argue monks have not had a cut in power through various nerfs, when i witness this it doesnt make me have much sympathy. Where is the weak monk that everyone complains about, cause 1-50 a melee with this ability is unheard of, i mean iver seen monks solo before and do it well at 50+ but not like this. This cat wasnt even bind wounding, he was literly chain pulling. <br />
<br />
Where am i supposed to feel bad for this class again ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any class with elemental gear and Time gear is gonna completely own you if you don't have such things.  Which you don't so there u go.  I have more AA's/better gear so I'd probably burn thru the mobs faster than you too.  And others have better gear than me so they'd trash me in kill speed.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, it wasn't the uber high level monks that got hit so hard with the nerf stick.  It was the midlevel ones without uber gear that got hurt the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A very well equipped melee can take a surprisingly low amount of damage from lowish mobs. And a lot of monks are iksar + funghi + other regen gear and thus regaining 50+ HP a tick in addition to lifetap on their weapons. Monks do it a bit better, for various reasons, but if he was owning then any melee with his level of gear could. Indeed I dare say a BL would be even more upsetting to you.<br />
<br />
That said, I'd still be more likely to think he has a botted healer nearby.<br />
<br />
The last run in I had was a L65, well geared and very well AA'd monk absolutely astounded that he'd soloed a blue con (using mend, stonestance and ending on low health). The mob being the sun revenants in the grey (L55).<br />
<br />
The low geared monks are hilarious, getting the crap kicked out of them in a disturbingly rangerish fashion.</div></div><hr />

I am willing to join your group, you can dispell all buffs from me and you can watch me use just self buffs, I will have 1623ac and 6523hp and 1600atk.<br />

Then you are welcome to come back here and post exactly what you saw.<br />

You can inspect me at anytime to make sure that I am not cheating by removing peices of gear.<br />

I have been to the revamped PoM, unless they changed it before it went live, there is no way in hell I can 'burn thru' a load of mobs without down time.<br />

I tried soloing a Bixie it took me inner flame and mend just to get the thing dead and I was at 25% health by the end of it.</div></div><hr />

This is my magelo btw.<br />

Feel free to browse thru it, I think I am missing 2 Disease Resist that I got recently, but apart from that (and the fact that LDoN Auguments and PoTime + effects are still not registered) everything is in Order.<br />
<br />
My HP/AC/ATK have been manually adjusted, either by the current (AC/ATK) adjustment parts of magelo or (HP/AC) by upping my Charm form 100% to 185% to cover LDoN Auguments.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking...oops what if they changed the zone? Made it a lot easier from when I was there?<br />
<br />
So I ran there just now, thought I would log in.<br />

How many mobs do you think I could solo like this? 2 if I used Mend and perhaps Innerflame in the next fight?<br />

I say this poster is a liar.<br />
<br />
edit -<br />
<br />
You have to ignore my DPS I hit a Finishing Blow for 32k of damage and so of course my DPS is huge 500+.<br />
<br />
I took the finishing blow out.<br />
<br />
My DPS is 143dps damage taken by the mob is 13,242.<br />
<br />
Just to give you a fairer idea of what the mob damage taken is. As EQComp is saying 45k because of the 32k hit.<br />
<br />
http://www.kefen.btinternet.co.uk/PoMFight2.html<br />
<br />
I uploaded it here, I did not want to 'adjust' the first parse though, as i wanted you to see it untouched. I have removed ONLY the Finishing Blow from this parse and nothing else.<br />
<br />
As I said in my original post if any Shaman who posts here would like to come to PoMischief with me and watch this happen, they are free to do so.<br />
<br />
re-edit<br />
<br />
Someone will no doubt notice that damage done doesn't = damage recieved by the mob.<br />
<br />
This is EQComp, for some reason it gives Proc - Yak as my DS (take a look it says 8 damage 4 times, unlikely to get a set of partial resists that consistent)<br />
<br />
There is another part in EQComp that puts in 1,175 damage from 8 Procs (ranging from 250 - crit 125 Ykesha proc on one weapon to 100 - secondary Ykesha proc on other weapon)<br />
<br />
Just so you are not confused by the maths and wondering where 1k of damage disappeared to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I say this poster is a liar.<br />
I don't think he was purposely lying. As someone else pointed out, the Monk could have had a botted Cleric around CHing him after each fight.<br />

What I wrote on the Monkly-Business message boards, where this thread is linked.<br />
<br />
Either the Monk was:<br />
<br />
1, Fully Raid buffed<br />
2, Had someone helping him the poster didn't see<br />
3, The poster is a liar<br />
<br />
So I wasn't so harsh after a moment to think about it.<br />
<br />
It really doesn't help monks with posts like this, we are in a poor state compared to both the game and the relative power of other classes.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help when other classes have posts like these on their boards, this post is blatantly false, even with full raid buffs and 8700hp and 1700ac, I would STILL struggle to &quot;Burn thru endless mobs with no downtime&quot;<br />
<br />
The ONLY way to do that is with another character backing me up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The following is cut and pasted from  a post few months back (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15465 ).    <br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Long post from an ex-monk.<br />
<br />
The class actually is pretty messed up. The mitigation nerf is only a tiny part. Several fundamental changes have, like some norrathian spotted owl, displaced this class. Please bear with me while I try to describe what I've watched transpire over the last two years.<br />
<br />
Pre-Velious, monks had crappy armor, healthy innate AC and avoidance skills, the best weapons, and excellent DPS. They made fantastic partners for shaman – killed things fast and, against a 75% slowed mob, took mild damage. We had crappy heals and they had crappy HP’s. Synergy.<br />
<br />
Velious came out and monk quest armor was still junk. NToV was a different story. Verant went Monty Hall on All/All gear with huge AC and HP’s. Monks began to close the gap with tanks. If you didn’t need /disc defensive or taunt, monks made decent light tanks for experience grinding. This was not a terrible thing, IMO.<br />
<br />
Luclin ships and Verant treats us to boss mobs with insane attack ratings and just silly amounts of HP’s. With attack that high AC becomes nearly moot. It’s going to hit hard. Some guilds began to use monks as rampage tanks since they had the best chance of sidestepping the attack. Other classes begin to get worked up. Tanks feel threatened. Melees are disgusted at well equipped monks with fungis they see soloing non-stop in Velk’s. Let’s admit it – it’s really easy to dislike monks. The class attracts a lot of arrogant jerks and feign death is the ultimate griefing tool. We’ve all had mobs dropped in our laps from some iksar named Slamfoo Kickinutz.<br />
<br />
The next big change – NPC Casters. These guys used to be pretty stupid, never flipping beyond page one of their spell books. Overnight they become deadly. For a few days players are slaughtered with high level nukes from low level mobs. Thankfully they turned it down a notch.<br />
<br />
Then came the resist change. It’s hard to describe but it used to be your innate resists gave you pretty good partial resists but levels didn’t help much -- greens could root you. Afterwards, greens landed fewer spells but your innate resists became less effective against mobs in your level range. Nukes hit hard.<br />
<br />
These two changes made splitting way more fatal for monks. Got of bunch of corpses somewhere nasty? Monks used to be the answer but now they just add another body. Doesn’t matter at all in PoP -- graveyards.<br />
<br />
October 2002 brought the manaburn nerf, the modrod nerf, and the monk mitigation nerf. SoE spelled out the first two in great detail, but only made vague comments about the last. They didn’t want monks to have the high AC gotten from All/All gear but they didn’t want to go and tweak a ton of items already owned by players of every class. Their solution? Give monks an inherent, hidden, AC penalty. Monks become the only class with a mitigation handicap.<br />
<br />
Setting aside the actual impact on gameplay for a moment – monks psychologically feel both crippled and punished. They worked just as hard as any other class for their items. Why should their equipment give less return on investment as the SAME ITEM worn by another? It was demoralizing.<br />
<br />
Now, back to the actual effect. It appears (from testing, because SoE wouldn’t say squat) that monks were given an AC penalty of around –200. What did this do? The high end monks with 1450 AC now had an effective AC of 1250 and tanked pretty much like they always did. So the nerf missed it’s mark. Who did it hit? Low end monks. The player with 800 AC who now has 600. You folks know what losing 200AC at lower levels will do. With better gear and a ton of AA's, it can be surmounted.<br />
<br />
PoP comes out. SoE wants to try a completely different approach than Luclin and gives us mobs with less hitpoint but hit like Mack trucks. This killed monk soloing anyway. It killed shaman tanking IN TEH FACE too (ok, some still do but rare). It gave warriors back their jobs. Then the warriors lost their job to knights because of aggro on demand. Sorry guys. Monks, who have no taunt and (usually) lack the mitigation and hitpoints, are delegated to the job of rogue-light. Get behind it and press attack.<br />
<br />
PoP gameplay turns out to be pretty shallow. Pull kill. Pull kill. Ala Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Instead of using monks to split, it’s way faster and convenient to let the enchanter, or druid, or ranger, or bard, or cleric, or paladin pacify it. Splitting used to be an art form where your senior guild monks would teach the younger ones the trade. People used to be impressed by tough split. What was skill is now just mana. Bards, not monks, were given a 100% memory wipe skill making them the ultimate puller.<br />
<br />
PoP also gave all melees access to some pretty incredible weapons. You can get a 50/44 Windblade on my server for 18K. It would cost me 90K to get something comparable. Remember how I said that Velious blurred the line between tank and monk AC? PoP has blurred the line on DPS as well.<br />
<br />
The last aspect is just dissention. Many players perceive monks as gimped or whiners -- either way they aren't as welcome in groups. The monk boards have been filled with complaining for ten months. Even within the class people can’t agree. There’s a ton of bad feelings surrounding monks. You know those “what partner?” threads we see every other week? Two years ago it was monk, monk, monk! Today, shaman have written them off.<br />
<br />
I don’t ask anyone to agree absolutely with my assessment. The only thing I can tell you is I miss the days when being a monk was fun. It’s not fun anymore so I put him away.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I briefly went into PoM the other day with a monk and an enchanter.  He went down like tissue paper.  <br />
<br />
He's not well geared of course.  <br />
<br />
I also went down once like tissue paper.  Some mischievous something tore through me.  I had 5000 hp and CA3.  Not very good, but I can't conceive a monk soloing these mobs without downtime.  <br />
<br />
Max hit I saw on me was 458, and the enchanter reported he was once hit for 500.  They hit pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Maybe I should rephrase that. Monks were never meant to be able to solo nonstop without downtime from level 1 to 65.<br />
<br />
But they could before, hence the nerfs in the past.  They're where they should be now.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but this is just ridiculous. The Nerf happened prior to the release of PoP. Monks stopped being able to solo effectively after the nerf... yet the level cap wasn't raised to 65 until after the release of PoP. Monks could never solo effectively to 65.<br />
<br />
The last line of the second quote is so bizarre that it leaves me in awe. how on earth is a monk 'where they should be'? They can't solo effectively, and there's next to no reason to invite them to a group. Other than being completely worthless most of the time, yeah I suppose they're doing all right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Depends on how long this kept up.  What's that new Cleric mitigation buff?  That alone would make a huge difference.  A leftover DS, or DS potions.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of the stories of some guy &quot;soloing&quot; Naggy - with two bots in the sidelines, and a couple of packs full of potions.  <br />
<br />
I hit PoM last week, with a pretty poorly equipped 55 paladin friend.  Didn't do too great (I probably could've tanked them better), but these things aren't any worse than PoN, so far as I could tell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Monks and warriors need some major help. Monks are essentially the bottom rung of pulling classes in ldon, far behind bards, chanters and even clerics (on easy mode). A bard can do their job 10 times better, and contributes dps as opposed to being fd to split. Its really aggravating to watch yoru supposed dps class spend half the time lying down.  Not to mention the utility a bard has. Monk weapons have not scaled properly vs other classes, and they have lost a good amount from there. Monks are now average dps, and average pullers, which is a shame. They need something to make em more attractive in an exp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grazel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well this arguement isnt going to be for all levels so lets just make it clear and say, im talking about the 60+ monk.<br />

<br />
<br />
I think you answered your own question :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I started playing this game with my brother-in-law and leveled all the way up with him. He took a few months off after the initial monk nerf because he could no longer solo very low old world (solb) blues with full buffs when I wasn't around. That was with the best possible buyable monk gear at the time. He spent a lot of time and effort raising the plat to buy things like a fungi and flayed barb leggings. <br />
<br />
Now with LDoN, monks are pretty near useless. Don't have time to split in adventures so pacify or just pull 5-6 if your group can handle it. Can't do as much dps as a ranger, rouge, or BL might as well just get one of them. He doesn't even log on anymore, went back to playing old muds because no one wants his class in a group unless I'm putting it together. <br />
<br />
Barm's post hits the nail on the head. All of the changes are completely demoralizing to monks. Weapons? Great staff of the four winds is one of the best monk weapons for a non VT/Elemental guild. Warriors and knights I believe can use it too. Monks used to have awesome weapon choices, now they get same as everyone else for the most part. <br />
<br />
I had a group in ldon a few weeks back with my bro and a shadow knight in it. First thing the SK asks is if the chanter or cleric will be pulling. If that doesn't show the core of the problem, I don't know what does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm not really sure what this is supposed to accomplish.   This actually reminds me of threads on other boards that talk about how some uber_shaman_01 soloed some big mob so we are overpowered and should be nerfed.  <br />
<br />
Do you know any monks?  I know some 65 monks (albeit not POT equipped).  If they are lucky they have friends who can get them into groups.  If not then they are hosed.  As someone else mentioned all kinds of classes can pacify, making split pretty much obsolete.  They can't tank and other classes do far more DPS than they do.  I feel pretty bad for them myself.  I've done like 70 or 80 LDON missions, and I believe a monk came on one of them.  I've sure never heard anyone asking for a monk for any kind of exp group.  <br />
<br />
I don't think this game should be balanced around what any POT equipped character is able to accomplish, as the vast majority of players are not in that category.  The average monk brings little to groups and can't viably solo at 65.  So basically there is nothing at all for them to do (I can't speak to monks role on raids as I can't stand raiding and don't do it, but one can't level to 65 raiding, so there really needs to be something else they can do).  So to speak to why you should feel sorry for them, it'd be because they have very little to do and little to contribute to a group and can't really solo.<br />
<br />
If they nerfed shamans that badly I'd have to play another character.  I'd be sad, but if you can't find a group and you can't solo why play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Add to this the fact that nearly all the monk armor from PoP is shared with beastlords and druids and you have a nearly intolerable situation.  Not only do monks suffer from an effective 150 - 200 AC penalty versus all other classes, but their displayed AC in end game gear is 300 - 500 AC below that of the &quot;tank&quot; classes.  <br />
<br />
And as has been stated, monk weapons really haven't kept pace with the increases given other classes.  A well equipped 65 monk in PoTime gear doesn't do much more damage than a 65 monk with gear from Ssra temple, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's kinda funny.. when making a monk, the following details are stated:<br />
<br />
Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else.<br />
Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, though it's not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone.<br />
<br />
*shrugs* perhaps by &quot;adventuring&quot; they mean sitting down with lfg turned on for hours on end.<br />
<br />
sure monk AC was too high from the ntov days.. but now most pop armor is HALF the AC of our older gear... the screw up they made on gear has been corrected, the mitigation nerf is no longer needed.<br />

Besides, how was this monk equiped? What were his stats? Did you by chance notice a healing bot nearby for him?<br />

Just a few details that are kinda required to Know, before you make a call like that on any one.<br />

And as for monk's being where they should be, could you please describe just where that is? Or is this another case of class envy involved?<br />

FD seriously needs some work to make monkly pulling useful again though.  I'll take em for ldon, I'll take em for planar, I'll take em for anything but duo.  Why not duo?  No taunt and poison dots/slow/malo generates a LOT of aggro, I have to tank em myself.<br />
Some of the very best ldon groups I've been in included at least one monk.  At the same time, most of the very worst included an enchanter (NOT a knock on chanters, mezzing just hasn't worked out very well), your milage may vary.<br />
Was in pov a couple weeks ago, was level 58 at the time.  Group included myself, cleric, 3 monks!!!, and a mostly afk necro.  The monk army ruled that day.  Later on, we hooked up with another group to go into inner to kill sleepwalker, and after the sk tank and clerics all die, all left alive was me, a druid from other group..... and two monks.  After killing sleepwalker, all died from repops but myself (I gated when ordered to).<br />
I'm delighted to include monks.  Of course, I'm just 60, so things might change.</div></div><hr />

trmonk is one of the few ubers that understand the problem.  Most time-gear monks claim that the rest are just whining, which basically shoots the majority of monks (who have 3k hp, 1100 ac, so just imagine how quickly they die) in the foot.<br />

was grouped with a elemental monk in pov with the rebb from Jiva augmented with an extra ldon proc. His mitigation was on par with level 60ish warriors I had grouped with (only eyeballing how much damage he takes from a slowed gloem/crawler), no one could touch him in terms of aggro (max dex after my buffs). Had no idea what type of gear he had.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Berik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Its a very very silly thing to say that monks can solo to 60..<br />
<br />
**** get this, THEY CAN with the right equipment.<br />
<br />
Here is another one, ANY class can with the right equipment so that is not a valid statement.<br />
<br />
Yes a monk with a Fungi and a Tranquil staff could solo to 60 pre nerf.<br />
<br />
At the time of the monk nerf, those to items cost around 80kpp plus on most servers.  Now what class couldn't solo with 80kpp in equipment?<br />
<br />
Just because a class can solo, doesn't mean its a good way to get exp.  And who cares if a class can solo when they can't find a group?  Shamans/Bstlords can solo to 60 with near no gear so don't bring up that they can solo to 60 idea up, its just silly.<br />
<br />
There is so so much hate for monks these days all because everyone was yelling back in Velious and Luclin, **** they can solo they can solo!<br />
<br />
Here are a few other classes that could solo like no other back then and still to this day, beastlords, shamans, wizards, necros, mage's..wait I see a pattern here do you?  Any class with a spell book can solo with ease.<br />
<br />
Monks got hit by the nerf bat so hard, and people still hate them.  So much hate, why?  Let it go, please let it go.  Don't hurt someone else's good times in a video game.  Don't be envious, there is no need.  Next time you see that monk just wasting through mobs in PoM, ask him if he wants to duo with you.  Im sure you will both have a good time, and you just might get better exp and have a good time.  Enjoy your time in this GAME, enjoy it while you still can.<br />
<br />
Or we can just keep shouting about how this class can solo and that class can solo..it will only lead to one thing nerfs and more nerfs.  Thats the way SoE reacts, they don't bring other classes up they tear other classes down.</div></div><hr />

A 65 monk with Elem. gear and aa's out the booty, with 1500ac...shoudln't be able to take near the same damage than a 60 warrior whom is not in elem. gear and doesn't have aa and has 200ac less?<br />

Your not going to believe this a monk tanked Fennin Ro, from start to finish.  That is completly uncalled for, I mean this is a complete injustice that any avg monk can do such a thing.  Poor Warriors losing more content to the over powering can owoopass that is monks.<br />

Hmmm I wonder if there's anything left to improve on his gear?<br />
<br />
Nope, monks AREN'T balanced. they are VASTLY underpowered, and need a REAL upping of either their defense capabilities or their DPS. The only other class as hurt as monks is the warrior whose taunt ability really needs to be upped a bit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Barm's post is excellent<br />
<br />
but it forgot 1 major nerf to monks.  POP itemization and AC.<br />
<br />
Plate Tank AC went up from Luclin to POP from 1500ish to 2kish<br />
a 20 to 33% increase in AC<br />
<br />
Monk AC went down/stayed the same.   An Luclin Era uber monk<br />
might have had a 1500 to 1600ish AC.  They have the same, or slightly less now in Plane of Time Gear.<br />
<br />
So not only did Monks suffer a 200 AC Nerf Penalty, Itemization<br />
gave plate tanks up to 500ish more AC then the last expansion.<br />
So your talking about a Tanking Gap of roughly 700 AC.<br />
<br />
At the same time as posted, the gap in monk to plate tank DPS has decreased.   <br />
<br />
The complete and total removal of the nerf won't even be enough<br />
to save this class at this point.<br />
<br />
BTW: prepop soloing to 60.  Was highly friggen dependant on GEAR!<br />
90% of monks saw the value of a Fungi.    90% of Plates were just too dumb to see it.  The old soft cap of AC was 1200ish so many plate tanks using 51 AC crafted BPS or Vindis, or other similiar BPScould have easily withstood the AC loss ((since at that point most were 1400ish))<br />
for the regen.   Basically figure that 15 regen every 6 seconds was reducing a mobs DPS by 2.5.   That is larger reduction in mobs dps<br />
that moving AC from 1350 to 1400.   Also given relatively low DPS of many mobs in old world like Velks.  Reduction of 2.5 was huge<br />
<br />
Also Monks had an advantage of innate haste.  They had 40% more DPS via thier epic then any other soloing melee.  the only other clicky haste at the time was dreadful Mask of Plunder for 20% haste.  Cloak of Sky</div></div><hr />

Man do you remember those days? I do.  I was ALWAYS impressed with a really good monk pulling  a single named from a group of 5 or 6.  The gradual dumbing down of this game really sickens me the most.  It used to be great to hear about soandso and whatshisface duoing a mob that took a solid group.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Don't think monks meant to tank. However their damage and enhancement to the role they have on raids needs to be looked at probably. It is kinda hard for pure melees, as no offence but they are one -dimensional.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Don't think monks meant to tank.<br />
<br />
You know that is your opinion, and you're entitled to it.<br />
<br />
I doubt there is very much that i could say that would change your mind.<br />
<br />
I will however say this.<br />
<br />
If Sony took away your ability to slow, and your ability to place buffs on other people, and you became a poor man's Necro...hey you have a pet? You have DoT's.<br />
<br />
Would you be happy?<br />
<br />
Would you not complain that buffing and slowing is what you have done for the past 3 years, that this was the reason you made your shaman, that it gave you a buzz to do these things and it is why you are still playing your shaman after 3 years? That you liked to land that slow and stick your finger up at the mob and say...Have Some !<br />
<br />
That you didn't like 'just' being a poor man's necro, that you liked being an individual class that had specific skills to bring and had a role in the game?<br />
<br />
So what makes you think that monks are any different from you?<br />
<br />
What makes you think that we are happy about that the fact that after tanking for 4 years, that role was taken away, how do you think we feel about being made into Rogue Lites, or the poor man's rogue?<br />
<br />
How do you think we feel about having our role in the game stripped away bit by bit until we have nothing left to offer but that which other classes do better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Well i know this is a heated subject but let me clear up somethings.<br />
<br />
Im not lying, i have no reason to, i love monks and have no reason what so ever to have class envy. This is my exact recollection of it.<br />
<br />
I was in PoM ALONE, when this monk came in. The staff he was carrying was not something i recognized and was a 2hb. I was fighting have a good old time when i saw him take down a few mobs and i was like ... hmmm<br />
<br />
I started to watch his health and noticed he really wasnt getting low much, although i have to admit i wasnt watching him none stop as i was killing myself. I watched him go form mob to mob without bind wounding himself cause he was in the same area as me. There was no one else in the zone so he wasnt getting CHeals.<br />
<br />
 Now you can think me a lair all you want, but again, why would i lie ?  The point of this post was not to try to get SoE to nerf them more, but was just pure amazement at what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Now if was swaping out weapons and was slowing them and lifetaping or hitting insta heal potions, i dont know. But i know what i did see and that was a monk blowing through mobs faster then i could and with less downtime then me even when i was trying to keep pace with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Berik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I think Tr and I share the same ideas..you know why.<br />
<br />
My main is a 65 monk, whom I really don't play anymore because I almost cry when I see what has become of my class.<br />
<br />
Having the rug you have been standing on for 3yrs yanked out from under you is very crappy.<br />
<br />
I never said monks where supposed to be able to tank aswell as a warrior, paladin, shadowknight...but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to tank at all.<br />
<br />
I made my monk, because it sounded like a fun and entertaining class.  I didn't want to be the button masher that is a warrior.  And I wanted more offensive than a Paladin and Shadowknight.  So I rolled a monk, got my way to 65...get this tanking in my groups when the warrior had to leave.  Why the hell must a group break up just because they can't get a warrior, sk, pally?<br />
<br />
Now Im to much of a hazard, and mana sponge on the cleric and its no where near efficient...oh well I guess will just wait for the warrior/sk/pally to fall in our lap because SoE has deemed it they are the only classes to be tanking..it was to much to allow a monk a step in and keep the group going when the tank left, now we just pack our bags and go home.  <br />
<br />
But thats why I made my Shaman, there needed in groups like no other.  Slower is god, slower is GOD.  And when I can't find a group, no biggie I go solo and gain sometimes better exp than grouping.  Its so nice to be able to have that option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heck with that happening I bet a 65 shammy could tank the mob...<br />
<br />
lets not be silly...<br />
<br />
anyone with 7khp could do what that monk did, and probably do it better.<br />
<br />
I speak from experience, a monk was my main...I don't play him anymore at all...he is broken...utterly....<br />
<br />
Anyone that cant see how broken melee are as a whole, and monks in particular, must play the game while drunk, high, and probably with their eyes closed as well...<br />
<br />
What kind of DPS can you deal out as a shammy without ever running lower than 70 percent mana...I know I can easy do 130dps plus without breaking a sweat...no special gear, just using my spells and my ability to generate mana...<br />
<br />
Do you even begin to realize what kind of gear and buffs a monk must have to get that kind of DPS...<br />

Perhaps it was a Beastlord you saw?<br />

It wasnt a monk.<br />
<br />
Because NO monk in the game can do what you describe.<br />
<br />
NOT ONE.<br />

edit<br />
<br />
Of course with healing pots, any toon in the game could do that, a wizard could tank those mobs dead with just his DS if he had enough healing pots.<br />
<br />
That isn't solo though.<br />
<br />
&quot;are their woes unfounded&quot;<br />

You mean because a monk spent thousands of Plat on healing Pots in the bazaar and was capable of expending tens of thousands of PP just so he could kill mobs that you were killing with ease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Trmonk no class likes being nerfed, but monks never have been meant to tank or should tank. If you want to tank play a sk, pally or warrior not monk. The only thing monks need is a review of their of their abilities on raid and perhaps an increase of damage whether you like it or not.<br />
I can sympathesize that you are no longer in your glory days as teh tank, but I seriously don't think making monks tank as good as warriors/sks/pallies is the answer. <br />
<br />
A monk should tank no better than a rogue or a ranger. The answer would be perhaps an increase of damage, an enhanced run ability and the ability to FD against casters more easily. I also like Thott's suggestion whereby he suggests monks have an AE melee ability although I am unsure about the viability of it. They should have given pure melees new discs lvl 60-65 also really.</div></div><hr />

your post would be funny but post nerf my wizard could tank better than my monk.  my wiz has about 800ac and about 1500hp, my monk was, at the time, 1k ac and about 2khp.  i was grouping with a friend in echo right after the nerf 2 boxing my monk and wiz.  my monk was pulling, my wiz would some aggro with snare/rains - monk was taking more healing than the wizard all night long.  friend finaly told me just not to get hit at all - was running oom healing the monk but was ok healing the rogue.  rogue tanked.<br />
<br />
it's somewhat better.  otoh when my shammy was 5 levels lower and about 200 ac less she was tanking much better than my monk.  as it is she still takes hits better with 200 less ac and 500 less hp.  at least he has stonestance/mend to almost even it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Denor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">As for as far as monks go:<br />
<br />
1. up the DPS somewhat<br />
2. up the migration/defence to about the same as rogue or ranger<br />
3. Look at FD ability or AA's for splitting mobs<br />
4. Maybe look at nerfing lull/pacify (when you can lull/pacify straight through BoTT without much trouble there is something wrong.)<br />
<br />
I don't see a lot of problems with the Monk class that can't be fixed. I usually group with the same people in LDoN and that group is Shaman (me) Druid, Monk, Cleric, and usually 2 other guildies. The monk is always puller and SA. We have no problems and the monk never seems to take to much damage. Buffed i would think the monk as about 6k+ and about 1400 ac. But again i have never played a monk so i am not saying i know your &quot;pain&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">The thing to bear in mind is this.<br />
<br />
I already tank as well as any ranger or rogue.<br />
<br />
Rangers and Rogues make appalling tanks, which is exactly what I am.<br />
<br />
The difference between the classes and why it is acceptable for these classes is simple.<br />
<br />
Rogues trade off all tanking ability to be the absolute best at melee damage (from behind).<br />
<br />
I have the same trade off, but I am not the best melee damage.<br />
<br />
Rangers trade off tanking ability for a host of spells, they are a warrior/druid hybrid after all.<br />
<br />
Monks get no spellbook.<br />
<br />
Where is my trade off?<br />
<br />
The classes that we tank as well as, have traded off their tanking ability for something else.<br />
<br />
Monks have traded off their tanking ability for nothing.<br />
<br />
We have gained absolutely nothing at all, for the loss of our tanking ability.<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury, monks are STILL paying the weight limit penalty, that was our cost for that tanking ability.<br />
<br />
So not only did we not gain anything for our lost tanking ability, we are still paying the price for something we no longer have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I already saw your example and its relevance is limited. Nerfs happen. For example when horses were nerfed a lot of people whined but it was a game change for the best. The mitigation was nerfed first time around then it was upgraded but to the point where monks were not tanks. Monks are not and will not be tanks no matter how idealistic your days of tanking were it won't happen. For all I know your started a monk for this superior ability, back then people said monks were overpowered. <br />
<br />
Your request to be able to tank as a monk is completely absurd and feel free to get angry with me as you so eliquently put it. I really hope that Verant do not give into the whiners and make monks tanks. YES damage upgrade YES improve pulling abilities but tanking come on. Or if monks must tank then handicap their damage so they are in line with warriors, sks and paladins=p Balance&gt;all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I get my tanking back if only I accept just doing ShadowKnight DPS?<br />
<br />
Fine..<br />
<br />
Where do I sign my name?<br />

I get my tanking back, and I probably get an upgrade in Damage too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me try and explain the monk nerf and the semi-rollback of the nerf.  i don't have all the hard numbers in front of me and it's been awhile since i read it all but it goes something like this.<br />
<br />
monk's had high ac per velious itemization and the inherent monk ac bonus.  as you know ac has two parts: mitigation and avoidence, and each class seems to have one or the other higher.  warriors and knights, for instance, have higher mitigation ac than avoidence ac.  monks had higher avoidence ac and lower mitigation ac.  so warriors would get hit more often for less damage while monks would get hit less for more damage.  neither class was getting hit at max or min damage all the time. monks also had an additional 5% avoidence because block works better than parry.  <br />
<br />
what this all ment was that warriors/knights would take damage but it would be predictable and managable,  by that i mean you could estimate how much damage a tank was going to take over say 10 seconds.  (leading to the ch chain but a different story.)  the monks, on the other hand would typicly get hit less often but take more damage in the process.  the damage was streaky and did not make viable MA because you could not predict the rate they would loose HP thus either wasting much cleric mana with 1k CH's or dieing due to the RNG. BUT this is what made them shine as Rampage tanks.  the toon on the rampage is going to get hit for max.  IF a monk is on rampage there is a chance they will be missed and that is what made them great.<br />
<br />
<br />
now here comes the monk nerf.<br />
<br />
First were going to nerf your AC by about 200 from what is shown by your AC number.  Second were going to reduce your mitigation by 20%. So now we have the double wammy!  We not only get hit more often but we take more damage when hit.  <br />
<br />
When they &quot;rolled back&quot; the nerf what they did was change the 20% mitigation penalty to 10%.  So we still get hit more often but mitigate slightly better than before.  This nerf was aimed at the VT level monks but really effected everybody but them and to add insult to injury once you get to pop it doesn't really matter because most mobs hit for max all the time anyway unless your at 2k AC.<br />
<br />
Everybody talks about monks soloing as a reason for the nerf, but people forget why monks could solo.   Bandages.  Even a monk with a fungi used em, hell you could solo without a fungi if you had them.  I did at 51 in DL.  No fungi, no Tstaff, just ID and bandaids.  Heck the reason I was soloing at 51 in DL was to get my bindwounds skill to 201 so I could bind to 75%.  No other class in the game and I mean NONE spend so much time binding wounds.  Heck bind kiting is a fine art.  I could never get the hang of it but thats another way mobs were soloed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my 62 monk has an ac of about 1164 with epic effects and my 62 shaman is about 940 or so.  My monks effective AC is less than my shaman's and he gets hit more because of it.<br />
<br />
Mitigation wise a beastlord or druid will mitigate better than a monk.  All three are in leather but I think monks would be better off in silk.  Put a beastlord and a monk on the same mob, with the same gear.  Hit the mob once and leave attack off.  No pet.  The monk will die first.  Every time.<br />
<br />
Thats the frustration of monks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Faardarr, nicely put, but I think what you are saying is falling on deaf ears.<br />
<br />
Mcroc is somehow fallen under the impression that monks were like demi-gods pre-nerf.<br />
<br />
Since we were soloing such huge mobs as a single Fungus Grove Mushroom, or a Single spider in Velketor, we were quite clearly breaking the game.<br />
<br />
The fact that a wizard at the same time was quadding equal mobs, this means nothing.<br />
<br />
The fact that at the same time, Shaman were soloing Western Waste dragons, this means nothing either.<br />
<br />
We were quite clearly overpowered.<br />
<br />
Nothing you, or I, or anyone else can say will move him from this idea.<br />
<br />
Monks were overpowered and they needed to be nerf'd.<br />
<br />
He is the most annoying of all proponents of the nerf, because he has no idea why monks are overpowered, he just heard Furor or someone else say it once and thats it, we were overpowered, all evidence to the contrary will not mean a thing to him.<br />
<br />
He heard it once, it is the truth.</div></div><hr />

before I got VERY uber and i was just slightly uber, 4500hp unbuffed, 1300ac.<br />

I used to Box in BOT with a shaman.<br />

I used to plant the shaman in the corner, slow the mob on inc, then use FD to keep the aggro off my monk and on the shaman, and let the shaman tank with Quintessence, because he took less damage then the monk.</div></div><hr />

i hate them because the little Feign Death Key lets them be stupid.  and they seem to have the slowest learning curve of all EQ players.<br />
<br />
a monk with a Regen item, is nothing more than a self imposed Train.  he pulls, takes a few hits then flips over while his group wipes.  after the item gets him to full, he wants you to thank him for dragging corpses.<br />
<br />
before run 3, you could step on his neck a little.  now 90% of the time if you group with a monk you don't know; you will be doing CR.<br />

Sony could not take away FD, so they made them group dependent.  good monks get a group, like good rogues.  bad monks get the darwin award.  <br />

It used to be great to hear about soandso and whatshisface duoing a mob that took a solid group. Theres far less of those challenges these days.<br />

Yes monks need an upgrade because they got overly nerfed, yes monks need possibly a damage increase and a further enhancement of their role on raids(via changing a few of their aa possibly), but wanting to tank as good as a tank is a niave belief. I disagree with you end of story now please don't interpret my view as somehow the view that will stop SoE upgrading the monk. Soe I trust can take their own perspective on things, and without actually playing any of the classes you would think they would have the fairest view to an extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How are they supposed to know what is going on without playing any of the classes?  Monks were never as good tanks as Sks Pallys or Wars.  The thing that set monks apart, solo wise and in groups was our resourcefulness.  We used bandages, we sacrificed ac and stats for regen.  Most of us would spend hours learning how to pull in every zone under any imaginable circimstance.  I knew a warrior that used bandages when he soloed.  We would solo side by side for hours doing just as well.  Was a nerf warranted? No, SOE should have fixed the plate classes instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Care to give a reason why?  There's more to tanking than absorbing damage.  My bazaar sk makes a helluva lot better tank than a PoTime guild warrior (I know because we borrowed one hehe), simply due to better aggro management.  At least the gimp warrior had hate proccing weapons and a taunt key, what does a monk have?  So great, this monk has 1500 AC (less than my bazaar sk buffed I might add) but meanwhile the shaman, the wizard, the chanter and the mage are all tanking.  I still don't see why 1500 AC != 1500 AC.  Giving monks their mitigation back would only restore them the ability to solo in Velks and FG, those hotspots of exp, woooooooooooooooooooot.<br />
<br />
Why should monks be the only class in the game w/ a mitigation AC penalty?  If it's because plate &gt; chain &gt; leather, then I damn well better see mitigation nerfs on BST, DRU and all silk wearers next patch.  And better throw in nerfs on chain classes as well, after all, &quot;they were never meant to tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
The part that really makes me laugh is that monks still have a weight penalty and lose AC if they go over it.  Seriously, please explain THAT one to me. :)</div></div><hr />

2. to tank like a sk/pal<br />
3. To have better skills or usefullness to raid/group<br />
4. Better Gear<br />

I think Monks of EQ should start small and see what they can get before asking SoE to recreate the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Trmonk no class likes being nerfed, but monks never have been meant to tank or should tank. If you want to tank play a sk, pally or warrior not monk. The only thing monks need is a review of their of their abilities on raid and perhaps an increase of damage whether you like it or not.<br />
I can sympathesize that you are no longer in your glory days as teh tank, but I seriously don't think making monks tank as good as warriors/sks/pallies is the answer. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but this just isn't right. Monks were competent tanks from day one right up until the nerf. They certaintly weren't the best tank, and their lack of aggro control meant groups had to be more careful with a monk tanking. The advantage was that they usually did better damage then the plate classes. This is what's known as &quot;balance&quot;. A system of tradeoffs where, depending on the situation, one class may be more or less desireable than another with roughly equal frequency. <br />
<br />
Need DPS from your tank? Grab a monk.<br />
Need aggro lock? Grab a knight.<br />
Need raw damage soaking ability? Grab a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
A monk should tank no better than a rogue or a ranger.<br />
<br />
So, are you going to let monks do rogue-level DPS? If not, enhancing their damage isn't going to help the class. If they tank like a rogue, have roughly the same utility as the rogue, and do less damage than the rogue, they've still got problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
The answer would be perhaps an increase of damage, an enhanced run ability and the ability to FD against casters more easily. I also like Thott's suggestion whereby he suggests monks have an AE melee ability although I am unsure about the viability of it. They should have given pure melees new discs lvl 60-65 also really.<br />
<br />
If you won't let monks do damage like rogues or tank better than chain classes, then the answer would be to give monks some form of utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you 100% remove the nerf.   Monks will still not be equal tanks to the plate tanks.  They will be decent tanks.  but still a definite knotch below.<br />
<br />
This was true in day 1 before nerf, and is still true today.<br />
<br />
Reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Agro Management<br />
Of the four classes ((Pal/SK --&gt; War by far ---&gt; who is still greater than a monk by far))<br />
<br />
2) Healing Efficiency.<br />
You want your heals to heal for thier Maximum ((7500 Cleric)) and still<br />
not endanger loss of tank.  Healing Efficiency is when your MA goes from<br />
20% to 100%.   No monk has the hps necessary even with Plane of Time gear for this to work.<br />
<br />
3) Spikey Damage<br />
Monks never took more damage than a plate tank.  They shouldn't.<br />
But thier damage was always spiker.  This further made healing less efficient as you didn't want to wait for the monk to get as low before starting the CH.  Bad Spike = Death<br />
<br />
If you want to argue the realism of Plate should Mitigate Vastly More than Leather.   Monk should Avoid vastly more than plate.<br />
Currently the balance is wrong.   Plate Edge in Mitigation is way way way way way more than the Monk edge in Avoidance.<br />
<br />
Now comparing Monks to Rogues and Rangers.<br />
Rogues have large edge in DPS.  Balance would be Monks Tank better<br />
<br />
Rangers have spells &amp; AM3 ((at many levels of the game Ranger DPS &gt; monk dps as well)).  again balance would be monks tank better.<br />
<br />
4) Gear Itemization &amp; AC soft caps<br />
<br />
The NTOV days of Plate classes and Monks wanting the same gear like Ancient Wyvern is GONE!  the days of monks having equivlent AC is gone<br />
<br />
POP Gear has a huge advantage in AC for plate tanks.<br />
<br />
Also plenty of parsing has shown that with POP/LDON that AC's value continues.  2k AC ((plate topish level)) is vastly supperior than 1600 AC<br />
<br />
SO COMPLETE AND TOTAL NERF REMOVAL, and you still would fine<br />
that Plate Tanks &gt; Monk Tanks.  The difference is monks would go from **** TANKS to OKAY TANKs.</div></div><hr />

Let me give you my opinion on monks.<br />
<br />
To those who say 'monks cant tank, monks are not good dps, monks cant do this, monks cant do that'..<br />
You obviously have never grouped w/ a intelligent and well equiped monk.<br />
My roommate is a 65 monk w/ approx 290 AA. I am a 65 shaman w/ approx 280aa. We duo the valorian guardians, sentries, and valiant spirits in HoH on a regular basis for our AA exp. She pulls wonderfully, she tanks very well, and is not at all hard to heal. Quiscense is all i really need for her, unless i get a bastard mob that resists slow a lot. Even then.. stone stance and/or  mending of the tranquil usual does the job for me.<br />
<br />
Her dps is wonderful, and even when i slow, call on my dog, epic dot, and use tears of saryn she *still keeps aggro*(uses caens bo staff of fury). We are not elemental flagged, we do not have time gear. We have very nice gear. High end, but pre-elemental.  So the claim that &quot;Oh that monk is only good because of their time/elemental gear&quot; just kinda falls flat in my eyes.<br />
<br />
No, she's not perfect. *Of course* a plate class can take more damage, and a pally and SK can pull aggro off of me faster then she can. (Thank you LR5, how i love thee). Yes, pacify from a cleric, chanter, etc can be a bit more quicker for splits *and* she takes more damage then I do if hit fully, but her avoidance is amazing. <br />
But since we prefer duo rather then grouping w/ others, i think she does PRETTY DAMN WELL :) I love monks. lovelovelovelovelove. /hugs all the monks who know how to play the class well.<br />
<br />
My point is: Dont be so judgemental until you really know a class and what they are capable of. ~An open mind is a beautiful thing~.  :) <br />
<br />

Sounds more like you've never played a monk or never played w/ a monk who doesn't have 200+ aa's and raid gear.  I played a monk for a year and a half before I gave up and the sum total of my NO DROP gear was epic + shackle.<br />

Wow, you've discovered how powerful slow, is, good for you!  Swap out the monk for an int caster and guess what, they could also tank a slowed mob- wooot!<br />
<br />
She pulls wonderfully<br />
<br />
Except for any lull/pacify class who would have been a better choice in the example you gave.<br />
<br />
she tanks very well, and is not at all hard to heal. Quiscense is all i really need for her, unless i get a bastard mob that resists slow a lot. Even then.. stone stance and/or  mending of the tranquil usual does the job for me.<br />
Slow is awesome, isn't it?  Ever parse the assbeating your monk friend is taking vs. any other class in equivalent gear? Sounds to me like you're fighting mobs far below your gear.<br />
<br />
Her dps is wonderful<br />
As long as you define wonderful as less than:<br />
ranger<br />
rogue<br />
beastlord<br />
necro<br />
mage<br />
wizard<br />
enchanter that charms<br />
<br />
and even when i slow, call on my dog, epic dot, and use tears of saryn she *still keeps aggro*(uses caens bo staff of fury). <br />
So basically you don't slow on inc, because if you did you'd be tanking for a good long while until Mr. No Taunt pulls the mob off you.  Try loading up the dots instead of rains and see how well it goes.<br />
<br />
We are not elemental flagged, we do not have time gear. We have very nice gear. High end, but pre-elemental.  So the claim that &quot;Oh that monk is only good because of their time/elemental gear&quot; just kinda falls flat in my eyes.<br />
No casual monk, which is the vast majority of monks left, has a caen's.  So it doesn't fall flat.  Between your level of gear, truckload of AA's and slow you were able to keep a monk alive efficiently.  See how long Ms. Monk holds up offtanking an unslowed add.<br />
<br />
No, she's not perfect. *Of course* a plate class can take more damage, and a pally and SK can pull aggro off of me faster then she can. (Thank you LR5, how i love thee). Yes, pacify from a cleric, chanter, etc can be a bit more quicker for splits *and* she takes more damage then I do if hit fully, but her avoidance is amazing. <br />
<br />
So in other words she's not the best at pulling, as a pure melee she's not even as good as a priest at mitigation and her dps is subpar.  Sounds like a great class.<br />
<br />
<br />
But since we prefer duo rather then grouping w/ others, i think she does PRETTY DAMN WELL :) I love monks. lovelovelovelovelove. /hugs all the monks who know how to play the class well.<br />
Please explain in detail how knowing how to play your class well will enable you to overcome the big mitigation penalty a monk has when tanking.  Is there a special set of hotkeys I'm missing that will magically enable my monk to take less than max damage on nearly every hit?  Seriously, I really wanna know what I can do as a player to better myself playing a monk... well, other than grind out 290 aa's, raid a ton and have a similarly geared shaman sitting behind me slowing and healing me.<br />

<br />
This is my OPINION on this subject. Please remember that before responding if you disagree w/ me.<br />
You are certainly entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong for the vast majority of monks out there.  As for not knowing the class, I already said I've played one for 1.5 years before I gave up.  They are broken beyond belief.  Have you ever let your monk friend go off on her own- how long does it take her to get a group outside the guild?<br />
<br />

Actually, we've been duoing since we were lvl 1. And not that well equiped. We were both in our high 40's when the nerf hit, which pissed *her* off so the degree that she quit playing for awhile.<br />
<br />
Wow, you've discovered how powerful slow, is, good for you! Swap out the monk for an int caster and guess what, they could also tank a slowed mob- wooot!<br />
<br />
Well of course slow is the large part of it, and *no* an int caster cannot tank those mobs, slowed. I had to rescue a retarded enchater (pre-64 charm spell) who wanted to get aggro on the mob so his pet could tank. He went down very quickly. And if it was unslowed then the monk can still tank, which actually happened last night on a spirit i couldnt get slowed. Its NOT mana efficient by any means. And a warrior in that spot tanking would tank better but still would be mana inefficient. Again..i speak from personal experience. At least the monk can FD, while i run and kite until i'm able to land slow.<br />
<br />
Except for any lull/pacify class who would have been a better choice in the example you gave. <br />
<br />
Which i already gave an example of as being better. BUT since we dont use a class that pacifies in our group. She does it. Again, you're talking about a monk soloing. I'm talking about grouping w/ one.<br />
<br />
Slow is awesome, isn't it? Ever parse the assbeating your monk friend is taking vs. any other class in equivalent gear? Sounds to me like you're fighting mobs far below your gear. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, i guess mobs that hit for nearly 600 (spirits hit for 588 full)are too easy. I'm not talking about having her tank the AoW, i'm talking about in an EXP group. Yet, again, we're talking about something different.<br />
<br />
So basically you don't slow on inc, because if you did you'd be tanking for a good long while until Mr. No Taunt pulls the mob off you. Try loading up the dots instead of rains and see how well it goes. <br />
<br />
I slow once the mob gets to us. Shes a big girl, she can take the hits. And why would i want to use a less efficient manner of casting by loading on the dots, when its not needed? Please *remember* the example i gave was of us doing our usual thing. exping in HoH.  <br />
<br />
<br />

Seriously, I really wanna know what I can do as a player to better myself playing a monk... well, other than grind out 290 aa's, raid a ton and have a similarly geared shaman sitting behind me slowing and healing me.<br />
<br />
I think you are arguing about a monks ability to solo versus *my* argument that a monk is benificial in a group. Which she is because she add more dps then a warrior, pally, or sk and still tanks. And before anyone jumps on me for adding those classes.. My rl friend has a 65 pally who groups w/ us and if we have him tank while the monk runs to get another mob the DPS drops dramatically. <br />
<br />
<br />
I said her DPS was wonderful. you said :<br />
As long as you define wonderful as less than:<br />
ranger<br />
rogue<br />
beastlord<br />
necro<br />
mage<br />
wizard<br />
enchanter that charms<br />
<br />
To which i respond *again*. She and i DUO. DUO. DUO<br />
<br />
No casual monk, which is the vast majority of monks left, has a caen's. So it doesn't fall flat. Between your level of gear, truckload of AA's and slow you were able to keep a monk alive efficiently. See how long Ms. Monk holds up offtanking an unslowed add.<br />
<br />
Actually we started duoing in HoH when i was 63 and she was 62. With less then 50aa and she was only 3.5khp buffed (shaman buffed). And using a Bo staff of trorsmang and not nearly the gear we have now. Then we could barely clear 6 mobs. and i would have to rest. Now w/ canni 5 and quiscense and much better gear and aa on both our parts we are able to clear 10 mobs. 2 being the 588 hitting spirits vs the 544 hitting guardian/sentries.<br />
<br />
You are certainly entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong for the vast majority of monks out there. As for not knowing the class, I already said I've played one for 1.5 years before I gave up. They are broken beyond belief. Have you ever let your monk friend go off on her own- how long does it take her to get a group outside the guild?<br />
<br />
What a great class!<br />
<br />
We are unguilded. And since we have friends (gasp) she would never be LFG for long. And she has been playing a monk for over 2<br />
years. Yes, monk do need some more diversity. They havent grown w/ expansions like casting classes have. All pure melee needs to be looked at. Sony needs to do something besides giving them itemization and AA's, then need to have some inherent skills or abilities to bring them back to par. But as for being broken beyond belief .. well.. i guess all i can say is &quot;They're not&quot;.  I have proof grouping w/ me nightly.<br />
<br />
This is my opinion. If anyone wishes to respond, please be light on the sarcasm.  :p <br />

You obviously have never grouped w/ a intelligent and well equiped monk.<br />
<br />
I've had the good fortune to play with several, at many stages of the game, from the original game to current times (though it's getting harder to find monks these days). I can honestly say that monks are at the very bottom of the melee barrel these days.<br />
<br />
<br />
My roommate is a 65 monk w/ approx 290 AA. I am a 65 shaman w/ approx 280aa. We duo the valorian guardians, sentries, and valiant spirits in HoH on a regular basis for our AA exp. She pulls wonderfully, she tanks very well, and is not at all hard to heal. Quiscense is all i really need for her, unless i get a bastard mob that resists slow a lot. Even then.. stone stance and/or  mending of the tranquil usual does the job for me.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt this. I've had a druid with fewer AAs tank in HoH because she 'wanted to', not to mention doing it with a shaman on occasion. Not to knock your friend, but honestly priest classes can do the same thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Her dps is wonderful, and even when i slow, call on my dog, epic dot, and use tears of saryn she *still keeps aggro*(uses caens bo staff of fury). We are not elemental flagged, we do not have time gear. We have very nice gear. High end, but pre-elemental.  So the claim that &quot;Oh that monk is only good because of their time/elemental gear&quot; just kinda falls flat in my eyes.<br />
<br />
I'm a little surprised at her aggro generation. I know that even using Instill Doubt, Disarm, and Beg, monks can have problems grabbing aggro. Of course, most of them aren't toting a Caen's either. As far as her DPS goes, I'd be willing to bet that with Caen's, she's doing about 130 DPS, if she has good +atk gear. That's ok, but certaintly not spectacular. <br />
<br />
<br />
No, she's not perfect. *Of course* a plate class can take more damage, and a pally and SK can pull aggro off of me faster then she can. (Thank you LR5, how i love thee). Yes, pacify from a cleric, chanter, etc can be a bit more quicker for splits *and* she takes more damage then I do if hit fully, but her avoidance is amazing. <br />
But since we prefer duo rather then grouping w/ others, i think she does PRETTY DAMN WELL :) I love monks. lovelovelovelovelove. /hugs all the monks who know how to play the class well.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the monk playing her class well has very little to do with this situation. Pulling in HoH (as in most of PoP), is largely trivial. Skilled players don't mitigate or avoid damage any better. It all boils down to having good gear on your tank (which, based of the Caen's, I'd say you do), having a ton of AAs, and (most importantly!) having a solidly played shaman behind ya! <br />
<br />
Sure, the monk can tank this kind of thing, but you'd still be better off with almost any other melee class doing the job.</div></div><hr />

Agree 100% w/ the poster above.  <br />
<br />
I also missed the part where Kinelory plays on FV where casual players can get raid gear (damn I wish I were on that server hehe).  Try doing what you're doing w/ any other non-Zek server's casual gear and you'll find that it's slow, not the monk, that enables you to fight there.  I know, because my sk has no problem tanking that stuff as is and it's turgur's, not his bazaar junk, that makes this possible.  It would just be substantially harder w/ a monk due to max hits on most swings, lower hps and horrible aggro control.  W/o slow it wouldn't be possible at all at a casual level.<br />
<br />
From Kinelory's perspective, monks are fine due to his/her circumstances on FV, but I can assure you elsewhere they're not.  Drop the cain's and go to a SoFW (best droppable 2hb) and you'll barely be outdamaging an sk w/ a Windblade + pet and you'll fall way behind when the sk goes into burn mode.  I know this, because I've done both and parsed them extensively.<br />
<br />
I'm glad your monk friend works for you as a duo, but if your friend switched to an sk would your eyes ever open. I made the same switch and it's like going from Boone's Farm Strawberry to a '97 Napa Cab (had to drop the wine reference hehe).<br />
<br />

<br />
Its not quite as easy as we might make it out to be.  There's actually less high end stuff available, because there's no high end guilds to farm it.  But, yes, stuff like cowl of mortality is fairly freqently available, roughly 80k.<br />
On the other hand, you can move to FV and sit lfg with me and the other ten 60+ shaman lfg tonight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Kinelory Opiates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Though the recent posts have continued to disagree w/ me, i appreciate your politeness =)<br />
<br />
Yes, FV has an advantage, but only 2 high end raiding guilds and the items they let slip loose are not too common.<br />
<br />
I think my point may be coming across wrong still though. I'm not saying monks are the best tanks. Their mitgation is horrid, but i think ppl are forgetting that they have the best avoidance in the game. Especially w/ lr5. <br />
I'm going to enclose the magelo link to my roommate. She is highly respected in the FV community and is known to be one of the few monks on the server who can go toe to toe w/ bigger mobs if the main tanks should perish. <br />
<br />
www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527371 <br />
<br />
EDIT: I forgot to add. Her dps is 150. So you were close ;)<br />
<br />
Also, someone mentioned having her reroll as an SK (which is never going to happen). My good friend is a great sk and believe me i know the power of that class! But since we are both happy w/ our classes, no change will be made. The point of my original post was to let ppl know that &quot;No, monks are not broken. No, they are not useless.&quot;<br />
Again, i'm not saying she's better. But do not discount how valuable they can be. I know i am biased since we are #1 roommates and #2 we've been playing this particular duo together since lvl 1. And she's always been my tank :) I feel as though i know the monk class well too. <br />
Just my personal feelings. :)<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your input. It has not fallen on deaf ears. I do realize now that a large reason she does so well is because here on FV we have access to gear that players on other servers do not. Everything on her magelo is normally *not* no drop (excluding epic). It is a shame that monks on other servers have it so hard.   :( <br />
<br />
At least they have us wonderful shaman to take care of them :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but this simply isn't true. A monk's &quot;superior&quot; avoidance comes from one thing, and that's block versus parry. Block fires about 8% of the time, while parry only operates about 4% of the time. Mobs do not miss a monk any more often than they miss a warrior.  <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Damn nice gear, but I'm a bit surprised that she hit 150 DPS with Swift Like the Wind for haste and without capped worn attack.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No, monks are not broken. No, they are not useless.&quot;<br />
Again, i'm not saying she's better. But do not discount how valuable they can be. <br />
<br />
I'm going to have to disagree here. Basically any other melee class with comaparble gear and AAs would have served you better. The fact that monks aren't very good at filling any group role is what makes them broken at the moment. Sure, they can work in a pinch, but there's rarely an objective reason to invite one to a group instead of almost any other melee class.</div></div><hr />

Okay this is unhasted but add haste item.  So take Crush DPS as totally unhasted 80.65.  Then Haste it to 100% and 161.30<br />
Taking a stab at Caens which is 150 LT? compared to 200 SoT<br />
so if they proc the same your talking 75% of the Proc DPS<br />
6.1725 proc dps on a caens with full AA.<br />
Kick &amp; Strike DPS should stay the same.   So adding this all up.<br />
181.26 estimate dps using SoT ratio.   <br />
To get 150ish your talking caens is doing about 130ish hasted or 65 unhasted.   Making a Caens about 80% of a Staff of Transcendance<br />
<br />
Just some interesting musing.<br />
What was the monks attack during your fights?<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
anyway, i agree with previous poster, monks can do &quot;okay&quot; at some things but in just about every case.  Your better off with other melees in your duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Kinelory Opiates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Her attack was running 1728 w/ ferine avatar,epic and some lvl 65 sk spell. (do not recall name). And her dps is 147 after about 10 AA's worth of parsing on the same mobs. (valorian guardians, sentrys, valiant spirits). And since she was tanking she has double riposte working for her too. The mobs do block and avoid some attack themselves and i dont know how that evens out. Double ripsote versus their avoidance.<br />
(The parse she is using is Yalp)<br />
<br />
Mobs do not miss a monk any more often than they miss a warrior.  <br />
<br />
Any fired attack that does not come in contact w/ the monk is considered a miss. A block, riposte, dodge is all considered an avoided attack. Therefore, they have the best avoidance.<br />
<br />
Again  i'm not saying that monks are superior. They do need work like ALL pure melee does. I'm just trying to say that they are not worthless. Like some people in this thread were claiming.

Yes, monk do need some more diversity. They havent grown w/ expansions like casting classes have. All pure melee needs to be looked at.

I've read all your posts and for the casual player, monks bring nothing to the group that others don't do better.  They literally have no niche.  Know what happens to people w/ no niche? They're laid off, or in EQ, LFG.  IMO that makes them worthless.<br />
<br />
Sure, you can pound a nail into a board with a spoon, but wouldn't a hammer work better? Nevertheless, if you prefer a spoon, have fun- I'll continue to use my hammer aka shadowknight.<br />

Any monk with 290+AA is not a &quot;casual&quot; monk.  Casual has nothing todo if you raid or not and the difference is blured even more on FV.  I would argue that my monk is a better guide to a casual monk than your friend.  I'm not in a raiding guild tho I have been in the past and done to damn much HoT.  I do have some nice gear, most of which could be bought in the bazaar or camped by friends.  I have 10 whole AA (might have 11).  I was low 50's when the nerf hit me.  It's one reason I made my shamman so I could get some XP.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying that monks are worthless and I'm not saying they couldn't use some help.  I am saying that any class that needs 290+AA to be &quot;balanced&quot; needs work.  <br />

<br />
No, a mob missing you is when is you see: XXX attempts to crush you but misses. This factor is exactly the same for any melee class. I'm not sure how it relates to priest classes, as I've never parsed it and I haven't seen any reliable direct comparison. <br />
<br />
The only advantage a monk has is the fact that they use block instead of parry. Block works ~8% of the time, Parry works ~4% of the time. People try to talk up the monk avoidance advantage to justify the mitigation nerf, but the &quot;advantage&quot; is just block. <br />
<br />
<br />

Perhaps not 'worthless'... but almost certaintly one of the worst possible choices for a group member in any given situation.</div></div><hr />
