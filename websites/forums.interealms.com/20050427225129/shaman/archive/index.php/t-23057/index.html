<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone recommend some good duo spots for this pair. Both EP flagged. No LoY expansion available.<br />
<br />
Shaman 100aa 3.8k unbuffed (No GoD spells or trials)<br />
Paladin 243aa 6.1k unbuffed (SU3 included no GoD trials)<br />
<br />
Ideal would be easy xp grinding zone for AA's..........<br />
<br />
and any separate ideas for farming purposes.<br />
<br />
Would it be a good idea to head to GoD, if so wheres the best zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can gind decent EXP in CoD, SU3 helps, and with slow you shouldn't have to heal all that much... Diesies won't land on much there if I recall, but everything else should with no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would suggest HoH killing undead.  I used to hunt with a 65 Pally in the SE basement.  Mobs may come two at a time, so be ready to root them off.  If your Shaman has Q, you can keep the tank up with that after slow has landed.  Your mileage may vary of course.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could also try the depths of Veksar.  The shopkeeper and some others are going to be dark blue to you still and there seems to be constant spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mobs only hit for 600ish.<br />
<br />
Slow plus pally patch heals are good.<br />
<br />
1%aa per kill in a full group. Bout 3% duo. SolRo gives better xp per kill in my opinion, but the mobs have substantially more hit points and hit harder (600-800 ish).<br />
<br />
Its my new favourite duo spot with my sk 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i box a pally..his magelo is a little out of date but close enough....if i want to xp them both and only partner, i go to castle 2 of pof and root rot.  i heal with they pally and make him help with roots.  best xp i have found partnered.  could also do pow root rot the same way as fire.<br />
<br />
honestly with a pally tanking the dps on anything nonundead is to low to make good xp (imo).  so i rather root rot with the shaman and use the pally as a support class.  i do use the pally to farm mobs with my farm crews.  for example when we do seru, we have a group and a half with only 3ish RL people.  i camp the pally in the corner for rezes incase something goes wrong.  my pally is undergeared to tank tough named in pop/god (not that stuff there is going to be partnerable anyway,) but anything expansion up to luclin my pally can tank pritty much anything /shrug.  <br />
<br />
just had another thought, you might be able to plow through BB normal ldons depending on how many AAs the pally has in offencive skills...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">go duo in fort1  in fire.. mobs not too hard, drop pricy gems and you can pick up a nice spear for your pally doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sewer trials are really easy, great xp too.. and they go down pretty fast..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Plane of Hate Tier3 and Tier4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i got the spear for my pally in 3 hours in fire, lucky me!<br />
honestly take a group if you want the spear...i could not have doued it, and i am sure if it is possable for you it would be iffy...btw, i don't have divine stun or the god stun, but i couldn't stun the named and he kind of kicked a 9k raid buffed SKs butt.</div></div><hr />
