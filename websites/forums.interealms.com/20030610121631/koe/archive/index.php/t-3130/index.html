<br />
The 31-year-old Fedorov was was arrested and charged at 2:50 a.m. on Sunday. After posting bail, he was released on bond once his blood alcohol content dropped below the legal limit. <br />
<br />
A vehicle driven by Fedorov was observed driving around a car that was stopped for a red light. Fedorov's vehicle then proceeded through the intersection and the red light at a high rate of speed. Fedorov's vehicle was stopped by police. Fedorov was the lone occupant of the vehicle.<br />
<br />
The news released said an investigation was conducted resulting in Fedorov failing field sobriety tests. He was arrested and agreed to take a breath test, resulting in .09 percent blood alcohol conduct.  In Michigan, a blood alcohol conduct of .08 or .09 results in a charge of driving while impaired. A blood alcohol level of .1 or above is needed for a charge of driving under the influence or drunken driving.<br />
<br />
He must appear in 44th District Court no later than Oct. 3.<br />
<br />
After practicing Monday morning with the Red Wings, Fedorov refused comment.<br />
<br />
Red Wings spokesman John Hahn also refused comment.</div></div><hr />
