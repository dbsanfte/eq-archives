<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman spells expensive? Well we all know that shaman spells many times are alot more expensive than other classes. One might think that would change with PoP. <br />
<br />
All classes would get about same price for their spells. Well not shamans, since we have the rep to have expensive spells, WE will sell our OWN spells for riduculuse prices. <br />
<br />
Just take Talisman of the Boar, omg, selldom for less than 20kpp! What is wrong with people? thats the same price as for a Rune spell in many other classes. And dont blame others, its our own spells, and would not be suprised that alot of you shamans are having your own copy of ToB out for sale for around 15 to 30 kpp.<br />
<br />
Example: Malosinia were going for 10kpp, I had two, i put my price tag 5kpp. Soon after i saw people selling it for 3,5kpp. So people arent sure what to sell their spells for, but since we have a rep of expensive spells (Pox, Malo, Topor) we put high prices on them, until someone comes by and drops the price to a normal lvl.<br />
<br />
No, i dont have ToB, thats why im checking prices every day. Not that i think this post will change anything, just need to blow some steam  :(<br />
<br />
Just dont blame Verant for out spell prices, With PoP, we have shown that we are capable of biting our own leg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or you could just go get your own spells by turning in Specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can do that! wow great news.........(DUH)!!<br />
<br />
You didnt get the idea about we making our own spells expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All I know is, I am 51 right now and looking ahead to the later levels spells and thinking &quot;****!!!!  How in the world can I afford those?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Since I just started to work on AA, 100%, I am banking all my money till I get my 6 Basics and then hopefully *Crosses fingers* I will have a good chunk of change in the bank for some of the ones that are rare drops or Parchment turn ins.  <br />
<br />
But yeah, it seems that once somebody paid the blood money for one of our spells, they would want to get their plat back if they got another spell drop, makes sence, just wow.  I have heard of Shaman turning  spells over to Guildies or friends for little or no money, huzah to those folks!  <br />
<br />
I just hope I can get some drops, or get lucky with friends and Guildies some of whom  have already given me some of my 52 spells that they got from mobs.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck and good hunting<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Easier said than done. I think part of the problem is, by the time you get to turning in Specs, if you get a duplicate, you will need to sell it to afford another spell. If the one you want is 20k, then by selling yours for 5k, you'd have a big deficit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It does suck because you cannot simply spend your cash on upgrades. I have been lucky and found the 4 pieces for torpor for sale (total 7K). Now I just need to cross my fingers and get it researched.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, on RN where I play I have watched the same copy of torpor for sale for 3 weeks. Started at 75K. Is now at 44K. High prices will only sustain if there are buyers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's because everyone and their brother rolled a shaman.  You can't take a dump without a level 65 shaman walking through the stall at least twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at least with the new time drops you can wipe your ass in 1.3 seconds, which should spare embarassment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So don't buy it for 20k, if it sits there long enough, it will come down in price.<br />
All the spectral drops on my server are between 2k and 7k....perfectly reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good advice Vis, thats what im doing, or if a can get it by turning in a SP, just that we Shammys are getting our prices hiked up becuse we had Topor and Malo spells going skyhigh in prices.<br />
<br />
Something good have come out of scanning the bazaar all these days atleast. Gotten all my rune spells and payed as most 15kpp, that was for Fo7.<br />
<br />
So im pretty satisfied, only missing ToB, but that will come in time. Let them crazy people charge 20kpp for a SP.... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The other day in bazaar I saw:<br />
<br />
Endurance of the Boar: 150pp<br />
Talisman of the Boar: 18,000pp<br />
<br />
My guild offered to chip in a buy it but I told them I would see them all dead from lack of stamina before I paid 18K for a stat buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But yeah, it seems that once somebody paid the blood money for one of our spells, they would want to get their plat back if they got another spell drop, makes sence, just wow.

<br />
<br />
Yep, I'm lucky enough to know people like that, and I am that way myself. Had a fellow shaman give me two NPC drop spells the other day...because I showed him the pull cycle for the drunks a few weeks ago, and chatted with him as we pulled for a while.<br />
Well, that and he is just a good guy.<br />
<br />
I also have a few spells banked that were left to me by a friend who retired shortly after I started my shaman. <br />
<br />
When I get spell drops, they go immediately to people who can use them. Myself first, of course, then guildies and friends (and there may well be times they get 'em before I do, if I know I'll be hanging around and getting another soon). If I, for some reason, couldn't find a guildie or friend that needed it, I wouldn't think twice about looking for someone that could and handing it to them. Hasn't happened with a spell drop yet, but it has with some research items and equipment.<br />
<br />
For Words\Runes, etc...<br />
If I can't use them (or don't feel like sorting them), they go on my trader at a flat price of 10pp each. I don't even bother trying to figure out how rare\common they are. I figure at 10pp, they aren't too expensive for anyone who can actually use them, and I am making at least 10pp for something I just happened to loot off of something I killed.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm kind of disgusted at some of the prices people try to charge for things as well. I can't change what everyone else charges, but I can at least make sure I don't perpetuate it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's not helped either by the jokers selling vendor spells at inflated prices. I've seen a couple of people on Torv recently selling Mending of Krag for 5k in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your fundamental premise is flawed Armak. You say that SoE is not to blame for prices, since they are set by &quot;greedy&quot; shamans. Ergo, the problem is ours. <br />
<br />
The problem is a simple one of supply and demand. The supply (set by SoE) of good spells is low, shamans are a powerful and popular class, so demand is high... therefore the prices are high. <br />
<br />
No one is going to sell Torpor for 1k. If it was, someone would buy it immediately and turn around and sell it for 50k. Because they are evil and greedy? No, because that is what the market will bear. <br />
<br />
The subject of &quot;greedy&quot; people has been beaten to death in these forums and is a comic waste of time. Individual people might or might not be &quot;greedy&quot;... but the fundamentals of market economics are always present and is an impersonal &quot;invisible hand&quot; that will guide prices to what the fundamental supply/demand curves demand.<br />
<br />
So, if you want prices to go down, increase supply or decrease the number of shamans. Griping about greed won't get you anywhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is dead on.  That is also why I go ballistic on SOE leaving the shaman spell drop rates at their current non-existent rate for the kunark spells- I think the rune spells will eventually take care of themselves if/when enough guilds w/ stacks of runes decide they need more plat.  <br />
<br />
Spell research is also pretty much broken if you are not a lottery winner- I've spent hours now in chardok at royals and elsewhere and I've seen one (1) shaman spell research drop of any value (words of virtue for avatar).  <br />
<br />
I will be L65 long before I scribe a dropped L59/60 kunark spell- my favorite was the trader trying to sell Avatar for 70k.  I ask him if he added a zero by mistake and was told &quot;you'd be surprised what people will pay&quot;.  Fine, but there were 3 copies of Ferine Avatar for sale at the same time for &lt; 20k, whatever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Vorpatril. <br />
<br />
Why would anyone sell something for 5k if they knew they could get 20k. Supply and demand is the problem, and Sony sets the spell and item drops rates.<br />
<br />
My pet peev is someone, Complaining about my price, in /ooc. Lots of times I'll turn around and sell it a few hours later for that same price. Guess that guy that was bitching, wanted me to give it away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is not the lack of supply because of SOE, lets say your guild raids kunark level mobs, ie most of your shaman are in the low 60s and not planning to level because you want to expeirence all the content or whatever.. all your shaman have torpor and you get a copy of torpor.. are you going to sell it? more than likely you're not, it's all in guild banks guys, or random alts have em ready to scribe if they ever hit 60.. nothing wrong with that.. but that is the reason why things are the way they are..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There's two sides to supply and demand. If you dont pay those prices, then there is no demand. Plain and simple. I have never paid outrageous prices for spells since Kunark came out, and I will never pay more than 500 plats for any spell. Just ignore all those hacks selling our spells for thousands of plats and worry about getting the spells on your own.<br />
<br />
Dont sell you shaman spells either. Give them to another shaman that needs it..there will be somebody who needs it and that will be one less shaman who will feel desparate enough to patronize these jackasses.  Every extra shaman spell I've found, I was able to find a friend or a stranger who needed it rather quickly. Except for the bazillion copies of Malosini and Cripple I've found - those I just sell to vendors. <br />
<br />
And you reap what you sow. Those people you gift with spells will remember you for it. Nobody will remember you kindly for selling a spell they need for thousands of plat. One of the people I gave an extra copy of Tigir's to made the stein for my solstice earring at no charge. I was given Khura's Focusing and Torpor by other people. I traded my copy of Ancestral Guard to a shaman who didnt have it for his extra Focus of Soul, and got Ancestral Guard back a couple days later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, but why is it going in the guild bank? Because it's insanely<br />
expensive to buy - we want to give it to our up&amp;coming Shamans when<br />
they reach the level to scribe it. If it was only a couple hundred plat,<br />
we wouldn't bother. <br />
<br />
Vorpatril nailed it - Lack of supply. There's little that can be done in the <br />
way of demand (though I applaud Steelbear for his efforts). I personally<br />
give away all my dupes to guildies, even alts. However it doesn't seem<br />
to affect market prices. <br />
<br />
I used to hunt in Seb almost EVERY exp night from low 50's up through <br />
60 (until PoP came out). The only exception was hunting guardian <br />
wurms. Got Bane and Torpor, but never saw Malo or Pox drop in over<br />
a year of hunting. I FINALLY got a Malo while helping a clerik with his<br />
quest about a month ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The biggest problem with the supply side of things for kurnak spells is VP. I'm dead serious. Look at the expansions since then. SoV? you had PoG, you had WW and all sorts of other places that people did hunt heavily that dropped high end spells. SoL? Ssra primarily but other zones too with named. Pleanty of supply. PoP? Runes a pleanty in the higher level planes.<br />
<br />
VP wasn't that popular in it's day and even less so since. The one zone that could have supplied a large amount of the high end spells was a waste land because the zone design SUCKED so badly. You want to get yourself spells and drive prices down. Go farm vp with a group or 2 every night for a month. You'll easily have all your spells and probably enough dupes to crash the spell market on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While this does apply to the level 60 and lower spells, it is not the case with post-60 spells which were the reason for this thread.<br />
<br />
With the parchment/rune setup, SoE does not control the supply of spells for an individual class. Only the overall supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Many pp later, I'm at a full PoP spellbook, and only 2 spells from having a complete book, period.<br />
It's a goal . . i'll get the last two soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">there is very little that is more important to a caster than having their spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You all are missing the point... <br />
<br />
I understand with the Kunark Spells (the drop rate sucks for shaman and needs reviewed.)  What the original poster was stating was, that etheral/ spec/ runes drop at a constant rate.  If following the logic of an earlier poster, there are tons of shaman (cant take a dump without .. blah blah), so that means tons of parchs/ runes are being turned in for a chance at spells they need.  Now, with ALL these shaman turning in drops, you would think there would be an overflow of extra spells. (AND there probably is, original posters point), but yet spec parch drops still selling for outrageous amounts  (12k for Velium Strike, 9k for Tears of Saryrn, 15k for Blessing of Replenish, and 17k to 35k for Rune word spells).<br />
<br />
His original point, which I agree with, is... Due to the absurb rarity of Torpor/ Malo/ Avatar/ Pox, etc... and the prices those fetch (from 20k to 60k ), everyone automatically jacks the prices thru the roof, for any shaman spell they see.<br />
<br />
Prices are Quellious btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The problem isn't so much shaman selling extras as it is monks/rogues/warriors/anyone with all thier spells turning in parchments to shammy guy because they now we're used to taking the heavy spell prices Soe has gifted us with for years. Sure they could sell the mq or give it to a friend but why do that when ya know that any shammy spell they get is gonna be 10k and up, maybe as much as 60-70kpp on torv for malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">And who's fault is that? If shamans werent paying those ridiculous prices, then the prices would go down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Everyone is greedy, and don't act like your not,<br />
So why would EQ be any different? <br />
Prices on tunare seem to run about the same for all classes infact enc prices are higher on some spells<br />
<br />
My rune purchases are Malos 15k Q 20k BoS 12k Fo7 Free (got it off rune bot drop :D) still missing FA and a few 63-64 spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I dunno. I understand the orginal posters thoughts and can see whatcha mean. But my pallies big hps 65 buff is usually same price as fo7th. My rangers big 65 spell is slightly less to same priced. The 63-64 pally spells still sell for 5k to 12kish and i see the same for some of the shaman ones. Only exception ive seen is even with a ton of copies of malos people still try and get 35k for it but i also got mine for 5k when a person had 5 copies.<br />
  <br />
   We dont have alot of trash in our lvl 65 spells so i think takes alot longer and all of them stay kinda high. Where my pallies lvl 65 root sold cheap becuase its a root spell. Not gonna be a big deal if i didnt have it. The 65 group heal for my pally however is still higher priced and in shaman spell range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Other than torpor/malo, are people still paying the outrageous prices for kunark spells?  All the shamans in my casual guild (just did chardok royals this weekend, guild first!) are just motoring through to 65 now that tier 2 has opened up and going for the L65 versions since they're so much cheaper/better.  Even torpor/malo suck hard compared to the L65 versions, particularly since they're never for sale and when they are they're at least 50% more, if not double the price of the rune spells.<br />
