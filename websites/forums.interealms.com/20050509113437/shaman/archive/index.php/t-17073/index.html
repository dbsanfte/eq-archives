<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its amazing.. looking at the necro, sk, wizard, druid spells, they are all &quot;very hard to resist&quot; meaning they have neg resist adjustments made... me being on a pvp server, that makes me super mad...but me watching it being resisted by mobs in HoH and PotA makes me super super mad!!! =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pvp is broke man.</div></div><hr />

No, just have a look at alchemy or rabid bear ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rabid bear could be lots better, it would be really nice to see a 3-4x increase in the DPS on it...<br />
<br />
but damnit, it's FUN.  I love hitting it, screaming ROAR, and charging at some boss that I know is going to unleash a fury of ripostes on my ass and I'll laugh stupidly as I die<br />
<br />
not to mention the +cold wins completely in PoWater!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">back onto the subject boys! the gimpness of our LDoN spells even after malos... they sometimes get resisted... unlike druid/necro/sk/wizard spells!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everquest was made to be PvE. PvP was an afterthought. PvE still isn't balanced, what makes you think PvP would be? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PvE stands for what again? And yeah Pvp is a joke in balance, its just a fun thing to do rather than a test of wits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe PvE stands for Player vs Environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Everquest was never made for PvP, they just made these servers for roleplaying purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We could still really use the resist adjust for PvE though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stop whining. We are the super class! No one can stand in our way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doesn't matter if it was made for PvP or not.  The fact is they do have pvp servers.  Annoys the hell out of me when people say that.<br />
<br />
If you played on a pvp server you would really see what classes are out of balance.  I strongly believe SoE could balance PvE a lot more if they looked at it with a PvP perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">... seriously PvE is way too much sleepy compared to PvP.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">an &quot;Innate Malisement&quot; AA would be cool, costing 5/10/15 and giving -5/-10/-20 innate resist mods to our spells.<br />
<br />
I'd definitely grind out the AAs for that one =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">you just made me cry with tears of joy with the thought of innate malaisement =D snff snff...but lets have it -20, -50 and -100 plz... everyone has like 250+ resists (except me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok I've been cranky about the lack of a resist mod on our spell since first seeing it on beta. Its my only true complaint about Bane. <br />
<br />
Seeing this quote from a druid on my guild board about their spell though really hammered it home:<br />
<br />
I've had plenty of time to practice now with Vengeance of Tunare however and it is a definite must have in every Druid spellbook. I highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
The negative resist check seems to make a big difference because I have yet to see this spell resisted on any mobs (even tested on the dragons/drakes in ToV) and wether the mob was resistant to fire or cold it didn't matter it landed on them all.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hm, even on a mob that's been tash'd (but not malos'd) I get resisted a good amount of time on Bane. Where the hell is our resist mod?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i completely agree with ninth on this on. pvp is so screwed up its not even funny anymore.<br />
<br />
btw ninth, if you think sullon is bad, come over to vallon... pvp on our server is Random_xteam_guild_382912 vs infectus now (sad thing is, infectus aint even broken high planes yet and we still pwn)<br />
<br />
and hey *** u complaining about, your server is hardcoded... you ever died to a war because somebody is immy healing him against you and you cant do anything because u and he are both darks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am definitely starting to agree on the need for at least SOME resist mods on our spells.... What's the point of having malos and malosinia if having them means our spells are made more resistable than other classes to compensate. Us casting malos on a mob means every other class gets a fair chance to land spells except us. Once again, SOE basically turns an adantage into a disadvantage through overcompensation.<br />
<br />
2 nights ago we killed 2 of the named phoenix in plane of fire.... 3 shaman chain slowing after casting the resist debuffs, we each got on average 5-6 resists on slow per bird... that's 15 + slow resists just to get one through and we're all 65th. The mobs were half dead by the time they got slowed.<br />
<br />
This situation is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, tell me about it.  I still remember when they started doing all their resist changes sometime after Luclin was released, and ever since then, our spells have been a total PIA as far as being resisted.  <br />
<br />
And no matter what Lucy, etc says, I still maintain that enchanters have a hidden modifier, because after a full debuff on a mob (minus bard oos/hos) time and again, enchanters seem to be able to land slow first cast, then leave me 6 or 7 resists before mine will land.  I see it happen far too often to believe it's purely &quot;coincidence&quot;. And I can trace it all back to when they first started fiddling with resists.<br />
<br />
Anyone else remember going into NToV after the resist patch, getting eaten alive at 300+ resists from AE's, having slow being resisted jump from 10% to over 50% while enchanters single cast slow and have it stick every time?  Then two or three days later, they did another patch, which toned things down, but ever since then it's felt as though certain shaman abilities (*cough slow cough*) have been harder to stick vs other class's spells. (slows)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Has anyone else notice that since LDoN the mobs resist rates to slow seems to have crept up?  Maybe I'm having bad runs, but when it came out resists maye 1 in 5, now it seems more like 1-3.<br />
<br />
Is there a log parser that parses resists to slow?  Or is it something to do by hand?   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As I pointed out in the other thread about this we shouldn't be deined a resist mod on bane because of malos/malosinia. Druids can debuff fire WAY more then we can debuff magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">yeah I noticed it but I blame it on me changing dungeons, I swear the enchanter mobs are MR buffing the mob near them.</div></div><hr />
