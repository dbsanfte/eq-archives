I was just thinking, would group Q be overpowering? Since shaman have a superb mana regen it would basicaly be a endless uber group hp regen spell. Shaman would be able to cast it for an endlss amount of time because the mana used would be gotten back by canabalize in a few seconds (which would be healed by the group Q anyway). The only way i bet they would put in group Q would be to have a huge amount of mana attached to it (such is the way of all new shaman spells, which is rediculous). <br />
<br />
I have quit playing EQ due to the way shaman have been treated, but i still think about how the game balanaces out while i troll the boards. What would your guys solution to this problem be? would you say shamans just deserve it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if i had to make a group Q, i would make it, 900 mana more than normal Q  for an 1100 total and buff extension is only 50% effective for it. probably slap a resuse timer on it too, say 20 seconds.<br />
make it MGB'able but no extension when mass group buffed.<br />
<br />
sounds pretty balanced if done that way.<br />
can't think of a better way of doing it. o and should block out other HoT's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All of the non AA AE heals have huge mana costs and we would still run outta mana eventually casting one. I can keep chealing with my cleric for a long time even with his crappy FT and mana pool, but group heals drain him fast. <br />
<br />
I think an AA heal like CE, SotW, or PoS would be better or an AA cure over time as many have suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">true, but to balance a FREE aa heal we would have to have either a HUGE aa cost in sever level splits say 5/10/15/20 for different healing ammounts or slap a nasty reuse timer on it for say 10 minutes at start and lowering resuse time by tier in aa's down to 3 mins say 4/8/12 for the timed version.<br />
and the cost to get it should probablt be 24 aa's in ach 24 in and say 24 in pop abilities so most classes don't bitch about every shaman and his dog having this aa.</div></div><hr />

         Group version have a cost *3 . so group Q SHOULD be 600 mana(but we never know ,we're shaman it could be 1200 ou 2500 ).<br />

Oh, Quiescence is better then torpor - However I would like to see . . . Quietus (someone come up with a better name please)<br />
heals 600 per tick (yes, 600. This is after all a shamn ability), mana cost 300, slows 50%(also negates haste), snares 50%.<br />
<br />
Group version have a cost *3 . so group Q SHOULD be 600 mana(but we never know ,we're shaman it could be 1200 ou 2500 ).<br />

YOu are telling me you cant spare 600 mana every 24 seconds? Or, factoring in some basic Foci and AAs, 450 mana every 36 seconds? Clerics can keep that up for about 5 hours before going out of mana.<br />
<br />
No way a group Q could be too powerfull for a good reason ,it's Q don't heal enough.<br />
Now this I can agree with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yet again... &lt;Sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
Give us a real Upgrade to Q. Something along the lines of 450 Hps. for 6 ticks base. not 4. 350 mana 200 range and 3.1 second cast time.<br />
<br />
Then give us a real Targetable heal. Like 2K 200 range 650 mana 3 second cast time.<br />
<br />
Then give us a long term regen like regrowth and bump the healing from it to 35 a tick.<br />
<br />
And finally give us a AA group Heal starting at 150 hps + 10 Strikethrough +10 Avoidance and +10 mitagation for 6 ticks. At first rank and second rank 250 hps +20 strikethrough +20 avidance and +20 mitagation. second rank and third rank 350 hps +30 Strikethrough Avoidance and mitagation.<br />
<br />
That would make us viable healers in the tradition of overlapping heals slows and heals over time rather than relying on big blast heals like clerics and druids. <br />
<br />
Also While you are at it. For the love of pete. Group ferine avatar with a increase in duration. Please! Make it only castable on your group if need be so to MGB a raid with it or the AA heal would be a real choice. (Or more than one shaman stacking.) We could still ferine out of group tanks if required. But take away the click click click pain.<br />
<br />
Then for the last little bit decrease reuse of Rabid bear so that we can keep it up all the time. And make the Rabid bear Reuse decreaser pop aa into something like maybe that AA group heal that I mentioned above? Hmm?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We most definately need an upgrade to quiescence.  Even now, just in PoP, I think we need a 500/tick heal.  God only knows what kind of damage the GoD mobs are going to be putting out, so even 500/tick might not be sufficient.  I think that shamans should have the same heal over time as clerics.  Most clerics I know do not use elixers very much, but most shamans use quiescence as their primary heal.  Thus, I feel that putting our HOT abilities on par with clerics would not threaten anyone.  Clerics always have and always will outclass us on direct heals, but I believe shamans were the first ones to get a significant heal over time.  Now, we're second place.<br />
<br />
As for a group heal, I think that would be a valuable addition to our class as well.  As it stands now, I do a very good job of keeping my group alive through all phases of PoTime.  I really enjoy this role, and I'd like to see abilities to enhance this role.  A group Q would be perfect, especially if it was MGBable.  If we could MGB a group heal, it would help with shaman stacking issues.  My guild usually has almost as many druids as we do clerics for Time, but no one complains because we need each of them for their MGB SOTW.  On just an in-group basis, group Q would not really give us any new functionality.  With an 8-tick quiescence (eterninostrum and SCRM), I can keep Q up on my entire group fairly easily.  I practically have to chain cast it and it does slowly drain my mana, but I can sustain it for a pretty long time.  The problem, of course, is that for 6 out of those 8 ticks, we are occupied with casting Q.  A group Q (maybe with a substantial cast time - 12 seconds?) would free up some time for us to cast cannibalize, tnargs, or whatever else we want.  So, basically it wouldn't be new functionality, it would just be making existing functionality much more convenient.<br />
<br />
My dream?  A 500hp/tick single target HOT(spell), a 300hp/tick group HOT (spell), and a 500hp/tick group HOT that also has the counter-removing capacity of RGC and Nadox combined (AA - 12 minute recast). <br />
<br />
No, shamans need disease dots.<br />
<br />
Remember kids, cynicism and sarcasm improve morale on the boards and are an important part of working towards improving the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i personally , wouldnt want a goup heal spell, a group health regen aa mybe, like beast paragon but no mana (regen stam too maybe) but better health regen.<br />
<br />
what i would like is an u/g to Q which is 300/tick for 4 tick 200 mana <br />
but linked to an aa. the reason for this is at 65 if doing normal stuff then this would be too powerful to have a huge quin but add an aa cost and it becomes much more acceptable to other classes , least i hope.<br />
<br />
my idea would be 400hp/tick for 4 tick 266 mana. then have an aa that only affects our HoT but keeps same mana ratio , 4 to 5 parts , 3,6,9,12,15aa adding 5,10,20,30 and 50% to oue hot.  so at lowest it be 400/tick 266 mana to 800/tick for 533 mane (or 500) not sure how easy this would be to set up though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like the idea of a grp Q, but it'll get overwritten by the cleric or pally versions anyway so I'm dubious of the worth.  I would prefer an upgrade to Tnargs, not Q.  I basically use Q for 3 things, drop it on a puller or MA before a tough fight, top up folks in a fight, but mostly I use it for mana regen.  I don't get hit too much anymore so I only need enough healing to cover my cann and chain Qing works fine for me.  On the other hand, with a AHA1 and an IH4 item it still takes me about 5-7 Tnargs to get a plate tank to full heath from nearly dead.  Thats nuts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are a better person than I am.  I would not even have given this guy the benefit of moving his post from the proposal thread where this comment did not belong in the first place.  The caveat about no longer playing a Shaman because of they way they have been treated yet feeling compelled to comment on the class now just strikes me as hallow.  If you aren't committed enough to the class to weather hardtimes and lobby for better then you probably aren't that thoughtful about Shaman as you think you are.  What class is this guy playing now, a Beastlord, a Paladin?  Sorry if he is an old mainstay of the board but times change and real heroes endure like Gloriana.<br />
<br />
One troll and we start to second guess our assumptions about what a class that we play every gaming day needs?  Group Quiesence  would not be unbalancing given what other classes have in the way of group healing spells.  I agree with many who say that there are other upgrades that they would rather have but the fact remains that Group Q is not an unreasonable request for the proper mana cost and restrictions.<br />
<br />
I just spent a night as the 3rd Shaman on a four Shaman raid.  Let me tell you it was a heartbreaking experience to be 65/74 and reduced to dropping FA on the melees and a Q here and there in order to feel even remotely useful.  When I cast my Tnarg&#8217;s I can&#8217;t even see the MA&#8217;s HP bar move.  I have become a Zerg:  just another toon in the crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I didn't want his post about group Q in the proposal thread, but if he felt strongly enough about posting it, I didn't mind moving it.<br />

<br />
A lot of people confuse Quiescence (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=quiescence) with Quintessence (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=quintessence).  Personally, I think Quintessence would fit better (and is just a cool word in general), but in the meantime I am willing to just accept that people are going to mispell and mistake our spell names.  I've seen tugur and topor so many times it doesn't even phase me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think group Q would be an interesting spell, but the mana cost would have to be 6 * Q (or 5 * Q) in order for it not to be overpowering.  Basically, the equivalent of casting Q a bunch of times individually.<br />
<br />
A recast time would be fairly pointless, since the spell is going to last a long time anyway (unless you're talking about a recast time of minutes).<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd simply rather see an upgraded Q.  Twice the healing, for twice the mana.  No change in efficiency.  Less clicking = good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's funny how when it comes to class lines blurring over slow everyone gets irrate, but when it comes to healing like clerics that's fine.<br />
<br />
Q is almost identical to the level 59 cleric HoT... the 2nd best one they get.<br />
Group Q would be almost the same as the level 60 cleric HoT... the best group HoT they get.<br />
If Q got increased to 500/tick it would equal (surpass?) the current best cleric HoT.<br />
<br />
Personally I would rather have MGBable FA, a fast casting nuke be it poison or cold, and a MUCH faster casting 1000-ish heal. Stacking issues? Damage always stacks (except in the case of DoTs and 4+ Necros), and the only other thing I really find myself being unable to do is dropping fast heals on an Enc when their pet breaks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Make group Q an AA, with a refresh of 6 minutes or so. Yeah, it's not ideal. But it gives us something to patch the group with every so often and something manaless to MGB, which bring us near parity with the two other healer classes, the way it should be.<br />
<br />
I say near because even group-Q isnt going to compare to Stack-With-Everything SoWood (or Paragon, for that matter) or the 8-ticks base duration of Celestial Regeneration.<br />
<br />
And, comparing the raw healing power of the other healer classes, this doesn't even come close to bridging the gap.</div></div><hr />

HoT spells are a shaman (and necro) ability. We had them before clerics. I do not see anything wrong with having more powerful HoT spells (powerful as in health per tick) especially if it comes with side effects.<br />

I think fast heals step much more on cleric's toes then a bigger HoT. Not that I would mind having any of these (especially group FA).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think I'd like something like an AA that casts the same cures as RC3 but innately MGB, maybe once every 45-50 min.  Would really add power the role of Shaman's against tougher mobs AE effects.  4-5 shaman's with this AA could really help &quot;turn the tide&quot; against tough mobs.<br />
<br />
A group Q is nice, making it MGBable is nice too. If it was group, however, I think that I would settle for a 360 range group heal.  With our mana regen capabilities, if they didn't make the mana ridiculous to cast it we'd essentially end up with a semi-permament +300/tic regen which might make any group a bit overpowering.<br />
<br />
Honestly I'd just be happy if they took all the {x} over time spells and put them in the short duration buff window first and THEN in the main spell bar so I can actually have 15 buffs and Q myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">HoT spells are a shaman (and necro) ability. We had them before clerics.

Dude no... Clerics get HoTs at 19, 29, 44, 59 and 62. Shaman get them at 44, 60 and 65. Plus Clerics (and I spose Necros in a way) are the ONLY class with a non-AA group HoT.<br />
<br />
The price of healing like a 59 Cleric at 60 was making the spell group only and having all the melee click it off. Would you really want to go to a 500/tick Torpor? I wouldn't even bother to keep it memmed. Melee are just going to click it so you gotta Tnargs/Q them anyway, and Casters die fast enough that 500/tick (less than one hit) isn't going to save them.<br />
<br />
Q/Tnargs plenty to keep people healed on slowed stuff, and with the brand new -40 check everything is going to come slowed. With mitigation the 15% difference isn't even going to be noticeable. I mean, BSTs with their 10% difference slow fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">he didnt mean by level , he meant in time frame, cleric didnt get hot spell till after shaman had torpor,shaman where the only priest class witha hot spell at one point. clerics like the idea though.  then asked for their own line. and got it.<br />
<br />
basically shaman spells are given out to other classes which indirectly affect our relative power, group/raid stacking and inthe end reasons for actually having us in either.<br />
<br />
really i see only 2 reason to have a shaman on raid or group , malos and the 500hp from fo7, that really it. <br />
our slows arnt different enough from other class to make us reallly needed for them, our dps isnt big enough to make any difference and  our healing is pitiful , it wont save a main tank or group members from those 1k hits.<br />
<br />
(though i do concede that for lower planes and normal ldon we are ok, but i never said that needed looking at:))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Dude no... Clerics get HoTs at 19, 29, 44, 59 and 62. Shaman get them at 44, 60 and 65.<br />
The first HoT spell was the necro life exchange spell series, back in the original game. Shaman got Torpor in Kunark, clerics got their first celestial heals in Velious.<br />
<br />
The price of healing like a 59 Cleric at 60 was making the spell group only and having all the melee click it off. Would you really want to go to a 500/tick Torpor? I wouldn't even bother to keep it memmed. Melee are just going to click it so you gotta Tnargs/Q them anyway, and Casters die fast enough that 500/tick (less than one hit) isn't going to save them.<br />
There is 3 kinds of healing - healing trivial damage from the odd riposte or plain weaks MOBs. Healing AE damage. And healing someone who is being pounded.<br />
For healing someone who is being pounded you will use Tnarg's anyways, unless we get some 2K per tick HoT.<br />
For healing trivial damage anything will do.<br />
For healing AEs HoT spells are just fine.<br />
<br />
SO, yes, I would use a 600/tick torpor, on casters mainly. It would give us a nice niche on raids, which is about the only place I would ever use a group Q anyways. And it would give us a healing niche without stepping on druid's and cleric's toes.<br />
<br />
Q/Tnargs plenty to keep people healed on slowed stuff, and with the brand new -40 check everything is going to come slowed. With mitigation the 15% difference isn't even going to be noticeable. I mean, BSTs with their 10% difference slow fine.<br />
As I said, when you are healing trivial damage anything will do. I do not like our new slow but if you are going to assume everything gets slowed you will make due with Q just fine - and why would you want group Q?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Is spirit of the wood overpowered?  No?  and why not?  Because the dam CHALLENGING mobs do MUCH more DPS than  can be healed with a mere Heal over time!! We're not fighting in Old Sebilis anymore folks, we're exping in the planes where mobs quad for 1k, mitigate slow, and have 20k hps minimum.  How overpowering is ANY heal over time spell in the face of such challenges?  <br />
<br />
Honestly . . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">One of the things that I always seem to see mentioned with Shaman healing spells is how they change the balance of our mana regeneration abilities via cannibalize.  Giving Shamans a bigger and/or more efficient healing spell allows them to regenerate mana more quickly.  This was supposedly the reason why our mini-CH was only 1950 rather than the 2925 that Druids got.<br />
<br />
If increased healing power is something that Shamans, as priests, should be getting, why not simply flag the spells as &quot;others only&quot;?  Group heals, single target heals, AE heals, or whatever could be added but they would just not land on the Shaman casting it.  Obviously, two Shamans together could take turns casting the more efficient spells on each other but that would be an exception rather than a common occurance.  By flagging the spells this way, Shamans could get some healing spells that put them back in line with Druids in the group healing department but do not change the balance with regards to mana regeneration.</div></div><hr />
