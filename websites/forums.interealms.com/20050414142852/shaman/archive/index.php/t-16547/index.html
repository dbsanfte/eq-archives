<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tigrin24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just bought a new computer and I took it to college.  I installed all the expansions on my new computer and the internet connection works fine.  I can get all the way to the character selection screen and I can even get to the loading screen after I select a character and enter world.  After it loads the screen goes black like it usually does but then it takes me back to the server selection screen.  This happens everytime I try.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions I can try to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
