 Is lord Rak in Com broken? We tried to MQ a tear yesterday. The shaman doing the turn in was ally, not in bear form. Rak just ate his tear. this is the 3rd time i got screwed out of my epic. /sigh Also, why do other shamans have to get in my face and ask me &quot;Where is your epic?&quot; before you ask me do /badwordfilter on (yes, i am getting testy)<br />

<br />
Assuming the hand in was not bugged by some odd circumstance the only thing I can think of is that the handin shaman did not have the proper level of faction required and either doesn't know it or lied about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can be ally and he will eat the tear. The correct faction seems to be somewhere between low ally and max ally. In order to guarantee that it should work, you have to be max ally. I just got the tear myself, saved a lot of heartache and tears, but that option may not be available to you. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps, best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're going to go the route of MQ, go and get Envy, Woe and Marr's promise and drag the mq'ing shaman out to WK.  Have him hand them in to check for faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You did not get &quot;screwed out of your epic&quot;<br />
Do the quest yourself then you wont have to worry about faction issues.<br />
All your time getting MQ tears you could have done all the necessary steps in order to assure you had the correct faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maximum Truespirit faction is required for the person handing in the tear to Lord Rak. Being ally doesn't prove maximum.<br />
<br />
Another way to verify max faction besides Woe/Envy/Marr is to do the step from the very beginning of the epic where you deliver a gem from a lesser spirit to Bondl in Freeport. He should get the message &quot;Your faction couldn't possibly get any better with Truespirit&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know for a fact that you need max true spirit faction. When I did my final epic fight Rak ate my tear, but I did all the steps leading up to rak, so I petitioned, gm gave back tear telling me my faction somehow got reduced when I did a server transfer about half a year back. I then did the envy/woe/marr's promise once and got maxed ally. Did the epic fight a week later and now i am an epiced shaman. So whether your mqing or doing the hand in urself make sure the person with the child's tear has seen &quot;YOUR true spirit faction can not get any better&quot;. Also now whenever a person hands in the iksar tear to get their epic, their truespirit faction goes back down to indifferent just so you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">im gonna bet that the MQ'ing shaman just conn'ed rak and was ally... and assumed was max =( sorry to hear you lost your tear man....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i was not max ally, I have my epic.<br />
<br />
I guess that proves all those theories about you must be max ally wrong.<br />
<br />
Like its been said here on so many threads already.  The proper faciton needed is between ally and max ally.  Yes, it works if you have higher than needed faction, but it does not have to be maxed.<br />
<br />
If you do the quest from step 1 to the end exactly how it was intended to be done, you will have the right faction needed.<br />
<br />
If you skip parts of the quest, you should max your faction because thats the only way to be 100% sure that it is high enough.<br />
<br />
Finally, its hard to believe that faction was the case here anyways.  I'm operating on the assumption that the shaman who did the turn in for you already had his epic?  It's hard to imagine him mqing it with someone, if he didn't already have it, but I guess thats possible.  If this is the case, his faction must have been high enough already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you.  I saw the message your faction with True Spirit has gotten worse when I did the turn in.  I realized right then, right after I got my epic, at that very moment, that I was gonna have to do faction work to MQ it for anyone.  Why on god's green earth ppl see a lose faction message then assume they are still max ally is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You go back to indifferent after you recieve your epic now, they changed this just after the release of PoP I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lord Rak`Ashiir looks down at the tear in his hand and says, 'A minion of my god came to me one night. I knew it was of Cazic-Thule as I was frozen in terror. My mind screamed for me to flee but my body would not respond. The being took my daughter and vanished to only he knew where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I felt nothing but betrayal. I don't care anymore about anything. If you want repentence then slay me, Mukkul'<br />
Your faction standing with Truespirit could not possibly get any better.<br />
You gain party experience!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baiyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I'm not mistaken, I think the faction reset happens when you turn in the scale to get your epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did the quest from start to finish with 0 problems. I agree with Kareck about doing the quest on your own but I've had many friends that have received their epic via MQ with no problems as long as the person turning in the tear is Max Ally, as has been stated in many of the above posts. If nothing but for the security of knowing that he won't eat the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What I don't understand is Epics are Kunark era and faction over ally/max faction didn't come out until mid Velious (to prevent people from being non kos to all 3 velious factions).   So why would you need max ally? Shouldn't it be max warmly?</div></div><hr />
