Given that I dont really like the tone of the general forums for WoW, I was going to hang around here for any WoW-related chatting.  Is there anything in particular the Forum People here would like checked out that wasn't readily available on the boards? I'll do what I can.  Might as well make myself useful, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nothing for me, yet anyways.<br />
<br />
No biggy though. Not really sure I'd want to continue in beta. I'd rather save up my excitement for release, knowing that it's ok to develop an attachment to my character and not fearing a wipe. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i just got mine, gonna down load when i get home from work.<br />
<br />
cant wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm the kind of person who is addicted to Alts, so re-rolling at release isn't going to be a problem, heh.   <br />
<br />
I'm going to have trouble downloading anyway... At home, i'm on a dialup.  At the school, theres a firewall which - though I haven't tried - has thwarted many other attempts with other files (how often does one get to use the word 'thwart' in a sentence?)  so my only option is to mug my cousin and borrow his cable modem for the duration. <br />
<br />
The frustration...Gah.  Hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm just glad to hear the invites are still rolling out, I still have a chance.  There are definitely some combo's I want to play before live, but I'll probably save my planned main for release.  If I don't get in today I still have open beta.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just read your post after I submitted mine. (slow con today).  Sorry to hear about your luck.

Hehe, no worries, have a great time playing :).  I just posted on the off-chance something would come out of it.  I have bad luck getting into betas, not sure why.  I have a somewhat older, non-cutting edge system that I always think they'd want some data on, I played EQ test server for 2 years, and I actually have experience in other betas (I've beta test DAoC and SWG in the past, but ironically, I always used my brother's beta account).  Somehow he always got in and I never did.<br />
<br />
Oh well, perhaps there's still a small chance of getting in, maybe in the open beta when it happens.  If not, I'm still eagerly awaiting release :).<br />
<br />
I'm still curious about experiences like Izmalis from a more casual/non-raider perspective to see how things are going.  He had a couple nice posts that I enjoyed reading.  Any new opinions from this point of view?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just got in too! One of my EQ-guildmates somehow managed to get our whole guild invited. We are a small bunch of family/friends so I will do my tiny bit to try to make WoW also enjoyable for the casual non-uber-raiders.<br />
<br />
So far it just looks so much better than EQ. And this is still beta. EQ is gonna take a major hit when WoW is released I have no doubt about that no that I have finally had a chance to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doh, no dice for me either. Im starting to jones pretty hard now :(<br />
<br />
But over all im not sweating it, cause if i get in the beta im going to have to kill the work i do anyway, so im fine with waiting for the full release so i can start toons and not have to kill them. But i cant help but desire to play, just a lil ;)<br />
<br />
I just wish they would release it already. Everything seems to be just fine and dandy, atleast in playablity. By the time poeple get to the point where the game is not completely finished, they can roll it out in patch updates. I mean if you level 60 in 1 week, then thats your fault and you dont get WoW if you ask me. The game is about the journey, not the end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow, i've been playing pretty steadily (well, it's the weekend).  I'm usually MUCH more of a casual player who rarely raids myself.<br />
<br />
I'm only level 11, mostly because actually getting the drops I needed for the Call of Fire quest was exceptionally hard :(  This quest you get at level 10, and gets you the Fire Totem, and enables other fire totem types.<br />
<br />
So far, i haven't HAD to group at all, though I did a couple times for various reasons.  The quests are still the same from the stress test, so that helps me out too, heh.  The only frustration with them was the Fire Totem quest I mentioned.<br />
<br />
Still nothing compared to farming rare drops in EQ.  My other quests were for various beasts in the area, and I just wondered and picked off everything I saw - or nearly everything anyway, I think there was only one mob type that WASN'T part of one quest or another. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll add more when I have more productive information to add.  So far, i'm still young yet, and the only thing I can say for sure is, at this point, no content is restricted in any way :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and on a side note, all of my equipment is quested (and some out of date still) and i've made it this far quite easily.  I would have better stuff, if I had taken up skinning and leatherworking for tradeskills (A large amount of mobs around the beginning areas can be skinned.  It would have been a ton easier then herbology/alchemy , but I dont regret the decision - not yet anyway :) )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">bummer =(  I was really hoping to get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's to hoping the open beta is SOON, and release right around the corner.  But I'm happy they're taking their time.<br />
<br />
The sick thing is, I agree with the above, and I don't really WANT in beta, because I already feel like I've seen so much content, and I know I'm going to re-roll another orc and repeat a bunch of quests...  But if I get in, I know myself well enough to know I'll play.  ;)<br />
<br />
Congrats Detton and anyone else who gets in.  I enjoy reading your posts about how it's going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow, i've been playing pretty steadily (well, it's the weekend).  I'm usually MUCH more of a casual player who rarely raids myself.<br />
<br />
I'm only level 11, ...<br />
Sorry if this has been addressed already, but can someone go over a typical &quot;xp curve&quot;?  I've seen this alot that getting to level 10-20 is done over a matter of a day or two it seems.  Does xp slow down?  Is this due to many, many hours per day playing that it happens so fast?  I'm hoping that it slows down a good bit and that the journey to get to max level is the fun part... not getting to max level.  I've always found that games that claim that &quot;the fun starts after your maxxed&quot; do not hold my attention very long (e.g., Shadowbane comes to mind, although that was pvp so perhaps that was true).<br />
<br />
Now true, I can PL a char in EQ to level 20 in a couple days pretty easy (after that it takes a lot longer to level for me at least), but playing a game with no help from the beginning, I would expect levelling to take pretty long.  Heck, it took me close to 80 days played over the course of 2 years to ding 65 in EQ (maybe I'm not normal, who knows).  But in essence, that is what kept me paying and playing.  It wasn't that easy, took a long time, but gave me a long term goal and a sense of accomplishment.  Only problem was that EQ required exp grinding, a lot of which was more work than fun.  Granted, I know that people PL/grind out 65 levels in a few days or something ridiculous like that - I don't really know how they do it but I know I'm not capable of doing it.<br />
<br />
To me, a perfect game with longevity would be like EQ was in the old days where the time to reach max level is measured in years, not days, but it was actually fun, with a variety of different ways to achieve the same goals of max level, quest accomplishments, and some decent loot without a huge disparity between the &quot;haves and have-nots&quot;.  I know some will do it anyway, but I hope we don't see a game where you max out in a month.  Saw this in SWG and other games and especially in a new game - they levelled so fast and they ran out of content.  This then breeds discontent and the boards are full of rants and raves.<br />
<br />
Anyway, starting to ramble now.  Again, I know that some power players will be level six hundred in 2 days no matter what you do, but I hope that WoW just has xp coming in at a nice comfortable rate so I'm not &quot;done&quot; levelling in a month.<br />
<br />
P.S., I remember the &quot;rest&quot; system that WoW has (had?) implemented.  Will this truly stop fast levelling?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's hard to describe - and i'm not the kind of person who likes putting down numbers (such as XP you get per mob, XP til level..).. . frankly, I hate numbers, math, and everything associated with them. :D<br />
<br />
And i'm a computer technician.  Go figure.<br />
<br />
In the stress test, my very first character was an orc shaman, and to get to level 10 took me ... give or take, 3 days, and that was progressing very slowly - I was checking out the sights, trying to figure out where the quest NPCs and targets were.   <br />
<br />
If you're playing the game from the start, brand new, and you dont go to spoiler sights and message boards to learn the &quot;Uber XP Spots&quot; (cough..paludal..), then I think that the XP curve, just hunting, is just about the same as EverQuest's.   Add in quests and it speeds it up, because quest XP rewards are very significant for an even leveled quest.<br />
<br />
I remember those days in EQ, and I remember getting my first character to level 50, I think I made it about a week after Kunark was released. :D<br />
<br />
I dont know if it'll take years for a casual player to hit the level cap, but I can fairly safely say many months to a couple years (depending on your pace - even between casual gamers this varies alot) to get there.  <br />
<br />
Some people will hit max level in a month.  Heck, in the stress test, the short time that was going, people had reached level 40 already.  Frankly, I can't even fathom putting that kind of dedication into a game :) Especially, as you said, you just miss - or blatantly skip - a lot of content to do that.  Like Paludal again in EQ - it's just too fast.  You miss out on, well, everything.<br />
<br />
I'm not one of the people who say EQ is a dismal flop of a game with no story or redeeming features - heck, I love EQ, that's why i played it for so long.  EverQuest, especially back with Verant, had a great storyline for almost every aspect (and I love the epic quest stories, especially shaman).  But, it's only there if you look for it.  <br />
<br />
Leveling does slow down at later levels.  The amount of XP you need for each level does ramp up steadily.  Plus, i'm fairly sure that XP gain is still artificially inflated for beta testing purposes.  I'll get back with actual feedback from my experiences and not just hearsay from the boards, though, when I get to experience it myself.<br />
