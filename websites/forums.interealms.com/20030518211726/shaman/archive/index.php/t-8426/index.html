<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i had my coffee in the office this morning and fixed my magelo profile link, so ill try this again.<br />
<br />
Well i been back now for about 2 months. I had been gone for about a year EQ vacation. My JBB had been mu prozed possesion but i found myself using it less and less and using Cann 4, Horse and Torrent of Poison more often. So i sold JBB and upgraded my equip, i increased my HP/AC and Wis so i think i did well. Would just like your opinions on my gear and or improvements. And your thoughts on the JBB. <br />
<br />
Here is my gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are in pretty damn good shape gear wise. Time to get 60 and start raiding. Maybe get a DMOtE for the face, other than that, most gear upgrades at this point are going to be through raids. Mebbe a silver hammer earring instead of the earing of cleansing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Krakster.<br />
<br />
You can scoop out a couple minor upgrades, or wait and go for the big stuff when you raid.  If you have torpor/mala waiting for you then consider minor stuff for your gear, otherwise, save for your spells.<br />
<br />
I'd consider taking a couple groups to Halls of testing or WToV (depending on faction) for arm/head/BP upgrades, or get 3-4 groups of your good friends and do vindy.  rubicite coif/slime coif (whichever has 65 hp and 16 ac) is a decent upgrade, but by no means earth shattering.  Heiro cloak is better than the lodi shield, but you're better off with the AC atm as you really want to break 1k unbuffed.   Your HP are on track to break 2k unbuffed by 60, nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the response guys. I dont post often here but i do read this board alot. So i have taken all the advice over the past months and been working on my HP/AC gear.  <br />
<br />
Tarthug, i wish those spells where waiting for me. Im dreading leveling to 60 just for the stress getting those spells will cause me heh. Im 1 yellow bubble to 59, i think ill hit 60 and just level AA until i can find my spells..<br />
<br />
Im pretty happy with my gear. Cost me a pretty penny to upgrade but i see the difference in mana pool and HP/AC. I guess once i hit 60 i will start raiding and pray for a Vindi BP..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks solid and you really have reached the point where upgrades will only come from raid mobs or longer quests.  <br />
<br />
If you have time to burn go after an Eyepatch of Plunder, Regal Band of Bathezid/Spirit Wracked Cord, or Coldain ring.  Most higher end quests are a pain, but if you get a few friends to join in they can be tolerable. :)</div></div><hr />
