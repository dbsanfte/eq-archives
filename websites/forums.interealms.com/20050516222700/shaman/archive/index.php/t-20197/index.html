<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The description of the AA ability Call of the Ancients is listed as an endurance regen. Currently, it is a hitpoint regen.<br />
<br />
What is the status of this AA ability? The description still states it is an endurance regen. I purchased two levels since the warriors in my guild said an endurance regen would be a GREAT thing to have (citing the high endurance cost of incite).<br />
<br />
If this ability remains a hitpoint regen, will SOE provide AA refunds? I wouldn't have purchased the ability if the description had accurately described it was a hitpoint regen.</div></div><hr />

Heh heh....I'm sure that it was hp regen from day 1, but someone must have at some point been under the impression that it was endurance, otherwise it wouldn't have said that it was endurance in the description. It was probably originally intended as endurance, and just became hp at some point for whatever reason, but the description wasn't changed ;)</div></div><hr />

If that was the planned effect, it was poorly done.  You have 3 classes with the same ability and they don't stack.  At level one I think it's like a 30hp/tick regen for 5 minutes.  Blessing of Replenishment is better than that in my opinion.  Any class with full worn regen (not too difficult to get with tribute buffs and augments) and a shaman or druid in the group can reach 70hp/tick regen.  If you just had BoReplen and regen 10 from tribute, you have 35hp/tick regen.<br />
<br />
Coupled with the fact they die from mob AEs, this AA is completely worthless.  The lung capacity AA is more useful at this point.  I sincerely hope they change it.  The melee classes in my guild ask me every day if regenerates endurance yet.  I have to keep telling them no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">as there are 2 other class that have this regen, it certainly would be nicer to have something different that stacks. Stamina regen  would be nice, but if it had an atack increase too , or just a gerneral increase to mellee ablilities be nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The fix should be to the effect, not the description imo.<br />
<br />
Endurance regen (or even some other buff) would be far more desirable than the hp regen, which the druids and clerics already offer. It fits in with our old role of stamina regen buffers (invigorate/acumen line) which we lost with the change from stamina to endurance and would provide a unique shaman ability to help give us an extra, useful thing to do on raids.<br />
<br />
I also feel these wards need to be immune to AEs, or at least have a load more hitpoints so they last more than one AE attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd like my AA back, because as HP regen, it's worthless.  I'd buy it only if I already had 500 AA.  <br />
<br />
That's my vote.  <br />
<br />
If they change it to an Endurance regen, I'll keep it.  I don't think they are going to do that because I don't think they have confidence on how these things interact from a balance prespective.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting Brenlo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone reads the boards or participates in the serverwide.crucible channel. The description in the AA window STILL says endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yep, fix it one way or another.  Refund the points if it's not meant to be endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I guess the issue is if more than one Ward in a area stacks.<br />
<br />
If they do stack, then keep it as HP Regen.  Every group and raid I've been in wants more HP Regen and they really do not care about END Regen.   <br />
<br />
Why do they not care about END Regen?   Three reasons.  First, most melee do not use enough END in the corse of a single encounter to warrent a END regen.  Second, because encounters are over quickly and you move on.  A Ward would be left behind as soon as the raid or group finished the mob it has engaged.    And finally, half of the raid force is non-melee, they dont care about END at all and would rather have MANA or HP regen.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a END/HP couple or a END/HP/MANA triplet so we can do what we've always been trained to do... help everybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They do not stack.<br />
<br />
Warriors in my guild loved the idea of an endurance regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Didn't SoE stated that NO Endurance regen items or abilities were being looked at shorlty after they revamped the new melee changes? I thought I read something to that extent. <br />
Then when when GoD came out and I looked through the AA's and saw that, I was excited about getting that AA, since it could make us more beneficial in a group/raid.... maybe it's time to rethink that since SoE is now saying it's meant as HP only. To me it seems someone in SoE isn't talking to others, or no one wants to assume responsibilty on this and either make it do what it says, or fix it so it does what it was meant.</div></div><hr />

Some news for you all.<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients, apparently the description is incorrect and we will be refunding any AA's used to purchase it. It is intended to grant HP and not endurance.<br />
<br />
I talked with the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; and he was already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT and will let me know when he has something concrete. <br />
<br />
The team is also looking to shift the slow immune creatures about, in some Gates zones, so that there are no concentrations of them in one area. <br />
<br />
I will pass along more information as I get it.<br />

Just to expand a bit on what Brenlo said:<br />
<br />
The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells. The healing changes in general are aimed at significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations. While we certain maintain that clerics should be the best at healing, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting.<br />
<br />
The frequency of slow immune NPCs in Gates is also being looked at, and there is the possibility of some adjustment in certain areas if we find it necessary. Although this will likely only apply to a few specific areas where the concentration is especially high.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">***... endurance regen sucks.  Only gimps use all their endurance in 1 encounter.  HP regen is WAY better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My 65 war with 280str/dex/agi/sta uses up about 3 yellows for a duration of mighty strike disc.  When I use that much endurance on one fight it forces me to conserve endurance for quite a few fights (= far less berates) to get the endurance back up to where it has to be to use another high cost disc (furious, charge, mighty strike, etc)<br />
<br />
With fairly fast pulls and using lots of berates I am way behind my natural endurance regen.  My warrior is normally regenning 300+hp/tick (pretty much always Q'd) and with so many ways to regen hp, why is it way better again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Likley +endurance will be added to lots(all?) old gear with next patch, as it's already starting to show up on old gear on Lucy. As well as the display changes in the way effects are handled (for instance, haste items will say +Haste 40%). So it will mean you'll be able to longer in one go..but still have to wait awhile for it to regen back..longer for that as well =-(</div></div><hr />
