<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ya know, ever since I joined my new guild about 2 months ago; I've been sucked into the leveling grind.  And I think that's where all my frustration with Vork has come from.  So instead of grind/frustration/grind/die/rezz/buff/grind..... What I want to know now is everyone's opinion of the most FUN zones/camps they have experienced.  Exp isnt a factor, I want to get back to the exitement I had with my Shaman when he was in his 30's and low 40's.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The most fun I ever had was grouping with my RL friends. It didn't matter if we were doing Guk LDoNs, camping some epic mob, or fighting spectres and sand giants. I remember having half my bank full of various tongues, heads, and sundry body parts at one point... that must have stunk! Not that I probably helped you any...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, my focus has been on having fun - which for me means not doing the exp grind, but rather seeing most/all the dungeons I can onthe way up.<br />
Trouble with that is many friends I make in game are on the 'fast road to 65' and I get left behind...oh well.<br />
I just dinged 57 a week or so ago and have 54 AA's - that should give you an idea of how slow the 50's have been for me :)<br />
<br />
Like Samanna says - playing with RL friends is the best.  I'm almost always grouped with my chantress wife which is a great start for any group if we decide to take that route.  I guess what I'm getting at is that in order to properly answer your question though it would be good to know your playing style.  Are you almost always grouped? guildmates, pickups, solo???<br />
<br />
Aside from simply exploring the vast number of dungeons available to someone in their 50's there's one other thing I like to do.<br />
<br />
Quests...these can be most rewarding.  The latest one we're on is for Zeannor's thesis page 16 (enchanter lvl 58 nuke research).  Apparently it drops in Velk's Lab off crystal golems...musta killed 40 of em last night and nada - but sure was entertaining trying to navigate that labyrinth first time being there...<br />
Casting while sliding on ice - a true pleasure :)<br />
One day I will stand over the body of Velketor and spit on his stinking corpse!  <br />
<br />
So I guess that's my other suggestion...instead of looking for zones that yield exp...look for ones that might yield an item drop or something and exp will be the by-product...I have looked at your gear though - it is unlikely that you can get an upgrade from something you killed but let an item be the draw to a place<br />
<br />

<br />
p.s. suggestions assuming you are lvl 53 as your magelo states.<br />
Back part of CoM (solo/duo exp spot)<br />
Nurga (many named in here)<br />
Tunnel section of Torgiran Mines<br />
Get your keys for Old Seb and HS<br />
Arena in Kael can be fun if you got a full group<br />
Acrylia caverns (nice loot near entrance)<br />
Bug/Bats in solB when soloing -beware the death beetle :) keep away from imps at your level - will get too many adds at lvl 53<br />
Small group 3-4 could likely do warlord/hands in Karnors depending on classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I never went into HS or even got my key until the 1.5 spoiler said it was needed, but it did seem like a really cool zone. Different wings with different level mobs. Also, courtesy of the 1.5 quest, I went to the bottom of... that underground dungeon by Field of Bone. That was cool, too, although it was all green to me by then. I'm starting to see why people loved the Kunark graphics and zone design so much more than that of PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Man, I remember CoM being a total blast when I was in my 50's.  Soloing was super fun and so was grouping.  Much &lt;3 to this day for CoM.<br />
<br />
Late 50's, I had some good fun in Nadox too, I would think you and your wife could have some fun killing the troll dudes and maybe a couple piggies just in from the zone, down the lava river.  One day I went to solo a piggie and pulled him, and couldn't figure out why he was kicking my bum.  Well, someone had given him a set of mage weaps and he was proccing me into the ground.  But seeing that little angry Puumba with a pair of swords sticking out at a totally perpendicular angle from his legs was such a hoot.<br />
<br />
Skyfire might be another place to check out, there *may* be some charmable mobs for your wife, which could surely lend some excitement fast.  I remember skyfire being a fun place to just run around and do crazy zergy killing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">kunark quests. very fun, and not too difficult. key quests, canni quest, and such, I remember losing alot of bodies in KC and Trak's Teeth. still very fun.<br />
<br />
HS is alot safer now that there is a corpse summoning lobby. my first HS stint for solo didn't meet well, I got jumped by 3 mobs at the ZI, as I was misinformed that it was a safe spot as long as you were invis. lol.<br />
<br />
try going to a zone you've never been to, old-world or otherwise. work on older keys. try and see the things you've never seen before, you'll usually find something interesting or a small event you never heard about. like stumbling on Hollowshade war for the first time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OOH I just thought of another one!  Go to the Ry'gorr fort in umm EW.  I had an absolute solo blast there in my lower 50's.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks everyone. It's good to hear about other's experiences through the 50's.  Guess I really need to get that second computer so the wife and I can duo, eh? In keeping with the feel of the thread, I would have to say the most fun I ever had was running around solo in Runnyeye back in my mid 30's.  Exciting enough to give you sweaty fingers. Which is bad when you slip on the keys and DoT the bartender in there.  Aggro'd the entire zone running around looking for the exit.  And I mean the ENTIRE zone, hehe.  Got map-packs the next day. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Last night got a group in UP. a 63 shammy, 65 chanter, and me.  Grew into a necro, sk, and cleric.<br />
Chanter tash pulled, and I Dot'd/slowed until i had full aggro.  Then i stood there and beat away with all 3 pets helping. Had a blast until the SK tried a pull and brought in 4 mobs.  Things got ugly.  Up to that point though, i was making 1% a kill.  The great part was how much fun it was.  First time being a part of tash pulling, and it worked great.  Cant wait to try again tonight. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maryienes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">During the low to mid 50's what I loved was OOT soloing cyclops, Dulak's Harbor on either the boats or in the ship yard (nifty nameds in there on a fairly regular basis).  Upper 50's had me in Nadox by the fake wall entrance - a challenge to solo, but fun going deeper in as you level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brewnoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Think the most fun spot I hit in the low to mid 50s grouped was PoMischief (post Kragg's - anywhere I was MH and the only slower kept me on my toes).  For soloing the armory in Dulak was a blast around 53-54 - couple tricky pulls and the boats to fall back on if it was camped (Shimmering emerald crystal was a nice upgrade for me before I caught a guild language fair for my tainted heartstone)</div></div><hr />
