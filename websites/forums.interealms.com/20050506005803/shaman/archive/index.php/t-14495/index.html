<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all , <br />
<br />
     I know the 3 camps in ME for the shard. Was doing the prophet camp the last two nights and 4 prophets one shard. Logged in tonight and the 3 are camped. Which got me wondering can scouts drop the shard?<br />
<br />
    Ive helped people do this shard when i didnt think i was ever going to bother with it. So when the shard dropped everyone was so relieved and we had been mass killing the few times that i dont remember what dropped it. Was wondering about scouts because along the wall past the BM and than the prophet camp is another 3 set of scouts heading towards the Umbral Zone. <br />
<br />
  Btw whose mean idea was it for the named and scouts to drop the POS hardwood staff or whatever it is. The graphic at first glance looks alot like a shard. Ive seen a bunch of those even off the prophet once when  it dropped the shard. Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Scouts never drop shards.<br />
<br />
Every scout is a ph for a named gorganda. For example, the scouts by the dsp zone in are ph for The Seer. The scouts by AR are ph for The Battlemaster &lt;- I think that's the name, the 3 spawn next to the 2spawn by AR are ph for The Phrophet... etc.. so you kill scouts until named pops and if you are lucky the named will have a shard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well hmm. Still getting conflicting reports. Friend of mine has a shard on one of two toons who wouldnt be able to kill a named in ME. Problem is its toons he doesnt play that often and cant remember what mobs it was.  He has only killed the 3 scouts that ph the seer camp and regular mobs. <br />
<br />
  PLus there is a 3 scout camp that arent ph'es for anything that i know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry forgot ...Thanks for the reply khozik. <br />
<br />
    Just also kinda irritated. shards can bring out the worse in people. Was getting hassled for killing the 3 scounts down the wall from the prophet. Ubah's figured i was screwing them out of a few mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there's a nice post with map on safehouse, maybe someone with some initiative will link it for ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont really need a map persay. I know the camps that are mentioned. Been to them all and actually just got seer to pop with a shard weeeee. <br />
   But been getting conflicting info on the other scouts and mobs in zone. My friends druid has a shard , he isnt collecting them else his SK would have it. But wasnt anyone in the zone to give it too and he couldnt kill a named but doesnt remember what dropped it. I however have never seena shard off anything else that i knew of.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Just like this. Friend tells me his druid has a shard and he hasnt killed a named type in the zone. Ive helped get a couple shards before but was big mass killing and i dont really know what dropped it at the time. Was a long day and i was just slowing all that moved. Tonight people from an ubah guild were made i was killing those scouts. Said screwed them of a few spawns while they were shard camping. Soon as i left i popped in another char to move them to zoneline and they were killing the scounts along the wall towards UP farther along the wall coming out of AR. Past the BM camp and past the prophet camp is a 3 of scouts i see people kill alot while shard hunting. Why it had me curious is all. Plus was trying to camp one last night and the 3 camps were all taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They were probably worried that you would kill those scouts and say you're killing them, then when the named popped you were going to take the named and loot the shard as well.. Generally when I'm there helping friends if someone wants to kill scouts I group them or help em out but I let them know that if a named pops, the shards are mine no questions asked and they always agree.. <br />
<br />
Your friend probably killed a named, they are not much harder than regular scouts, and if a shard drops in maidens and no one in zone, send a tell to a guild member that you know is doing VT, I'm sure you'll get 10k out of it or something =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Scouts can NOT drop shards.  I've killed over 300 scouts in ME and never saw one shard on them.  Nor did anyone in my entire guild when we were doing our VT keys.  Scouts dropping shards is nothing more than a pipe dream.  I just wish I got exp from that camp when I was doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive always given shards away when i didnt need them so whoever is one i try to find them. Thanks for the replies. I killed alot of scouts myself and never seen anything off them either. I have 3 60+ char's and while i'm not guilded i am going to do the shards so when i do join a guild i wont be having to split time with raids /guild stuff and shards. As for the ME shard i just want to get them all done at once so i never have to camp ME for myself again. <br />
<br />
   Was sad today i changed camps because no one was in zone and was tired of prophet. After i got set up and cleared the close wanderers at seer people started filling in and wasnt much later that someone said woot finally a shard. Found out the prophet popped lol. Evil evil damn zone for shards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Join the guild BEFORE you do the shard, a lot of guild are years away from VT and some plan to skip it, so don't go through hell for nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Of course, having 10 shards and being close to finishing an emp key can make you a more attractive candidate to some guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On some servers that is...mine for the most part doesn't matter.  Besides, really, there is only a few ****ty camps for the most part..although with my luck everyone turns out ****ty.  I have had my VT key for a few months now...and I was asked to help a pally friend get his Grey shard.  Well, 4 hours later... the damn thing finally dropped.  The only freaking saving grace was the fact that I actually gained just a little bit of exp there.  Mobs were killed as soon as it popped.<br />
<br />
Really, have heard horror stories about the ME shard.  My suggestion is that you camp it late at night when there is no one else around.  I camped it around 8am and I was able to get the zone to myself and another pally friend.  After clearing all camps we got the prophet with shard on the second repop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BAH second repop shards, I hate you.<br />
<br />
On about the 22nd hour of camping the damn place and I have only seen a named pop TWICE (my wife got one shard, named didn't drop one the other time).<br />
<br />
I hate this zone with a PASSION.  They changed the pathing by Akheva a couple of patches ago and now it's next to impossible to pull the camp under the tree near Akheva (Prophet camp?) without adding a dog or robe half the time.  Mobs have way, way too many HP for their level and the XP is squat.  Just give up my shard and let me get the hell OUT of there already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I finally got 3 shards from there. Two from seer. I found that pulling prophet is easier over the hill  and along the wall going towards Ups. I could watch the mobs patching around there and pull in between drive bys. I'm done with them there but i still hate the damn zone hehe.</div></div><hr />
