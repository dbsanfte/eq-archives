<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been running my Shaman/Mage duo with a great deal of success but after getting trained 3 times at the Gaolers by players who did not know boulders see inviso i need a cleric becuasse i'm sick of wasting my time looking for a rez.  My first thought was HE or Dwarf but i read that the snare necklace that troll shaman get is a DE cleric item too.  The biggest negative about shaman/mage is no snare, i know earth pet can root and shaman can root but those are not 100%  everytime.  So my question is: is it worth losing some stats and being emcumbered all the time =) as a DE cleric just to get the snare necklace?  This will be a BOT and will not group up with others he will be PLed to 56.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There must be something I am missing...you worry about getting a snare necklace yet you say he will not be grouping with others just pl'd to 56? To do 96 percent resses I take it?<br />
<br />
If you are ditching your mage and trying to make another duo then shadowknight or ranger would both have a snare and be far better combined with shaman than a cleric. Another option would be making a paladin instead - they dont have snare but they do get 90 percent res at level 59. And again a paladin would be a far better partner for a shaman than a cleric.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 ranger I 2-box with my shaman and thats a fine combo. Only problem is rangers are not the greatest of tanks. So I am now in the process of levelling up a paladin. So far he seems like a very capable tank especially against undead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I say go halfling if it is just a bot... that would have the least experience penalty (ie faster powerleveling).<br />
<br />
Then if you are still not enjoying the mage you can powerlevel up a SK, Monk or BST do duo with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not giving up either the Mage or shaman this i will be on a third account which i will run on my second machine.  I EQWin the shaman/mage combo and have cleric setup on backup machine.  Odds are i will not group him up with the mage./shaman just have him there to snare at about 50% throw a cheal if things get out of hand and rez when things go bad.  He will group up with my 65 druid to get PLed but he will just be sitting while i charm killing in PoN and PoS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The snare necklace is nice but remember that it is a low level snare which means short duration. It does come in handy but the higher level my boyfriend and I got, the less he actually used the necklace. That's just our experience, though, I've seen others swear that it is the best thing ever :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The snare necklace is the same one that trolls get. It's a necro's lowest level snare so it doesn't snare as well as what your probably used to and only lasts like 30 seconds. It is possible to use it as a snare but in a botting situation it might be a bit troublesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would agree with the halfling suggestion since its supposed to be a bot.  Faster leveling &gt; the troublesome, mostly ineffective, snare necklace.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With 10K plat and the bazaar you can make anyone's stats the same. Starting stats should be the last thing you consider when making a new character because they have the least amount of impact in the life of that toon.  Faction has more bearing than starting stats just because it's harder to raise. If you want the snare necklace the only downside I see the exp penalty and that you have to look like a halfling to do part of the quest.  I can live with the exp hit but if one of my friends see me in halfling form I would die of embaressment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Halfling.  Racial Sneak and Hide, good starting WIS and STA, good faction, exp bonus, and best of all, smells like cabbage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That doesn't even really apply for warriors anymore. They get an aa that gives them high resistance to stuns. So it's almost as good as an ogre. Neither is truely stun immune either. It protects from being stunned by melee attacks, ie bash, kicks, slams. Neither does anything to protect you from spell based stuns in ae's, procs or spells cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Human? Well your stats are blase and you can't see. So BPT to buy or buff Ultravision a lot. Welcome in a lot of places if you'r eworried abotu faction.<br />
<br />
Dwarf? Make SURE you put 5 points into Agility to start. Otherwise you're sitting at 70 and taking a huge AC hit. Kaladim is nice and you can CB belt your way to 9-10th level fast. (as with other goods) You can see, decent WIS and STA.<br />
<br />
Gnome? Short. I mean REALLY short. Halflings post up on them when the races get together to play basketball. Decent stats and iinm you can choose to be evil. Has infravision. I was never a big Ak Anon fan.<br />
<br />
High Elf? Good brain stats, suffer from Laura Flynn Boyle disease (Too damned skinny and pale). <br />
<br />
Halfing? Can see, short but can still take Gnomes to the hole. Infravision. Decent stats. Good starting town. EXP BONUS.<br />
<br />
Erudite. Only if you enjoy playing a human in a worse starting zone and is equally blind. However, they do look cool in a lot of gear.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf. My Favorite. ULTRA-VISION. Good stats. Sorta frail so if you're into the stat thing bump STA. EXP penalty. Also look cool in a lot of gear.<br />
<br />
Remember the three Special Forces rules of EQ:<br />
<br />
1) Always know where you are<br />
2) Look cool<br />
3) If you don't know where you are, at least try to look cool</div></div><hr />

My DE cleric has the snare necklace and it barely slows the mob down, it doesn't last long and it has a long cast time from the necklace.  It's a lot of fun to use at lowere levels to point out to your Druid and Ranger and SK groupmates what a sad day it is when the Cleric has to snare, but at higher levels it doesn't do much.  One of my favorite things about that quest was the halfling illusion mask that unfortunately only had one charge.  <br />
DE clerics look cool.<br />

I run a cleric\shaman dual box combo...with your stat buffs, the cleric is NEVER encumbered, and with only moderate gear, his melee stats will all be well over 200. Mine is, indeed, a dark elf. I love my clicky snare necklace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Epic?  It took a lot less time to PL our cleric bot in the group than it would've to camp all that epic garbage.  *grin*  Who is, of course, a hobbit, for the 5% exp bonus.  Frogs are just a blitheringly stupid idea for a PC race, and I'm fairly sure they do NOT get the exp bonus.  I've never regretted making the cleric a hobbit.  Hell, we even got her to 61 for virtue (a lot cheaper than aego) just because it was so easy with a shaman and a mage.  She literally got to 61 just tagging along popping CH's while we camped for quests and gear.</div></div><hr />

But that is not why I'd go DE for cleric. I do DE for the inate hide ability. DE wis is not too bad and they only have a 5% exp penalty (like most other races). If leveling fast is your thing, go halfling for inate sneak and a -5% penalty.</div></div><hr />

For the love of pete....<br />
Why is it so hard to remember the exp restrictions to the different races?  There are only FIVE races that have any type of modifier.<br />
<br />
Halflings get 105% exp for ever kill (+5%)<br />
Barbarians get 95% exp for every kill (-5%)<br />
Ogres get 85% exp for every kill (-15%)<br />
Trolls get 80% exp for every kill (-20%)<br />
Iksar get 80% exp for every kill (-20%)<br />
<br />
EVERY OTHER RACE GETS 100% exp for every kill.  Learn it.  I really cannot understand how something that has been in place since day 1 of EQ (and day 1 of Kunark expansion for Iksar) is gotten SO wrong by SO many people.<br />
<br />
Yes, Im being an ass about it.  My coffee maker is broken, and so is my car, so its REALLY a bad day here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Don't warriors and rogues also get an additional 5% tacked onto each kill?  Please correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Class =/= Race.  Though warriors and rogues do gain an XP bonus (10% IIRC, though I may well be wrong on that).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">However there are still class bonuses...<br />

I started a bot cleric not too long ago. Went with halfling. Exp bonus, sneak, hide, welcome in a lot of places, decent starting stats...and there aren't all that many of them around compared to say the high elf or dwarf.<br />
<br />
Haven't looked back, and he easily outpaced my friend's froglok cleric(started at the same time) in leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Be a frog.  If you're going to deck him out in equipment anyway, wisdom and every other stat doesn't matter one bit.  Plus you have a Shaman.  Even less to worry about stat-wise (except for wisdom)<br />
<br />
The casting animation is cool,  and swimming isn't the WORST idea for a bonus.  Granted, I dont think they get an experience bonus, but eh...<br />
<br />
I heard a very, very vague rumor about a mana regen bonus, but it was so small and so vague i would not consider it as any kind of a plus to the race.<br />

It works better with Froggie shamans, but you can have people &quot;lick the magic frog&quot; this way, too :)<br />

Penalties:  Ogres - 15%, Trolls/Iksars - 20%, Barbs - 5%<br />
<br />
Bonuses:   Halflings - 5%, Warriors - 10%, Rogues - 5%.<br />
<br />
Thats the only penalties/bonuses left in the game.  Verant explained this in a patch message a long time.<br />

So yes, a Halfling Warrior would get a 15% &quot;bonus&quot; to experience - or need 15% LESS experience to level that another class.</div></div><hr />

why not push for 59 and get the 100% exp, no rezz effects, ressurection through AA? 100% EXP BACK! and no low Strenght, PLUS you come back with full life/mana! loss of buff still stands though 8( but still...you'll never lose exp with that AA rezz.<br />

If you want a fast levelling, hiding little runt, who is the second most ugly possible PC race, go halfling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">My understanding is that the snare necklace has a 30 second duration and an 8 second casting time. If you have that on a L 56 trying to snare mobs that the shaman/mage are fighting at L 65, I'd think that you'll almost never succeed in sticking the snare, even with Malos on the target mob. So I wouldn't make it a considerationg. Go halfling for the 10% less exp required. <br />
<br />
But seriously.... do you think that you're going to PL a cleric to L 56 FASTER than it would take you to make back the exp loss from a few unrezz'd deaths?  I know exp-loss deaths suck bad, but powerleveling clerics is PAINFUL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree, I got killed in an LDON the other night and decided to eat the death.  I decided that rather than wait an hour for the corpse to pop out, I would get some shuteye.  It took me all of about 10 minutes to make the exp back.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Side note, why the hell do barbs have an exp penalty anyway?  We get racial slam (woooohooo :p) and umm.... we're nightblind and ummm... ummmm.... help me out here... oh yeah, we're dead sexy and ummmm... that's about it.</div></div><hr />
