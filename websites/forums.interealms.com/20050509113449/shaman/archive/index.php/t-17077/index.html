<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a shaman and a ranger, since those are my two preferred classes to play, who do you think will fare better in lvl 50-60 plus pvp?<br />
<br />
hoping I get that far lol<br />
<br />
I heard rangers have had their archery nerfed in pvp and that shaman spells get resisted alot due to high resists of players.<br />
<br />
So it's kind of a toss up, but I do like the rangers ability to track and snare.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call would seem to be a hoot in pvp, send out the hounds.<br />
<br />
So what do you think? Any experienced pvpers out there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman can be okay in support roles in pvp if you have other dmg dealing classes to put people down.  If you're going solo, I'd go with the ranger without a doubt.  Despite the archery nerf, rangers still do some serious dmg in pvp.  Solo, shaman are one of the worst pvp classes in my opinion (I'm speaking from the experience of lvl 65 pvp, generally highly-geared opponents).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same here, go with the ranger, a smart ranger who stays out of range of lifetaps and harm/deathtouches will own any other class imho.... Unfortunately, I've come to realize that my shaman's only job is to twink out my 51 ranger =P...and then my newbie wizard =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frogy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rangers will not own every other class, but they would be better than shamans for pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Frogy goes down pretty fast I must say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman(particularly ogre shaman due to the unstunability) are insane in pvp. There are not many fights that a shaman will lose. Granted, when gear gets to the elemental level so you can't land spells, a shaman can do no offense. But you can generally outlast any caster by keepin yourself healed.<br />
<br />
Rangers are pretty good in pvp, with chloroblast and am3. They dish out major dmg even with the nerf, and they can hit fast if they decide to come in to melee ya. I do not regret having rolled a shaman, and I never will regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We don't win any pvp encounters either.<br />
<br />
With the recent removal of the recharge ability on charged items we just dropped down from mediocre to somewhere in the muck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have always found SK to be very proficent in PvP. I have played Rallos exclusively in my EQ career so...take it how ever you like. Shaman in PvP typically get hammered because our spells get resisted so often. Only play SHM if your planning on having SK RNG or PAL friends to be back up for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Basicly what Asta said.<br />
<br />
When facing well-geared players ie guilds who have killed their way thru Ssra (or cash fat twinks) we dont land any spells due to their resists.<br />
<br />
Any mediocre player with crappy resist we can kill, but so can anyone. :(<br />
<br />
Bards own PvP. SK's and Paladins are good too. Rangers can also be a major pain along with chanters. Also depends on who youre facing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Beautiful sig, Vigdis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you... yours i very nice too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Be a shaman, no other class can do what we do.<br />
<br />
1.  We have class stamina, we can outlast nearly every other class save bard, which you MUST nuke down after a malos.<br />
<br />
2.  We are the tank mage, paladin comes close but overall resists are the major factor.  Tank mage as in UO terms, we can heal over time/Tnargs, we can dot/nuke and we can annul/root and have a pet.  If you have a dark mace of thought or sharkspine club you are god.<br />
<br />
3.  With resists all 400+, in a equal battlefield, its a tough call.  A bard can mana drain you, rapture you (crimson potions stop it), and then melee you down, only 2 bards on SZ I know of that can beat me and thats because of insane resists and ghosting.  <br />
<br />
Any class is godly with enough resists, clickies, etc... But only a shaman can outlast nearly EVERY class other then a fast bard.  Paladins are a bit tough sometimes as well.<br />
<br />
Your keys to victory are:<br />
MD+VP<br />
Malos / BoS / Ancient:scourge / Tears<br />
DogDog always up at the ready with 2 weapons and hastes<br />
Your bag full of stinging wort pots<br />
Pendant of malosini helps as well with chains after a malos<br />
Blind, we get it a lv39, 0 resist mod check, low enough MR (110+) you can do it.<br />
<br />
Your choice, I go with shaman with high resists, we can always strip down someone with malos, and no one likes malos :)  I am usually one of the first to die in wars because of malos, kill the shaman first, and victory is assured, let the shaman live, and his healing dots, his debuffs, his annuls, his dogdogs WILL wear you down, if the VP does not get you first ;)<br />

<br />
thk you for confirming what I have always known, shaman are uber<br />
<br />
but I will most likely be the cannon fodder... for a long while until I get decent gear and some decent levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">SK is currently king of PvP as far as I'm concerned.  They have taps with exceptional heals, great 2h weapons for jousting, and of course, Death Touch.<br />
<br />
Bard is nice, but is more annoying then anything ... a necro or SK can take out a bard without problem, its just a mtter of actually killing them before they run off to heal that's a problem.  However, since selo's is usually in the top slot and has a 3 second? cast on it, it gives you a very nice window of oppurtunity if you are smart.  But then again, bards can train very very easily and can mez/manadrain you if they are smart enough to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ninth just loves me, esp when I tailor emotes to each class, area and location, as for gunning for me first, its great watching people just dump mana into me and I absorb it all, while your clerics/druids/shaman die :)<br />
<br />
400 mr?  Just broke 318 mr with auggies, only 82 to 400, and i do not even have a RoR :(  If i got a pair, I would be at what? 430?  :D<br />
<br />
But shaman are gods in pvp, a SK is strong yes, any class can be played to a draw in the right setting.  Most annoying class: Bard with DA refresh every 3 mintues, mana drain and rapture.  Your most powerful weapon as a shaman?  Adaptation, adapt to each battle, know what to do in each situation, and strike first.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shaman &gt; rangers if you're smart and fight in areas that are to your advantage.<br />
<br />
A smart bard is the only class I'd say is impossible for a shaman to kill.  I've killed SKs a lot more than I've ever been killed by one, a lot more.  Most classes/people underestimate me and that's what usually gets them killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think it's hard to compare, but I see all these people from other red servers saying that they regularly defeat SK's on their server, and to be honest, I find it hard to believe.  Maybe we've got ultra-talented SKs on Rallos, but I can seriously say that an SK that doesn't beat a shaman in pvp is either seriously lacking in AA's or is a straight up gimp.  No SK should lose to a shaman in pvp.<br />
<br />
edit - I mean potions to cure dots, aa's to crit taps, holy steed (whereas a lot of shaman don't have horses in comparison to knights at this level of play), so on and so forth.  It takes one or two good rounds of melee plus a crit HT to drop any class in the game.  Combine that with the fact that very few people fight alone anymore and (at least on rallos) 90% of the pvp encounters consist of the shaman (if there isn't a wanton cleric or chanter to pick on) taking the first nuke or two of the encounter and the Sk just says, &quot;Smell ya later&quot; with an auto-crit HT. <br />
<br />
I love my class, don't get me wrong.  I just don't play the arena style pvp game, and my honest opinion is that shaman don't cut in pvp lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have narrowed down my servers to either Tallon Zek or Vallon Zek<br />

<br />
I have played on Vallon Zek since before Kunark. There is no longer any item loot, only coin loot, so everyone banks often.<br />
<br />
You can PK people that do not belong to your team and they have to be within 8 levels. The teams are as follows:<br />
<br />
Blue team: Human, Erudite, Barbarian, Frog, Cat <br />
<br />
Purple team: Gnome, Dwarf, Halfling <br />
<br />
Yellow team: High Elf, Half Elf and Wood Elf  <br />
<br />
Orange team: Dark elf, Ogre, Troll and Iksar. <br />
<br />
Vallon Zek was all four teams against eachother for the first months. Then the &quot;Light&quot; teams banded together vs the &quot;Dark&quot; team (orange) because there were so many Darks back then.<br />
<br />
Now that every high end guild is more or less 4-team ie mixing players from all teams the light vs dark thing is of the past.<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek today is dominated by guild vs guild conflicts and this is troubled by the fact that /guildwar is disabled on VZ/TZ so even if your guild is at war with other guilds, you cannot still hit people of the same team... For instance, if an Iksar is fighting a Woodelf 1 on 1 and suddenly comes a high elf cleric who starts healing the Iksar, then the Woodelf cannot hit that cleric since he is on the same team. This is called immortal-healing and is a large problem.<br />
<br />
In mass pvp 4 team guilds are benefitted by the fact that they can employ shamans of both Blue and Orange teams wich means we can cast malos on all kinds of players. 3-team non orange guild can never cast Malos on a player of the blue team since barbarians are the only &quot;lighty&quot; shamans.<br />
<br />
High end pvp is dominated by 2 groups of guilds that fight eachother. Every guild is usually alone but there are occasions when members from guilds in the same group join eachother for raids. The strongest guild on server at current is Defiant (time flagged) and their #1 competitor Ancient Dawn (2/4 elemental gods dead).<br />
<br />
With the current imbalance between classes most 1 on 1 pvp can be tipped to one persons favor depending on what class you play, but when pvp really shines is when large guilds face eachother ie over 100 ppl fighting for zone control. Lately the competition has been harsh and there have been occasions where people train eachoter on purpose and refuse to abide to Loot and Scoot. When you die in pvp you will leave zone for 1 hour but sometimes people Bindrush and get back in fight after they have died. It's kinda sad but the constant fighting have left very little love between some guilds and officers are hard strained to maintain the fragile balance.<br />
<br />
I dont have a good view of lower guild pvp since i only play my lvl 65 main, but there are still large alliances of guilds who either run pure-team ie only orange or 3-team ligthy vs darkies.<br />
<br />
I dont have a great deal of info on Tallon Zek but it should be similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tallon Zek is very similiar.  We are also a 4-team server, basically.  Our top guild is Pandemonium who just recently got into to Time.  There's a lot of grief play at the top, but that's really just to be expected no matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I love my class, don't get me wrong. I just don't play the arena style pvp game, and my honest opinion is that shaman don't cut in pvp lately.<br />
<br />
I agree.  Problem started cropping up with VT+ resist levels on opponents.  <br />
<br />
It's great that your resists are high and that nobody can land anything on you, but we are a class that pretty much *relies* on landing resistable spells.  Poison/Disease/Cold/Magic.<br />
<br />
Against a melee with resists &gt; 300 in all these areas (and there are a ton of them lately) you're a shaman with no arms hobbling on one leg.<br />
<br />
All the tricks in the world aren't going to win pvp fights if you can't land stuff.  Arena?  Sure ya, gimme a sharkspine club and alot of time and I'll kill a warrior with 500 in all resists.<br />
<br />
On the battlefield it's very unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Only 3 teams there, and 2 of them are combined with (hate) being lead evil, with good teams lead (black prophecy) being led by a hate member which allows xteaming to take place easily vs neutral lead (tides of wrath) who 99% of the time wins the wars due to most of the hardcore PvPers being neutral.<br />
<br />
Its like this, you have 3 teams and 1 is a non factor, so its more like a 2 team server.  EP access is nice, but resists are where its at. <br />
<br />
Our other problem is that evil team has 3 sources of burners, whereas neutral has only one.  We took the archery nerf (neutral/good), while evil team (lifeburn not nerfed/DT to 75 percent) still is a bit harsh.  One shot abilities should be removed from the game or given to each class, or at the very least be made resistable.  Goes for any class.  It just ruins the game and takes away from the sport of PvP combat.<br />

god dont go tz/vz, xteaming is rampant, imortal healing is everywhere. <br />
<br />
SZ has the same loot rules, full range pvp and hard coded teams, you know who your enemies are and you usually know that if you con somone and they dont con ally a fight is on.<br />
<br />
oh yeah its coin only within 5 lvls but pvp with no limits.</div></div><hr />
