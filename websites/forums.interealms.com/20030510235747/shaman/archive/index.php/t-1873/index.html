<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bankster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lots of faction issues around regarding the shaman epic it <br />
seems. <br />
<br />
Well I have done all of the steps up to the tear from fear. I've done everything in order, wolf, ghiosk, kirn, neh. Now a friend of mine (shaman, has epic) recently looted a tear from a fear raid. <br />
<br />
So he is max faction truespirit<br />
<br />
I am also max faction Truespirt after doing the woe envy marr's promise part again. I don't meen just ally, i also got the your faction could not possibly get better message.<br />
<br />
Hypothetical situation:<br />
<br />
he hands in tear Rak, rak aggros ( on him but aggros none the less), rak is keeled by us, I loot the the scale, I turn in the scale to the spirit.   Will I have the spear in my inventory at this point? :)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind again both of us will have max faction so any faction hit I would get for turning in the tear would be absolutly meaningless.<br />
<br />
I've done it by thr book the whole way, but fear is a PITA, and if i can avoid it, I will. Sorry for being lame.<br />
<br />
Well so whadaya think, will it work? If the quest is still faction based then having max faction when I turn in the scale should be enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went to City of Mist last night with an epic shaman.  So, surely she has enough faction to do the quest.  She handed in the tear so that I could MQ it with her.  Rak ate the tear (no agro).  I hadn't even touched Rak at this point.  But if you must know, I have done all parts of the quest except for looting a tear.  I conned Rak, and I'm ally.  We petitioned, and of course there weren't any GMs on.  A level 50 guide said she would tell the GM so that the other shaman could look into the possibilty of getting her tear back.  Anyone else MQ'd this portion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually MQed it for a shaman on my server that looted a tear, turned it in, got the faction hit, killed Rak, but his raid got wiped out before he got a chance to loot the scale.<br />
<br />
I was an epic shaman and he had turned in the tear previously and received the required faction hit, the MQ worked just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You going to avoid Fear when your friends/guildmates need oil from the Broken Golem or a Soul Leech for the SK epic or the Shissar for the enchie epic or the gloves for the necro epic or a pally friend needs to go to Fear for the paladin epic?<br />
<br />
I'm just always surprised when people play the game solely about themselves when a collaborative effort would accomplish so much more.</div></div><hr />
