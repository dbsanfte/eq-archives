<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The first level of Grieg's End off of Dawnshroud Peaks has been empty each time I've been there with a group of friends (or near group, because we occasionally have a slot open). We don't really have a typical group makeup because we often think that nearly any group is a good group.<br />
<br />
Casting Malosi and Turgur's Insects combo rarely works in Grieg's in my experience. That is, neither has a good chance of landing at all and I'm likely to find myself OOM for trying. But the disease slow, Plague of Insects, seems to land a good 90-95% of the time without trouble (and is a darn sight faster to cast). In the latest run we made, we actually had two shaman players on the run and we commiserated on the lack of success on landing either of these line of spells. In the end, I stuck to the disease slow route and he nuked because that seemed to be the only thing that worked.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Is this everyone's experience or just that I'm at a point where my spells are starting to be insufficient for where the group is hunting? (No info here at EQshaman or in Alla's that I could find and I'm tending to say this is normal because I can slow just fine in other, sometimes more difficult, locations.) Am I not considering something here?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Is this normally such an underutilized zone? It seemed pretty straightforward for a walled zone. And with the right group, it seemed like running through the maze of hallways was just a matter of knowing which side of the room or door a mob would be standing on and where the traps were. It lacked a certain...I don't know...randomness that happens in other zones. Maybe it's because of the low agro radius of some of the mobs. I'm hesitant to even mention the zone because of how blessedly empty is has been when we've been there, but my lack of success with the &quot;Patented Shammy Two-shot Combo&quot; (TM) makes me want to find out the answers more.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

I was in Grieg's saturday slowing with just Turgur's and rarely got a resist at 65.  GE has an xp bonus so it's a decent zone to level in.  Loot is on the weak side unless you can drop the Servitor of Luclin and a couple other named.<br />
<br />
Oh and sadly, beer goggles no longer drop.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye its all about your level there. <br />
<br />
I was there a few days ago to farm the named for alts with a few friends.  I didnt cast malo once and had only 1 Turgurs resist for the 2 hours we spent there.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you were making the best of a bad situation by using your disease slow.  Some people wouldnt have thought if it and just plowed ahead with resists on Turgurs.  It does get better there..just keep at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info! For the historical record, in case anyone ends up looking up threads about this zone later ... at the time of this writing, my toon is level 55 with pretty good gear, a horse, and KEI running.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to add my 2 cents to the Grieg's discussion. I absolutely love this zone. I do not get quite the resists on my slow that you state but it seems to run in spurts.....would have 3 or 4 mobs in a row that resisted alot and then almost no resists for quite a while. The names are fun too.....don't know about anyone else but had a group of three in the courtyard area and the names always appeared as something different to each of us in the group.....just something interesting) Also, I think the exp in the zone was very good. Overall, probably one of the best Luclin zones I have been to.<br />

&quot;Madness takes it toll......Have exact change ready&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ah the joys of ZEMs and patches. We peeked in at Grieg's post patch there were 50+ people in the zone. Looks like we'll be looking for another place to hang out for a while. It was good while it lasted though. Thanks for the help, folks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssseven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm it is probably your level. I went there last week for 3 hours never got resisted but I am level 58. I also got 60% xp there and 500pp for the loot.</div></div><hr />
