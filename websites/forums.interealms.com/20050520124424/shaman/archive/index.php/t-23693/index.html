<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so, how many of our aa should be removed? and why wasnt something else added?<br />
<br />
and for those cant be bother to click<br />
<br />
&quot;To clarify...<br />
<br />
During tuning, we took a look at how Sleight of Hand fit into the bigger picture of the expansion and the overall reduction in aggro that would be possible with current items and new ones being introduced with Omens. The end result was that in order to be balanced within the big picture, Sleight of Hand would have to be an insignificant amount of aggro reduction. Passive aggro reduction abilities have always been problematic since it's hard to see a concrete effect except when the overall reduction is large. The extremely minor reduction that Sleight of Hand would have offered would have been unnoticeable to most players. Instead of releasing an AA with no appreciable effect, I chose to cut it from the list.<br />

the original post, before the more sensible one from &quot;Ashere -- EQ Designers&quot; was:<br />
<br />
This AA was removed because there are already numerous posts that Casting Subtlety does nothing even though it does decrease generated aggro.  It was felt that this AA would have generated even more people stating that it does nothing and the small gains were not worth the problems created. <br />

LMAO. Superb reply.<br />
<br />
On a slightly serious note, can any of you wise and sage shamans let me know what you think about SCS3?<br />
<br />
I started doing the SCS line, but stopped after SCS1 when i found that more and more i need to get agro to move the mob away from the druid/monk/whoever for rooting, especially when the melee classes in the group aren't good at understanding &quot;mob roooted -- MOVE&quot; or when VP3 won't stick due to very high DR mobs even after MD.<br />
<br />
On the other hand getting summoned is getting tiring.<br />
<br />
Would like your thoughts, SCS3 -- Yes or No :)</div></div><hr />

scs3 doesnt help shaman so much due to the fact it doesnt work with dots, however must the nuker types and enc loved it as far as i can tell, so how they got that impression i not sure.<br />
<br />
what shaman need is a jolt type aa, or something that great reduces our agro when we get sumoned.</div></div><hr />

I reached the exact same conclusion: I KNOW how to manage my aggro under normal game circumstances. Adding in a randomly arbitrary reduction in aggro just means that I can no longer manage it effectively, and there are many times when I WANT to gain aggro. So I chose to not buy SCS.<br />
<br />
Same is true for the DoT critical line of AAs: I KNOW how to plan for the aggro I gain from DoTs. Adding in a randomly arbitrary amount of extra aggro from possible critical DoTs means I can no longer manage aggro effectively. So I chose to not buy any Critical DoT AAs.<br />

i believe they admited that crit dots were not meant to add agro (least 2X agro like they doing now) , but how long will it take them to fix.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually the information about crit dots came from parsing.  All SoE has ever said that I have seen is that we're all crazy and there's no extra aggro from dot ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SCS may or may not be worth it depending on your play style.  Solo a lot?  No point at all.<br />
<br />
It reduces agro on spells that land instantly.  That includes slow and nukes.  Those items will do noticeably less agro at scs3.<br />
<br />
It doesn't do squat for DoT agro, nor does it appreciably help with poison counter agro.  Critical dots, if you have 2 runnning, are very very likely to get you summoned.<br />
<br />
If you DoT a lot, don't bother.  If you don't DoT that much, and want to lessen agro, scs3 is pretty effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Followings SOEs logic and i use the term loosely i can think of like half a dozen AAs, that should never have been released.<br />

Good way to avoid a problem: delete the feature causing it  :rolleyes: .<br />

<br />
Haha, there was exactly zero posts stating such nonsense - atleast serious ones. I need a BS emoticon right here.<br />
<br />
And if some people would bother and actually READ said posts, most are covering certain aspects of the AA like aggro from DOT ticks or poison counters - not the whole AA in itself.<br />
<br />
Admittedly Rashere's post to clear that up is a bit better, but still very vague for my taste.</div></div><hr />
