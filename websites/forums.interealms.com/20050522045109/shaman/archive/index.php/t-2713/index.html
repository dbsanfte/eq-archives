<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...to these boards???<br />
<br />
I visited these boards regularly when I was playing a year ago and what I saw was a lot of Shamans trying to help other Shamans. Now I see a lot of Shamans flaming and insulting other Shamans.<br />
<br />
During my year's absence I played Dark Age of Camelot and was a regular reader to the VNBoards for Camelot info. I grew to hate those boards for their flames and general pessimistic outlook.<br />
<br />
Lets try and be constructive in our posts and remember that it is real people we are dealing with who all share a love of the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You must have not seen Eduins posts back then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seredith, give me a break. Eduin, despite his lack of tact, was posting SOLELY to help other Shamans. From what I can tell, these boards have turned from an informative aid to the game to a bitchfest for all leves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What am I missing here?<br />
<br />
I think these boards are great on their own but when compared to most other boards they are off the scale great!<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just naive?!  Maybe I'm just partial?!<br />
<br />
What examples do you have of these flames?<br />
<br />
Geoid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nah, theres still plenty of helpful posts/threads I think.  <br />
<br />
Now certain topics are nearly guaranteed to generate flames here though....<br />
<br />
-Balance petitions<br />
-Gripes about shaman being underpowered<br />
-Spell drop complaints depending on how they're worded and/or how the responses are worded<br />
<br />
The one thing agreed upon about shaman balancing is that we can't seem to agree on anything in that respect! :p<br />
<br />
Threads about how shaman are so underpowered almost always look at one particular aspect of ClassX and then use that as a comparison, ignoring the many other ways in which a shaman may be superior to ClassX.  Hence, that gets pointed out, and often times in a not very diplomatic fashion.  Flames build from there. :o<br />
<br />
Spell drops are generally considered a pain in the ass, but there's also a decent contingent of shaman that think since our highest level spells make us nearly godlike in ability, they SHOULD be very rare and difficult to attain.  Hence, the haves and have nots tend to disagree on this one rather passionately. ;)<br />
<br />
Other than those topics, I don't see much flaming here.  The biggest thing is that there isn't much NEW to talk about.  Hence, there's not much for the older, wiser shaman in the community to really discuss to help each other out.  The old ac/hp vs. wisdom debates, or what should I wear at this level discussions have been done so many times that you can't really blame people for ignoring those threads, since a simple search would yield the answers to the posters questions most times anyway.  <br />
<br />
And Eduin may have been trying to help other shaman, but he was very abrasive/rude anytime someone disagreed with him.  Flames and random insults on the intelligence level of those that disagreed or questioned his ideas were far too common, IMHO.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A similar discussion took place in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1176)<br />
<br />
Couple comments from that thread (that I happen to agree with.)<br />
<br />
Targar:  I have been on this board for almost 3 years. Back in the old days this board was great. We talked about strategy. We talked about quests. We worked through the alchemy formulas etc we talked about all the happenings with the shaman class in general b/c everyone was growing and finding new things etc. I will call those the &quot;glory&quot; days of this board. <br />
<br />
Bigguss (hehe- what a great name!):  I think the problem isn't too many equipment threads, but not enough &quot;high quality&quot; content threads. As the game matures, more and more of the content has been figured out. There's not really a need to figure out alchemy, or the quest for our epic, or how to do any but end-game dungeons... they've all been figured out by now. (That we don't have a library where we keep all of this knowledge is annoying, but the subject for another thread...) <br />
<br />
Even on the tactics and strategy side, most of the battles have already been waged. What's left? For end-gamers, there are still topics to cover- but not as many as before. For newcomers, there's the same old stuff (starting race/stats, equipment concerns, etc.) That's what you see on the board now- posts from end-gamers asking end-game questions, and &quot;newb&quot; posts covering material that's already been covered many times before. <br />
<br />
The problem is that the &quot;Glory days&quot;- lots of new content, things to learn and explore- is largely gone now. The game, and this board, have moved into a new phase. <br />
<br />
Boinshar:  The problem is that there's only a finite number of things to discuss. Back in the old days many of our discussion were about equipment as well, the only difference is that back then it was new, there were different items to get without having to spend a lot of effort. There are less topics compared to back then only because of most of the topics we once enjoyed have been beaten to death by now. <br />
<br />
Group tactics, solo tactics, how to get your epic broken down into each step, strategy for breaking planes, dealing with slowing, etc have all been done numerous times. There simply isn't much to discuss anymore, since the only real mistries are some of the high end mobs, and people don't openly discuss them for a variety of reasons. <br />
<br />
There you have it, the game's getting old, there are very little things of wonder left to talk about. The number equipment threads have not gone up over the years, the number of other discussions have gone down.<br />
<br />
BlargX: Most of the best advice ever put on this board is long since gone. It tends to vanish over time. Searching through pages isn't going to get you much. <br />
<br />
People are going to post here because that's where stuff gets read. Period. I never check the other &quot;mini-forums&quot; here, and I'm probably joined by the vast majority in that. For the most part, I don't care. I've been 60 for a while and I already know where to hunt, and I know what the spells are, etc. When skipping forums about that, however, I also skip the opportunity to reply to anyone asking about those things in that kind of forum. Which is fine by me. <br />
<br />
But actually, I might be tempted to help -- and sometimes am -- when I see a thread here in the main forum. If people need info, their best chance of getting it is in the main forum, so that's where they'll continue to post. <br />
<br />
As to there being too little new here to read for the old-timers, that is indeed because the game has been around so long. What else is there to say? Mostly the good stuff is what people wouldn't want to give away anyway -- how to make a certain camp much simpler, where to send your twinks, how to complete a certain uber quest with mobs someone else might want to camp or fight you or your friends for for if you spilled the beans. Most of the stuff there is to say either has already been said or people are unwilling to share, so...the boards are actually not as much a place for the old-timers anymore, at least not to the extent they once were. <br />
<br />
They really are for the guys now asking all the questions others think are dumb or must probably be intelligently answered somewhere, who knows where but don't bother me about it. <br />
<br />
We were all newbies to the class once, though, if not to the whole game even, and the class and the game were damnably full of puzzles that were very hard or extremely time-consuming to figure out, and we've all probably come across many times where some tidbit of knowledge has been immensely helpful. <br />
<br />
So when the old-timers get too blase to help or even are tired merely of seeing the same old thing, they should remember that they don't own the boards, and what's trivial to them might be vital to someone else. <br />
<br />
Most importantly, it's new blood that keeps this or any game going. I've played a lot of online games, and sooner or later old-timers tend to get sick of newbie questions and sometimes even start to flame and intimidate newbies. That's cutting off your nose to spite your face, though. If this game relied only on the crusty old farts to keep it going, it would start to sputter and die a very premature death. We actually need the newbies more than they need us, if the game is to continue. <br />
<br />
So if their threads seem tedious or duplicative or a waste of time, skip them. They have at least as good a chance as us to keep the shaman community and the whole game active and alive. They may even be here long after we're gone.<br />
-------------------------<br />
Also, I think the board wipe was a contributing factor.  A lot of great content was lost- where before you could say &quot;Go have a look at this thread for a detailed answer to your question&quot; - now the main board residents are mostly end-gamers, and no one wants to write the ultimate guide to {something useful to a level 20}... it existed before because the predominant level of the board used to be level 20- but now the tone is different.<br />
<br />
I personally have been in favor of a true shaman FAQ (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1922), but I haven't had time recently to continue to add content- and frankly interest didn't seem that high (both in posts and in views.)<br />
<br />
I agree, the board isn't what it once was... but I think this is because the game isn't what it once was.  That said, I still think the board (and the game!) are pretty good.  Generally, you ask a question and you get an answer.  Sure, you'll get your &quot;Use the serach function, n00b !!&quot; replies... but you'll also usually get a good answer.  <br />
<br />
Happy hunting<br />
<br />
P.S.  Eduin rocked.  Stusser, too.  Even if you didn't agree with them, they were hilarious to read.  We need a few more characters around here.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Callir, I never said he didnt help people, I was referring to the 'flaming and insulting' part of the original post - he was very capable of doing all three at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Compounding the problem with lack of new stuff to talk about is that the 'new stuff' there is to talk about is kept hush-hush for the most part until it's already become common knowledge through the grapevine.<br />
<br />
There are a LOT more high level guilds out there now, and a thus more competition for the newest baddest mobs.  It's no surprise that strats on the latest and greatest phat lewts mobs aren't shared for some time, since nobody wants to hand their competition a walk-through. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yer right, there's very little for me to talk about lately. <br />
I'm just posting out of habit or something.<br />
But that's the game's fault not mine.<br />
Shamans haven't been changed or upgraded since Kunark and we're getting stale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just started reading this board 2 months ago.  I am 51 and just never spent much time reading boards, as I have a life that is quite demanding at times, and I prefered to play the game when I had free time.<br />
<br />
This board is still very useful for those of us who haven't been everywhere, done everything.  I have even pulled up all the ac/hp vs. wis gear threads to pound over my monk husbands head so that he actually believes me that no I don't want to change out my 'warrior' 15 ac shoulders for a more suitable wis gear low ac item until I have more AC (mine is lacking).  <br />
<br />
I can tell you that I die less because of you, and thanks.<br />
<br />
I guess that the 60+ people feel that the board is stale because you all already know most of what is posted, and what you don't know won't be discussed until enough people figure it out themselves, but this is not the case for all of us.  I still consider myself a noob shammie, and I learn lots from all of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This board is extremely warm and civilizied compared to many of the other boards.  Go check out the necro or PvP boards if you wanna see flaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So far this board is a breath of civilization among all the cruddy boards out there. No doode speak and just about all the posts are intelligent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gotta agree.  Although I'm very fervent in the HP/AC vs. Wis arguement, I see most everyone being rather supportive/giving input.  It's ok to disagree (heck I do that a LOT) as long as  you keep it in perspective.<br />
<br />
And some topics (balancing, Poxporlo drops, etc...) are generally bad feeling posts as it is so there is no surprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mez one of da bad people  /sigh.<br />

People don't like that much but how can joo sit and just watch people give others bad advice.<br />

Lots of times it just ends up with people using some rather creative discriptions instead of my name.<br />

I agree wid Setantha....  Mez also go and do DaOC for a while and when I came back this boad was / is a lot less friendly then it was at one time.<br />

Brodur Scrug is another guud example of someone who stays above the fray.  I have yet to ever see him post anything but guud honest advice.  He is wrong more often the Gloriana /duck but he does not have a mean or vindictive bone in dat ugly green swamp slimed body.<br />

Most of the people on dis board are still very nice...  most of dem give very guud advice 95% of da time.  Some of ous are just too stupid to leave the other 5% alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, was in The Hole the other night, had ODS on for mana pres III,  regrowth, Clarity 2 and Ikky BP and gave an example to my group of my mana regen.   &quot;Main target slowed, 80 mana.

Is it true that he might have been trying to make a helpfull point about something that he felt was the correct thing about shaman? Perhaps. Does that excuse the childish ranting and general jackass behavior that he exhibited, with him tearing others down in the community? No, not in my book it doesn't. We had a similar situation with a person from my guild a little while back that was trying to make a point about the idiocy of Greater Remove Curse dropping from only Rhag Zhezum in ssra. That was a valid point. In the process of making that point, however, he proceeded to call the rest of everyone on the server quote &quot; all the gimp ass guilds&quot; and &quot; ass pummeling fags&quot;. Sure the base message and point might have still been there, but adding in all the hostile negativitiy really didn't help anyone, and damaged not only those that may have been upset by his ranting, but also severely damaged any credibility he might have had on the issue. It turned into one big flame fest from there until it finally got rickshawed. Anyhow, just saying that being inflammatory and tearing down as many other members of the community as you can does not help promote a good community like we seem to remember from way back when. If ya have a point to make, make your point. Don't cloak it in a bunch of hostility and static cause it makes your point much harder to find and agree with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ass Pummeling Fag... gotta at least give him points for being creative.. (the ass pummeling part.. the fag part is old, overdone and honestly a pisspoor flame in a world that lets you be what you want to be)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I still recommend this site for non-shamans to read.  There's always a topic that springs up that covers a subject that other sites might not, or at least,  comes from a shaman perspective; such as the recent fizzling rate topic.   <br />
<br />
So venting and bitching exists here.  Sometimes that could be a good thing.  We're a community of the same class, and spitting out your frustrations or ideas to those outside of your guild and server, can be a relief.  I'll agree though, that things do get out of hand.<br />
<br />
I read the boards everyday, but obviously don't post everyday.  I even have been registered to this site longer that what is shown, but had to re-register due to some reason (I either was stupid forgetting password and restarted, or site changed, or some blah thing).    Perhaps, I should post more on my experiences to help others out, but a lot of times, things are already covered.  If I post something that repeats what others have said, it's because I sternly agree or disagree, or stand by my beliefs and want it said.</div></div><hr />
