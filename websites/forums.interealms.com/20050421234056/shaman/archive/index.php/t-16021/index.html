<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To be honest, expect to die. Gargoyles are pretty tough, and you will have problems single pulling them at that level. We recently wiped after killing several of them because we picked up 2 on the pull, and then a third came by. We had a full group of 60's.<br />
<br />
If you can single pull you should be ok, but be on a constant lookout for wanderers.<br />
<br />
Good luck, it is a great camp if you like excitement.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep.  Never camped those, but some nimrod druid trained a couple by me and my mage partner one night.  Mage died instantly.  One round of attacks, he just fell over like a sack of bricks.  Being a shaman, you'll have a handful more hps and might live, should one get hold of you.  I guess the best advice is to have a really healthy appreciation for how fast those little buggers hit.<br />

Oh, and good luck getting the camp.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey there, don't despair, you will get to the gargoyles eventually. In the mean time just try poj to get the hang of the mobs in the planes. Try camping the zone out and pulling prisoners to begin with. When you get a handle on the way they act, and hit, etc. you can move down to the basement. The enforcers give good xp and the opportunity for diamonds/parchments.<br />
<br />
I would suggest trying POJ before PON, and work your way up as you find your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info. POJ is where ill give it a go. Time to do some homework and figure the area out. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bah dont tell him not even to try.  Necros can FD pull so he should be able to get singles.  As far as aggro kiting, thats when they snare a mob and keep hitting it with decent aggro spells as fear doesnt work.  When Duo-ing with an SK friend who aggro-kited in PoS, I would make an alpha-pet turn taunt off and sick him on the mob.  Then throw dots appropriately.  Was sorta boring but decent Exp.  Gotta be willing to try new things, even if it involves getting killed sometimes.</div></div><hr />

did your momma do drugs during pregnancy? poj is nothing like other planar mobs. at 55 i could solo poj exit without any trouble at all... try that on ANY other pop plane and watch what happens to ya. only places it might be possibly at all are rats/goos in pod and yard trash in poi.</div></div><hr />

Volotani, you are rude, obnoxious, and disrespectful. There is nothing wrong with using the mobs at the POJ exit to get some pop trash experience. You said you could handle the mobs at 55 easily, congratulations on your achievements. The original poster is 53 without any planes experience. It can be daunting at that level. At 53 he might find them a challenge. Also, I wasn't claiming that if he took on 2 exit mobs in PoJ he could head to PoN and start pulling doubles. I was merely pointing out that the mobs in the planes do hit harder than other places and these were the easiest, and would thus give an easier learning curve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try that on ANY&quot;.... &quot;The only other places it might be possibly [nice spelling] at all are rats/goos in pod and yard trash in poi&quot; - Last time I checked they were both planes mobs. Nice work refuting a statement as impossible and then giving two examples of where it is possible.<br />
<br />
Your comments regarding my mother and drugs are irresponsible and peurile. Couple that comment with the rest of your trolling post and you are quite possibly one of the most stupid lurkers to give the boards a shot. Do us, and yourself, a favor and go back to lurking.  Or even better, just go away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">agreed, my post was rude, especially the comment about your parentage.<br />
my point was that, at 53 for a sham, poj stuff near exit shouldnt be much trouble except for sralm (sp?) and the high risk of adds from the hallway.<br />
however, preparation for planar stuff is best taken in groups; starting out soloing pop zones usually ends up in needless exp loss or trains (might just be cuz of poor gear or w/e).<br />
at 53 best bet would probably be consistent pod groups. anywhere in the zone would likely be fast exp at this level, and if you managed to grab a bonewall group you could probably get a nice chunk of exp in an hour or so.<br />
<br />
if you still decide to go soloing in poj area, just remember to keep a slow on and start rooting like crazy at about 20-25%. running mobs can bring a lot of friends, especially when there are 3-4 rats and a few sentries around at once.<br />
<br />
and yes, if you're going to start soloing anywhere on pop planes, poj exit is by far the best.</div></div><hr />

I don't really recommend any shaman pre-65 soloing in the planes for xp. Plane soloing is really more about testing ones abilities than grinding xp. If you really want xp in a solo capacity haul over to LoY. In Nadox many mobs are still dark blue to a 65 and they are easy to handle in 3's. Xp is much better there but still slow compared to grouping.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The reason I don't recommend planes soloing is because I didn't find any solo's that were worth the effort up in the planes. That doesn't mean that they do not exist. I was comfortably doing the enforcers solo at 61 but they come in pairs and take some focus. I took a couple of rats in disease as well but didn't like the constant threat of adds. If anyone knows of good places feel free to correct me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

doncha miss the days when protectors in pog were still down and you could farm gems there and STILL make some exp? i cant believe they reactivated those stupid things...<br />
<br />
if anybody knows a good place to solo in the high 50's NOT on loy, post it. i need exp bad, torpor and malo are wasted sitting in my bank</div></div><hr />

I just went to PoN last night and duo'd with a mage. We were both 57, she used earth pet, it was virtue'd and it tanked. XP was great, just doing the yard trash (ravens, trees, spiders), I made the last 3/4th of a yellow of 57, and half a yellow into 58 in only about an hour or so.<br />
<br />
You probably could solo here at this level, might be a little tougher, they hit pretty hard even slowed.</div></div><hr />

Gargs in PoN are good experience and as long as your Necro friend knows how to aggro kite you should do well. It's been my exp that the Gargs have a very large assist range,but it you are pulling them off the spires they can normally be pulled singly. While the Necro is kiting the mob he/she just needs to be sure to not kite to closely to the wall you pulled the garg from in the first place....or you WILL get adds. Be sure to keep your Necro sowed...if one of those Gargs gets ahold of the Necro he will go down FAST. The Gargs are certainly doable with your 56 Necro and yourself.<br />

sure. Started soloing in PoD last night trying out a pretty decent spawn of rats just NW from the zone.  Technique was to pull to the wall just NW from the zone in from PoT. The pull-to spot is really close to where that ogre NPC paths to when he walks toward the wall. Cash isnt bad, but is dependant on how much rat junk drops. Net exp is better than the boats in dulaks. I pulled about the same exp as I have done in the past on the boats in my 1 hour camp time there, and i probably didnt pull for about 20 min of that hour. Had kei and alfalfa.<br />
<br />
Need to perfect my process on it though as I'll finish the fights around 50m. Been part root rotting, part dog tanking, mixing it up. Man I cant was for DD'less dots!<br />
<br />
boats net me about 2-3 percent per clearing of the boat (approx 3 clearings before rebuffing) and netted 7 percent while i was in PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you can handle a single bird or Tree there is a place in the North East corner of PoN that has four static bird spawns (find these resist less then other mobs) and couple static tree spawns.  What makes this place nice is right between all these mobs is a very large area free from roamers.  The place in question sits between the River (Near where the Hobgoblins are to the far North) and the Platue.  The static birds can be easly pulled single with slow.  With the large open area there is plenty of room to run back to the wall and then cast mala???? to lower resists even more.  Then you can layon the dots then after wards root and back pet off till time to reapply the dots.  The area is attually large enough for you to use fear kiting as well.  This works Idealy for a necro shaman duo.</div></div><hr />
