<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, got a quick question for you all.  I have always used the lowest level root but lately I have been wondering, is it worth using the higher level roots over the lower level ones as you progress?<br />
<br />
Lately, my root has seemed to be sticking for a shorter duration, I don't know, I might just be crazy.<br />
<br />
Well, thanks for your time:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">use the level 14 root until you get to 61- then its greater immobilize fo' life.<br />
<br />
Only time I used regular immobilize is when I was in a dungeon and I flat out HAD to have the quicker casting time. <br />
<br />
para. earth is worthless for its high mana cost and unreliability, unless you are using it to park greenies for extended periods of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, for a &quot;3 min root&quot; Paralyzing Earth seems to break more often than not in the first 3-5 seconds, before I can even Slow, DoT or Nuke. So I'm sure I'm not causing it to break, it just does. Can't wait for Greater Immobilize, I have it in the bank awaiting level 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use root simply for low mana cost... <br />
<br />
Not often that you wait for full duration, and if ya do, it usually doesn't last. Esspecially if soloing, our DoTs are root-killers.<br />
<br />
just my logic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">greater immobilize &gt;*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">regular lvl 14 root until POP for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Petrifying Earth(lvl 64) is god like though. Love that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is petrifying earth that good?  I have it, but havent used it yet.  I am using greater imobilize to deal with adds (chanter? oh, those guys soloing in tier 3!) in groups.<br />
<br />
When would you use PE over GI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think the reason i don't like using PE as much as GI is the casting times.  petrify = 3.0,  Gimmobilize = 2.0 (if i remember right =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PE takes roughly an extra second to cast(Greater Immobilize is a 1.8 sec cast time so it has its place in certain situations). However, PE just lasts so much damn longer. I don't have any of my PoP dots yet, so when I solo in Tier2 zones I'm using dots with a DD component. Its not uncommon that I can stick 2-3 dots (not counting epic of course) on a mob before PE actually breaks. With GI it will break almost every time.<br />
<br />
PE is a very superior root.</div></div><hr />
