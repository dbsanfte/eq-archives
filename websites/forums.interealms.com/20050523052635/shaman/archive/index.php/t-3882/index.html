<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the Shamans role in a group at these levels? I see very few spells that would be usefull to a group. Sow, slow and healing at lvl 19. The stat buffs seems to be of little use. What am I missing, and what is the role of a Shaman in a group?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kuminns7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basically before your slows start becoming worthwhile to cast, you will mainly heal and cast buffs on those that ask for them.  Even though the buffs arent powerful enough to make a real difference at those levels, if it makes the tanks feel better to have 15 more str, then let them have the 15 str.  Good luck getting through the early 20s, I remember how tough it was :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, basically you're a healer at those levels.  Your melee output is not that bad - probably more than half of a warrior's - so you might as well do some of that, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say your role at these levels are Buffing and you can heal in a pinch but Shaman heals are pretty pathetic until 29. Cleric would be much better for healing at these levels. Why not melee a bit too ? I was slowing too, but now that I look back I'm not sure it made much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shamans have the same heals spell as a cleric from 19-23, missing out (now) only on the cleric's 5% bonus. Before 19 a shaman's heals are weak, but that's generally still your role in a group. It's frustrating being a shaman healer before 19, but that's usually the role you're stuck in. From 19-23 it's something you're good at. Enjoy being a healer while you can do it well, that won't last forever. ;)<br />
