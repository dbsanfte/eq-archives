<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya. I was talking to someone ingame a couple days ago, and they mentioned that the ranger epic was recently made level 50 minimum for the final turnin. Was the shaman epic changed as well, or is this still doable pre-50? Anyone confirm either way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Indrii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A fellow guildie shaman did all steps but the last one between 41-46, and the last one at 48.  He was successful, but he said the spear didn't right click until you hit 50.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know that the quest was doable pre-50 at least until a couple weeks ago. Has anyone seen a sub-50 do it very recently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm curious about this as well.<br />
<br />
I can't think of any level based quests in game.<br />
There are currently only level based things I can think with the ability to steop quests:<br />
<br />
Level to Enter zones ( planer zones )<br />
Level to *Hail* an NPC<br />
<br />
The Hail method is used on the Chardom quest to prevent people from getting the first ring until lvl 51 ( course, you can MQ the second one providing faction ).<br />
Zone limits are used in the Monk Whistling Fists quest ( where the final turn-in is CT in PoF ).<br />
<br />
Monk's epic has an NPC that won't speak to you unless you're lvl 53. However; you can still turn in for the book for epic.<br />
In theory, you can get the monk epic at lvl 1 if you have a LOT of friends.<br />
<br />
I'm playing with this epic idea myself and trying to figure out my full game limitations in obtaining this.<br />
So far I see Level requirements to enter PoF and Faction requirements for turn-ins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Barring a level requirement by the final spirit, the shaman epic could be done at level 1.  Its all faction based and unfortunately about 80% of it can be skipped completely with faction work.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />
