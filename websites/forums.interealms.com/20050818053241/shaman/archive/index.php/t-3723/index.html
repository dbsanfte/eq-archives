<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Camped this stupid thing forever, saw 12 Chief spawns not one DI.  Also i'd go 8-10 hours straight camping his tree and he wouldnt even show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes.....i lost roll on one last night(again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Verrant has redefined 'rare drop' in Maiden's Eye. I've been after a particular MoB there for almost two months now and have yet to see him spawn once--although I have confirmation that he does indeed still pop.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to hate that zone :p</div></div><hr />

:D I already did hate that zone ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Verant went from making rares pop every other spawn there and dropping rare 1 in 3, to poping once in 50 pops and dropping rare 1 out of 20...its insane.  They should make the rares pop more (of course not as much as the first few weeks) and make em drop the rare more.  BTW, the uber ranger sword doesnt drop anymore though hehe.  Also, Kryss, after the Thought Stealer?  I need him too :( 20 ac earring /drool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I've been camping the Xi Thall in the Lakehouse for this:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics17/grodans_flowing_cape.jpg<br />
<br />
35ac and FT2 I can't pass up ... I have a 35ac 15hp 6wis/int back slot item I'm keeping as a shield because my current back slot has 5 wis, 50mana and 75hps ... and if I ever replaced it with anything it better be damned useful, like Flowing Thought ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah, well I have never even heard of that hehe, but if it was only shaman usable I would go sit in there and camp it for weeks.  I really could use the mana regen \ AC boost (mines dipping low now with all my HP items).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I probably say this too much but ... o get yourself that 30ac statless earring out of the Netherbian (Tawro's) caves in Umbral Plains, drops off Festersore in the second junction room. Just keep killing netherbian until he pops. Level 55 necro who gates to his pop (fight him on it ;) and was a pushover for the item he dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">.I've been thinking about that, seems like a good alternative to 20 ac earring from ME or farming 4c in CT for that 70 hp 10 sta + mana one...last one that dropped went to a rogue who has 2 of the 75hp ones and sold it for 100k the next day :( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ME = OT with loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Killed the chief 7 times now, no DI. I talked to another shaman who does the chief spawn, hes killed him 9 times no DI. We have both been hunting him for 2 months now. Still, I killed a thought stealer and got slighted gloves 15ac 20wis gloves, then killed a few 4 arms to get a stone idol 5ac 8int 8wis 15svm so I'm pretty happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">where do the thought stealers pop?  err...where its safe to pull/kill?<br />
<br />
everytime i find the darn things its right after invis drops and i'm training around mobs like a drood hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thought Stealers are a random 6hrish spawn with a mind burrower as a PH. The PH is the wandering mind burrower not the trap triggered one. I used my monk to pull it then FD /q. The only way you can pull it solo is with insane luck or root it at zone and hope no KS before you rezone. They are pussies when slowed max hit was less than 200 for a level 60 mob, I don't even have malo. They can drop the 15ac 15str 20wis gloves, the 20ac ton of stats ear or the crap ring.</div></div><hr />
