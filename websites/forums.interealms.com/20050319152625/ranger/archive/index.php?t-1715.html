More proof that the entire &quot;licensing&quot; scheme is incredibly out of wack.</div></div><hr />

Please explain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do believe that the license agreements for most software says that the software manufacturer has some reasonable recourse to determine if unauthorized copies are being used.<br />
<br />
I know the company I worked for a few years ago underwent forced software audits on two occasions. The auditors showed up with a warrant and federal marshals and went through every computer in the building cataloging software.<br />
<br />
Both times they were looking for something speicific, which they did not find.</div></div><hr />

It's crap like this that gets MS sued by the attorneys general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimirr</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the part I am confused about.  From the article:<br />
<br />
The school districts are considered guilty of software piracy until they can prove they're in licensing compliance<br />
<br />
Um... what?  Isn't this the opposite of the way things work in the U.S.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Replace all MS using computers with Linux then tell the MS guys to come in and audit (they will have to pay for it unless they can find pirated MS software but since its all Linux they won't find anything).<br />
<br />
Then tell them to take their licensing scheme and shove it up their ass and that these school districts will NEVER use MS in the future nor purchase ANY MS product again.<br />
<br />
Quick way to shove this MS BS back in their face AND to top it all off they just lost a potentially large market they could've sold to.</div></div><hr />

I mean really, if you want to target someone, why target the schools?  /sigh  You know, most of the people I know who work for Microsoft are ashamed to say so when stuff like this is going on.  :(</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately in the United States when you get outside the normal court system (and software &quot;piracy&quot; comes under these non-standard judicial systems), there is a great deal of precedent for this. The IRS considers you guilty until you prove your innocence and even have separate tax courts that operate under this assumption. The EPA considers you guilty until you prove your innocence.<br />
<br />
This is a by-product of the &quot;regulate everything&quot; mindset that deems that the average person is too stupid to live and monitor their own life.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is how things are. Is it constitutional? Personally I would say no but then I tend to be a government minimalist. ( &quot;That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves.&quot;  - Thomas Jefferson) The current Supreme Court would probably rule it constitutional though, for what that is worth.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, the United States is undergoing the transition from Republic to Empire. It's happening slowly but it is happening all around us and the movement is inexorably towards empire, and all the associated trappings of empire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with this is<br />
a) It's a lot of work for a cash-strapped school system to change all the computers over to Linux.<br />
b) This would deprive all those kids from working on the number one business platform, which could be considered a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
It would feel good but it ain't practical, which MS knows.  Definately not the smartest move by MS.  What gets me is that by all accounts MS makes more money than it knows what to do with.  It just ends up salting away much of it's assets because there are only so many ways to spend it.</div></div><hr />

I believe Kullaas to be the son of Bill Gates, and his hatred for microsoft really is stemmed from a hatred of his father. The genetics would explain the mathematical intelligence and computer knowledge...hmmm crazy enough to be true.</div></div><hr />
