<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I have always been a strong believer in leveling over AA's (I leveled to 65 on my monk before touching any of the PoP aa's), but now I am thinking it would be better to do AA's on my shaman instead of 61+ to 65 or 70.  I'd like to know if you agree - and what you think.<br />
<br />
Basically - I am thinking that I should at least pick up canibilization at 60 - before moving on.  I am thinking at 60 it will be easier to find good exp.  I am worried that at 65 or 70 experience will be harder to find.  Usually I'll play my shaman with my 65 monk, or alternatively with a low 50's pal and necro.<br />
<br />
I'd be curious to get your thoughts.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have torpor I'd pick up canni just to change pace for a little bit.  I think I hit 62 myself and then grinded up to canni and then went and hit 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would think about pushing on to 62 before taking a break to gain AA's. Level 60 is a short half level (it takes alot less exp than 59 or 61) which means your only looking at 1 1/2 more levels instead of 2. There are a fair number of very good spells in those 2 levels, new pet, regen, stam, focus, direct heal, and if you have DoN the first of the proc buffs spells. <br />
<br />
You may also want to add level 63 as well if plan on hunting in HoH or BoT. If your hunting elsewhere I don't think I would bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would atleast get 65 before AAing...you would have fo7 and be able to group in wos and rcod alot easier.<br />
<br />
of course Leveling sucks, its probably best to get as much of it over with as soon as possible.  if you usually get alot of good xp groups...get 69 or 70 first...2-3  days in rss and you'll have canni 5 and beyond</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aren't there a lot of these threads?  I'll summarize: Canni is worth a detour at 62, other than that 23aa, nothing else at all is better than level 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i personally plowed on to 65 then stopped for MGB/canni/VP1. now - i am back on my leveling tangent =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Level 61 gives you a new pet and the first DoN DPS spell, which are very good and easy to get.<br />
<br />
After that it gets a little murkier. Personally, I leveled straight to 65, but then I had all the important PoP spells in the bank by the time I was 60. Velium sold well at the time. If I hadn't had the spells, I suspect I would have stopped at 61 and made enough pp to buy them while getting AAXP. Quiescence is as game changing as CanniV IMHO.<br />
<br />
But heck, everybody approaches this issue differently :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Herger_Athach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get to 62 so you can get into BoT. Perhaps split your reg exp and AA 70/30. PoV is great too at that level, imo. The AAs will roll by frairly quickly, but the leveling is important. I wouldn't stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Forget Fo7, Q is what you want to get to 65 for.  The single version (FoSoul) is cluncky and mana intensive but will serve well.  I agree with Brohg that level 70 is king, but you can take a pause at 68 to AA a little as you collect runes if you want, a lot of people that I taked to do/did that are aren't/didn't regret it.<br />
<br />
EDIT... read below, GET TO 70!!1!!!eleven!11!!one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">People that stop at 68 used to break my heart.  Then I got over it.  Now I just send them 3-4 links an hour of rotting RSS loot until they wise up.</div></div><hr />

LMAO... haha ok point taken, yeah, get at least to 69.... nm 69 sucks to XP through, just get to 70 and level.  Aside from canni, not even MGB is worth stopping for... (Nemonic Retention(sp)..... maybe) get to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think if I had to do it all over again (gods forbid), I would only stop for Run5, Cani5 (+ prereq Metab3, MC3), and the extra spell gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldn't stop for anything. I'd go straight to 70 without passing go and collecting the 200p. Resist rates, melee mitigation and group desirability are the main reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">run4 &amp; 5 are *15* aa.  Not a ton later, but that's enough to earn a whole level as you go up.  No way run4/5 are worth an entire level.  CanniV, level 70.  No mgb, no spell gem, not Durability or Casting Mastery.  CanniV, level 70.  <br />

It's good to be king.<br />

Winners always want the ball.<br />
<br />
There is another.<br />
<br />
okay, I've lost the train of thought on my movie quotes.  CanniV, Level 70.  Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My opinion is that if I don't have the spells, there isn't much point in dinging. A level 70 shaman with no OOW spells is just a level 65 shaman with more hitpoints. That royally pisses folks off in my guild, but I don't see them helping me get spells, paying for my subscription or grouping with me to get me leveled up. As it is, I am back in the situation that if I had to app my guild over again, I wouldn't meet the minimum requirements.<br />
<br />
The bottom line of the matter is that some folks will tell you to level up or die lowbie scum! take that link you loser!, others will tell you to have some fun along the way. Only you can make that decision, after all, it is your money and your time. Not mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't make it a job. It ain't that serious. Only decesion you are going to be happy with is the one you make on your own. Take advice given, and there is a lot of good here, but don't make it a job. I stopped at 68 for the time being on my Necro, need about 50-60 more AA, and the way I have my % set I will ding 69 right around 100 AA from now. That suits me fine.</div></div><hr />
