<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friends on test tell me that the new class will wear cloth.<br />
They also tell me that they cant wear magic items.<br />
<br />
Anyone know if this could probably be true?<br />
I find the last statement a little odd... just about everything is magic. How would you kill a wisp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if that is true, Im sure SOE will forget that non magic weapons cant hit some creatures(with really no rhyme nor reason at to what can be hit and what cant by them). Thus leaving Berzerkers screwed at first. In a few weeks they will finally notice and belatedly claim that it is one of the intentional downsides of the class. Eventually some Berzerkers will get up to plane of hate/fear level, not be able to hit a single mob in the entire zones, and again the subject will arise, at which point Absor will go &quot;whoops, our bad&quot; and fix it finally.<br />
<br />
At least that is my take on it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless they have some innate abilities that allow them to hit creatures regardless of that restriction. There is no sense trying to second guess what SoE has planned for the class with regard to their abilities etc... right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They're not at work right now so I cant ask them, but I'm wondering where they got their information, seeing as how you cant create a berserker on test. As far as I know.. sony hasn't released much info on the class<br />
<br />
Im still trying to picture an ogre/troll in a robe......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monks recieve the innate ability to hit magical targets with their fists at level 30, so it would probably be something like that.  Its way too early to talk really even ponder at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My understanding is this is a leather class that will be highly dependant on the new endurance system coming out.<br />
<br />
Basicly i was told that its a leather wearing warrior type class comparable to a monk in DPS and setup.<br />
<br />
So think monk with no FD and able to use 1hs 2hs<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno, doesnt sound all that spectacular. Infact if i was a monk i might be a lil pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not saying that SOE would make sense but they should only be able to wear leather and hides. Berserker means Bear - Shirt. These warriors would run around in animal hides sceaming and acting like madmen to intimidate others. Hence the word berserk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will play one no matter how they turn out. Just to add a new challenge for me in the game, its kinda getting boring at the highend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's time for a silk wearing pure melee class. <br />
<br />
So i guess they will go with that combo, give them block and high defensive avoidance and offensive skill caps as well as knight or even warrior like HPs. Probably a large race. <br />
<br />
We shall see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's time for a silk wearing pure melee class. <br />
<br />
Yeah, they are called monks.  They have been around for a little bit...<br />
<br />
I've heard the 'no magic item use' rumor before.  When beastlords were being speculated on.  I seriously doubt that it would ever happen.  Even if SOE was dumb enough to try and implement it, they would quickly find out that 90% of dropped armor from Kunark and up is flagged as magic.  When they have to go back and add Bezerker drops to Velious mobs they will realize that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Interesting that monks are no leather class on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not saying that SOE would make sense but they should only be able to wear leather and hides. Berserker means Bear - Shirt. These warriors would run around in animal hides sceaming and acting like madmen to intimidate others. Hence the word berserk.<br />
<br />
Also has been interpreted as 'bare shirt' (bare sark).  So you could make an argument that they should be cloth only.  Which would make an interesting addition to the classes (instead of another leather melee ala' Monk and Beastlord).<br />
<br />
I suspect sony created the class abilities and restrictions first, and then looked around for something to call the new class (instead of the other way around). <br />
<br />
Surprised there hasn't been any mention about a berserker rage.  Under the current rules, it would probably some sort of /disc, but after the revamp who knows.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I've always considered Monks as a leather class.  Pretty sure their velious armor is leather, and I've seen plenty of DRU MNK BST armor, but no NEC ENC WIZ MAG MNK (not that a wizard and a monk would want to wear the same stuff).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">NEC ENC WIZ MAG MNK <br />
<br />
Plenty of robes follow this formula, as a matter of fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So far I haven't seen any description of this &quot;Berserker&quot; class that makes any sense at all, that would actually WORK as a class, that people would want to play for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I think Berserker I think Slaine from the 2000AD comics.<br />
<br />
He would go into rages' I forget what they were called now ...something spasm I think.<br />
<br />
The equipment he wore included a special harness which would 'manage' the spasm allowing him to control the spasm to a greater degree.<br />
<br />
He was a Celt warrior and as such had a strong affiliation with his gods, not sure if this fits with the general picture of a 'Berserker'<br />
<br />
Not sure what race I would use for this, Barbarian fits the 'theme' best by a long long long way but my Shaman is a Barb....hmm<br />
<br />
Nice idea, would be great to see some of the '2000AD' ideas come through to this class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Plenty of robes follow this formula, as a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
Regardless, monks are a leather class.  Their Velious, Luclin, and PoP armor is all leather.  End of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Historically, the Berzerker was pure offense and no defense, which is what made him such a fearsome opponent.  I'm envisioning a leather class which focuses on two handed weapons.  Damage output is likely to be high.  Perhaps the special melee skills will involve haste and some form of damage mitigation/increased dodge.<br />
<br />
This is just pure conjecture on my part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If they can't use magic items, then they aren't playing EQ.  Honestly what would they do with their time if not seek out the phattest of lewts?  EQ - gear inflation = whack-a-mole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well at a wild guess I would say it would possible be some type of Massive DPS meele class with little damage midigation.  Something simular to the rogue class with less defensive skill but more offinsive minus the location restriction of being behind the mob.  Likely they will have a large number of the new endurance skills and will need to balance thier skills more to thier enduracne simular to how wizards currently save thier mana for thta critial time and then BURN the mob down.<br />
<br />
Though this is all just my own rambleings on the subject as I currently have no real idea what they plan for this new class.  I just seems that they went to all this trouble for a meele upgrade.  But they are giving three different classes these skills to enhance them.  However, they dont have a class yet build around them.  I would guess this Bezerker class at the time it showed up and such would be one custom fit for that position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree the pure offense no defense class would fit the name berserker best, but i thought i saw something from the recent SoE melee discussion that they will be burst offense as well as burst defense.  Not sure how burst defense would work, but im sure it would be VERY lame.<br />
<br />
If I had to make the berserker class here's how i would do it.<br />
<br />
1. leather armor - berserk means bear-shirt in ancient scandanavian type languages.  Mitigation would have to be the worst of all melee or people would whine.<br />
2. BURST melee - im thinking the melee DPS of a BL w/o pet, until they go &quot;berserk&quot; for maybe 30 seconds every 5 minutes for dmg roughly equal to what a wizard could put out chain nuking in that time<br />
3. warrior type weapons, 1hs, 2hs, 1hp, dual wield at 13, gains melee skills about the same times a warrior does.<br />
4. alchemy? everyone has been talking about an endurance regen buff, but maybe alchemy would be used in the new berserker class in a way similar to rogue poison (except not sucky), after all, berserkers IRL would eat mushrooms to dull the pain and help their frenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The way I see the Bezerker class,it is pure offense.A berzerker would be able to inflict heavy dmg but couldn't take much,if he ends up taking dmg,he would inflict even more dmg.<br />
<br />
Basically,he would have the same DPS than a rogue,once he goes below 50% life,the Berzerker would be able to activate different offensive disciplines and some kind of &quot;absorb dmg&quot;,would absorb a percentage of dmg while the disc last.<br />
<br />
Should also have some &quot;group effect&quot; disciplines,increasing melee dmg for his group members for a certain amount of time.There is nothing like seeing a Berzerker charge the battlefield to give  his fellows a boost of courage and strenght.<br />
<br />
Should be immune to fear,Berzerker isn't scared of anything,he scares his ennemies.<br />
<br />
Should be limited to barb,troll,ogre and maybe Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
Defense skills similar to ranger,maybe a bit lower,wearing leather (skins and such),in my mind a Berzerker has a primitive look.A Berzerker in cloth is silly IMO,but hey bards can wear plate,it is SoE's world ;)<br />
<br />
That's how I see them,doubt that's how they will be tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">mmm.  berzerkers were for striking fear into your enemy, not so much for doing damage, tho they certainly did that too.  it'd be neat if they got an aoe debuff or something based on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">WEll our original beserk / rage line of spells used to drain all mana and increase, str, sta, hp regen. You used to get mor hp's as your mana drained away, and the spell lasted until you clicked it off.<br />
Almost used to be a way to convert to a warior kinda type. Could make a class based like that i guess, when attacking your sta / mana drains away till your too tired to continue with the same gusto. But while it lasts your speed increases damage increases, you take less damage, regen faster. or all those abilities could be from the suggested melee turn in abilities. Only a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hmm rangers have jolt,  monks have fd, rogues have evade. So I wonder how when a beserker does too much damage will be able to avoid aggro if their mitigation is going to be bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Should be immune to fear,Berzerker isn't scared of anything,he scares his ennemies.<br />
<br />
Instill Doubt/Intimidate like rogues or monks get.<br />
<br />
Should be limited to barb,troll,ogre and maybe Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
Definitely Vah Shir.  You ever try to give a cat a bath?  I also think that humans and dwarfs would be appropriate races for the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Here a short article explaining what a Berserker was.<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker_(viking)<br />
<br />
Pretty interesting. Maybe they'll have a special forage skill to get some of those shrooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hmm.  Making me wonder if this is going ot be a really high DPS class but that cant tank for crap. Might be intresting. I mean it would be fun putting out huge melee number but being a feather weight. cant really piss off monks that way or rogues really if they are weak enough defensivly.<br />
<br />
time will tell i guess.<br />
<br />
All i know is if they expect me to buy another expansion at this poitn, its better be un-freaking-believeable, like LDoN had sex with Kunark then pumped up on steriods.</div></div><hr />
