<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blakdecree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Downloaded a parser today.  We were raiding time.  On Cazic Thule, I spent the entire fight chain casting panther on everyone I saw meleeing.  I had to pop spiritual channeling to keep up as I was oom about 1/3 of the way through the fight (9k buffed mana pool here).  I had another person heal me as to not slow my casting.  Had I had enough mana, I would have went through my mana pool probably 2.5-3 times.  The way my parser is set up, you can do a search, but it will not automatically give you proc damage, since it is naturally attributed to the person using it.  All of the panthers I cast were on pc's also, as to not get into the increased proc rate of pets.  Also keep in mind that I did not begin to chain cast panther until after CT was engaged and my log was turned on.<br />
<br />
The way that I came up with my numbers was doing a search for &quot;550&quot;.  All test messages were of the exact same form.  This, of course, will not include various crit procs or partial hits (although I doubt this happened even once).  The fight lasted 3:37, or 217 seconds.  There were 357 procs.  Doing a little math gives us 357*550 = 196,350 damage.  Dividing this by the duration of the fight yields 904.8 dps.  You can probably theoretically add on another 50-150 dps from crit procs as well.  As you can see, this is a significant number. BUT...<br />
<br />
Keep in mind there were four other shaman at this raid.  Had I not kept it up on the entire raid (I had to pop a long reuse ability to do so), then all of us combined could have.  Since you cannot have two panther buffs at once, and assuming that all of your shaman are dedicated to this, 904.8 dps going four ways is not all that impressive at all.  Splitting the duties would probably allow for a dot here and there also, but even still the dps figure would not go over 400 (probably not even near that).  I don't really see a problem with this buff, and I have no clue why they are nerfing it.  Someone clue me in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to Rytan, they would like to fix it because:<br />
<br />
&quot;...roughly 600 DPS for 7800 mana, which most shaman should be able to handle for at least those 12 applications, and in most cases longer.<br />
<br />
600 DPS is higher then even wizards in most situations depending on gear etc.  Given that shaman have never primarily been a DPS class, and have a number of other useful abilities to bring to the table 600 is just plain too high.  The spell needs to be reigned in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Too much damage - based on the observation that 1 shaman at a raid could possibly keep the spell on 12 individuals for the duration of a boss mob fight.<br />
<br />
Of course - this isn't a stackable ability - unlike many wizards at a fight, shaman could not create more and more infinite damage with this spell, it is limited to the number of player characters available (who are not dead, stunned, afk, kiting, etc)<br />
<br />
I don't think the spell needs to be fixed :) In some sort of perfect scenario, I might be able to keep the spell up on 12 people, but I'll probably have to do other things as well - heal, cure, re-buff the dead, kite, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on a raid i see what you're saying but what about an exp group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, how do you balance the spell for both raiding and grouping? That's why I thought the option for leave it the way it is, limit it to single target, group members only was interesting - it doesn't affect the group experience at all, while potentially limiting the 12 person buffathon Rytan mentioned in his example.<br />
<br />
(of course, the enterprising raider will just use the raid functionality to move shaman from group to group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">exactly.<br />
<br />
i won't comment further. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>felargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hello , im new to this community and just want to introduce myself to make you understand a little where im coming from.<br />
<br />
Im a LVL 70 450 AA Wizard Raidleader of an elemental planes guild currently working on access to time.<br />
<br />
I follow various class boards and im interested in overall Class interaction and teamwork.<br />
<br />
I think the panther line is a great addition to a shamans flexibility and power and personally i dont see the need for a nerf.<br />
<br />
In its current form it gives the shaman the choice between  burst DPS ( panther ) , sustained DPS ( DoTs ) and healing/slowing/debuffing .<br />
Flexibilty is a good thing in a game to deal with different situations and also making shamans &quot;stackable&quot; in a sense ( even in a group ) <br />
<br />
Nevertheless there is a reason why SOE ( Rytan) think this spell is overpowered in its current implementation ( and i agree with him there ) <br />
Having Shamans putting out 900 burst DPS ( and i assume in a standard raid there is enough room for 2 Shamans on panther business ) is simply too much compared with other classes whose single purpose is to deliever (burst) DPS ( rogues, wizards) <br />
Shamans are always needed in a raid as slower , add healers ( grp ) , debuffers and curer. <br />
giving them a tool to provide burst DPS is a good thing especially if you have enough shamans fulfilling the other roles,  but i think this burst has to be below that of a &quot;true&quot; burst DPS class ...Adjusting the burst capability to 600 DPS ( roughly ) would sound like a reasonable number to me (make it a little bit skill based so TOP shamans might bring this up another 100 or so ) <br />
<br />
Concerning group play : Adding 300 sustained DPS , aggro free , for a shaman on DPS duty  is fine ... I think the spell in its current form does that  <br />
( parsing panther DPS in a high uptime RSS group would be nice to see )<br />
It widens the gap between melee groups and caster groups even more and one would see GRPs making choices between melee and caster oriented groups but thats fine for me ( shaman , bard , healer, 3 melee vs illu, nekro , healer , tank and 2 caster classes as &quot;optimal&quot; setup )<br />
<br />
Panther is a good spell and also needed for a shaman to contribute DPS after fulfilling its slower role ( having to dot or nuke after slowing i can imagine the shaman getting aggro ..) <br />
<br />
Concerning overall Class balance : &quot;the grass is greener on the other side of the fence&quot; is something which is seen on any class board . <br />
Is a shaman without panther worthless ? Are other classes getting goodies all the way while shamans are overlooked ?<br />
What is the current status of the game ? Which classes need what to make them playable / enjoyable / balanced ?<br />
I think  these are the core questions one has to answer !<br />
Panther does help the shaman class fixing some of their issues and thats why im strongly against a nerf : Nevertheless im thinking that an adjustment is needed in such a way to balance it against the other classes. <br />
<br />
and a last comment : Lets put aside the class envy and work together for a better game. being reasonable and having a fruitful discussion might be better than &quot;bitching&quot; , &quot;cursing&quot; and insulting each other <br />
( and sorry for the long post )</div></div><hr />

How exactly does one make the task of chaincasting a spell skill based?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Few comments on your comments felargon  :)<br />
<br />
1.  Wizards stack.  Shaman buffs do not.  Remember Panther is a buff, not a nuke.  I typically raid with 45 people.  Possibly 15 are melee that I'd cast Panther on.  <br />
2.  How much dps do you think an enchanter hasting a raid provides?  I can tell you, its much, much more than Panther adds to the raid.  And it lasts over an hour.  Why aren't you against haste?<br />
3.  I need targets to provide this dps.  Stick a shaman in a primarily casting group with say, one tank, and my dps contributed drops to next to nothing.<br />
<br />
I guess what we shaman though, was that Panther was actually part of a true &quot;reinvisioning&quot; of the shaman class. That the kings of melee buffing would actually have a spell that melee needed. All our buffs are nice.. but they are so subtle in nature, its hard to measure.  Even parses of Ferine Avatar, show it to be of very little value in the endgame as players attack gear climbs.  <br />
<br />
We have the weakest hp buff of the priests, the worst healing of the priests, and soon to be even less than marginally better slow then enchanters and beasts (they are getting neg resist check slows similar to our GoD nihili line).  Even paladin's are getting a blast heal that is almost as good as ours!<br />
<br />
I agree that Wizards need a bigger boost in both burst and sustained dps.  But rising shaman up doesn't have to mean you going down.  I'd like to see Wizards once again above rogues and other disc burst melee in terms of burst.. but the King of melee buffing really needs something that returns them to that status.<br />
<br />
As it is.. as third rate healers, third rate hp buffers, and only slightly better slowers.. there isn't much left.<br />
<br />
300dps, which is what Rytan suggested from his 30 second recast suggestion.. is just laugable.  I've been doing 300dps with my dots for an expansion or more now.  when they stick that is... (only dot class without neg resist check dots also.. grr).  <br />
<br />
600dps that you suggested is much closer to what I think most of us could deal with.  But the only way implement that is to limit the number of targets. And for multiple reasons I won't get in to now, Shaman hate spells on timers.  Since we won't accept a spell on a timer, that leaves making Panther group only.<br />
<br />
The only way to make Panther do 600 dps on ideal group of 5 melee + 1 shaman.. is to INCREASE the damage Panther does.  Something I doubt Rytan would go for.  <br />
<br />
And then what happens if you group a shaman with a couple beastlords, a couple mages, and a necro on a raid... thats a group spell that just landed on 10 targets.  Or.. approximately 1000dps.  <br />
<br />
SOE really messed up with this spell, IF, IF, their intention was to &quot;balance&quot; the shaman by allowing us to provide 300dps.  <br />
<br />
I don't pretend to know all the answers, I just see a lot of the problems, and the release of Panther is one of them.  It either needs to be a truly class redefining spell for shaman, or it just needs to go away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>felargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">@veeshan : i meant it as a combination of skill and gear...On one hand you reduce casting time and on the other hand you need to have the shaman be rather good at pressing keys on the keyboard if you want to take out the maximum potential ..this can make the difference between 1 or 2 more panthers depending on gear and dedication ...<br />
<br />
@ungkor : good comments and i dont know the answer either / all of them... <br />
concerning 1) Wizards stack but if their burst and sustained gets surpassed by more and more classes you rather take those right ? ( dont want this to turn into a wizard discussion though ....i have my thoughts about the role and what needs to be done for the wizards as well but dont want to get offtopic here ) <br />
Shaman on the other hand have some unique spells which make them not replaceable for a raid so you will still need and want some for every raid just not 10 ...Agreed though for burst dps there might be enough panther targets for 1 to at most 3 shamans on a raid --- not to mention the hassle of targetting pets out of your own group which can be a mess ....<br />
<br />
2) thats really the strongest argument i see that you have to make Rytan keep the spell as it is ...Its after all a buff who needs a &quot;platform&quot; to be beneficial.  After thinking about it strengthening your melee buffing situation and at the same time strengtheing caster buffs for enchanters ( like a panther for spells( spells have an additional chromtic proc attached ...a  short duration Saliks for spells etc ( spells crit 20% more often )  might then be the route to go ...It would enhance every class and strengthen the intedependance....<br />
<br />
<br />
concerning your other points i just want to add id very much like to see Shaman healing improved ...There ought to be a considerable gap between a WIS based caster ( healing ) class and a hybrid ( rangers and paladins ) The &quot;everyday&quot; shaman cant act as main healer in challenging content for most of the time ( at least this is true for our VT/elemental geared shamans in RSS ) and even the better equipped ones have a rather hard time to do so .....Druids seem to be better suited for that .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. Empirical data isn't needed at all to come to the obvious conclusion, unless the person you are conversing with is a little dumb. The most important point about Black's post is not the achieved DPS for god's sake, no matter what he had to do to achieve it, but this:<br />
<br />
Keep in mind there were four other shaman at this raid. Had I not kept it up on the entire raid (I had to pop a long reuse ability to do so), then all of us combined could have.<br />
<br />
I have been saying this in every post where Panther has been discussed as it's the main argument. <br />
Whether Black added 600 or 1500 DPS matters little(you can reliably guess how much it does without ever logging onto EQ at this point and get a very approximate average number), because it needs to be divided by the number of Shamans present, in order to get a figure for how much DPS every single Shaman adds through Panther, AND by the number of players present for the raid, in order to find out what the overall DPS increase for a raid is. That's the aspect that Rytan is arguing on and where he feels its overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Isn't the DPS of a shaman using Panther entirely dependant on the melee/pets available to cast it on?

<br />
Another point in favor of a theoretical approach and against an empirical one.<br />
I posted a theoretical scenario in the other thread showing that, after the pet nerf, Panther will only add around 17 DPS per player on a 54-man-raid. That's with 36 different people being Panther'd, which using Rytan's numbers requires 3 Shamans to buff 12 different people each. Basically impossible without overlapping, even if you had that many recipients available.<br />
<br />
It doesn't get more obvious than that, ladies. Don't buy into that ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hello Felargon --<br />
<br />
I think the key thing that needs to be said, over and over again, is this:  Spirit of Leopard and Spirit of Panther are buffs.<br />
<br />
When you as a wizard go to max blasting, you are dropping direct damage spells right on the mob's head.  <br />
<br />
When I as a shaman start buffing people as fast as I can go, I am buffing characters.  They are the ones who actually do the damage; I am just buffing them so that they can do more damage than usual.  (That's what buffs are about, after all.)<br />
<br />
Having Shamans putting out 900 burst DPS ( and i assume in a standard raid there is enough room for 2 Shamans on panther business ) is simply too much compared with other classes whose single purpose is to deliever (burst) DPS ( rogues, wizards) <br />
<br />
The shaman did not put out 900 burst DPS.  He buffed 18 or 20 people, and thus created an additional 900 burst DPS.  They couldn't have done that without him, so he should feel pretty good about it.  But the shaman wasn't nuking for that amount; he was buffing like a madman; and he had support from 3 other shamans (who did all the rest of the usual shaman chores, leaving him free to concentrate on one buffing task) and 1 healer (who kept him alive while he drained his hp to keep on casting).  So:  about two dozen people were all involved in creating this 900 dps.<br />
<br />
If you as a wizard can put out 600 or 700 dps in a short burst of chain casting, that's what you as one player can do.  One player; and the two wizards standing next to you can do the same.  Three of you, then, can combine for about 2000 dps.  Maybe that's not as much damage as it should be; I've seen some important arguments about that.  But it's already true that in order for a shaman to put out 900 dps, it takes like two dozen people on a raid working together to make that happen.<br />
<br />
It might be tempting to think, &quot;Wow.  If a shaman can provide 900 burst dps this way, let's recruit four more to do the same thing on our next raid:  that would be 4500 dps!!&quot;  But it doesn't work that way.  900 burst dps will be the total you can get.  You can split it between 2 shamans, or 4, or the 4 you have plus 4 new recruits for a total of 8; but they'll still only get to buff the melee characters that are there on the raid.<br />
<br />
I think the deep question has to do with the class re-envisioning concept.  <br />
<br />
It appeared that the re-envisioning said this:  Let's give shamans a very powerful buff, one that is so powerful that a shaman, draining his mana pool, burning down his health, buffing as fast as he can target and cast, can maintain this buff on 18 people and with this team of superbuffed melees proccing like fiends -- together they will create more burst damage than a wizard on full burn. <br />
<br />
It now appears that Rytan is saying that the re-envision is:  Let's give shamans a modestly powerful buff that will allow them to buff two or three melees, creating burst damage of 300 dps -- or a little less than what they could already do as sustained damage with their dots.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is anything wrong with the first vision at all.  I see no reason to suppose that this needs to be nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Thats my point. Rytan seems hooked on these &quot;theoritical, best case, GOD mode&quot; scenarios. I think this example, and a few more like it (maybe the devs should COME to some raids, and SEE how it is in a real-time envrioment?) will do more for our cause than any other numbers you can toss out there.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see him come with us tonight, if nothing else he can laugh at the emotes and hotkeys. (Assuming he can see them, /flexes his 32 slow hotkeys.)<br />
<br />
Anyway. I've been pretty vocal and my view stands. Leave the spell alone, other than retuning it for pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thats my point. Rytan seems hooked on these &quot;theoritical, best case, GOD mode&quot; scenarios.

<br />
No...Rytan's theoretical scenario is not best case, it's perfectly realistic. Any empirical data would probably be less realistic as some guilds are caster-heavy and others more melee-heavy.<br />
<br />
A Shaman buffing 12 melees is a perfectly legit assumption(when using Channeling), but this only works for up to 36 targets and THAT'S already pushing it. 3 Shamans buffing 36 people generate 1800 DPS per Rytan, which is 900 DPS more than these 3 Shamans could sustain with their DoTs.<br />
Dividing 900 DPS by 54 people on a raid makes its contribution look what it really is, miniscule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you want to talk theoretical, let's talk theoretical.<br />
<br />
The amount of damage that panther can do is limited by a) The shaman's mana b) The number of available targets to keep Panther on, therefore, a shaman will stop casting panther when either of those things is true:<br />
<br />
A) nobody on the raid who can receive panther still has it (saturation)<br />
B) the shaman has no mana (OOM)<br />
<br />
Without counting swarm pets, the average raid has around ~30 valid targets for Panther.  This is a number I pulled from looking at the last few DPS parses I did and the number of people who did damage, and manually adding them up, if your experience varies feel free to post.<br />
<br />
Three 'distinct' modes the shaman casts panther in:<br />
<br />
a) BURST dps using up mana.  Assumes a 12k mana pool, a mana regen of 120/tick passively, and that the shaman does not do anything except panther people.<br />
<br />
b) Spirit channeling mode.  Assumes that while in spiritual channeling mode, the shaman will only cast panther and serenity on himself to upkeep the damage, casting serenity will slow down the rate at which panther is kept up, shaman switches to this mode when OOM.<br />
<br />
c) Mana regen mode.  Here the shaman is totally OOM, and casts panther as his mana allows.  In this mode, the limiting factor is mana, so the shaman will use Ancient: Ancestral Calling as much as possible, and cast panther whenever possible.  Mana is spent as soon as it is gained.<br />
<br />
Panther costs 650 * .77 or 550 mana/cast, and takes 1.5 + 2.5 around 7 seconds per cycle.<br />
<br />
Math time:<br />
<br />
In phase a ends when mana (t) = 0<br />
<br />
d(mana)/dt = 550 / 6 - 120 / 6 =  - 71.66<br />
mana(t) = integral (- 71.66) =c -  72 t <br />
<br />
boundary conditions are 12000 mana starting, so setting the mana equation at t = 0:<br />
<br />
12000 = c - 72 (0)<br />
<br />
c = 12000<br />
<br />
n is the number of people with panther.  Let's assume that a shaman can give one person every 7 seconds panther.<br />
<br />
dn/dt = 1/6S<br />
<br />
where S is the number of shamans, that does not vary with t.<br />
<br />
boundary conditions, at t = 0, 0 people have panther.<br />
<br />
integrating:<br />
<br />
n (t) = 1/6St + c <br />
<br />
n(0) = 1/6St + c = 0<br />
<br />
n (t) = 1/6St<br />
<br />
d(damage)/dt per person = 100 <br />
at time t = 0, total damage is zero, integrating:<br />
<br />
damage (time) = 100 + c<br />
<br />
damage (0) =  100n + c = 100t per person, or 100tn(t) total<br />
<br />
This is a pretty straightforward math.  All it is saying is that mana decrease with a rate over time, and damage increases with time, the number of people who have panther increases with time.<br />
<br />
Let's solve our system now for n:<br />
<br />
n (t) = 1/6ST <br />
<br />
if at t = 102, n &gt;= N (where N) is the number of available panther targets, then not enough shamans (S)  are there to reach saturation.  If not, then we can calculate how long it takes to reach saturation.  Let's use the 30 possible targets for panther number:<br />
<br />
30 = 1/6 ST .  Setting T to = 102, we get:<br />
<br />
600 = 100 S<br />
<br />
Therefore, on a raid with 30 targets, 6 shamans can manage to complete the cycle before panther recast.<br />
<br />
It however also shows something that is not nearly as obvious but it is very important.<br />
<br />
Adding shamans is still very productive at this point.  Each shaman added DECREASES the amount of time required before saturation is reached, and each shaman INCREASES the amount of time that panther can be kept up for the entire raid.<br />
<br />
The 'optimal' amounts of shaman, at which DPS is maximised depends only on how long the fight is, but it is not true that adding further shamans once you got enough shamans to cover an entire raid does not increase damage, NOR, is it true that adding extra shamans does not increase BURST damage, since saturation is reached much faster.<br />
<br />
I did not finish the math for phases B and C, because phase B is identical to phase A, except the amount of time that it takes for a shaman to cast panther, and switch to next melee, and because nobody disputes that part C is true either, that is, that more shamans allow people to keep panther up longer if you are scraping for mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you want to talk theoretical, let's talk theoretical.<br />
<br />
The amount of damage that panther can do is limited by a) The shaman's mana b) The number of available targets to keep Panther on, therefore, a shaman will stop casting panther when either of those things is true:<br />
<br />
A) nobody on the raid who can receive panther still has it (saturation)<br />
B) the shaman has no mana (OOM)<br />
<br />
Without counting swarm pets, the average raid has around ~30 valid targets for Panther.  This is a number I pulled from looking at the last few DPS parses I did and the number of people who did damage, and manually adding them up, if your experience varies feel free to post.<br />
<br />
Three 'distinct' modes the shaman casts panther in:<br />
<br />
a) BURST dps using up mana.  Assumes a 12k mana pool, a mana regen of 120/tick passively, and that the shaman does not do anything except panther people.<br />
<br />
b) Spirit channeling mode.  Assumes that while in spiritual channeling mode, the shaman will only cast panther and serenity on himself to upkeep the damage, casting serenity will slow down the rate at which panther is kept up, shaman switches to this mode when OOM.<br />
<br />
c) Mana regen mode.  Here the shaman is totally OOM, and casts panther as his mana allows.  In this mode, the limiting factor is mana, so the shaman will use Ancient: Ancestral Calling as much as possible, and cast panther whenever possible.  Mana is spent as soon as it is gained.<br />
<br />
Panther costs 650 * .77 or 550 mana/cast, and takes 1.5 + 2.5 around 7 seconds per cycle.<br />
<br />
Math time:<br />
<br />
In phase a ends when mana (t) = 0<br />
<br />
d(mana)/dt = 550 / 6 - 120 / 6 =  - 71.66<br />
mana(t) = integral (- 71.66) =c -  72 t <br />
<br />
boundary conditions are 12000 mana starting, so setting the mana equation at t = 0:<br />
<br />
12000 = c - 72 (0)<br />
<br />
c = 12000<br />
<br />
n is the number of people with panther.  Let's assume that a shaman can give one person every 7 seconds panther.<br />
<br />
dn/dt = 1/6S<br />
<br />
where S is the number of shamans, that does not vary with t.<br />
<br />
boundary conditions, at t = 0, 0 people have panther.<br />
<br />
integrating:<br />
<br />
n (t) = 1/6St + c <br />
<br />
n(0) = 1/6St + c = 0<br />
<br />
n (t) = 1/6St<br />
<br />
d(damage)/dt per person = 100 <br />
at time t = 0, total damage is zero, integrating:<br />
<br />
damage (time) = 100 + c<br />
<br />
damage (0) =  100n + c = 100t per person, or 100tn(t) total<br />
<br />
This is a pretty straightforward math.  All it is saying is that mana decrease with a rate over time, and damage increases with time, the number of people who have panther increases with time.<br />
<br />
Let's solve our system now for n:<br />
<br />

<br />
if at t = 102, n &gt;= N (where N) is the number of available panther targets, then not enough shamans (S)  are there to reach saturation.  If not, then we can calculate how long it takes to reach saturation.  Let's use the 30 possible targets for panther number:<br />
<br />
30 = 1/6 ST .  Setting T to = 102, we get:<br />
<br />
600 = 100 S<br />
<br />
Therefore, on a raid with 30 targets, 6 shamans can manage to complete the cycle before panther recast.<br />
<br />

<br />
Perfectly valid assumptions, even though, I would have not touched the mana cost since it matters little when assuming BURST and we are using Channeling.<br />
Anyway, it's perfectly true that more Shamans reduce saturation time, but even if we reduced saturation time to 0, you'd still look at a total of 2100 DPS added through Panther, which translates to an additional 38.8 DPS added to each of the 54 people on a raid.<br />
<br />
Given that it's impossible to even come close to zero saturation time, the number still looks rather small.</div></div><hr />

Looking at panther as 'damage added to raid' is very misleading.  Yes, panther requires a raid to support it, but all 'raid' DPS requires a raid to support it.  A wizard cannot nuke without a mob being tanked, adds being controlled, clerics being healed, but 'spreading' his damage out to everyone who allows him to contribute is just confusing yourself.<br />
<br />
It is a perfectly letigimate point of view, but then by that token every damage should be 'spread out' over the raid.</div></div><hr />

It will be a hyperbolic function, though, so each additional shaman tasked into panther casting mode will be a smaller and smaller increase to the speed at which saturation is reached.  With five shaman saturation is reached in 6 cycles; add one shaman and saturation is reached in 5 cycles:  so just 5 seconds sooner.<br />
<br />
Adding further shamans will increase total damage -- at the margin condition where having fewer shamans means they end up running oom.  If three shamans can sustain saturation for three minutes, and the fight is over in two minutes, then we do not gain anything if we add a fourth shaman and give ourselves the ability to maintain saturation for four minutes.<br />
<br />
Clearly if the fight is going to last ten minutes even with the added dps from saturation, it makes sense to have however many shamans it takes -- eight? -- and maintain saturation for all ten minutes.<br />

It would only be confusing if I didn't state that it's adding a total of 2100 DPS to the raid, but I did. Distributing the damage among everyone is the same as calculating the effects of VoQ or Haste individually.<br />
<br />
The point here is that the burst DPS of a raid isn't increased dramatically. This is best shown by stating the average DPS added by Panther to each person present, as saying it will add 2100 DPS is pretty insignificant without giving a baseline for the average TOTAL raid DPS, but everyone pretty much knows the DPS output of X class or at least their own.</div></div><hr />

See, then does a wizard 'spread' his damage to the warrior, the clerics keeping the warrior alive, the enchanters mezzinig the adds, the enchanter who gave him clarity, the bard who is singing mana song, the SK  giving him zefveer?<br />
<br />
It is a zero sum game, each class depends on the other to 'enable' its performance.  Panther does not require anything extraordinary.  If Panther was a DoT that ran its course in 1:30 minutes, was unresistable, had zero aggro, and stacked with itself t he issue would be exactly the same.<br />
<br />
This is as silly as attributing the damage from Pyrlin Skin to the tank, since 'it is a damage shield'.  Of course it is a contribution to the raid, but it is a single contributon from the shaman to the raid, there fore a single shaman adds more damage to a raid than a dedicated DPS class does, which is why Rytan is trying to 'reign in' the spell.</div></div><hr />

The issue is that clerics and warriors aside, raids do not happen in a vacuum.  In your tipical 54 person raid, one is likely to get anywhere from 2 to 6 shamans on a raid.  Yes, I agree, that having 8 shamans on a 2 minute fight is not 'optimal' but really, how often does that come up, that you have 8 shamans for a large raid, and you are killing a single mob that dies in 2 minutes?<br />
<br />
If, EQ was geared so the tipical shaman numbers per raid were 8+ and the average fight length was around two minutes then I agree with your numbers, but that's so far from the norm which IMO is not worth considering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am not spreading the damage because it's dependant on a target rather than just the Shaman, you're misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
I stated that the DPS added through Panther, if the saturation time of zero was a ssumed, would be 2100. That's pretty straight-forward as you can see.<br />
To clarify what 2100 DPS raid DPS actually means, since some people don't raid and most don't parse the total raid DPS but just their own, I showed how much damage was theoretically added to each individual's personal DPS, so that the Shaman or whoever reading this would not say &quot;What the hell is 2100 raid DPS like?, but rather say &quot;I see, 2100 raid dps is like a buff that added 38.8 DPS to my own DPS and everyone else here on the raid&quot;<br />
<br />
See what I am saying?<br />
<br />
Edit: For further clarification: Any raid with 3 Shamans casting Panther, assuming they had 36 different targets and somehow managed to not overlap their buffing, would add 900 additional DPS through Panther to their raid. <br />
If this was a &quot;raid buff&quot; or a Leadership AA you could turn on, it would mean that each of the 54 people would do ~17 DPS more than without it.</div></div><hr />

Spirit of Leopard / Spirit of Panther are powerful buffs that provide significant steady dps in groups and quite significant burst dps in raids.  If my role is envisioned to be providing powerful buffs to make my melee partners awesome fighters, then this is just the kind of spell I want.  They appear to do exactly what they are designed to do (unlike many of the other buff spells I have gotten over the years).<br />

<br />
Oh, in that case I understand your point.<br />
<br />
The argument that 900 DPS is 'not that much' in terms of total contribution to raid DPS is highly reducive though.  A wizard adds less.  A monk adds less.  Sure, in terms of the overall damage of the raid it is not a huge addition, but that's because a raid is the sum of its parts, and each person makes up 1/54th.<br />
<br />
The issue at stake is that each 1/54th feels like they should bring a meaningful contribution.  If classes whose main role as the 1/54th of raid is damage dealing are outshined at their role by other classes, that devalues roles.</div></div><hr />
