<br />
Oh, and it will be a complete wipe.  No open or closed beta characters to be carried into the retail world.  It's definitely for the best.<br />
<br />
See you all in Azeroth!  :D</div></div><hr />

WoW is actually in stores today, but they are not selling it till the 23rd.</div></div><hr />

I bet 5pp you will be buying this game within a month of release man :P<br />
<br />
Give yourself to the dark side. It is your destiny. And mine and that of ~500000 players :)<br />
<br />
Now as a side note: GAH NO WOW FOR 5 days OMG I AM GONNA DIE.<br />

I wish you the best of luck in not getting into another MMORPG.  I quit EQ 6 months ago and I had a blast getting away from them.  Unfortunately I'll be buying WoW but who knows, maybe I'll find a way have a life and play it.</div></div><hr />

Barli that's my favorite part of WoW.  You can simultaneously have a life and progress in the game.  Granted I'm not going to see the end game stuff within the first month like a lot of folks, but I will have a heck of a time.<br />
<br />
I quit playing the beta a few days ago.  I didn't want to get attached to/invest a lot of time in a character that would be wiped eventually.  Definitely a solid game.  Only &quot;negative&quot; (though it's negativeness can be debated) is that it doesn't have that addictive hook of EQ since you CAN accomplish things in very short periods of time, unlike EQ.<br />
<br />
Anyway, see you guys in retail, maybe shortly after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really?  I can't get to the Bliz website from work to cut and paste, but if I remember right from skimming it this morning...  They said that they were still making some last minute changes based on the beta and then they'd make the gold CD.<br />
<br />
Can someone else cut and paste?  Doesn't sound to me like the game has even shipped yet, but I think they can mass produce a lot of CD's/DVD's in a short time once they get gold.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I'll be sending the wife on a mission when all the stores open on Tuesday to pick us up a couple copies :).  I hate pre-order so I'm taking my chances I guess.  If a pre-order gets screwed up, I have to just wait it out... if a store just doesn't have it, I can drive to the next one til I get it hehe.<br />
<br />
See you all Tuesday!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They didn't name a gold date on the website - they said<br />
<br />
<br />
As we moved closer to retail, we continued to make changes and optimize all of the code that makes up World of Warcraft until we reached the point where we felt we could create a gold master -- the version of the game that's currently being pressed onto the discs which will be available for purchase at retail.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll bet the Gold CD was cut in October sometime, or possibly early November.  They have to have time to press a buttload of CDs at a time of year when CD presses are in very high demand, package them, and ship them via the various retail channels.  They don't use FedEx overnight to ship them, so that takes a few days, and in fact stores may get their palette a day or two ahead of the 23rd - they just aren't allowed to sell them until the 23rd.<br />
<br />
I would expect a fairly large patch the first time you connect to reflect all the changes since they went &quot;Gold&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ahh, ok.  It was 5:45 am and my eyes were still hazy when I read that.  I didn't catch the past tense. <br />
<br />
If I were them, I would allow anyone that had a beta client installed currently on their machine to just input a credit card number and make your purchase and subscription, rather than going out and buying a box.  But that's just me hehe.  I also would have allowed account creation and game purchase to have been happening already to minimize the hurtin' on the account creation server.  There were issues with this just for beta sign-ups, but hopefully they got the problems solved.  Nothing more bizarre than wanting to spend money on their product but you can't since the servers are down (SWG or one of the other games had this problem if I remember right).<br />

<br />
I agree that you CAN have a life and progress but damn if I didn't play way too much in the open beta and that wasn't even for keeps.  I realize that I can do both when it comes to WoW, I just hope I can actually accomplish it.  Hope to see you in retail and end up on the same server, Furd err Haagen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">WoW is a MMO... It will have a patch ready for downloading as soon as you try to log in, it's inevatible...<br />
<br />
However i love the way blizzard handles patches... the servers aren't down long.<br />
<br />
If the forums weren't down at blizzard there's a good post in the general section called &quot;10 things i hate about WoW&quot;.  If you are interested go read it, it's enlightening and hilarious (yes, it is a parady).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I really wasn't impressed with the patch process during stress test/open beta.  The first patch they said servers would be down 2-3 hours and it took 4.5 not including the hour or two afterwards where they had to reset the servers every 20 minutes.  The 2nd patch in open beta wasn't bad as it only took 2 hours but it was a tiny patch with just a few very minor changes.  <br />
<br />
The biggest problem I felt was that the servers would come down in the middle of the day.  Now if servers are generally only going to be down an hour or two that isn't really a big deal but for those 4-6 hour patches I hope they start them at like 4 or 5 am instead of noon or 1 pm.  Maybe they only did it in the middle of the day because it was beta and come retail they'll start earlier but I didn't see any mention of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you kinda answered your own question :p ... since it is not retail and they are not getting paid for it there is no reason to have a nightshift working on the patches ... better to just have the hole team awake and working on it in normal hours  ... also about the patch time ... 4.5hours is allot better than SoEs 9 hour+ patches ... also since they havent even started up for real yet they are still in a learning process and will hopefully have figured it all out when it goes live</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, it wasn't the 4.5 hours that bothered me so much as the 4.5 hours in the middle of the day.  I figured they only patched during the day because of beta, like I said.</div></div><hr />
