All I have to say is remember when we went from Luclin to PoP? It was a huge jump in the game...with barely any guilds just scratching the surface in end GOD content seems wierd seeing a huge expansion such as this being released. <br />
<br />
Clawmarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just hope its better then GoD.<br />
<br />
I dont think any other expasion alientated a larger part of the population then this. I can STILL barely put together a group on only a rare occasion, i still have 0 spells from GoD and have no flags cause all my groups spend 2 hours clearing to the bottom and die on the boss encounter.<br />
<br />
For a non-guilded person GoD ****ing blows.  But as a raiding/guilded person with the resources to put groups together ont he fly, im sure GoD works quite well.<br />
<br />
Like i said, i just hope they dont alienate like they did in GoD, it almost seems like in GoD they siad screw everyone else and designed content only for the high end raiders. Mind you thats ok, but before i shell out my cash on a expansion they claim was for 50+ i would like to know that its really for 65+ with VT-Elemental gear or higher and for guilds only.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would have enver wasted my money cause i have gotten 0 back for it. Well, i did have some good times in challanging dungeons, so i cant complain too badly, but it certainly was not meant to accomidate a player like me, thats for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
AND you cant get any significant testing done in 3 weeks.  From the last report I saw OOW ships end of this month.  How in the hell does SOE think they can get the bugs worked out of the 200 new spells?  As with other beta, are people going to be instanty 70? Or are they going to want to test out the exp curve from 65 to 66, and 66 to 67 etc ad nauseum.  I havent seen ANY discussion from SOE about possible AA yet; are they planning on testing that too?<br />
<br />
IMO, Beta for OOW should have started at the same time the Summit (Motto: Help is on the way) happened.  Who CARES if the expansion wasnt &quot;finished&quot; yet; testers could have worked on the content that WAS finished.  (take a HUGE hint from Blizzard on how to run a seccessful beta, SOE)  If testers had to spend a week testing the same things thats just grand because then, IF (not WHEN) I buy this expansion I want to have a bug free experience with it.<br />
<br />
I cant really fault Sony for doing the testing in so short a time frame though;  4 years and 7 expansion have shown them that almost no matter what they do, people will buy.  Its a business model that works, but be warned Sony;  You are about to have some very stiff competition with WoW.  Look how many subscribers you lost when you released the cluster-**** that was GoD and the only thing out was CoHeroes.  WoW is 100X the game that CoH is, and its gunning for you.  Watch your back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, with new spells simply consisting of 17% upgrades or whatever to existing spell lines, they can't really make obvious errors.  Because they aren't doing anything new or interesting or different.  <br />
<br />
Incremental adjustments are safe... and boring.  <br />
<br />
And sure, inbalances can and will evolve and they are extremely slow to address those.</div></div><hr />

I was in a EP guild that was just about done with VT and nobody could really be bothered to do GoD groups with me, either.  We could've won, mind you, but most people didn't want to bother.  (either that or they were waiting till they didn't have to drag a shaman along, HAR!)  So from my experience, an even larger percentage of the playerbase got screwed on that expansion than you'd think.</div></div><hr />

Do not forget Innate Wisdom 5 as well.<br />

At least they had Canni V in the template.  I was lucky enough for my betabuff to get ONE EP bracer.  Do not know how I swung that, but in the end, I deleted the toon to /beta my character over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG, good expansion? Have they changed any of the shaman spells yet? Do shamans still have craptastic DPS?  Are shamans going to be barely ahead of paladins as healers? Do shamams still have class defining spells as ancient spells? And what about all those single stat buffs? Those changed yet? Check out Lucy. I don't see a lot happening there, do you?<br />
<br />
Tugela, confess. Which department to you work in for SoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hopefully they push that mid-September release to a mid-December date.  The amount of &quot;tweaking&quot; we need atm makes Everest look like a mole-hill.<br />

Pretty crap is still crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">personally, i want OoW out now, just so they lose their biggest excuse for not getting on w class balancing... Yea they would still have OoW bugs to deal with, but we will get those any ways :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OOW will not push back to past Nov at the *latest*.<br />
<br />
Simple reason is that WoW and EQ 2 current have &quot;estimated&quot; release dates of around Nov.<br />
<br />
If OOW comes out after WoW OR EQ 2.... you can bet sales will be way down... maybe it will be sold eventually... but a lot of people, even if they don't leave EQ, will go try out WoW and/or EQ 2.    <br />
<br />
If OOW came out at the same time, or right after EQ 2, or WoW... I know I wouldn't buy it... I'd be busy checking out those other games.<br />
<br />
You can bet that SoE will release Omens early Sept... I'd say it's pretty much set in stone regardless of what people think of it at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After getting over the shock of losing my tail, I checked out the gear situation.  Wow...he was even worse than the current template hehe.  He had a bunch of VT gear, but NO mana pres, NO spell haste, NO buff extention...NO AAs (as in NO MASS CANNI)!!  I was dying for my own toon, and after killing a few mobs I gave up...<br />
<br />
I'm glad I didn't delete him though :P  Snagged an AoN and some Holgresh beads from his inventory to play with during testing as a consultaion!!</div></div><hr />

It's ok.  Betabuff rangers get blade of war, yet warriors get no EB weapons....and yet again Beastlord is pretty much the best geared betabuff class   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The whole process of getting into Beta is a crock of crap. I have played this game coming up on 5 years. I have 2 accounts with several lvl 65's on them and belonged to a raiding guild for most of that time in EQ. I know the insides and out of several classes yet I am never able to get into the early stage of Beta. However I see postings on forums from people who boast about being in Beta who have realistically put a miniscule amount of time in game as someone like myself. I really wanted to test this expansion out but looks like they will let the DoA, WOW, and COH jumpers test out a game they really dont even know how to play.<br />

But considering the short time frame, odds are those who made it either pay attention or are bleepin' lucky...<br />

((Incidentally...  Run Speed 3?  Ummm...  why?  It's slower than sow - and for a shaman - is it just the inside thing?))</div></div><hr />
