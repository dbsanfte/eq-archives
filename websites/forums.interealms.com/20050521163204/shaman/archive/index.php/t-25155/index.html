<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benthebaoa Laytor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was Cut and pasted from the Kane Bayle board. Not my conversation with sony but worth a read. <br />
<br />
Its time sony wakes up and cuts back on severs before EQ dies out, little background on me (if you care) I play a lvl 70 shaman with 1035 AA as my main. i have been on kane scine it opened. was in a qvic lvl guild that disbaned due to lack of people. Joined a time lvl guild that is VERY close to dieing now due to the low population on kane.<br />
<br />
Eq severs need to be cut in 1/2 to keep the game alive. and forcing people to pay to move will only make more quit. i will quit playing EQ before i pay to move. and it wont be to play wow or EQ2 I will try my hand at the game called RL.<br />

CSR Nash K.: Hello , Thank you for contacting Sony Online Entertainment. One moment please, while I read your question. Thank You! <br />
CSR Nash K.: May I know your First name and last name? <br />
Customer: Steve Grueber <br />
Customer: My question is more of a request <br />
Customer: I lead a Time guild on Kane Bayle <br />
Steve Grueber: we have the lowest population to begin with and with the release of eq2 and wow our population is dwindling even further <br />
Steve Grueber: we need some resolution to this problem because the 2 top guilds are now trying to recruit from each other because there are no people outside of those guilds to recruit <br />
Steve Grueber: if there is nothing done we will be moving our guild to WoW <br />
Steve Grueber: that represents $21,600 worth of revenue to you guys over the next year <br />
Steve Grueber: we either need a server merger or an ability to move servers or you will lose not only my quild to a non sony product but probably the other guild as well <br />
CSR Nash K.: Thanks for the information. The issue you are describing is an in game issue. Here at chat support we can only help with technical and account issues. To help our customers we have more than one support departments. I will not be able to help you for this issue as it is an In-game issue. <br />
Steve Grueber: i would say its a biger issue then in game <br />
Steve Grueber: who can i speak with regarding this that can actually make some sort of decisions <br />
Steve Grueber: and an email isnt good enough because i have sent 10 emails with ZERO response to even one of them <br />
Steve Grueber: and losing 150 accounts to blizzard is an account issue <br />
Steve Grueber: i for one have 7 accounts myself , and i have put over 2 years into this guild and i dont want to see that wasted, that is why i am comign to you guys to first of all make you aware of it and second of all to get a resolution <br />
CSR Nash K.: One moment please, while I transfer you to another CSR who has the ability to assist you further with your issue. You will be returned to the queue and a CSR will assist you immediately. Thank You, and have a nice day. <br />
CSR Nash K. has left the session. <br />
Please wait while we find an agent from the SOE HELP EVERQUEST II department to assist you. <br />
You have been connected to CSR Jacob T. <br />
Steve Grueber: hi jacob <br />
Steve Grueber: can you read what i typed to the previous person? <br />
CSR Jacob T: You cannot move servers at this time. <br />
CSR Jacob T: Is there anything else I can help you with today Steve? <br />
Steve Grueber: do you guys seriously want to lose this amount of customers to WoW? <br />
Steve Grueber: a blanket answer of no isnt gonna cut it <br />
CSR Jacob T: Well, that is the answer. <br />
CSR Jacob T: I could lie and tell you YES. <br />
Steve Grueber: im not asking you to <br />
Steve Grueber: im asking if #1 you are aware of the issue and #2 if there is anything we can do <br />
Steve Grueber: we want to stay in eq, but without people to recruit it wont happen <br />
Steve Grueber: and instead of starting over in a different game we want to seek out a potential resolution <br />
CSR Jacob T: You could submit a paid move request. <br />
CSR Jacob T: The free moves are only done when the population is too high. <br />
Steve Grueber: ok and what about the opposite problem? <br />
Steve Grueber: or does that not matter? <br />
Steve Grueber: $21,600 worth of revenue just from my guild in the next year and it doesnt seem to be an issue <br />
CSR Jacob T: Well, we are going to provide special treatment simply because you are threatening to leave the game. <br />
Steve Grueber: we want to stay , i have spent way too much time in this game to just give up on it <br />
Steve Grueber: i played the beta for wow and i dont like it but my guild does.. <br />
Steve Grueber: im assuiming you meant to say we arent going to <br />
Steve Grueber: are there any servers that are high population that you could offer a transfer to them to move them to KB? thus solving 2 problems at once <br />
Steve Grueber: and if so let us know cause then we could post for recruits on those server boards <br />
CSR Jacob T: That is a good idea. <br />
Steve Grueber: i just want something to happen cause i fear my members are || close to leaving and i dont want that <br />
Steve Grueber: we have dropped from 5 time guilds to 2 in a month on KB <br />
Steve Grueber: there are zero EP guilds below us <br />
Steve Grueber: so there is zero blood to recruit from <br />
CSR Jacob T: Well, there is not much to it. <br />
Steve Grueber: the 2 time guilds were best allies, and now were at each others throats to get each others members. they are in txevu and we just hit time so its tough <br />
CSR Jacob T: Some players enjoy low populations. <br />
CSR Jacob T: You could submit a paid move request and move to a server of your choice. <br />
Steve Grueber: this isnt just me though <br />
Steve Grueber: if it was just me i woudl do it <br />
CSR Jacob T: Bristlebane, Stromm, and Maelin Starpyre are the most populated. <br />
Steve Grueber: this is 150 paying customers that see the end coming <br />
CSR Jacob T: Or, you could continue to lodge complaints such as this that will likely not be addressed. <br />
CSR Jacob T: In game, you could use the command /feedback. <br />
Steve Grueber: if i can come back and say to them i spoke with you and that they are going to do (insert solution) then they have something to hang on to <br />
CSR Jacob T: That would be the best way to submit voice your concerns. <br />
Steve Grueber: ive sent 10 emails and 5 /feedbacks and have not heard a single thing back from anyone <br />
Steve Grueber: thats why im taking this approach as a last resort <br />
CSR Jacob T: Where did you send the e-mail? <br />
Steve Grueber: ive sent them to just about every address on the site <br />
Steve Grueber: accounts, billing, customer service, the feedback one <br />
Steve Grueber: i even sent one to our gm but found out he isnt there anymore <br />
Steve Grueber: i phoned yesterday and was on hold for 2 hours and gave up on that <br />
Steve Grueber: its like you guys dont care, if i ran my business this way id be out of business. <br />
Steve Grueber: you have a customer coming to you trying to help you guys continue to retain a revenue stream <br />
Steve Grueber: i wish i had customers that did that for me <br />
CSR Jacob T: You should e-mail feedback@soe.sony.com . <br />
Steve Grueber: been there , done that and ill do it again <br />
Steve Grueber: i just dont want things to fall apart /sigh <br />
CSR Jacob T: What GM did you e-mail? <br />
Steve Grueber: his name was owen <br />
Steve Grueber: ariemos or sumpin was his gm name <br />
Steve Grueber: but havent seen him around in forever <br />
Steve Grueber: the other guild leader said he wasnt a gm anymore /shrug <br />

Steve Grueber: i am sending the email again, but i am not sure what if anythign will come of it since i have sent emails to this address b4 <br />
CSR Jacob T: What do you expect to happen. You expect us to transfer 150 characters for free? <br />
CSR Jacob T: That is not very likely. <br />
CSR Jacob T: You have been given a few options here. <br />
Steve Grueber: im just explaining the issue <br />
CSR Jacob T: Thank you for visiting our SOE Chat line, Steve. Take care and have a Good Day! <br />
Steve Grueber: the only thing you told me is to pay for a transfer <br />
Steve Grueber: that doesnt help the SERVER problem <br />
CSR Jacob T: I also gave you info. on where to submit your feedback in game and through e-mail. <br />
Steve Grueber: and i have <br />
Steve Grueber: but obviously you arent in the position to see this as an issue and i need to speak with someone that really cares about the revenue stream and there customers. <br />

Considering the former zillions of players who occupied (crowded) the original servers for so long, I was a bit surprised to see servers like MS and Stromm end up on a most populated list.<br />

I would pay to have the old server population numbers back on Server Select just to see where EQ is at. :p</div></div><hr />

I will not be able to help you for this issue as it is an In-game issue. <br />
<br />
I sympathize with guilds, that are hit hard by the current development - my own guild is aswell  :( .<br />
<br />
But right here the conversation should have stopped with an apology (yup i said it - an apology towards that CSR guy) for using the wrong channel and a thanks for his time.<br />
<br />
Why is it, that people feel the need or the right to use CSR representives, that have NOTHING to do at all with the issue at hand as their own private trashcan for their anger and frustration? Yeah, yeah i know SOE has probably understaffed and underpayed their CS staff (besides using a sh.... system) but inmature attitudes like that doesn't help the matter.<br />
<br />
I am working partly in CS myself and trying my best to help customers, but one could expect a minimum of consideration and respect on both sides.<br />
<br />
A hint to Steve: You are talking to the wrong person champ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I mean not only that, but you set the tone of the conversation from the minute that you start it, when you start something with &quot;Steve Grueber: if there is nothing done we will be moving our guild to WoW &quot;.

I understand you are frustrated, but when was the last time that someone came up to you and said &quot;give me $75 or else I will be real mad&quot; and you did it????</div></div><hr />

Nah cant see this being true at all.<br />
EQ 1 is a massive cash cow for SoE and if they did kill it off i think they realise they probably wouldnt get as many subscribers to EQ 2 as they have for EQ 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sshawnbrewer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ya i wasnt sure about it either...just thought it was interesting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I kinda agree that the person trying to &quot;force&quot; some kind of action/re-action in this conversation was out of line. &quot;Steve&quot; seems to have a relatively closed mind on possible solutions to the problems of lower (possibly temproary) server populations. Maybe the big rival guilds that are recruiting from each other should just suck it up and merge. Oh wait, they have been &quot;bitter enemies&quot; for so long . . . whatever.<br />
<br />
I am sure that if the trend of low server populations continues, there will be server-mergers, but no one should expect it (or DEMAND it, like Steve seemed to be doing) anytime soon. EQ has seen this type of situation before. DAoC took HUGE chunks of large guilds for a period of time. Most returned to EQ eventually. Same with other games. Granted, the WoW thing is much bigger than any challanger in the past, but I dont see SOE making any rash decisions on server mergers, for at least a couple months, to see if WoW is a true contender or a DAoC-like pretender. <br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;trying to drive people to EQ2&quot; theory, thats just nonsense. EQ2 is SOEs method of targeting NEW players, and trying to retain older EQ1 players who are tired of the inevitable &quot;grind&quot; thats present at higher levels of any game. Lets face it, not that many new people are joining EQ1, and with good reason. But EQ2 is all fresh and new, without the one-zillion web sites full of spoilers, without the empty low-level zones, without level 10s twinked to a degree that would have made a lvl 50 proud in 1999 (Nothing I was using the first time I killed nagafen is worth more than 20 pp anymore. Most of it is totally ignored, because its so useless). SOE isnt giving up EQ1, no way no how. <br />
<br />
Merging servers would be the first step to admitting there is a &quot;problem&quot; with the game, subscription-wise. I dont see it happening until WELL after the holidays, maybe even next Spring. Until then, ALL guilds are in the same boat. Either adjust, or your guild probably wont survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, it's all Steve's fault because after exhausting all of his options for a point of contact and getting no reply, he chose an option where he might be able to at least speak to a person. lol<br />
<br />
&quot;CSR Jacob T: What do you expect to happen. You expect us to transfer 150 characters for free?&quot;<br />
<br />
/boggle It must be terribly complicated to copy and paste a list of characters from one server to another. Obviously there's more to it than that (probably not much though), but this comment almost sounds like, &quot;You expect us to actually do something for you?!&quot; <br />
<br />
If they want to continue EQ1, they're going to have to consolidate servers and move people eventually otherwise, when there's not enough people on the server to justify playing, people will quit.<br />
<br />
Anyway, SoE customer service pretty much sucks on every level and some people in this thread are acting like 'well, if you just went through the proper channels, everything would be ok!' when in fact this guy more than likely is not going to receive help from anyone at any level. And then somehow, this poor customer service is Steve's fault? I think a few people who have posted here might be too used to bad customer service or have no idea how little help SoE can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This issue is a basic business transaction. Steve saying if you do this you keep our business, if you don't we will will go elsewhere is perfectly reasonable. It isn't threatening, it isn't intimidation, or blackmail, or anything other than stating the facts. The real problem is that the situation will not, and cannot, be elevated to the level of SOE/EQ management that is necessary to establish a mutually beneficial solution.<br />
<br />
If it could be, the likely solution is that SOE would move this 150 group if that group would each commit to a 1 year subscription in advance. Toss in an understanding that a server move may not result in the desired new member influx expected and ... zippo ... poof ... SOE gets their subscription and this guild gets to move for &quot;free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then again, there is the other side of the story. Steve claims if a server move to a more populous one were allowed, then 150 players would continue to play EQ. These are the same players that want to move the guild to WoW. How many would stay even if the server move for free were allowed? How many would still go to WoW?<br />
<br />
... just some quick thoughts</div></div><hr />

Obviously, you have no concept of the business world. How about the person that comes into a grocery store and says &quot;I want 2 gallons of free milk a week or I will shop across the street&quot;. Or the gas station where the guy says &quot;I want a case of free oil or I am going to buy gas somewhere else&quot;. <br />
<br />
That 150 people may not seem like a big deal to move, but how many subscriptions do you think SOE still has? How many of those do you think wouldnt mind moving servers, especially if it was free? Shouldnt they get FREE moves also? <br />
<br />
Join the real world please, the one where threats and ultimatums dont mean JACK. 150 members of a 300K population is hardly something that would instigate a change in policy. I am not saying that, eventually, SOE shouldnt offer free server moves as a method of deciding which servers to merge and downsize, but right now, after WoWs month &quot;Rocket-Man&quot; run, they arent gonna cave to this kind of crap, nor should they.</div></div><hr />

If you think that moving character records between world databases would be near the difficulty of cutting and pasting text in notepad, you *really* need to take some classes on enterprise grade databases like Oracle and DB2.<br />
<br />
That $75 you pay to have your transfer done? That's probably covering the cost of having a DBA move all your stuff around.<br />

does EQ make money, yes.<br />
<br />
Is it a cash cow, no. (atleast not for sony)<br />
<br />
The profits that EQ make pale in comparison to sony's other products. A   blockbuster movie can earn more money than EQ has earned total.<br />

The moment EQ stops making money it will be sold or shutdown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any DBA worth his weight writes scripts to automate routine tasks.  I'm absolutely certain that SOE 'pushes a button' and these characters are copied over.  <br />
<br />
Here's what you are probably paying for:<br />
<br />
1.  You type in the webform, which emails your server request to an operator or pool of operators (DBA's don't mess with this low level crap).<br />
2.  The operator enters your character name into a program, chooses the new server location, pushes &quot;transfer&quot;, done.<br />
<br />
The fee is not justified.  The only reason its in place is to A) make money, and B) minimize the amount of people seeking tranfers. <br />
<br />
If everyone could move at will, freely, SOE would have a large amount of their staff time devoted to it.  They'd rather not I'm guessing.  Even though it only takes a couple minutes to transfer, multiply that by 300k and you see the problem.  <br />
<br />
But besides all the business/computer stuff, I think the main issue is SOE doesn't want servers to become ghost towns.  If all the lowest servers moved to higher population servers, those low servers would become empty.  SOE isn't ready to deal with that yet.  Its probably a much bigger deal to close/open servers than it is to move characters around.  <br />
<br />
I feel for that guild, ours is being hit hard also.  And I think if SOE really wanted to make things better, they'd close a couple servers, and work to bring new players aboard, fast.  But closing servers is tantamount to saying &quot;we are hurting&quot;, so it won't happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Even with stored queries to do the transfers, it's still not trivial to move 150 player accounts between servers. I really hope they aren't having a joe schmoe CS dude pushing a button to do character transfers. I would hope they have someone more technical looking over some logs or something to make sure every transfered without a hitch. Maybe not a senior-level DBA, but at least *someone* with a clue.<br />

This process should actually be automated when you submit a request.  No human intervention is required for a transfer at all.  I can transfer between my bank accounts online without having someone log in and tell me &quot;please log off your banking account, I'm going to move your funds now.&quot;  And that's real money, not a stupid game character.<br />
<br />
They have the transfer process the way it is to dissuade you from transferring at all.  Even though they could just check the last time you transferred and authorize based on that.  I think not allowing free or reduced-fee transfers at this point is going to cost them more money in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&quot;stored queries&quot;<br />
<br />
Term you are looking for is 'stored procedures'.  And yes, I'm almost certain they have operators doing this for them.  I work with huge amounts of data, and after myself and other programmers put apps/scripts in place to accomplish routine tasks, we give them to qualified operators to do the button pushing.  That is very common practice in large computer departments.  Its very segmented.  <br />
<br />
Trust me, last thing you want to do if you are the DBA for 32 terabytes spread across 4 oracles servers, mssql servers, and rdb on vms, is have to deal with user requests.  You put the processes in place, and then let customer service run the processes.  You of course have to test things thorougly, and make sure that the stored procedures have failsafe routines and are transactionally 'sound', in that they can roll back if any one part fails.. but other than that, its easy to setup.  Plus, even if some weird bug occured, you do have backups (which, btw, are also run by operators, usually fresh out of college).  <br />
<br />
At any rate, in terms of customer service, what we are seeing is very typical of a large organization with nothing to prove.  It'll take some serious financial pain before SOE changes its party line about service.  And like others mentioned above, I doubt anyone trying wow or eq2 actually cancelled their accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again i can understand, that he is angry and frustrated - but that random CSR has nothing to do with his frustration and cannot even help him with the issue. He was told politely, he was at the wrong address with his problem and still continued to waste the CSRs time.<br />

<br />
Actually, I work in customer service myself, and yeah, I realize that it probably didn't help Steve any to come into the conversation with ultimatums, but let's face it....there's nothing Steve could have come into the conversation with that would have actually incited some help from SoE's customer service department, and that's really the point. (mine, at least) Also, I realize there's nothing the CSR could have directly done for the guy, but he could surely have passed it along in some manner where it might have been considered or followed up on or anything really other than being shrugged off.<br />
<br />
&quot;That 150 people may not seem like a big deal to move, but how many subscriptions do you think SOE still has? How many of those do you think wouldn't mind moving servers, especially if it was free? Shouldn't they get FREE moves also?&quot;<br />
<br />
They've done server splits in the past free of charge depending on the situation on certain over-populated servers. Is it really so hard to imagine that they might consolidate servers based on the case of an under-populated server? I'm not saying that anyone who asks to be moved to a more populated server should get moved, but when there is a genuine need for such a thing, is there any reason the concept itself should be met with a &quot;free? yeah, right&quot; attitude? I agree with you that they should't cave in to every ultimatum too...what bothered me is that in the replies from the CSR, he doesn't even act like it's a remote possibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;Join the real world please, the one where threats and ultimatums don't mean JACK.&quot;<br />
<br />
It may not be the best way to get something done, but specifically what world is it that you live in where threats and ultimatums don't get anything done? That statement is nearly comical. Maybe in the world of SoE customer service they don't, but some businesses, believe it or not, actually do something when their customers become upset enough to make statements like this. (and yeah, while you don't want to encourage caving in to this type of thing, some of them are still legitimate)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Transferring money between accounts is pretty trivial. It's the equivalent of moving items between characters through your shared bank slot. Whole character records should be much more complex.<br />
<br />
2) The process, as of a few months ago, was still not fully automated. My friend was contacted by a GM, who asked him to log off while the server transfer was performed.<br />

Meh, I posted my reply last night after a long string of bad wipes in EQ2. My brain was a little fuzzy. Replace queries with procedures and junior level DBAs with operations technicians. My point is still the same, I don't think they're having general customer service people doing these transfers.<br />
<br />
For instance, at the bank I worked at, we had something called a CIF (customer information file), that was basically a record of a customer's contact information and all of their accounts, loans, etc they had with the bank. Occasionally, a personal banker would open a duplicate CIF for an existing customer adding a new account instead of adding it to their old one, as they should have. Merging CIF records was *never* done by customer service, it was performed by IT operations staff. The salary for that staff was more than customer service / entry level helpdesk. Not a ton, but enough. To me, doing character transfers is on a similar plane. I'm no DBA (obviously), but I understand basic concepts.<br />
<br />
*Shrug* I'm sure they've automated a lot of it, but I'm still not convinced the work going on behind the scenes still isn't as trivial as cutting and pasting some text between some files.<br />

Gimee a break man. There is absolutly NO legitimacy to this transfer request that cannot be applied across every single server in the game.

One of the reasons I left EQ was the continual and continuing locking up I experienced in OOW.  I spent over a week with EQ CSR and tech reps.  What ended up happening is I was having the same daily conversations and sending the same information to the guys at Sonytech.<br />
<br />
It got so bad I would just cut and paste the same answers to the same questions they were asking.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, EQ makes enough money that Sony won't shut it down. Heck, if EQ was losing money they long ago would've turned off the servers.</div></div><hr />

Actually Faern, I think we give it til February, when the &quot;free&quot; month runs out for all those who recieve the game from Santa. I dont think there will be a HUGE drop in subscriptions for a while though, because the game is obviously VERY strong. I trust the opinion and advice of people like you, and Snoww, and a couple others a LOT more than most of the fanboi, Pro-WoW / Anti-EQ garbage I read here. <br />
<br />
But honestly, I am already seeing a semi-return to EQ by some, and their reasoning is simple. They want to raid, but they dont want to grind. So they play WoW instead of XPing, and then log in for our raid times to play that portion of EQ. Our guild has gone so far as to have &quot;set&quot; raid target start times, &quot;set&quot; weekly schedules for raiding (easy to do at our level, since we have a server-wide Time rotation and we are currently on Instanced content in Gates, progression-wise). I have noticed a number of our &quot;WoW-EQ2 experimenters&quot; logging on for raiding. I can live with this for a while. Eventually, there wil come a point where people will choose, but for now, I want to raid, and the rest of my friends who are staying in EQ want to raid, and the WoW-EQ2 people want to raid, so I say lets raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">What Iceberg?<br />
<br />
WoW is definately the biggest smack EQ has weathered.  I enjoyed someone else's observation that in EQ the game begins at 65/70 and in WoW the game begins at 1.  I guess the big question will be -- In Wow, does the game also end at 60?<br />
<br />
I predict EQ1 will remain financially solvent for at least ten more years.  The population has peaked however and will slowly decline and eventually they will begin to collapse servers.  Now, launching a server costs way more than closing a server down saves -- you'll save hardware maintenance, whatever annual software licenses you might be paying (i.e. Oracle), and electricity.  If you can close an entire facility you save a lot more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Closed for your Convenience<br />
<br />
However, merging servers is an admission of defeat.  My guess is they'll announce something along the lines of massive &quot;upgrade&quot; to &quot;better&quot; servers than can handle more players at once.  Probably pitched as EQ 1.5 with that new graphics engine we were suppose to get last Christmas.  I also suspect a good portion of the people working on EQ 1.5 will be layed off soon after.<br />
<br />
Most crucible loudmouths, and I use that term affectionately, represent the hardcore, end content raiders.  But I wonder if we're not like the citizens of New York City speculating how American will vote.  I bet we're outnumbered by the rural, pre-time players by a good margin.  The casual, silent majority if you will.  These are the people that will go to WoW in droves.<br />
<br />
Then there's probably a few thousand people who forgot their passcodes and have no clue how to end billing.<br />
<br />
I sent my userid and password to H&amp;R Block <br />
<br />
I can see two huge mistakes SoE made with the last couple expansions.  One, the whole flagging system timesink.  Ideally, an MMORPG should have replayability from scratch and the thought of dragging characters through all those stupid trials probably kills it for average Joes.  It did for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Trash Mobs Attack<br />
<br />
The second bad trend is The Grand Wussification Project.  Mobs are too tough.  I don't mean bosses, but everything and its pet hamster.  Small, green, unslowable critters that hit for thousands.  A level 70 in GoD plays as feeble as a level 1 in North Freeport.<br />
<br />
That doesn't matter to raiders because that's part of the challenge, but to the casual, silent majority -- it's gimptastic.<br />
<br />
Your parents were shakers?<br />
<br />
If you lose the mid level players, then there wont be anyone to patch the holes as you lose ubers to chronic uber burnout syndrone.  Some ubers do their Betty Ford time and come back,  many don't.  I wouldn't look for a big reaction from SoE until they see far more alarming numbers though.</div></div><hr />

I play on RN, and if I made this ultimatum, then no, it wouldn't be legitimate. We've lost players too of course, but there are still plenty on the server. However, I'm just going by the information in the first post...<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve Grueber: we have the lowest population to begin with and with the release of eq2 and wow our population is dwindling even further<br />
Steve Grueber: we need some resolution to this problem because the 2 top guilds are now trying to recruit from each other because there are no people outside of those guilds to recruit&quot;<br />
<br />
From this statement and a couple others in the original conversation, my impression was the problem was pretty severe on that server at least. They didn't split every single server at once, they won't start merging them at once either. <br />
<br />
However, this is not really my point at all. I think you've just gotten caught up with trying to argue with me. My point is, again, that the CSR could have treated this a lot differently despite Steve's (legitimate!) ultimatum. I'm not even saying that anything at that time could or even should have been done to help (WoW and EQ2 do need to be out longer and things need to stabilize first), but the CSR shouldn't have acted like this was the customers problem, and yeah we'll fix it if you pay us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What I dont like about this is that Steve seems to think a transfer will help.  I dont think so.  I have seen so many posts and heard so many things about 'High end guilds' on other servers having problems.  I think he should count his 150 man roster as a blessing.  My guild has an 87 man roster, about 60 of which are active mains, we can clear up to P4 in Time (when we get ~40 people online, when we dont have enough for Time, we do GoD/OoW) with out much problem...and yet this person with 150 people (not sure how many are active) is complaining?<br />
<br />
Unless Steve's guild has 150 people and only ~30 are active...then he's kinda screwed in which case he has a right to be upset(but not at SoE), and nm that he can do GoD/OoW raids with less than 30/40 people.  I think people need to step back and realize that its not just thier server and that its not just isolated guilds having problems, its everyone, every server it seems and getting pissed at SoE for lack of people isn't right.  Telling SoE CSR people that 'do this or we leave!' isnt right and it wont solve anything at all.  Catch a clue please.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my little rant, just getting SO tired of people getting upset with the wrong people for lack of population and attendence.  Be upset with the people who left (not that that is right either) not at the game or SoE....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The solution is staring them in the face... If the two guilds used to be good allies and everyone's hurting, then instead of ninja recruiting from the other's ranks or seeking server transfers, just merge the guilds and dominate the server competition free. Problem solved, everyone's happy.<br />
<br />
A guild name means jack if you don't have the people to raid. The bigger guild will probably appreciate the influx time geared apps with raid experience. The Smaller guild can probably cut a deal to have all their members accepted at the same time.<br />
<br />
Probably some will leave for Wow using &quot;the guild just isn't the same anymore&quot; as an excuse... they would probably have left anyways. Those that stay will be the die hard EQ 1 players. When the dust settles, the 2 merged guilds will probably be better off and stronger for having shaken things up and combined forces.<br />

Logical, no ? The best way to deal with any kind of CS is not to need them. Because when you have to rely on someone not directly concerned with your issues regardless of the company, you're screwed.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm.  I don't know of any plans to address this issue.  I know I myself can't do anything specific to fix your problem.  I'm not even sure who I should send you to.  It's not really an ingame problem, like 'the NPC ate my quest stuff' or 'my epic has gone missing,' so it won't help to tell you to /petition about this.  <br />
<br />
It's got to be very frustrating for you and your guild, and if you've sent in the emails and petitions you mention there, it's got to be doubly frustrating.<br />
<br />
I've written down your email address.  I'll bring this situation (up at the next staff meeting / to the attention of my supervisor / to the people who work on overall game planning).  I don't know how quickly you'll get a reply.  All I can say at the moment is, you've asked a question that I don't know the answer to.  But I'll try to get your question into the hands of someone who can answer it.<br />
<br />
This doesn't promise Steve a quick and happy resolution.  But it is a good process for trying to resolve a question when the CSR doesn't know the answer.<br />
<br />
We've all had problems with companies and then received exemplary customer service.  We've all had problems and then received terrible customer service.  In the nature of things, there is no reason why SONY can't have superb customer service.  But they don't.  Instead, their customer service is marginal to poor.</div></div><hr />

That's where you are wrong 21K is a big deal. He's one of the vocal minority. The silent majority will have the same problem but not speak up and just move on.<br />

I dont think that Sony/EQ will recover this time. Even if people do decide that WOW/EQ2 isn't for them they may decide that as much fun as EQ was it's hold over them has been broken, and if at the end they were not having fun then why go back?<br />
<br />
Lets face it if you are really happy in EQ then you wouldn't bother trying WoW / EQ2. Speaking from personal experience I didn't bother trying DOAC, SWG, or CoH because I was having fun in EQ. I don't have as much fun anymore so I will be giving WoW a go.</div></div><hr />

It's probably hard to understand from an outsiders view for those not working in some support area.

That policy is there for a reason, if *one* non-technical request can be submitted via technical channels, *all* of such requests should be accepted, or?

Drive by- 300K is a pipe dream.  They were falling well below that just based on the server numbers the people that attended the Summit six months or so ago reported.  If they're over 200K at this point I will be really surprised.  The total # of MMORPG players across all games isn't really that high.  It wouldn't surprise me at all to find 100K or so EQ subscribers had been poached by CoH, WoW, etc. <br />
<br />
I also find it highly unlikely that people will go back to EQ1 after WoW.  Time will tell if WoW has lasting power, but one thing that's tough to argue is that it is flat out fun and for the most part not tedious.  Even if you beat WoW and run out of content, it is unlikely that you're going to want to move back to a slow paced, tedious game with a laggy graphics engine.  And that presumes you have full access to content as a raider- I can't imagine a non-raider going back to EQ even if SOE paid them.</div></div><hr />

Something like this either comes from the top or it doesn't happen. If SOE decides to provide the framework for guilds to server switch for free as a response to dwindling numbers then great. If they don't you're S.O.L. You either accept it,  deal with the situation within the existing system if you can or you endure it. At best he might have been able to negotiate a group price but even that is doubtfull. If the company thought having a department to deal with guild requests would be worthwhile, they'd implement one. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, these big companies don't do anything on a personal level. They don't deal with individuals, they set up an interface and a set of standardised rules based on their perception of how things should work and the only real  say you have in the matter is to either do buisness with them or not. Management will parse the statistics on their end and react accordingly. It's just a fact of life. In calling the tech support guy for something like this you're just frustrating yourself and wasting time he could be using to solve problems that actually fall within his jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I still say they should just merge the guilds and solve both their problems.</div></div><hr />

If everyone could move at will, freely, SOE would have a large amount of their staff time devoted to it.  They'd rather not I'm guessing.  Even though it only takes a couple minutes to transfer, multiply that by 300k and you see the problem. <br />
<br />
Ummm.....so you saying that the fee is justified....right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>EQBendur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Lets face it if you are really happy in EQ then you wouldn't bother trying WoW / EQ2. Speaking from personal experience I didn't bother trying DOAC, SWG, or CoH because I was having fun in EQ. I don't have as much fun anymore so I will be giving WoW a go.<br />
<br />
So not true.  I'm still a big fan of EQ but would like very much to try out WoW as a little extra.  I'm not sure why, but it really gets to me that so many people on this board seem to think that EVERYONE is so unhappy and leaving.<br />
<br />
And as for comments that the game begins at 60/65, only true if you make it that way.  Have I made it that way myself at times?  Yes.  But I've also moved to a different server recently and introduced the game to my girlfriend.  We are having as much fun together now as I did when I first started some 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
It is what you make it.  And that goes for WoW, EQ2, etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">If people say that it only starts after level 65.. well, it's because after the game has been around 5 years, it's natural that most of the stuff that is new is out for the people who are at that level.<br />
<br />
Just like WoW right not catered to the people who are a higher level.. it's because 99% of the server population prob isn't above level 20 yet (then again, with how easy i've heard it is to level, maybe it is).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think your server is a ghost town, you should see what the Zeks look like these days.<br />
<br />
About 3 months ago, my guild would easily get 90+ online fighting for raids spots in Time.  Last few weeks, 25 online would be a good night.<br />
<br />
From the rumors I hear and petitions circulating to merge TZ and VZ, VZ isn't in much better shape.<br />
<br />
The more days and weeks go by, less and less logging in to see the &quot;raids...maybe&quot; MOTD.<br />
<br />
An era is ended....... at least on the Zeks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">70 active (and semi-active) members here, used to be 100 - best turnout lately has been around 40 with low to mid 30's normally AND we haven't been hit by WoW yet. As we are a euro guild on a euro server WoW doesn't get released here until March '05.<br />
<br />
EQ2 alone has pretty much wiped out our guild and it is very difficult to get &quot;casual&quot; raiders who are happy with 3 set raid days a week :(<br />
<br />
Clerics really been hit badly - we used to have 12 on roster and 8 show, we are down to 7 on roster and Thursday night had 2 show up.<br />
<br />
Top three guilds on server are recruiting heavily, one of our competition guilds just got absorbed completely by a higher guild. Another 2 at our level merged completely, loads of room in the EP's at the moment and we don't have the force to do much more than a few rings or mini nameds :(<br />
<br />
To cap it all some of the higher guilds are deliberately targeting core needed classes and offering them goodies to move from our guild - B******'s</div></div><hr />

Wonder whats going to happen to these newly recruited players when the old ones start tricklling back.We all know this is going to happen.Ok not everyone will return but i think a good % of them will.<br />
From what ive read no other game holds a candle to EQ 1 when it comes to raiding.<br />

A friend of mine works for SoE and he's responsible for the EQ CS. I spoke to him 2 weeks ago and he told me EQ had close to 400k subscribers. To me it doesn't matter really, but I don't see why he would be telling me that if it wasn't true.<br />
<br />
You can not go by the servernumbers on a guild summit btw. By doing that you are missing about 50 to 60% of the accounts, just because you don't catch those on who play once or twice a week and those in different time zones...</div></div><hr />

This may be true. I have three accounts and although they are all cancelled the least ammount of time i have left on a account is 2 months with one having 5 months left!</div></div><hr />

        We should all start again Pick a server with a really low population and all make a<br />

    Interesting, not what they are stating on their boards:<br />
<br />
    This is not something that has been considered, or proposed, or even discussed at this time.<br />
<br />
    I understand with the next gen MMOs launching that people feel there will be an impact on server population. Both the new games (EQII and WoW) are very different in feel and scope from EQ, from my experience and may not appeal to a large percentage of EQ'ers.<br />
<br />
    Contrary to popular belief: the population on the three Ubi servers is still healthy and there is no immediate reason to consider any sort of consolidation or merger.<br />

Greetings,<br />
<br />
following my statement over 1 month ago, this situation has been closely monitored.<br />
<br />
Discussions are taking place internally in this regard and there are no options which are being excluded from those discussions.<br />
<br />
We have no business statement to make at this time in this regard, other than: the results of those discussions and any decisions regarding server structure / composition will be communicated to all our players via their language forums and the EQLoft (UK / DE / FR).<br />
<br />
As a company we understand that reduced server numbers can impact the fun of playing EQ and we are actively exploring all possibilities in order to retain that fun for our customers.<br />
<br />
Quest and Event programming will be revitalised, as this is an area which we agree has seen a reduction in activity recently.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued understanding and support of the Ubisoft Everquest experience.<br />
<br />

Ubisoft is aware of the situation, so SoE should be just as aware, if not more so. If they care is the real question. I think we all know the answer to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Magni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Personally I am glad the populations are getting smaller.  Now keep in mind that I absolutely am revolted by the idea of raiding.  Raiding just not make the game fun for me.  On the other hand it has been a lot easier to find good camps to grind xp in or to be able to farm supplies for tradeskills without having to bump heads with twenty other people who are also wanting to farm tradeskill supplies.  IMO EQ has gotten better and I don't seem to see any more ksing griefers.  All EQ2 and WOW have done is to remove the fanboi/greifer problems for EQ, thus making it a better game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Any DBA worth his weight writes scripts to automate routine tasks.  I'm absolutely certain that SOE 'pushes a button' and these characters are copied over.  <br />
<br />
Here's what you are probably paying for:<br />
<br />
1.  You type in the webform, which emails your server request to an operator or pool of operators (DBA's don't mess with this low level crap).<br />
2.  The operator enters your character name into a program, chooses the new server location, pushes &quot;transfer&quot;, done.<br />
<br />
The fee is not justified.  The only reason its in place is to A) make money, and B) minimize the amount of people seeking tranfers. <br />
<br />
If everyone could move at will, freely, SOE would have a large amount of their staff time devoted to it.  They'd rather not I'm guessing.  Even though it only takes a couple minutes to transfer, multiply that by 300k and you see the problem.<br />
<br />
ROFL a pool of operators look at the char name, server name, type it in on another screen and click transfer? That's just retarded.. you click submit on that webform, everything is done automatically.. no humans touch it.. Why would they automate the &quot;hard&quot; stuff and leave something as simple as name, server to humans who on top of things, are prone to error?<br />
<br />
Also, if you interact with rashere you know the second he wants a character on test server he types something and 2 minutes later you are copied over full gear and all.. it's purely for profit and to keep honor in the game.. if every ******* could transfer for free...</div></div><hr />

All i can say is steve enjoy WoW it looks great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Drive by- 300K is a pipe dream.  They were falling well below that just based on the server numbers the people that attended the Summit six months or so ago reported.  If they're over 200K at this point I will be really surprised.  The total # of MMORPG players across all games isn't really that high.  It wouldn't surprise me at all to find 100K or so EQ subscribers had been poached by CoH, WoW, etc.<br />
Playing another game doesnt always equal a cancelled account. I bet they are still in the 300K range for active, paid accounts, if the 400K number on January 1st was accurate. Logged in populations fluctuate regularly, wihtout other games in the picture.<br />
I also find it highly unlikely that people will go back to EQ1 after WoW.  Time will tell if WoW has lasting power, but one thing that's tough to argue is that it is flat out fun and for the most part not tedious.  Even if you beat WoW and run out of content, it is unlikely that you're going to want to move back to a slow paced, tedious game with a laggy graphics engine.  And that presumes you have full access to content as a raider- I can't imagine a non-raider going back to EQ even if SOE paid them.<br />
Well, I cant speak for non-raiders, but many raiders, in my guild anyway, are already starting to trickle back in. Not a ton, and not full-time, but a few are logging in for a raid here or there. <br />
<br />
For a lot of people, EQ has become a &quot;Chat room with a game attatched to it&quot; instead of the other way around. This is especially true of people in large, raiding type guilds, as they tend to play more than non-raiders (on average, I know there are many exceptions). Our schedule for raiding is known, so that the EQ2 and WoW players KNOW when to log in if they wish to do a raid.</div></div><hr />
