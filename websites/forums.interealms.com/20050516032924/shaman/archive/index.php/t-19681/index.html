<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone able to post info on the gates AA's when server's come back up?<br />
<br />
i haven't yet bothered to get gates.. i've still gotta finish luclin, and planes before i worry about new stuff.. but i'd like to know if anything useful went in release</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zuksharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He was just looking for a live AA listing... not a social commentary. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Just delete!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zuksharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, Sionnach, you did not answer his question.  He was asking about new AA's.  He was not asking for a tirade about how much Sony and their new expansion sucks.  That, Sionnach, is not contributing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's ok Sionnach, I gave you a positive rep bump<br />
to make up for it ;D<br />
<br />
I sometimes think Sony employees DO in fact read<br />
this board, but only marketing people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a thread on the gate's AA's, but it's from the test server:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">oh wow.. logged in and i can see the list of AA's even though i can't train them..<br />
<br />
oh well.. nothing i can't live w/o for now..</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's TEH SLAP IN TEH FACE (as some called it), as one of the factions in GoD is with the Nihli.<br />

<br />
Go read their GOD Manual (http://everquest.station.sony.com/gatesofdiscord/pdf/FinalGoDman.pdf) and flip to page 26 where shm specific aaxp is explained.<br />

Call of the Ancients (Activated) - Use of this ability creates a stationary ward that continually heals everyone around it. <br />

Imagine you reading this while patching, crossing ur fingers they might have given us some AE heal, logging on after patch and seeing it is Endurance regeneration anyway.<br />

Never attribute to malace, what can be attributed to stupidity. <br />

I've read Sony didn't realize that the Scars Of Luclin acronym was SOL<br />
until it was too late to change the name.</div></div><hr />

I'm happy that it is endurance regen! Yay for something that only we can do. I bought two levels last night (3/6) and two warriors in my guild just raved about how nice it was.</div></div><hr />

Was that expansion before or after Shadows of Velious?<br />

Just humor...don't get too excited:)</div></div><hr />
