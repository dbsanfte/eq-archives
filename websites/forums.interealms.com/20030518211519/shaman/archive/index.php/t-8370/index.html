<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,  Ive been lurking this site for awhile not much of a talker I guess =P. anyway quick question about gear. I just hit 53 a few days ago, I was wondering what gear I should ditch and what gear I should go for. I know some of my items are a bit old now (focus effect 2s need to get lost) but I dont know what to replace them with. I more ac wouldnt hurt, but I dont know how much wis I should sacrafice.<br />
<br />
my mangelo profile is attached to my sig. any help would be greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
(PS if anyone knows how to do the vB code equivalent  of ezboards [center] could they PM me? thanks!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heres a couple ideas...<br />
<br />
Earrings: Do the Earring of Solstice quest and buy and Silver Hammer Earring.<br />
<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
<br />
Neck: Tracking Wolf Collar (This might be a little expensive depending on your server) or a Amulet of Insight.<br />
<br />
Fingers: Shadel Bandit Ring/Circled Toe Bones<br />
<br />
Bracers: Barbed Rubicite Bracer/Coldain Military Bracer (Or a JBB if you have that kind of cash)<br />
<br />
Belt: Spider Fur Belt is a nice cheap uprade.<br />
<br />
Back: Ancient Seahorse Cloak thingy.<br />
<br />
Chest: At your lvl the Iksar Regen was ok but it was getting to un-noticable to make a huge difference so I dropped it and bought a Polished Tin Mail ChestPlate thing. It has fairly nice stats and is pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
Arms: Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves/Crystal Chitin Armplates.<br />
<br />
Legs: Brown Chittin Leggings/Barbed Rubicite Leggings (Again, the second is more expensive so server prices come into play again =\ )<br />
<br />
Boots: Tribal War Boots maybe?<br />
<br />
Shoulder: If you like do trade skills I would start the Shawl quests.  They are a fun break from the exp grind and the 7th shawl isn't to bad, and the 8th is great.  If you don't like tradeskills maybe you should like for a Peerless/Matchless Dragon Wing Mantle or an ODS.<br />
<br />
Range: Goranga Idol/Begginers Magic Manual<br />
<br />
There ya go, that's about all the updates I can think of heh.  I hope these opinions help you a little bit in deciding what new gear to buy :)<br />
<br />
Btw, about how much wis you should sacrafice.  Just find a number of wis you feel comfortable with and try to stick at that lvl well improving your gear more towards HP/AC.  My lvl of wis comfort was 175-185. but it all depends on the player =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">personally, I would keep the bp, the shield and the reif, everything else I would ditch for hp/ac gear. I feel quite comfortable sitting at 153 wis right now, and I would be fine with dropping it a bit to get some more hps. <br />
<br />
here is what I would consider if I was you:<br />
<br />
Barbed dragon boots<br />
Crystal spider eyes<br />
Brown chitin legs<br />
shissar gaunts<br />
slime covered rubi coif<br />
earring of the solstice<br />
black sapphire electrum ear<br />
amulet of insight or a nice dragon talisman<br />
6/65 ring, shadel bandit ring<br />
barbed rubi bracer x2, or a coldain military bracer<br />
hardened grey flesh sleeves<br />
ods or a nice dragon mantle<br />
ikky bp or fungi<br />
heiro cloak/seahorse cloak<br />
chitinous belt<br />
beginners combat manual or magic<br />
sbs<br />
reif<br />
<br />
this will get you a bunch more hps, its all droppable and you should be able to afford most of it after a few days hunting in seb if you dont have plat laying around. <br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />
