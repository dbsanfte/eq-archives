<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I notice that potions now have a level, and items with a level restriction on a proc now state the level at which they proc. Have you noticed any other changes not documented in patch? <br />
<br />
The damage shield potions have a minimum level above 30, and SOW potions are at 25. Gate potions are at 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed that I failed a TON more last night making 20k worth of Gate potions.  Usually, I only fail 6 times (on average)....I failed 15 times !<br />
<br />
This is with 210 alchemy (bag), and alchemy mastery 3..not sure if this was just a really bad luck night, or if there was some sort of nerf with this patch...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hrm, noticed a huge increase in fails on VelBD bracers on my chanter, 7 fails in 20 combines, thought maybe it was just bad luck but it happend again the next time around. sounds like they may have messed up the tradeskill software.</div></div><hr />

That level added to the description of potions is the effect level. For some potions like Kilva's, the effect level helps define the amount of damage on the damage shield. For other potions like gate and SoW, it doesn't seem to mean anything. It's NOT a required level - that's just a wording problem.<br />
<br />
For some items it makes sense, like the Spear of Fate now shows an effect level of 50 which is when you can start using the effect. For potions, it does not really make sense and they should take the level out of the description.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info. I had not tried it on a below level 25 character.</div></div><hr />

That's why reading other threads first is a good idea. Especially when they're....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Far as i know the levels on the potions mean nothing... not reco lvl not lvl of effect not anything...  Just was working on my new alt with sow potions and ds potions after the patch and everything worked as before.  odd that ds potions have a lvl listed but still cast at the lvl of the user, ie 3 damage around lvl 4 and 10 around lvl 18 (aprox).  further dumbing down the population by posting the proc levels on everything is understandable as soe goes after less experienced players.  However posting useless number on items is pointless and just make things more confusing.  Leave it to soe to completely screw things up once again...</div></div><hr />
