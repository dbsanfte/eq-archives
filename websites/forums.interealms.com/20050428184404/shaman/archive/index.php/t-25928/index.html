<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that my crew and I are PLing up dps melees (rogue/hunter) to replace our pallies we've discovered to our delight that paladins are the ultimate melee PL class if you 2 box.  Blessing of might on a rogue is insanely good.  Heals + rez are also fun.  Pull too much? Bah, just shield the class being PL'd and use that time to bandage up.<br />
<br />
The best part about the healing is that if the rogue pulls 5 (which I do intentionally, saves pull time), the paladin will get heal aggro nearly instantly.  But who cares if the paladin is getting beat on by 4 lowbie mobs?  After I finish my first mob in 6-8 seconds I simply turn and backstab one of them off the paladin. Rinse and repeat and watch the exp/loot roll in.<br />
<br />
So far I've managed to burn through an entire fresh application of poison in under 10 minutes, a personal record.  I'm going to Stockades next to see how big of a train I can pull.  I start to lose track of who I'm fighting once I break 6 mobs or so, but since they don't last very long I guess it doesn't really matter.  I also give up any finesse required by my backstab build and just spam sinister strike and slice and dice.  That lets me clock over 40 dps at L23- not bad eh?<br />
<br />
Paladins rule: they are PL gods!  That was why I leveled one up- so everyone else could benefit. I knew there was a reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">best way i have found so far, is to group the lowbie with my 60 rogue, and drag him through all the instances over and over with the 60 rogue doing all the killing. Can do teh SM cathedral in about 45 minutes, every mob killed, make 3-4 bubbles of exp still at 41 each time.<br />

Problem with that for me is that the PLer is a paladin and it would take him about 45 min to clear the courtyard of SM solo.  And 3-4 bubbles of exp for 45 min is way too slow- a rogue can beat that handily just soloing. I want the PL exp, baby!</div></div><hr />

Although, was pretty constant dps last night in BRD, 400-600 with my full combat spec again and fiery weapon enchant. If I ever get to upgrade my mace, it will be so silly, silly, retarded damage. Regular ss crits are 450-550, love that.</div></div><hr />

At L50 using an instance 1hander, I do 60ish dps. When I switch to 2hander I can get to 75 dps, sometimes 80.  I will be lucky to ever break 100 dps at L60 no matter what weapon I get.<br />

400-600 dps? You're killing at literally 7-10x my speed, how do you even get hurt?</div></div><hr />

<br />
they hit me back for 400-600, and they have many thousands of hps. I can't always be in evade mode :) I can barely kill a level 54 elite mob on my own, even with massive damage like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've finally got a UI setup with a dps meter on it so I will pay more attention to it. Using seal of command fighting lvl 50-51 elites I'm like 85-140 dps. Is twitchy meter so getting used to reading it plus command is a twitchy seal see it procs alot or not sometimes. <br />
<br />
This is with my 52 dps big damage no stat sword. When I used my 42dps big stat weapon my dps was 65-100. I'm afraid to parse my 1h because I drop alot. SOC doesnt work so hot with 1h so its better to use more seal of light ( heal ) or seal of wisdom. <br />
<br />
Wish I had a ui like this during the bugged seal to see how damage was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well Mill I dont think a 60 dps from a pally is that far off. I'm embarrassed from what just happen in game lol<br />
<br />
Killing dragon kin in askhara. Put my 1h and shield on to test I was killing so slow that a 60 hunter killed his mob and came over to help me because he thought i was in trouble. Said nope just testing 1h dps. Was 67 and 65 on my two mobs. Way to short a test i know but i had to log hunter was showing off. <br />
<br />
With SOTC was hitting 2h about 80-100. This is 2h spec'ed. Blessing of wisdom/light combo was 70-90ish with 2h. 1h with damage seals 65-67 and with seal of light and wisdom I could see 60 easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I average 80 dps, lvl 57 Paladin. The only saving grace is a critical strike, Seal of Command proc, or the highly acclaimed double crit proc. DPS spikes up to around 180 then settles back down to less interesting numbers.<br />
