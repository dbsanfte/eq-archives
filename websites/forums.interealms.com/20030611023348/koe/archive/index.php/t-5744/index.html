They like to swim all day in warm water (76-78*F) and make excellent pets for beginners because they don't require live crickets for food! They eat frozen bloodworms or brine shrimp.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />

These frogs love to eat, which can make them quite fat, hence their &quot;dumpy&quot; appearance. Unlike many frogs, these frogs do well with other frogs of their species and are fairly friendly. They like a warm and moderately humid habitat and eat larger insects like crickets, cockroaches, locusts, moths and beetles.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />

They enjoy spending their day swimming and singing with other frogs of their species and become more active when not alone. Weird fact: Firebellied toads cannot extend their tongues like other toads or frogs. To feed, they must leap forward and catch their prey with their mouths. After they have grabbed a cricket or worm with their mouth, they usually use their fore-arms to help stuff food the rest of the way in. Then they squish their eyeballs down in their heads to push the food into their throat.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />

They are notorious for cannibalism...if there are other species of frogs in the tank, or even specimens of the same species, they have been known to feast on their neighbors!&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />

Active mostly at night, this toad will walk about slowly, sometimes making short jumps, in search of insects, worms and other invertebrates. This makes it of great help to farmers. At the end of autumn it buries itself in the soil where it remains until good weather arrives again. &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />

They like their habitat with temperatures around 68 - 70*F and high humidity. This species is very showy in captivity preferring elevated positions out in the open. Males are generally smaller, slimmer and more angular in build than females and not as vocal as other species of mantellas. Females can produce eggs at a rate of once every two months given proper care.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />

They mate in the water, and as the eggs are released the male fertilizes them and presses them to the back of the female. The skin grows around the eggs to enclose them where they will develop over the next 80 days. The young emerge out of the back of this toad as a bunch of tiny froglets!&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />

Usually, they hang out in open grassland, and if there are any to be found, they'll sit around in puddles. When startled, these frogs will blow up like balloons to scare away the intruder!  In the dry season, they will burrow into the ground. These guys eat lots and lots of really big bugs, fish, mice, lizards, and even other frogs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/funstuff/frogtest.php3&quot;&gt;What kind of Frog are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</div></div><hr />
