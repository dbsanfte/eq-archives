<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wrote this up for a couple guildies, figured I would post it here as well in case anyone else could benefit from it.<br />
<br />
<br />
In game, open the options menu (CTRL + O) and go to the KEYBOARD tab.<br />
<br />
In the dropdown menu, select TARGET.<br />
<br />
<br />
The VERY LAST choice in this list is what I will refer to as Target Swapping. It's name on the list is &quot;Toggle last two targets&quot;<br />
<br />
The option 2 above that I will refer to as Toggling. It's name on the list is &quot;Toggle target and myself&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Toggling:<br />
When you get a mob targeted, you hit this key and it will change the target to YOU.<br />
<br />
Press the key again (while targeting yourself) and it targets back to the prior target.<br />
<br />
This key is AMAZING for someone that can heal/buff themself (unless it is a self only buff and you don't have to target of course).<br />
<br />
Hidden Uses:<br />
Locking in a target: I use this a LOT when a named is coming up. Target the mob that you want to be able to re-target easily. Then press the TOGGLE key (now you have yourself targeted).<br />
<br />
From now on (till you toggle OFF of anotehr target) anytime you press ESCAPE, then toggle twice, you will return to that same target. (on first press of the toggle you get yourself targeted).<br />
<br />
End result is like this:<br />
<br />
A named mob is coming up in the raid. You use an eye of zomm (or assist a puller) to target it. You then TOGGLE to lock in the target. Unfortunately, the raid stops to buff up. So you go down the list of the raid clicking on names of people in groups and casting AGI (yeah dispell bait!). But now you have lost your target on the name, and you REALLY need to slow it fast..... Hit ESCAPE to drop your current target. Press TOGGLE twice.. you are now targetting the named again.<br />
<br />
Alternatively: MA just died and aggro is bouncing everywhere. You target the named, TOGGLE twice (you just locked in the target and then retargeted it) and hit /assist. Cast a heal, and WHILE THE HEAL CASTS, you can hit ESCAPE, then toggle twice, you now have the named targeted again and the moment the heal finishes you can /assist again and cast the next heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Target Swapping:<br />
<br />
This one is pretty new in the game and I have just recently started to use it. Overall there aren't as many uses, and you can't &quot;lock in targets&quot; like with the other button.<br />
<br />
Basically, press this button, and you wil retarget your LAST target.<br />
<br />
If you press it when you have no target, it will return you to the previous target, and when pressed again do nothing.<br />
<br />
The only real use I have found for this is for those casters who REALLY wanna know what health the target is at, but can't see it because they are forced to keep the MA targeted to heal him, or keep an add targeted to mez it.<br />
<br />
Target the MA. hit /assist. Now press the TARGET SWAP key and you can swap between healing the MA, and attacking/casting on/watching the main fight.<br />
<br />
For a puller, you could get lined up to have the next pull in line of site while you beat on the current target, then when you are ready to pull, TARGET SWAP to the new target and fire off a spell/arrow. Pull is timely but you lose almost none of your melee DPS in the process.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Overall, I am incredibly accustomed to using the TOGGLE key, and can't live without it. I am still adjusting to the TARGET SWAP key, but I find that I use it a lot more lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's a targetting trick-- not really the same type of trick, but it's still a targetting trick. hehe.<br />
<br />
(/pet taunt off)<br />
/pet kill reaver<br />
/pet back off<br />
(/target Jabober)<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
(you end up targetting the black reaver that your pet was just about to attack)<br />
<br />
This only works when your pet recognizes a match (i.e. reaver = &quot;a Black Reaver&quot;) that is close enough and you see the message saying he's attacking it.<br />
<br />
Then you can bind sight er whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xzanthos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's another, most people probably know this, but for those who don't.<br />
<br />
Ever been ML and have had certain corpses hard to loot, or have a corpse fall into the wall and not been able to loot it? Well, if you tap the toggle between yourself and target button, after the mob dies, you can toggle back and it will say &quot;soandso's corpse&quot; just have that targeted and walk over and type /loot.<br />
<br />
I have used this quite a bit lately, the swirling air guys in the MM dungeons are hard to loot sometimes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only thing I hate is when I use that /loot trick and suddenly realize I didn't have to heal all battle (and thusly never toggled off target).<br />
<br />
  And Xev_Grammar must be a nice old schooler.   before they limited the range that a pet would attack mobs from you could target the nearest of any mob type in the zone like this as long as you knew how to spell the name.  Shammie tracking! (/pet attack Vallon Zek, /assist pet, /gu Ayup, VZ is up... come to Tactics :P)</div></div><hr />
