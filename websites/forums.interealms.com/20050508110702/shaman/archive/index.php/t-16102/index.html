Im sitting around last night looking at my pets damage in PoN and jeez, he barely even hits, i mean the only thing he is good for is taking damage on lower tier mobs while i can4/5 myself, he practicly has no DPS at all atleast vs a PoP mob. Something like this would be a very nice boon to our pets usefulness. No we dont NEED it, but its certainly not overpowering and would give us a reason to cast a pet in a raid or any other situation. Besides, its not like we cant get them already and its not like we all dont, it just would save me 10 min looking for a mage ot running to a bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to say that is why we aren't likely to get such an item in the game.  But considering some of the silly stuff they have put into the game in the last few expansions...who knows....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heck, I'd be happy if that silly little Barb Tribunal quest neck in Halas let us summon hammers we could give to our pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This game is about sociality and interdependence.  We should have to depend on other classes to perform at peak efficiency.  <br />

Hehe, I love it, high end hard to get item like is having a clicky to summon a pet only weapon is somehow on the same calibur as clicky KEI and Virtue.<br />
<br />
It's just a god damned pet weapon ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Virtue's just an hp/ac buff that another class does.  <br />
<br />
I was exaggerating to make a point clear.  Mages summon things. Like nice pet weapons like the fists and swords.  It's what they do, a 'hallmark' of their class, if you will.<br />
<br />
I wonder if you would have the same nonchalance if druids got a clicky Turgur's Insects, or if maybe that's too over-the-top, a clicky canni2?<br />
<br />
Food for thought.</div></div><hr />

If another class got Turgurs or Grummus Id be pissed beyond belief.  However, Canni 2 already made it onto a non shaman item.<br />
<br />
Sacrifice (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29329).  Its funny you mention that because I just had a good cleric friend of mine loot that of Yelniak about 30 minutes ago.  In my deapest heart I was jealous, bucause I never got Canni2.  <br />
<br />
Bracer of Hammerfal (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1727)'s hammers wont work; they are throwing only and cant be equipped in primary/secondary slots.<br />
<br />
Im with the others here; Give me something to summon some daggers or swords that no one wants so I can give them to my pet.  If it was a non stat item and had to be worn on my head to use it I wouldnt hesitate for a moment to drop it on.</div></div><hr />

I could just see the patch message in the one that this got added.<br />
<br />
Added :<br />
<br />
Tribunal quest neck allowing players to summon hammers.<br />

<br />
Shaman pet's ability to dual weild when given two weapons.</div></div><hr />

I have to say thats a poor argument because  &quot; /tell mage_01  Can you summon me pet gear?  /tell mage_01 Ok thnx &quot; is not exactly a in depth social interaction that would be missed. My point is not to remove dependence on each other, but to make out pet more worth while.<br />
<br />
Hell i would be happy with a upgrade to our pet buff that gave him dual wield and a better haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This sentence is sad on SO many levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Level 1) Spelling-It was early, I'd had no coffee, and I'm not the best typist to begin with and I didn't proofread.<br />
<br />
Level 2) When I was at the level to get Canni 2 KC was still the place to be for 51 to 60.  Everyone and their mothers brother had a shaman that was trying to get the bones, so the line waiting for the camp was usually 10 to 12 people long.  So I never bothered.  <br />
<br />
Sure, I'd have liked to have canni 2 at level 39, or even 49.  Did it make me a bad shaman?  No, just one that wasn't willing to sacrifice fun playing time for boring 'sit on my ass and wait for a drop' time.  <br />
<br />
Level 3) That SoE is blurring classlines.  Warriors that have 15 to 20 spells they can cast.  Clerics using shaman spells.  Everyone using cleric spells.  Classes that share spells.  It all equates to the Devs not having any good ideas anymore and just tossing junk out when the need for a new expansion comes along.<br />
<br />
Those are the levels that I see...Care to elaborate on what you meant?</div></div><hr />

I mean when your puppy goes &quot;miss miss miss miss&quot; and has mage weapons and fulls buffs, its kinda hard to figure out how to make him hit more =\</div></div><hr />

Mani str + FoSpirit (or Str of the Diaku + FoSoul) to get his atk as high as possible, + Avatar if you have it.  My dog seems to hit for max more often then not with this setup.  Pets seem to have no stat limits, so the any added str is that much free Atk.  That would seem to include +str from summoned weapons/gear/Avatar.</div></div><hr />

Granted this would be very helpful as well.  Though I ussually just stick to FoS and Haste.  Primal Essnece would most likely help as well.<br />

You know with our pets damage able to go in its own window its alot easier to tell when our puppy is not hitting for max damage or missing alot.  When thats happening try using that other spell not used much called Cripple (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1592&amp;source=Live).  That alone ussually drops the mobs defense enough to allow him to hit more often.  That and working your pet around to the back of the mob where it's natural AC is lower as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ya, cripple rocks for increasing pet damage. I noticed while while I was leveling up my necro. It makes a noticable differance in how hard the pets are hitting.

i think the fact that beastlords exist shows that sony doesn't think like you. they are blurring the lines left and right, except they aren't blurring in shaman's favor.<br />
<br />
whats wrong with him saying &quot;we should get a summon pet weapon&quot;?<br />
<br />
mages and druids say they should get slow, necros get slow. hell, mages have heal for their pets, a good one too.<br />
<br />
toss up some ideas of what blur has helped us, because i can't think of any off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its funny that you mention that item, since it is not a clicky it is a proc... as such, it isn't a relevant response.<br />
<br />
If you are gonna use that as a justification, then it had better be a weapon that procs Summon : Fist of Ixiblat... not a right click.<br />
<br />
<br />
mages and druids say they should get slow<br />
<br />
Thats only a few idiots from each class, not the whole class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I find that with the proper pet positioning his DPS increases as well.  Little Cujo must be a rump humper as his DPS seems to increase on the mob's backside.  Give Cujo some proccing weaps (mage fists from the bazaar, buy some spare) helps because you can still proc on a miss giving the puppy a little help.  Cujo whiffs A LOT but it's still free damage and he buys me time on adds when everything goes to hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The resaon he hits better from the rear is the mob losses its Agi AC bonus.  Well it basicly has lower AC from the rear.  Is the same reason you get hit for more from the rear.  The spell cripple lowers AC as well which is why it helps as well.  If you combine the rear attack and cripple most times puppy will start hitting for max if he was not already.  Unless the mob is just super Red to him.</div></div><hr />

According to this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14184&amp;highlight=pet%2A+stat), stat buffs other than atk or straight hp have no effect on pets whatsoever.  I couldn't say either way, but now wonder whether it's worth buffing my pet or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a thread here not too long ago where someone parsed out various pet configs, and Maniacal Strength had a significant impact on pet DPS, almost that of Focus.  It was well beyond statistical error, something on the order of 32%</div></div><hr />
