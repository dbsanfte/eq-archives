<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I got &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; when I cast Turgur's Insects, for the first time since I dinged 65, and I'm wondering if anyone can shed any light on the matter.<br />
<br />
The fight was the Xegony battle in Plane of Air, it was the last bunch of adds, which happened to be the elementals.<br />
<br />
Several times, not just once, I cast Turgur's and it didn't take hold. It was definitely Turgur's that I cast, not some other spell. There was no other message. I sometimes miss them because I have different things going to different windows, but I double checked this time. I also double checked that it was Turgur's I cast and not Malos or something like that.<br />
<br />
This is only the second time we've beaten Xegony, but the previous time I didn't notice this problem either with slowing the elementals or slowing the last set of adds.<br />
<br />
I doubt the mob had run out of buff/debuff/dot slots, for a start - I have not yet come across that even on a long fight, and there just wasn't time for these to have been dotted that much.<br />
<br />
I don't think it can be another player's spell - Turgur's should overwrite every thing.<br />
<br />
I don't think it can be some mob-based AE that somehow blocked Turgur's, looking through Lucy's stacking I can't see what might do that - the only slow higher than 75% is Storm Comet (cast by Emmerick Skyfury in BoT) and we certainly didn't have that cast on us.<br />
<br />
I imagine there's some simple explanation for it, and maybe I'm being thick but I can't think what it might be, so I'm hoping someone else can.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">must have been something someone in your party had cast that wouldnt let it stack. possibly the mob ran out of buff spots? hehe :)</div></div><hr />

It's the 30 buff slot thing, has happened to me before.  I think that equal debuffs get not overwritten but stack like dots, so if you have 5 shaman malos/slowing, 4 druids debuffing, enchanters with aoe tash etc that can add up fast. And since everyone is 65 you are not overwriting anything.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that can be true. At least it doesn't seem to match up. If I cast Malos, and Shaman2 casts Malos, then someone casts Malosinia, Shaman2 gets the &quot;your Malos has worn off&quot; message, where I don't. Similarly, if I Turgur's and then Shaman2 Turgurs, and 5 minutes goes by, Shaman2 will get &quot;Your Turgur's Insects has worn off&quot; but I won't.<br />
<br />
This suggests to me that the same spell cast by the same level person will overwrite, not stack.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure it's possible that 30 spells could have been cast on these either, even if 5 different slows had been cast. And also, why would it have happened on 3 of the elementals, but not on any other mobs at any other time on the same raid, with the same people casting the same spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know. I have never got that message with Turgurs before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">some mobs buff themselves, maybe you need to dispell whatever buffs they have on, to make it 30 slots for dots and debuffs. otherwise you might be shorted about 10 slots sometimes depending on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a wild guess, but maybe mages have an elemental slow spell they were casting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what about that piece from cornav, that has extended debuffs focus, perhaps a shaman with one of those landed his before ( i belive its shoulders)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nope, we have not yet done Coirnav. None of our shamans has that item.<br />
<br />
I guess it's possible those mobs had a lot of buffs before we started, but even so, I don't think there was that much time for our raid force to land a lot of buffs.<br />
<br />
Oh, and also, I couldn't slow while the mob was mezzed, but also couldn't once it had been woken up (1 less slot right there).</div></div><hr />

Any 65 shaman casting Turgur's will overwrite another 65 Shaman's Turgur's, regardless of whether a focus item affect's the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is definately the message you get when debuff slots are full.  How many DOTs were being cast?  Each DOT by each person = one slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't know how many dots were being cast, but there were none being cast on mezzed mobs, obviously, and I got this when the mobs were mezzed as well as just after they'd been woken up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've had this happen to me before during xegony.  I'm pretty sure that what happens is that one of the nameds that has a disease AE dies, but just as he dies, he casts his disease based AE.  This causes the AE to be registered as coming from his corpse, rather than him.  Since his corpse is not on the same faction as the mobs around him are, they actually get hit by this AE.  That AE is a 55% slow, so it's probably more than turgurs is once you take into account slow mitigation (I'm guessing that mobs don't have to deal with slow mitigation).  Therefore, you get the &quot;cannot take hold&quot; message because there is a higher slow on him, even though you should be able to.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this is what happened becuase when it happened to us, the corpse AE'ed and awoke every mezzed mob around it, and afterwards I couldn't land slow on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just a wild guess here, but any of the other shamans have the VT shield with brilliance of ro? adds 20ish lvl to the caster of the spell or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I heard something about this when guilds first started doing elemental planes. If I understood correctly, either the mobs in those places are only slowable to a certain percentage regardless of which slow spell you use or each slow spell is limited in some way. If this is the case then there may actually be a slow (disease based perhaps) that is more effective than Turgur's in that zone or against that mob, .<br />
<br />
Or maybe I understood that wrong and I should just shut up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Or maybe I understood that wrong and I should just shut up.<br />
<br />
You understand it wrong :)<br />
<br />
When a mob mitigates slow, that slow is reduced by a certain percentage.  I'm not sure how much the exact mitigation is, but it is something like 75%, 50%, or 25% mitigated (for slightly, partial, and mostly landed slows, respectively).  Thus, a turgur's (75%) slow on a mob that partially mitigates will come out to 37.5% slowed.  Grummus (40%) on that mob will come out to 20% slowed.  So, basically, turgur's is always the best slow as long as magic lands.  If not, grummus is the best.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, I have seen a bug where spells just don't take hold for no appearant reason.  Today we were killing yard trash in pofire and I tried to slow some mobs, and was getting the &quot;spell does not take hold&quot; message.  Sometimes I also get a bug where any time I try to cast a spell I get the &quot;does not take hold message&quot; as soon as I click the gem.  I don't even cast the spell.  I found that I can fix this bug by either zoning or casting and tnarg's on myself.  It is very strange.<br />
<br />
Barring this bug, the only possible explanation is that all debuff slots were filled.  I have only had this happen a handful of times and it was always my dots that weren't taking hold (I slow way before other people start throwing mass debuffs on, usually), but on a big bad mob like xegony I can see it happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When mitigation was first implemented, it was bugged so that at times a lesser slow could be more effective. Now it should be working as intended, so the best slow will always be more effective.<br />

<br />
I wasn't bugged like that. Plus, this wasn't on Xegony herself, but on adds that are part of the event, and I don't believe they can have reached the maximum buff/debuff slot limit for reasons I've already explained (not enough time, and it didn't happen on any other wave).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've had this happen to me before during xegony.  I'm pretty sure that what happens is that one of the nameds that has a disease AE dies, but just as he dies, he casts his disease based AE.  This causes the AE to be registered as coming from his corpse, rather than him.  Since his corpse is not on the same faction as the mobs around him are, they actually get hit by this AE.  That AE is a 55% slow, so it's probably more than turgurs is once you take into account slow mitigation (I'm guessing that mobs don't have to deal with slow mitigation).  Therefore, you get the &quot;cannot take hold&quot; message because there is a higher slow on him, even though you should be able to.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this is what happened becuase when it happened to us, the corpse AE'ed and awoke every mezzed mob around it, and afterwards I couldn't land slow on them.<br />
<br />
Ooh ooh, that could well explain it. I remember one occasion (can't remember which set of mobs, but it could well have been this set) where the named threw out an AE just as it died and woke all the others up.<br />
<br />
The elementals did have the disease slow + DD AE, and 55% slow would likely be better than a mitigated Turgur's, provided that mitigation doesn't count with one mob casting on another.<br />
<br />
I will have to check my logs too, but this is definitely the most plausible explanation I've seen. I don't like not being able to explain why something happened, so thankyou!</div></div><hr />
