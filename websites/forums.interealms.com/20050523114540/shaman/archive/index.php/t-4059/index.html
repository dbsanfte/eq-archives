<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Gator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was considering getting the Rabid bear AA ability, but I was curious... what does it look like? Is it just like greater bear form, dependant upon race or is it something else entirely? Anyways, post some pics if you have any, I'm just curious to see if it's worth it visually :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, that includes me. When I was in plate-type armor, I proudly walked around as a barbarian. As soon as I got my fungi (and barbed legs, etc) I spend FAR more time in bear-form =P<br />
<br />
Anyone else think the chain look on barbs is horrible? Particularly the way it ruins the kilt (I HATE that!!!)<br />
<br />
Sorry, this wasn't meant to hijack your thread... don't mind me, I'm simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At least with chain vests,we can show are nipples</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">answer to your questions is yes, in rabid bear you look just like you do in greater bearform. althought I believe it's brown for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes, brown for every one :)<br />
rabid bear is very funny, i love having more than 1300 in attack (with cop) and double attack :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, Rabid bear appears to give the brown grizzly look for everyone, Greater bear form gives me the black bear look (iksar).<br />
<br />
I'd advise against getting it though unless you have a *VERY* good ratio weapon (I use a primal 2hb for RB) or have simply run out of other things to put axp in.<br />
<br />
I sort of regret getting it now when there are several more important things I could have put the axp into, but it is a huge giggle to use and it really does put out some good damage.<br />
<br />
Some facts/numbers!<br />
<br />
Its a 5 minute duration instant buff with a 2 hour reuse, it can also be dispelled =(<br />
<br />
RB overwrites both Spirit of Billy and avatar/primal avatar.  Its ok with regular sow/soe, cop, son, focus and voice of the beserker though.<br />
<br />
My record atk so far is 1472, I could get higher for certain with a necro in group though.<br />
<br />
The double attack rate is around 50% I find, obviously this varies a fair bit due to verants wonderous random number generator =)<br />
<br />
It also adds a disease based (I think) proc, small dd and fairly fast dot.<br />
<br />
My highest recorded dps so far was 46 in umbral plains against trash there, not amazing, but somewhat satisfying =)<br />
<br />
And my most amusing moment yet, accidently melee ksing a shroom that a friend was killing (60 war using epics), I doubt very much that I could consistently out damage the war, but it was pretty hilarious at the time =)<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Forgot to add, if your really vain about rabid bears look, use an illusion item/spell (old inkie mask or bear form), and then click the illusion off, rabid bear will stay but you'll look like your normal self.</div></div><hr />

I love my full suit of SS.. I've had many comments about it - seems that many 'uber' shaman still crave that blue look :)<br />
<br />
I do sometimes pull out the old brown bearform when in perma etc to prevent getting a hail of tells for buffs..<br />
<br />
I personally will be attempting to keep the blue look as long as possible.<br />
<br />
HoT: Been there; seen it; got the BP. hehe.</div></div><hr />
