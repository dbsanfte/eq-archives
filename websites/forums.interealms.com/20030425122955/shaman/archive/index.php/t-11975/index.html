<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shajaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering when you get to lvl 25 and can finaly do alchemy.  How much plat is involved in making Sow Potions.  I was hoping to raise my skill just enough to make Sow Potions,  get them to 10 doses and sell them. So's to make enough to make more potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your not going to make money making sow potions till your alchemy skill is closer to 70. you just fail too many times if the potion is just trivial.  an example - Ant's are just trivial to me - I can make 12 10shot sow potions with from 0 to 6 failures (120 combines) but I go about 50% failures on Ant's last time I tried.  Go ahead and make em to sell but the higher your alchemy skill the better your profit will be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't even start doing Alchemy till level 32. That way, you've saved a lot of plat by being high enough to train Alchemy to 20 with training points. At 25, the highest skill level you can have in Alchemy is 5, at 26 it's 10, 27 it's 15 and 28 it's 20. Now you're ready to start blowing money, but you will not get any skill raises and will fail probably between 50-60 percent of the time, so keep waiting. Save your plat until you get to lvl 32. Now go to town. At 32 you can raise your skill to 40, which is past the trivial for SoW potions, which is 37. You'll still fail about 35-40 percent of the time on average, depending on how kind the Random number Generator is feeling, so depending on how badly the market for potions on your server has gotten, you will probably still not be able to sell them for a profit yet. A lot of it has to do with how much you feel your time is worth. Mine is worth more than the time and wrist-strain of sitting around making potions for an hour to sell at maybe a 15-20 plat profit. (People in the Bazaar routinely auction 10 dose potions for 70-75pp on my server) Keep a few on you if you like though, you'll still get 90-100 plat selling them out in the field.</div></div><hr />

<br />
%success = (1.15 x skill) + 70 - trivial<br />
SOW trivial is 37<br />
MAX %success is 95<br />
<br />
You can work out the minimum skill to acheive the absolute highest success rate on SOW potions.<br />
<br />
Turns out, it is 54, which means that a level 35 shaman with max alchemy is as good as it gets for making money off SOWs.</div></div><hr />
