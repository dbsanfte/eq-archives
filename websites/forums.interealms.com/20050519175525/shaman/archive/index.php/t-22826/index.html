<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aurigabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't played a bard past level 10, but I believe that they continue to use low level songs all the way to 65, and that the effect scales up as they level. To a degree, some of our spells do the same i.e. Turgur's scales from 66% at level 51 to 75% at level 60, but that's not a big range. Why couldn't or didn't Verant just give us Turgur's at level 5 and say it scales from 10% at 5 to 75% at 60? Does it have something to do with adjusting mana costs perhaps?<br />
<br />
The effect (whether good or bad) is that the spell is arguably overpowered at the time it is first memmed and then severely underpowered when it is time to purchase the upgraded version several levels later. Take greater healing for example. Healing 300hp at level 29 is awesome - healing 300hp 21 levels later at level 50 is weak, to say the least. I am currently 54 and using sup healing which is adequate in conjuction with Turgur's. When I reach the magic level of 58, I will go from healing 583 to healing almost 2k, and the mana efficiency is nearly doubled as well? Does it really make sense to have those magic levels where a caster receives a spell that dramatically increases their playability and groupability, or would it be better to try to have a single spell that scales to the level of the player?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only low level bard song I use on a regular basis is Shauri's Sonorous Clouding(Invisibility).  Every other song, with the exception of Selo's Accelerating Chorus and Brusco's Bombastic Bellow, is 60+.  Sony stopped following the &quot;songs scale up&quot; ideology for bards long ago.</div></div><hr />

You have missed something that would have changed your experience:  Stoicism.<br />
<br />
You're right:  Gheal gets progressively weaker as you approach Sheal.  Stoicism is what bridges that gap.<br />
<br />
Frankly, even at your level, I'd strongly consider doing the Stoicism quest to help push you through to Kraggs, and then Torpor at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aurigabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Sudedor,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion. I actually do have stoicism and I love it for self heals and downtime heals. The snare/slow component makes it less than ideal for healing melees during combat (obviously), which is why I didn't include it in the heal comparison. It's really a different kind of heal, IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When my melee's complained I asked which they preferred:<br />
<br />
1 - Death.  Not usually a popular choice.<br />
<br />
2 - Significant downtime as I have to regain mana from all those emergency heals I keep dropping on them.  Usually this is only marginally more popular than death.<br />
<br />
That said, my role was usually as MH in the group.  If your role is different it may not be the same for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aurigabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Love that analysis, Sudedor. :p That certainly sums up the choices very succinctly for us mid level shamen. <br />
<br />
Option #3 that you didn't include is...<br />
<br />
3. Drop the shaman and get a cleric who has useful heals in that level range.<br />
<br />
I agree that the situation and group make up makes a huge difference. For example, if you are duoing with a melee, the slow/snare on stoicism is going to cut your dps by a huge amount. On the other hand if you are MH'ing for a full group with a knight tanking, stoicism works fine. The knights hold aggro via spells and the overall dps of the group only goes down a bit. If your full group has a warrior tanking then stoicism increases the chance of having aggro ping pong since the warrior relies on his weapons to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
I didn't really mean this to turn into a &quot;Mid level shaman heals suck&quot; thread. :) There are a ton of good things about playing our class in the mid levels including great soloability, excellent utility via slow/haste/buffs (buffs still desired in the mid levels), and pretty decent dps from dots and dog. Trying to MH tier 1 and LDoN content (pre 51) can be a bit of a challenge using the spells available to us, but a challenge is good, right? <br />

<br />
For real.  But think about it... as I've said before, 95 percent of all spells each rank are just statistical upgrade to old spells.  If they gave us spells that scaled up, there wouldn't be many spells, and we wouldn't have to (GASP) go through spell hell every additional rank.<br />
<br />
It would require them to rethink the way new spells are introduced.  It does kind of suck that very few spells actually have longevity and improve noticeably with levels.  Biggest ones that comes to my mind are Spirit of Wolf, increasing in percentage slowly from the day you get it, and, to a lesser extent, Turgur's starting out at 66 percent and capping at 75.</div></div><hr />

i would love it, but it would make all the pop turn in stuff obsolete. And sony likes timesinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Scaling spells would certainly be an improvement in every single aspect but one... the marketing aspect. Scaling spells would deprive SOE of a lot of potential carrots for every new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SoV didnt offer many real useful spells but still people bought it. SoV was the best expansion ever, i wish SoE would bring a new expansion with the same quality as SoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">not exactly the topic.. but i think it would be interesting to give some casters a chant or two like bards, that is kept up while you chant and drains your mana.. like an AE avatar, or AE rabid bear :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rangers hate Stoicism.<br />
As do rogues<br />
Snare make repositioning a pain<br />
They always chose downtime (though with that dps I could usually sit out a fight and dance and stoicism after a fight)<br />
<br />
Consequently when grouping with my friends I had to keep both up (the warrior didn't care and it was cheaper)  :mad:</div></div><hr />
