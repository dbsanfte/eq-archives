 <br />
Bearking and I (Leoclaw) have enjoyed ourselves each time we've come out to join you on raids. The two times we have joined you we have seen a zone we would not be able to otherwise.<br />
 <br />
We look forward to future exploration in the future as we get to know one another. Everyone has been very nice and warming to our presence.<br />
 <br />
Be safe and see you online.</div></div><hr />
