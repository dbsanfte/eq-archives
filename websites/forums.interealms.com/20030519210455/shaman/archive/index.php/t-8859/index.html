<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well here we are a few months and 2 expansions later. I think it is finally time to update my shaman soloing post. My post is not the definitive shammy soloing post…but nor is it meant to be…just a post to help those who have maybe never soloed and would like to (ie when you can’t find a group) or just want some quick xp. <br />
If soloing is done right it is some of the best xp aside from duoing or insane volume groups that you can get ingame (no mention of AE here!)<br />
Yes soloing can come at the cost of turning you into a social hermit and yes soloing can bore you to tears. However, there are times when soloing is viable…you need some quick xp…you don’t have time to dedicate to grouping etc…<br />
Comments are welcome! To any new players reading this, my shaman has been a hell of a lot of fun over the years..may you get the same enjoyment playing yours!<br />
<br />
PS. I am always available on The Rathe server to chat, my player name is Sshaila.<br />
<br />
LEVEL &amp; SOLOING TECHNIQUE GUIDE<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LEVELS 1-18 <br />
<br />
Basically you are a wanna be tank from levels 1-13, but that’s okay. You have enough tricks to make soloing very viable. You have sow to run away when the going gets tough. You can root mobs and back off to heal or use one of your lower level dots to do some basic root rotting, but more of that later. Once you hit level 14 things get better. You get Root and Spirit Strike (74dmg DD). These 2 new spells open up what is known as DD kiting. <br />
<br />
DD KITING <br />
<br />
Simply involves using Sow to outdistance a mob and then cast Spirit Strike to inflict damage in 75 chunk intervals. You can also root blast. Open the fight with Walking Sleep your 23% - 35% slow. Either way once you get the mob down to ~ 25% health you tank it to death. <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 19-23 (The Dark Levels) <br />
<br />
These are known as the dark levels for good reason...level 19 spells for the most part suck...sure you get a decent heal (80 health) and 1 mostly lame dot (affliction 126dmg over 2mins) but the others are nothing to write home about. <br />
This is the level when most people quit playing their Shaman or turn into group shamans exclusively, always unaware that just over the hill they turn into solo machines. So what is a shaman to do at lvl 19-23 if they do want to solo? Basically repeat the DD kiting method but work in more rooting and add the affliction spell to counter any mob regenerative ability. <br />
<br />
Some zones albeit Iksar centric…for great soloing through the dark levels include the following: <br />
<br />
Warslick Woods (Giant Fort) <br />
Lake of Ill Omen (I know..I know)<br />
East Karana <br />
Oasis <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 24-33 <br />
<br />
Congratulations...you have attained the level that gives you the spells that at later levels do much to define what you can do spellwise/manawise. Two great spells are given to you at this level. <br />
<br />
Regeneration (5hp per tick regeneration) <br />
Canibilize (20-28mana for 50HP) <br />
<br />
You have the ability, which nowhere near as powerful as it will one day be, to convert HP into Mana. You also get your first good DOT (Damage over Time) spell: <br />
<br />
Evenomed Breath (220dmg over 49 seconds) <br />
<br />
These 3 spells give you the ability to Root Rot <br />
<br />
ROOT ROTTING <br />
<br />
Root rotting allows you to kill most mobs that other classes wouldn't dare tackle. Cast Regenerate on yourself. Pull a mob with Walking Sleep to your fighting spot. Root the mob and then cast Envenomed Breath on it. Unlike Druid Dots our shammy ones all (exception of epic) have a DD component that has a nasty habit of breaking root. However the 1 nice thing to make up for this is that ALL SHAMMY DOTS STACK. Because your mob is slowed you will not take quite as much damage and besides raising defense is needed for later levels. While the mob is rotting you Cannibalize. After level 34 you will Canna Dance (more on that later). You should be able to get most of the mana back from casting Envenomed Breath without losing too much health. NEVER cannibalize below 3 bubs of health when soloing. You can root/rot the mob to death but I suggest you melee it at 25% health to work on your piercing and more importantly Defense skill. <br />
<br />
DD Kiting with your new DD spell is also very viable at this level. Either way you are doing more mobs than most fast paced groups with far less downtime. <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 34-38 <br />
<br />
This is the level where you get your first Pet. To most people the first and subsequent shammy pets are wimpy additions to the brawn of tanks mage/necro pets. DO NOT believe this...When used properly shaman pets are your most valuable asset during these critical levels...including the dreaded 35 hell (30 is nothing). Think of your pet as a permanent DOT to pester mobs and NOT as a tank because it isn't a tank not even close...What you are looking for is a way to maximize the life and return of you pet (cruel eh?). How to use the 600-800 hp and 10-25 dmg double attacks of this first pet to your advantage...Enter Pet Kiting... <br />
<br />
PET KITING <br />
<br />
You wanna fly through hell 35? You wanna get 39 within a few nights? Then pet kiting is the quickest way. Basically aggro management is the key to successful pet kiting...If you do more dmg to a mob than your pet then he gets forgotten and you are enemy #1 in the mobs' eyes. The best zone for Pet Kiting is GD and Kodiaks. You will be killing White and Yellows and getting 1/2 to 1 blue per kill. Blues are for sissys but when whites and yellows aren’t around go for it...  <br />
<br />
USE 3rd Person View. From default view Hit F9 3 times, 2 more brings you back to default. Learn to use this view by rotating mouse and moving while rotating. FPS shooter players will pick up on this quickly. <br />
<br />
Find a nice safe wall (NorthW of the dragon circle is great) and park your pet. ALWAYS have quickness and Sow on your pet as well as your HP buffs. TURN OFF YOUR PETS TAUNT.../pet taunt off. Park your pet in the camp spot and go find a Kodiak Bear (wanderers or cave #1-3). Aggro the Kodiak by getting into its face and pulling away from other kodies...Root the Kodiak in place and walk back. Cast Envenomed Breath and Scourge on the Kodiak and wait for root to break. <br />
<br />
You might need to reroot to apply both spells if it breaks after first. This is not much of a problem as any hits you take contribute to your defense skill. As soon as root breaks the Kodiak wants you dead and will stop at nothing to rip your heart from your chest. This is the time to run (particularly if its yellow) back to your camp spot. Once you get into your pets *master* range it will immediately attack the kodiak and nip at its heals...Keep running and once you are in your safe turf begin to Run large circles. <br />
<br />
Ya you may feel and look silly but when the mob in question is a white/yellow/red hell dawn the bobo clown face paint and wear it proudly. The Kodiak will continue to follow you while the Dots  and your pet are nibbling away at it. Once your pet does more than 1/2 dmg to the mob he will stop at begin to attack your pet but because your 2 dots are doing around 500dmg this doesn’t happen until the mob is at around 40% health. Use yer lvl 24 DD to get back its attention. <br />
<br />
The mob will resume chasing you and dying until it gets to the *flee* stage at which point you attack it. While you are kiting you will notice you often have to stop to let pet and mob get close again...this is just enough time to cannibalize once...when done strategically thoughout the fight you end with only about 1-2 bubs of mana lost at most. Most fights end with you down maybe 1/2 a bub of mana. I suggest every 3 or 4th fight tanking the mob just before *flee* stage to work on your defensive skill. <br />
<br />
Another great ability is: <br />
<br />
CANNA DANCING <br />
<br />
Information is sent to the Everquest servers every 6 seconds from client machines. This includes HP and Mana. If you watch your HP and Mana closely you will notice that they rise in intervals exactly every 6 seconds. It doesn't matter what you do during those 6 seconds...the program only checks on the 6th second to see wether you are sitting/medding or standing. If you are sitting you get mana if you are standing you don't. It is that simple. To canna dance you sit wait for a tick to occur and then stand up and cast cannibilize before quickly sitting to catch the next tick. This should become a ritual between mobs and greatly decreases your downtime. <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 39-48 <br />
<br />
In terms of spells these levels suck...you get some nice ones like: <br />
<br />
Chloroplast <br />
Venom of the Snake <br />
Blizzard Blast <br />
&quot;Tuna&quot; <br />
<br />
And the spell that will define your role from now on as &quot;slower first&quot; &quot;Buff person of ill repute 2nd&quot; <br />
.... Togor's Insects...Your first real good slow spell... <br />
<br />
Soloing..nothing new, Pet Kiting still works great...as does Root/Rotting with the addition of your new DOT Venom of the Snake. A new option opens up to you at these levels: <br />
<br />
PET TANKING <br />
<br />
Now that you have your first real slow spell you and your pet can choose to &quot;Tank Mobs&quot;. I would use this method split evenly with any of the above as it is the main method of raising your now critical defense skill. Pull a mob with slow. Root the mob. Cast 1-2 Dots. Send in your Pet. Join your pet. You did cast quicken on your pet and you right? Well you will be amazed at how quickly you and your pet can dispatch a slowed mob albeit with the help of a dot or 2... <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 49 <br />
<br />
Why only level 49 for this section? Because your ability to Root/Rot mobs has just increased 10 fold...2 spells: <br />
<br />
Envenomed Bolt (~1200dmg over 49seconds) <br />
Plague (~1200dmg over 1min 49seconds) <br />
<br />
You also get your first &quot;acceptable&quot; pet...he has over 1400hp and can double for 51dmg with a 3rd and 4th attack being bash/kick for 10-30 per tick. That is respectable dmg when coupled with your dots on a slowed mob. Again your pet IS NOT a tank...he is a mobile dot that can last a long long time for only your initial mana cast if you handle him properly. <br />
<br />
In my opinion root rotting is quicker but as a shaman you need to have defense maxed...I cannot emphasize this enough…DO NOT ROOT/ROT EXCLUSIVELY UNTIL YOUR DEFENSE IS AT 200!!!! <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 51 <br />
<br />
1 spell <br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects. The *best* slow in the game and THE spell that will define your primary role if you are the only shaman on raids. You now have the ability to turn most mobs into @#%$ cats for the slaughter. Once you hit 60 that slow will max out at 75%. Or put simply the mob will be attacking at 25% of its normal speed. <br />
<br />
In zones like the Great Divide you become a killing entity (warning extremely biased personal viewpoint!) unmatched by any other class. You might not be able to quadkite but double root/rotting becomes viable. Also your downtime is much less than that of a druid/wizzy who has to wait till all their mana is back before resuming quad #2. Becuase of spells like Canna 2/3 you will be up and ready for mob #s 2,3 and 4 before their next hopefully successful quad  <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LEVEL 60 <br />
<br />
This is the level where Shaman have no equal when it comes to soloing. No druid, necro or mage can ever hope to solo the mobs that a fully equipped and battle hardened level 60 shaman can. Several items and aaxp make soloing at 60 a blast. General rule even without much aaxp is: <br />
<br />
VISIT YOUR LOCAL MAGE FOR FOCUS ITEMS! <br />
<br />
Right off the bat you can cut your Torpor cast time down by a second (doesn’t seem like much but trust me it helps) and up your DDs dmg by several percent. <br />
<br />
Several higher end zones lend themselves to some fun soloing. IMO lvl 60 isn’t just about the aaxp or raids it is about pushing yourself as a class..as far as you can. <br />
<br />
One thing I love about level 60 is setting up little mini solo goals. IE how far down the Hole can I get? Or soloing in areas where people look at you funny like Umbral Plains. <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LEVEL 60-65<br />
Did I solo through any of these levels? Yep…was it dangerous and adrenaline packed…yep. PoP was tons of fun. My grouping and soloing times were approximately 60/40 in favour of grouping. Grouping with the right groups is excellent xp but again sometimes time or lack of groups just doesn’t leave much group time so soloing again becomes a wonderful fallback option.<br />
One thing PoP will really do is harden you…you will go back to old world content at lvl 65 and think my god..this once challenged me.<br />
<br />
PoN <br />
Treants, BloodRavens, Werewolves and Banshees are all viable root rottable mobs and give decent xp up to about level 63.<br />
<br />
PoD<br />
Goos, rats, crawlers, underbulks and flys are all great root rottable mobs. <br />
<br />
Depending on your gear, resists and spells the top of the castle is a blast to solo and a GREAT alternative if you do not yet have your pov/pos flag(although you should really work on getting it…more on that later)<br />
<br />
You will have 2 caster mobs at entry to castle, 2nd stairs and final entryway to top of castle for a total of 6 casters to get to a great soloing spot. I fought my way up but you could follow a guild up.<br />
If you fight your way up resists are very very important…put on fire, cold, magic, poison and disease self buffs as well as any resist gear you have. I highly recommend following a group up unless you are lvl 61, have at least 100+ resists unbuffed, have Tnargs mending (the perfect anti caster dd self heal) and lvl 61 pet. If you do not have these and want to prove me wrong…well you know what to do!<br />
<br />
Once up you take a right and follow it around to the far side of the castle. There are no mobs on this side and you can bind here IF you have an alternate means of getting out like a spiritstone! So get yourself a spiritstone and bind up here. All spiritstones allow you to get back to PoK within about 1min so consider this a VITAL piece of equipment to own.<br />
<br />
On the opposite side of the castle you will find 4 guardian of the crypts. They do not summon but hit extremely hard. My suggestion to split is to root pull. Then root rot your pull down. These are lvl 60 and give great xp. Gryme will occasionally be up but once he goes inside hall you can pull any of the 4 without agro. When Gryme is down you have an additional caster mob to kill inside. <br />
<br />
POV/POS FLAG<br />
<br />
Ok..PoN and PoD are nice and all but you probably noticed that population and finding a camp spot is problematic at best…so what are you waiting for? Get a good group and get your flag. <br />
<br />
Excuses?<br />
<br />
Pick up groups suck. <br />
<br />
Sometimes yes…other times no. There are enough people like yourself that can contribute well to a pickup group.<br />
<br />
I can’t get a group. Nobody loves me. <br />
<br />
You are right this is a game and they don’t love you. But why sit with LFG above your head and feel sorry for yourself? Message people and get other LFGs together…missing a couple spots? Ask some key classes from another group who is waiting to borrow them for your turn. There is no reason to not get a flag and there is no reason to not be successful.<br />
<br />
Get guildies who have already gotten flags to assist you. Don’t message them with a 2 hour wait. Message them when you are just about to go on deck.<br />
<br />
Methods?<br />
<br />
Several methods…<br />
<br />
AE Group<br />
1 chanter, 2 wizzies, 1 cleric and 2 extras<br />
<br />
DPS group<br />
1 slower, 1 cleric + Rest DPS<br />
<br />
There are also other trials available besides execution.<br />
<br />
PoV<br />
<br />
Root rotting is the option here. Mobs smack hard and pet (even knew pet) gets mulched solo. Great mobs to go after are Crystalline Golems and Crawlers in the Wasteland. <br />
<br />
Unless you have great gear and have close to 3k unbuffed I would recommend picking up a virtue by paying some nice cleric for his dot and time. Again, mobs here hit HARD and fast. A quick flurry, stun and you are eating sand. I pull with malo, run turn and slow. If you have Greater Immobolize I recommend using that as the –30resist stacks nicely with malo for –80 to resist on root and break check. At 64 and if you have it Petrifying Earth is much much better, I love this spell in fact.<br />
<br />
PoS<br />
<br />
Hurricane and Typhoon Loroks…nuff said!<br />
<br />
ACQUIRED FOCUS ITEMS<br />
<br />
I personally have only focus level 3 items. Focus Extended Affliction (Coldain Military Bracer), Focus Affliction Haste (Lcea’s Belt) and Focus Affliction Efficiency (Gem Encrusted Ring). There are tons of other items available each with their own emphasis (healing, buff enhancements, spell haste etc). I would suggest for soloing you acquire any of the 3 types of focus items…lvl 3 focus items are still good because even with Breath Of Ultor I still cast at least 2 lvl 60 and lower dots.<br />
<br />
POTIONS/ALCHEMY <br />
<br />
I have long given up on alchemy as a means to make money. Alchemy Rule #1… <br />
<br />
Forget about making money! <br />
<br />
Alchemy imo is all about extending your own personal abilities. Yes you can make DS potions for raids or if you really feel like it sell your sow potions. However, the person these potions benefit most is yourself. Once you learn to think of alchemy as an extension of your spell book (albeit a costly one!) Think of it..how many of you have paid 30K or more for your spells!? Exactly…so what’s a few kk for some potions? <br />
<br />
It all depends on what you are planning. For solo trips deep into the Hole I recommend the following arsenal: <br />
<br />
-Stinging wort potions (Hot-keyable instant click 300hp loving) <br />
-Undead’s Recourse (Like stinging wort but 150hp insta click) <br />
-Rejuvenation potions (only 2mins or so…but amazing regen that stack with all. Some classes (wink) can get over 100hp per tick with these…more than enough to handle most pesky mobs <br />
-Soluans Vigor (Like lesser rejuvenation) <br />
-Kilva’s Potions (DS potions again very useful for certain scenarios…be prepared!) <br />
<br />
HORSES<br />
<br />
Horse with Models enabled<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
<br />
Max speed is horse speed (if horse speed is faster than you thats how fast you go)<br />
No aggro from spell swapping<br />
Meditation mana regen while turning or standing and casting<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
<br />
Max speed is horse speed (if horse speed is slower than you thats how slow you go)<br />
No sitting regen rate<br />
No interrupting of spells via &quot;duck&quot;<br />
No Meditation mana regen while moving or attacking with auto-attack<br />
Slow ass startup and slowdown<br />
<br />
Horse with Models disabled<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
<br />
Meditation mana regen while turning or standing and casting (You will not see your mana go up until you cast a spell)<br />
Interruption of spells via &quot;duck&quot;<br />
Max speed is your maximum speed not horses (ie if you have sow that is how fast you go)<br />
No slow ass startup and slowdown<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
<br />
No Meditation mana regen while moving or attacking with auto-attack<br />
No sitting regen rate<br />
Max speed is your maximum speed not horses (ie if you have sow that is how fast you go)<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
With models turned off you can duck to interrupt spells and still get meditation bonus but you lose out if your horse is a faster than sow horse.<br />
<br />
With models turned on you cannot duck to interrupt spells but if your horse is faster than sow you get that benefit.<br />
<br />
Recommendation<br />
<br />
If you want the horse for meditation bonus primarily (ie casters) then get the cheapest horse you can buy and turn off graphics.<br />
<br />
If you want the horse for fast movement then buy the fastest horse money can buy and keep models on.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY <br />
<br />
I didn’t post much on Luclin because I can’t stand the place. Ssrae temple and Umbral Plains are all doable solo at level 60 but other than raids in ssrae and akheva I hate the place.<br />
<br />
Since Nixx on the Test Server first soloed melee only summoning dragon in WW many other shaman have gone on to do this same feat. <br />
<br />
The basic rule...if we can root and/or slow it...its dead. <br />
<br />
Nuff said <br />
<br />
That is it for now...updates pending as I think of things I have forgotten...of which I am sure there is lots. Have any solo tips or adventures of your own? Please post them as I look forward to reading them!</div></div><hr />
