<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, here is what I have:  My guild is attemting Rathe for the #3 time.  First was just exploritory, feeling it out..got 5 mezzables locked down, had a wipe and it was late so we stopped.  <br />
<br />
Second:  got to TM #11 and wiped due to slow wearing off and the horrible resists and not getting it on #11 before it wore off.  So the mezzables arnt the prob, its keeping the TMs slowed that is.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  going with 3 sham, what set up would you suggest for us taking care of the 6 TM mobs and keeping them slowed, clerics cured and everything else.<br />
<br />
Copy and pasted from my post on my home board, this is what I came up with...but I would like some feedback from shaman who have done it, and if this sounds like a good plan.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After experiencing the encounter to the near end, I have come up with a suggestion or 2.<br />
<br />
FIRST: what seemed to work; Mezzing then debuffing the 6 mezzables (very nicely done btw). <br />
<br />
Dodging the AE. More people need to move though (save for the ENC and the rot healers and tank) A lot of DPS were still in AE range when it was called...makes for hectic trying to cure people...lots of confusion. People need to move more (but over all not bad)<br />
<br />
SUGGESTIONS:<br />
<br />
First: After all 6 mezzables were locked down, trying to get back to keep them slowed became a giant pain in the ass to run back, slow them all and then get back for the next pull. The solution that I found was have the Kick ass enchanters slow their own mobs once we started on the TM mobs. (BTW...very aweseom job enchanters.../bow)<br />
<br />
Second: Having 3 full sham on the raid would have been ok IF we had a better plan of attack from the beginning. These mobs are HIGHLY resistant and with out the tash from the chanters, its even harder to land anything (including malosinia after malos has landed), getting SINIA ON IS IMPARITAVE!!! It also needs to STAY ON THE MOBS just like slow. SO here is a little solution that I think might work (this is from the TMs on):<br />
<br />
This is for a 3 sham encounter btw:<br />
<br />
Till the first 3 TM are locked down, the sham are doing pretty much their usual sham thing. But also keeping the TMs slowed while waiting for INC.<br />
<br />
After #3 TM is locked this is how my suggestion works:<br />
<br />
Sham #1: Keep TM 1-3 Malos(inia) and slowed once locked down, that is your primary duty..and curing clerics as needed.<br />
<br />
Sham#2: Keep 4-5 malos(inia) and slowed, help with #3 and cureing when needed. (so TM #3 will have 2 sham on it just to be safe and make double sure both sham have enough time to keep their TM slowed with out having to worry...'@#%$ my TM 2 is resisting everything...I dont have time to get to #3TM before slow wears off')<br />
<br />
Sham#3: Take 6th TM, then help as needed with cures and slows on other TM mobs, and the general raid as well. Having 1 sham on the 6th TM INC will add an extra few secs of un slowed...if that is a prob then sham #2 can probably slow like ususal. That would mean though that #2's TMs slow might wear off. <br />
<br />
From my experience till we had #11 locked down, keeping all the TMs slowed wasnt bad. Resists made it hard, but untill that 11th TM, slow never wore off even with resists, clerics stayed cured for the most part and everything was ok. Doing that way though is high risk, and not recommended again. <br />
<br />
IN A NUT SHELL:<br />
<br />
Sham#1: Keep TM 1-3 Malos(inia) and slowed while curing<br />
<br />
Sham#2: Keep TM 2-5 Malos(inia) and slowed, while curing and helping to keep TM3 slowed as well.<br />
<br />
Sham#3: Alone on INC 6 with the malos and slow (mages will sinia like usual), while curing and helping with other TM slows should it become neccesary.<br />
<br />
That covers all TM with slow, and clerics with cures. <br />
<br />
I have also found a way to run and dodge the AE while slowing the TM mobs. Keep the TM on the water edge (as close as is safe) and run as close to the temple thing as is safe. This will keep the sham from getting AEd while running and slowing between mobs. With extended range I never found it truly necessary to get in AE range to slow (or I was just lucky and dodged it a lot). I did experiment with seeing if being close to the TM was helpful in landing anything (in my vain attempts to reduce the resist of slow)...it didnt do squat, so I stayed away from the AE as much as possible. <br />
<br />
If you can understand what I said, this seems like a sham plan that will probably work. if you have any suggestions to add, or anything to point out...please do so. I hope that I made it clear enough  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Any help, suggestions, revisions...anything will be of great help, we are planning on attempting here again very soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have a surprisingly high number of shamans in my guild, and we happened to have 6 on for our first rathe kill.<br />
<br />
make 6 offtanking groups, each with 1 cleric, 1 shaman, 1 druid (if you can spare it, otherwise just put druids in the earlier groups if you don't have as many)...  As a shaman your job is to keep quies or trushar on the tank at all times, and cure the AE from everyone. if you have 3 priests in your group you can just do a radiant cure rotation which works nicely.<br />
<br />
Druids should be doing hand of ro, as the -atk should help a bunch in addition to the SoW.<br />
<br />
if you have someone who can box an enchanter solely for running around and doing tash, that makes all the difference in the world.<br />
<br />
Another guild on my server gets to locking down 11, then killing the 5 offtank mobs and charging the 6th nonmezzable, THEN killing the 6 mezzed. We just pulled and chipped down the 6th then killed all 6 at once.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The first few times we did the Rathe we were shaman light. Use your beastlords for slows and your paladins for healing/curing if you have to. It leaves room for mistakes. It also alows you to move around more and cover Sinia on the enchanter mobs as well as slows. Paladins and druids can help cure those tanks that get the aoe. Don't feel bad sending them somewhere else. <br />
<br />
I would tell you how we do it, but there are 11 shaman in my guild and we run 7 or so nightly. Good luck and let us know how you do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The biggest thing for the Rathe is communication.  Dividing up the work load as you posted is essentially how we did the Rathe so long ago.  Turgurs and Malosinia both have a long enough duration where it is possible to do this with 2 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Basically we would pull in the 6 mezzable mobs and get them all locked down.  Then it was knocking them down to 1% then mezzing them again one at a time.  Those groups without curers would stay out of AE range while this was done.  Tipically one Shaman would be assigned to keep all 6 of these mobs slowed and Malosiniaed (unless a Mage was there to do that part).<br />
<br />
The remaining Shaman would be divided amongst the TM groups.  Most of the time we would have 1 Shaman for every 2 TM groups.  But we always had one Shaman go with the knockdown crew for initial debuffing and slowing.<br />
<br />
-G</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our last Rathe kill was a speed kill. It took around 4 hours instead of 8 like last time. We were short on enchanters so we had bards help with the mezzing and a pally with divine stun to push the mezzables into the AE of the bard.<br />
<br />
The tank mez groups were supported by one or two shamans running like idiots to keep em slowed. Ofcourse, they had TA's wich help tremendously.<br />
<br />
I never got a cure from a shaman. We had clerics doing that for us.<br />
<br />
What it boils down to is traning, discipline and endurance.<br />
<br />
Btw, I hate this encounter d with a passion. It is a great encounter when it comes to testing your guilds endurance, but its a major pain in the ass nevertheless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">3 Shaman is kind of light for doing Rathe.<br />
<br />
When my guild does Rathe:<br />
-we have 1 shaman or mage staying with the 6 mezzables for malosinia and slow (or the enchanters just keep their own mob slowed).<br />
-we have 1 shaman in pull group (that's usually me) who is the main puller<br />
-we have 1 shaman in each CC group of the first 4 CC groups.<br />
<br />
The 11th mob is only CCed long enough to get the 12th mob debuffed.  You don't need to devote a shaman to that mob.<br />
You could use a single shaman to debuff 2 of the CCs.<br />
2 shaman on CC, 1 in pull is absolute bare minimum I'd say you can afford to do.<br />
4 shaman on CC, 1 in pull, and 1 at mezzables is how we almost always do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As you do this encounter more, you'll find quickly that getting the first 6 mezzable is going to be very easy.<br />
The hard part is keeping your attention span going for the entire encounter without making mistakes.<br />
If they made this encounter 5 mezzable and 5 non mezzable, it would be very much easier and almost enjoyable to do.<br />
As it is, it's about a 5 hour raid including cohs.<br />
Cutting out 2 of the mobs, would probably cut a full hour at least off the kill time.<br />
<br />
And really, if you guys can get 11 mobs CCed, you guys can do all 12 without additional help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman rathe pulling is bad ass btw.  Show them monks up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">see, your suggestions and help are great, but on a good night we can muster up 4 shaman.<br />
<br />
We had a mage stay with the mezzables.  On our first try that we actually got far (real try not just exploring with 40ppl).  I was the slowing shaman for all the TMs because 1 sham was boxing a cleric, 1 sham was doing something else and 1 sham was with the raid...so that left me.  Running my ass around keeping all 5 TMs we had slowed.  I did good till TM 11 resisted me something like...8 times or so.  Slow wore off at the bottom of a heal for the TM, it ate the TM then me before I could say /rs NO MORE SLOW ON 11!.  Which then prompltly ate the raid.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out what to do with only 3 sham because that is about what we can garrantee as opposed to 4 sham (one an app to the guild who si gone for work).<br />
<br />
Some of the people in my guild thought that having 1 sham for 2 TM would be good, I do too.  I think I might revise my plan to have 1 sham for 2 TM rather than 1:2.5 for the first 11 and 1:1 for the last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no shaman with the CC team in the cave, let the enchanters keep mobs slow, they need the aggro anyways, since mez can somtimes blur a mob and make them regen up quick, and let the mage there malosinia<br />
<br />
3 shaman is simple, keep 1 on camps 1 and 2, 1 on camps 3 and 4, one on 5 and then you're all back to having 3 for 6-12</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">see, your suggestions and help are great, but on a good night we can muster up 4 shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let Beastlords help with slowing.<br />
<br />
I didn't see anyone share my guild's favorite Rathe trick - the rusty dagger.<br />
<br />
While the 6 mezzed are locked down, the enchanters constantly stab the mobs with rusty daggers. The mobs require magic to be hit, so the rusty daggers don't break mez - they just keep the mobs from regenning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rusty dagger is good stuff.  We originally just had our ench's do hand to hand....then some upity mage summoned a mod rod, and well....we kinda had to start over  :p .<br />
<br />
Most shaman we've ever had on a rathe was 3 or 4.  Usually 3 sometimes 2.  The mez mobs only need fresh debuffs every 7 so between that, the re-debuff shaman can roam around and hit the melee cc ones too while the other shaman pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We did the rathe with only three shaman and once with two shaman.  We had one shaman back in the cave with the enchanters and bards keeping the mezzed ones debuffed.  <br />
<br />
Really if you have three shaman just split the mobs up two per person or even three per person.  The last one you don't really need to worry about all that much.  It dies fast so you really only have to worry about the other 5.  <br />
<br />
Spacing and positioning will be a factor to the your strategy.  I don't know where you space your TM mobs at, but it will be a factor on ease of range. <br />
<br />
My suggestions on doing it....<br />
<br />
1st is avoid the AE it only sucks your mana down.  Slow using lev out on the water or even across the water.  Use Radiant Cure and Remove Curse for cures.  Do not use Remove Greater Curse its more mana cosumption.  <br />
<br />
Regarding remove curse.  Most priest classes can get it.  Make sure all your clerics, druids, paladins, and shaman have it.  That is four classes that can use it.  Most will be healing, but they can cure themselves if they must.<br />
<br />
Have your shaman with the largest mana pool take the mobs that are tank mezzed first.  Have them keep malos and turgurs on the mob.  The new GoD slow is a great addition to fast slowing if you have it. <br />
<br />
If you can, get full tributes for mana consumption and stay on a horse it helps with mana regen.  If you are grouped with a cleric or druid have them set up a radiant cure rotation. <br />
<br />
Other than that its pretty much up to the tanks not to die. Have necros feeding the clerics and help spot heal the tanks. <br />
<br />
It wasn't a problem for us doing it with three shaman, but it depends on your strat.  We killed the last two tank mezzed mobs within seconds of each other. <br />
<br />
On incoming have one shaman Malos and one slow from across the water with extended range you can do this successfully.  Reason I say from across the water is because it generally saves you from dying.  Will slow the mob down.  Only do this if you have a knight catching the mobs on inc.  Slow right after they get aggro. <br />
<br />
The only other problem after that is timing your kills on the mezzed mobs so you don't get hit with the AE's. <br />
<br />
Good Luck...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">3 Shamans is all you need.<br />
<br />
- 1 back with the Enchanters in the cave.<br />
- 1 with the pull team getting the new mobs slowed.<br />
- 1 with a timer making sure slow is always up on all the tank mezed mobs.<br />
<br />
For the tank mezed mobs, you really want the best slow possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lohknar is correct.  Frankly, you can do it with 2 shaman.  I'd hate to try to do it solo, but I bet I could.<br />
<br />
Our guild has done it in about 2 hours, not including the time to actually get there.  I think our whole time in zone was about 3.5 hours.<br />
<br />
The biggest trick is learning the pulling.  We had it down to a fine art by the last time we did rathe.  There are ways to cheat a bit and minimize the number of people.<br />
<br />
It's a boring job, but if you can manage 3 shaman, assign 1 to the cave to handle all the mezzables.  Time malos and slows and also for cures and heals as needed.  A botted cleric is also good for heals there.  Other than that, just leave a bard and the chanters.<br />
<br />
One more shaman for the pull team, and the third shaman to time and handle all the melee rathe.<br />
<br />
This even is very very doable with 3 shaman.  If your puller shaman is very good, you can do it with 2.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mcwilliam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">With my guild we have had 3-4 shaman every time we do rathe.  We keep one back with the mezzable mobs and all they do is keep them with malosina and tugurs.  Than one sticks to the first 3 or 4 offtank mobs.  we use 1 druid and 1 cleric to keep up the offtanks so shaman only slow's and malo's.  Than third shaman keeps up with the pulls and keeps an eye on the 4th and 5th offtank mobs.  If you pull fast enough it should be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I pull Rathe with a mage and a ranger, from the time we start to the time the last one is ded our best was 22 min can chain pull that sucker the faster mobs are in camp the less time for screw ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">chut and lohk, We kinda did your suggestions on our first (and only) REAL attempt.  we had 4 sham, 1 was boxing a cleric, so the shaman was there for the very basic back up, another was busy with 1&amp;2 TM mobs I was running around getting 3 of them slowed and helping with cures and heals and the 4th was with the raid.  Something went VERY wrong;<br />
On TM 11 I was trying to slow, i malos I malosinsia, sina gets resisted....i attempt in vain to slow....slow gets resisted, rinse and repeat a few more times (well more than a few), slow wears off at the bottom of a heal and the TM dies then the RC eats me and then the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
We also had the chanters slowing their own mobs so in the cave we had; chanters, 1 mage, 1 bard (i think that is all)<br />
<br />
It seems like a good idea is 1 sham to 2 TM and have the beast help slow on the last 2 inc so they get slowed asap.<br />
<br />
I also saw a few ppl mention shaman pulling...how does that work?  Sounds cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I also saw a few ppl mention shaman pulling...how does that work?  Sounds cool.<br />
<br />
well generaly works best with a snare class like a ranger and a mage for COH to clear agro, i target the mob i want to pull  cast malos and get a COH then the ranger will cast snare pull it off the temple and get a COH at that time all the mobs walk back how ever the snared one dose not and there ya get your self a single mob, at that time i agro the single mob sini it slow it cripple and bring it close to camp get a COH to clear agro and have a monk pick to bring to camp. and as the riad is killing that one we set up another one to pic, if things go well and we dont get any snare reists only takes about 60 sec to line up the next guy rdy for the raid, the faster the mobs are brought in locked down and new mob in camp the less trubble you have and less things that can be messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">anyone mind if I copy and paste the good ideas you all have here on my guild board?<br />
<br />
I would also like to thank you guys for helping and offering good advice...I hope to see AoE at my feet soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was running around getting 3 of them slowed and helping with cures and heals and the 4th was with the raid.  Something went VERY wrong<br />
<br />
When I do Rathe, I tell people right off the bat that I'm going to be too busy slowing to help cure or patch heal.  Slowing all the unmezzable tank mezed mobs is a lot of work especially when you have 6 going.  Because of things like resists, and having to use a slow timer.  Tell those druids and pallies to cure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh...amen Lokh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Problem with the rathe is what we noticed is that Rathe Councilman randomly drop buffs/debuffs on them. It was ridiculous that every single time we pulled 2, a mez mob in the cave woke up. Somehow the mob was dropping a mez that was casted barely 5 seconds ago. Slow was also wearing off MUCH faster than 6 minutes (without a Turgur's has worn off message) and we'd lose LD tanks suddenly...<br />
<br />
Mages were assigned to keep all the mobs sinia'ed, which reduces our workload a bit.<br />
<br />
First win we had 3 shaman. One stayed at the raid (for buffs and such), one of us slowed melee LD 1-3, and one of us slowed melee LD 3-5. We just did it continuously, no breaks. Slowed it every 45 seconds or so. Very tiring =/ But it worked.<br />
<br />
Second run we had 5 shaman online with a box. Much easier and quicker. Box stayed with raid to buff, the rest of us kept on our LD group and could patch heal/cure as well as slow. Things went a lot smoother.<br />
<br />
Make the other classes do more if you have less shaman, and then slow the mez lockdown mobs later...if they're getting loose, they're gonna beat you down regardless of slow or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The biggest problem with rathe is their ability to randomly remove a debuff for no reason at all.  if that randomness chooses the mezz, you can be stuffed.  You have to assume that the 6 mezzables will be held in the cave ok.  <br />
<br />
Cave Mobs:<br />
We use chanters, 1 bard and 1 shaman.  The shaman's job is sinia, cripple and slow.  Reason is that when a mezz wears off on a councilman it will kill it's mezzing chanter and then it moves on to kill the shaman who should have massive aggro from cripple and slow.  In the time it takes for the mob to do this another chanter should be able to pick it up and kill it.  You could replace the shaman with a Mage (for sinia) and an mad aggro generating class, like a ranger (snare!) or paladin<br />
Shaman Timing for Debuffs:  Our main debuff Turgors lasts 6 mins, to debuff 6 mobs with malosinia, slow and cripple takes a little under 3 mins, assuming that you get some resists.  So after debuffing all 6 pop CanniV, when canniV repops you should start re-debuffing all mobs<br />
<br />
<br />
The Tank Mezz Mobs:  <br />
Pull, debuff, position and Tank Mezz 4 of the reamining 6 mobs, have 1 shaman per 2 mobs ideally.  You could realistically manage this with 1 shaman on all 4 - use the same Shaman TIming as described above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pull TM 5 and start to reduce it's hit points.  When it gets down to 10% give the order to kill all of the TM mobs.  Kill the 5 TM mobs you are currently engaging.  Pull, debuff and kill the last mob as soon as you have TM5 dead, let the people from TM1-4 join in when they can as they kill their mobs.  <br />
<br />
Run back into the cave and kill the remaining 6 mezzed mobs 1 at a time.  <br />
<br />
Have a bard kite the avatar around while you rezz and rebuff (5 mins max).  Then kill the avatar, hail and loot.  Avatar is about as tough as a countilmember</div></div><hr />

The way we do it is:<br />
get 1-6 mezzed<br />
get 7-10 CCed<br />
get 11 pulled and debuffed and being beat down<br />
while 11 is being beat down, debuff #12 and kite it until #11 is at about 10% health.<br />
Kill 7-11 at the same time, and have everyone regroup to kill #12 asap.<br />
After 7-12 are dead, you can figure out how to kill 1-6 in a timely manner.<br />
<br />
You have no need whatsoever to kite the final avatar.<br />
We've managed to have #1 gate instead of dying to a volley of nukes, and nearly wiped due to the summoning of people and killing them, and then us having to zerg it down from about 30% health and have the avatar pop on us.<br />
You have at least about 10 or 15 mins to kill the final avatar before he'll despawn (I've never seen him despawn ever).</div></div><hr />
