Ok, I'm splitting this thread so as to not crap on Samins theft thread, but the question merits discussion.<br />
To quote Locz.<br />
I am suprised this has not disturbed anyone else but me. I am bothered that several more guns have just entered the underground criminal economy, to be used for criminal and nefarious purposes. If Samin had never owned these guns, the criminals would not have these additional guns, and whatever future heinous crimes may (or will) be committed with these guns may not have otherwise occured. Sadly, I do feel that the originator of these guns do bear some degree of responsibility for their future misuse by the criminal underground.  <br />
I'm not sure I agree with it, but it's an interesting idea.  If Samin wants to fill us in with the specific facts of the incident, fine, but I honestly want to see what people think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly, I think you should heed what Tel said about &quot;not right now&quot; in the original thread.  This is a little too soon to start jawing back and forth about this issue.  A nice grace period would be very considerate.</div></div><hr />
