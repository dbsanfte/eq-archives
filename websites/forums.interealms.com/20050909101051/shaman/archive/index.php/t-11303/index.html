I like it when people try to make fun of other people's misconceptions, and then it backfires on them!<br />
<br />
There is exp bonus for grouping, it was added about 2 years ago... you can find the details here...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There supposedly is an increasing amount of bonus for exp based on number of group members.  That was in a patch not to long ago (year?).<br />

I've noticed that SoW appears to be slower in some zones.  In most of the old world zones SoW seems really fast.  In Kunark it seems about the same.  But running through some of the Velious zones seems slower, as do some of the Luclin zones.  I know it isn't, but it seems that way.  :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the chuckle Krak - they're few and far between on this board lately! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The scale of the graphics (and /loc too I believe) is inconsistent from zone to zone, so your running speed is going to seem different. But SoW is still going to be the same percent faster than without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your processor is lagging that too can slow you down.  A few times when my system was harshing on the graphics, people with sow passed me and i had sow too, post 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, (true story btw) using 2 EQWs on same computer..<br />
<br />
If i hit autorun on both, the one with the active window will run faster... And if i use the /follow mode, i have to set autorun on the person infront, and have the behind character active... else he outruns the other char :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have also noticed that when running very high with levitate, the character on the slower-CPU computer will drop faster.<br />
<br />
Big races also drop faster, but this difference is enough that when my Barb shaman is on the fast computer and my wife's human warrior is on the slow computer, she drops faster than me.</div></div><hr />
