<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, I am looking for some interesting places hunt with my 61shammy/55 monk combo. I'm not too interested in exp, maybe novelty places with slight chance of good loot. My shammy has torpor, but no malo. I was thinking I can probably do icewell keep(not the dorfs), I remember doing raids with my old guild now at 61 I could probably slow without too much trouble. What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I soloed in KD arena at level 62 / 63, just to see what it was like. I don't have particularly good gear, and my spell book is full of holes, but it was soloable. However, in terms of risk versus reward, it is just not worth the effort. The drops are so rare, and Velious standard quest armor is no longer &quot;uber&quot; - so much good gear out there now that you will struggle to sell MQs</div></div><hr />

 Go to Acrlyia Caverns and get to Inner AC, will be good exp for the monk also decent loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 65 with OK gear and over 100 AAs I soloed 8 spawns on KD Arena right.  It was actually fun, but trivial.  I did it just to see how much I could do.  The rampaging mobs, high resists, summoning and decent HP base of the targets made it a lot of work for very poor loot.  I made more pp off of a single HG kill in RM at lvl 39 than I did in the 2 hours I was pissing around there.</div></div><hr />
