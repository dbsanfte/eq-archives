<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Recurve Wormwood Bow, as far as math goes, would be about 4.9 % higher DPS (This is comparing their Dmg/Delay as normal meele weapons)<br />
<br />
Thing is bows unlike meele weapons dont have min hits, and speed doesn't make nearly as much of an impact on their damage.<br />
<br />
Relv said that at level 65 a Ranger with Primal Bow, 100% haste running, Endless Quiver, and 11 Damage Arrows would be doing about 175 DPS to standard exp mobs due to low Ac.<br />
<br />
In Comparison to Primal Bow the 2 above mentioned would then be merited to yield<br />
<br />
12% higher DPS for Elven Bow of Mystics <br />
-195 DPS (approx, playing with this by hand on paper)<br />
17% higher DPS for Wormwood<br />
-205 DPS (approx)<br />
<br />
So, does anyone still think Rangers are getting the short stick of the deal as far as Archery goes? Think about it, if this is damage yielded by a hybrid, it has to be extremely situational, and useable with the total co-operation of your raid mates.<br />
<br />
Edit: I still agree that our Meele AA are out of whack and need improvement.<br />
<br />
Now Sean, from depth of your heart, how difficult are these bows to obtain in comparison to Rogue weapons such as bloodbath?<br />
And what is the chance that we will see much better ones as we dig deeper into POP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're not that hard, if you can High Priest in Ssra you can definately kill the guy who drops the Wormwood. Mujaki? I think his name is.<br />
<br />
As for the Dragon in Halls of Honor A who drops the bow... I don't know, personally I didn't think he was that hard either, but it does take a good sized force.<br />
<br />
As for better ones? Off Tallon Zek someone got a 40/37 bow, Ranger only... and it has a 125 cold DD with a -125 resist adjust. And really... this is just the start of things to come imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This bow is 40/38, or 55/38 with champion arrows, so the ratio is 1.45.  Not *quite* as good as a VT bow if the elemental damage is getting through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i suppose the question i was really asking is how does the archery mod (3% if i remember correct) affect these ratios. Is there something you can do to these ratios to reflect the fact that there is a mod on the weapon. How much benefit does the 3% make, if it isnt that great then it maybe better to just go for a straight out damaging ratio bow like this new one.<br />
<br />
e.g. shadows = 38/35 raw ratio but 41/35 if you take the archery mod into account.<br />

i dont know :( <br />

I notice a significant difference in archery hits on the Crystalline (sp) Golems, spiders and crawlers in PoV when I don't have the proc up.  If you don't have a pocket Shaman to cast avatar on you the loss in atk (100+) generally might make it that the primal bow still outdamages this bow regardless of the difference in ratio.</div></div><hr />

 It doesn't seem to me that your new toy is really any better then a bow of storms. Bow of storms has a tad less damage but ALSO less delay along with superior other stats. <br />
<br />
The tallon bow seems to me it should be pretty much on par with the bow of storms.. maybe a tad better.<br />

I honestly, don't see myself replacing my bow of storms with either of those bows. In fact, I still use primal alot and swap in storm when it procs.</div></div><hr />

actualy I wouldn't bug  or feedback it, that proc not actualy working is a good thing, that's the same proc as dain's axe, and from what war's, pallies, and SK's in my guild have said that proc is extreamly high argo, they pull argo off our our two normal MT's, one who uses a SoD, other has a willsapper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
e.g. shadows = 38/35 raw ratio but 41/35 if you take the archery mod into account. <br />
<br />
I think you are getting skill mods and bane damage mixed up.<br />
<br />
If a bow has a +3% archery mod on it, that effects your archery skill value.  So if you are 200 in archery, you are effectively 206.  This number is used in damage calculation / chance-to-hit rolls.<br />
<br />
If a bow has +3 Cold Damage, that value is actually computed in the damage calculations.  So if something is a 15/20 weapon with +3 cold, the weapon is (optimally) 18/20.  <br />
<br />
Elemental Bane damage (i.e. cold, fire) is subject to resist checks.  Target bane damage (i.e. Extrapalar, Greater Ahkevan) is not.</div></div><hr />
