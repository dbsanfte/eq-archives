<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know of any issues that a UI might cause random LinkDeath?<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, my troubleshooting techniques have pointed at my patched together UI as a culprit for random LD issues.   On a windows xp by the way.  I just wanted to know if this was even possible. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SOE does not test effect of UI code changes on UI mods. Thus, the employment of UI mods often causes crashes, especially after patches. Linkdead status usually arises from a communications error or a program error. So, I would say you are probebly correct in your troubleshooting analysis. Try /loadskin default and see if that affects your linkdead problem. In addition, you may need to delete and reload the default UI if you have directly tinkered in the default directory, which is a real mistake when it is so easy to copy default into another UI directory, and modify the files in that directory. If loading the game at all is a problem on the character using the modified UI, rename UI_charname_servername to OLD_UI_charname_servername, and EQ will make a new one for you. <br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
