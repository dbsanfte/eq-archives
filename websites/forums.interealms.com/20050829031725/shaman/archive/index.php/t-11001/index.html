That right there is what is stoping you from progressing in spec:alt.<br />
<br />
Until you put at least 1 point into all specs, you can't go over 50.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Speaking of Specialization, I once had a cleric friend that forgot to train in it until post 50.  Someone was playing his account when they realized this and used up a few training points into each one.  He managed to get them all above 50, crashing the zone.  They weren't very happy with that, but it was an honest mistake on his behalf :p</div></div><hr />
