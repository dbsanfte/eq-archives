<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kruzk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are a shaman then the only place to be leveling is in Kurn's Tower.  Get a group or solo but you can hunt here ...right at the entrance killing entrance spawns for 10-14 and group for 15.  it has a 20% exp mod!  You would not believe the exp you get.<br />
<br />
Yes thats right even if you are a kitty get your tail over to Kurn's Tower in Field of Bone.  There is a book in FoB far from the guards.  And as long as you are careful to stay out of the pit and off any paths you see you will avoid being jumpped by guards and by mobs.<br />
<br />
It blew me away just how fast exp came.  Absolutely amazing.<br />
<br />
Of course after that head on over to Paludal Caverns to continue the raging experience!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kurns is the second best exp at that level.  I have leveled players both there and Padual and padual is about twices as fast as kurns.  Kurns has the appeal of not being over crowded.<br />
<br />
Also if you are an sk / necro or even if you need money bone chips sell for around 1pp in the bazaar and you can get bags and bags of them there.</div></div><hr />

Actually, in my opinion Kurns is greater because I can kill more in Kurns than in Paludal. Although, when I get to level 16 and get cure disease(playing my necromancer atm) I'm gonna go to paludal and own some fiends until 20 or so. =)</div></div><hr />
