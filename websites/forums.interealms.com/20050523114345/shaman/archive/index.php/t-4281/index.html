<br />
But I'd like to screw around up there a bit and try my luck at a few of the quests ( shaman boots, resist flowers )<br />
<br />
Where is a good place to bind? Near the zone in? That forest right infront of the zone has the tree you click to bail to CS right?<br />
<br />
Speaking of porting out, is CS the only spot you can get to from PoM? For some reason I always thought there were multiple zones you could get to from PoM. <br />
<br />
60 monk and a few other friends there atm. Decent exp to be had anywhere?<br />
<br />
People with experiance there, give me your thoughts please. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you dont know your way around then have someone show you or read up a bit.  Hailing the wrong mob can get you a death touch and there are a number of traps throughout the zone.  I have found that the best place to bind (and where most people do) is at the chest inthe middle of hte zone.  It, being the middle of the zone, provides access to the rest of the zone.  And, if you bind anywhere else you will probably end up running through there to get anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do DON'T bind outside.  If you die and are sitting there nekid and happen to spring a flower trap then you are pretty much screwed.  The chest is safe....at least until they change the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The chest with the &quot;Painter&quot; halfling walking round?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ya the mob name is Tresure Chest.  Big room with hallways, invis and one way doors.  Its basically your access point thru the zone and void of kos mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bind by Debbis the Fish.<br />
<br />
Alice in Wonderland 4 / Stomples and Archers area is the farthest away from anything, but in the Stomples room is a just click back to the Treasure Chest room.   DO NOT bind outside in the forest.  You will have to run through the dispell traps and rebuff everytime you want to fight.  The only zone out is to Cobalt Scar.  <br />
<br />
Exp is okay with 60 monk / 60 shaman.  The mobs are really not exp mobs though, I mean - the puppets for example have over 30,000hps which takes me, monk and dog ~5-6 mins to kill usually.  So it's definately not exp like killing frogs in seb every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Quests - It took me a month to get the cards to make the boots.  I bought one card and a friend gave me another.   So in a month of fighting 3-4 hours 4+ days a week I got half the cards I needed for the boots.  I was fortunate to also buy probably the last shaman doll on my server.   In that same time I got enough squires for 4 squire flowers and also 3 sets for the knight flower.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have exp in 60.  I took about 10 rezless deaths in a month there.  Other people are uncommon in PoM these days.  <br />
<br />
Don't fight in the garden area, it sucks.  The plants all assist each other.  My monk friend and I primarily fought the archers, AiW (alice in wonderland) 4 and 3.  The white stallion (only slowable with Plague of Insects and resisty to that) and puppets.  To keep puppets from despawning, kill the halfling Geb before Bristlebane spawns between 8 and 9am gametime.<br />
<br />
When using your pet do not stand by a wall, do not summon him near a wall.  Be prepared for him to poof/suicide on you 5-6 times per session for no apparent reason.  <br />
<br />
Good luck.  I am quite happy to be done with my boots, PoM was entertaining for like 3 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What's the deal with the puppets? Do they really put on some<br />
kind of a puppet show? If so, is it anything interesting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't been to PoM in a long time, but back then the puppets did nothing. I think it was broken, as Bristlebane was not spawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">they do nothing.  <br />
<br />
They spawn there behind the curtain on the stage starting at like 7am game time.  Then Bristlebane spawns between 8 and 9am game time.  He is up for about 7 seconds, long enough to shout something along the lines of &quot;Ridiculously funny!  Where be the Cazic Thule Puppet?  Bah, move along now, nothing here to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
(fyi- there is no cazic thule puppet - there is inny, rallos, solusek, 3 tribunal, erollisi, bristlebane, tunare)<br />
<br />
Then the puppets and Bristlebane despawn.<br />
<br />
Quite disappointing really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PoM is borken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What I really wanted to get was my 55 monk into the zone to get a Blam Stick.  I know it's freaking slow for main hand, but 30/40 1h blunt is kind of cool for big hits.  He's 1 AA from getting criticals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmmmm, I always bind next to the zoneout tree, for easy access to CS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">WARNING!  Be very careful falling down the pit traps.  I found that as I was falling, I most often got &quot;stuck&quot; in a corner for a moment or two as I was falling, and when I finally hit the bottom, I would fall for 10k damage.  It's really really annoying having to wait for your 3rd res from a GM in the day because of the 10k falls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">finaljustice - didn't you find the dispell traps on the way into the castle problematic?  I know I sure like to keep my aego and kei when i want to solo up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I learned to solo indoors without external buffs.  Since my guildboss is always telling me &quot;Get yer Bear Butt to NToV RIGHT NOW,&quot;  I gotta be ready to gate and go at a moment's notice  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toreden_Demonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dont think PoM will ever be changed. Thay nerfed it down and thats it, think the guy working on it quit or got fired or something, was a great ide that turned into a ghost town like 90% of everquest zones today. Why not fix all that instead of adding a new dam expantion with new frikking problems. <br />
I love PoM but tis to frustrating now adays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PoM = high level Befallen now  :(</div></div><hr />
