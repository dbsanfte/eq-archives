Throwable items, such as the Tentacle Shuriken, also go in the range slot.<br />

Go go enhanced fishing baits that don't actually do anything =(</div></div><hr />

You get stats from range slot items. I think you're confusing range and ammo inventory slots.</div></div><hr />

Range slot Rent = you get all benefits<br />
Ammo slot NoRent = you get all benefits<br />

If you're gonna put something in your Ammo slot, make it summoned or you don't get didly (but it's a handly place to keep stuff, like drums)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always keep my foraged fishing grubs there myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The point is that we are given an ammo slot. We can put certain things in it. Some of the things have stats, but we don't get the benefit of these stats. That seems to be inconsistent with the idea of equipping items into slots. I mean, we can equip items in our &quot;range&quot; slot that are nothing to  do with &quot;ranged&quot; items - the only reason we use the ranged slot is that it provides a neat way of getting some extra stats. What is the difference betweent hat and the ammo slot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh...Jhar, I used to keep fishing grubs in my twink bard's ammo slot...then leave them on the corpse to rot when he died.  Highest number of grubs I ever got to was 12.   :D</div></div><hr />

Originally just about the only things that fit in ammo were, well, ammo.  Arrows, shurikens, daggers, arrows, anything you could throw or shoot.  My understanding was that it was just a place to stick an extra stack of your projectile weapon of choice.  It was probably coded not to give stats because it was intended for storage only.  I would guess that they started making non-weapons ammo equippable just to let those without ranged attacks get the same storage benefits out of it and make it more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Take the item out of your damn ammo slot and put it in your damn range slot and you will get the damn stats. There aren't any significant stat items that only fit in the ammo slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well duh, I already have something in my Range lot Nytmare. The argument that you can equip an item in a different slot does not hold water. There are plenty of items that can equip in more than 1 slot, and you still get the stats for them, regardless of which slot you equip them in. You can even, theoretically, equip 2 identical items in your primary and secondary slots (presupposing they are not lore). <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, it seems inconsistent that there is one slot where the item stats are ignored, thats all</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We've explained why items that fit in the ammo slot have stats.<br />
<br />
If you're asking why the ammo slot does not grant stats, then who knows. Maybe it's so you don't get doubled stats when you have, say, stacks of shurikens in both your range and ammo slots.</div></div><hr />
