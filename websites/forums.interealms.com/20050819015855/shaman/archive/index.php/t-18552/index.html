<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, i was bored this morning so i went to log in my monk warrior to check what was new. I notice there is this melee hotkey thing, but when i click the S it brings up a box with nothing in it. Is this function not implemented yet or was i just too low for any abilities. They was 27 and 30 respectivly. I could have sworn melee got new abilities from ike mid 20's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to go buy the books for the abilities, even the old ones.  Turn them into your trainer to get the abilities to show up, kinda like buying spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They do. Go buy tomes for them in POK library &amp; hand them to a monk trainer to learn the ability/disc - monk vendor is opposite side of library on the same lvl as our Shaman spell vendors. Alt+C brings up the box, click the S, then you highlight the skill with mouse, make a hotbutton (dont recall if this was right click or there was a button to do it) &amp; drop the hotbutton in the box.</div></div><hr />
