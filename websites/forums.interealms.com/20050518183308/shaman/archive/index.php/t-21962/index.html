If you are into SCUBA it's the place to be.  Well I guess that was a bit off topic but who cares.  Have fun while you are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lucy was bought by allakhazam a while ago, I dunno if the old address works or not, but I think they prefer you use lucy.allakhazam.com.  That's about the best for spells (a lot of info on EQCR is still wrong).  Check out the medicine cabinet forum here for more info on aa's, spells, skills, etc, there's a ton of good info.</div></div><hr />

The old Lucy address still bounces you just fine, and even has links to the Allakhazam site for extra fruity goodness. And thank God for that cause I cant spell Allakhazam worth snot.<br />
I like cruising all the class sites that I play (SK, Rogue, Ranger, Bard, Necro, Wizard, Beastlord-both sites, Monk) and in general avoid the Paladin, Cleric and Druid boards, they arent happy places to be most of the time if your a shaman at heart...most class boards luv us and show it, others wish that we were all beastlords and would stop trying to improve our class, so dont wear your heart on your sleeve.<br />
I have a ton of links on my home comp, I am stuck at work atm and dont have any here.</div></div><hr />
