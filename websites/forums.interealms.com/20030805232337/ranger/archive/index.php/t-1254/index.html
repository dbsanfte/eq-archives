<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taradoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In a recent post (by me) I had asked where it was the best exp. for a Ranger solo from 46-50. The respose I got was the back door of Crystal Caverns. Which backdoor is this?? Is it the right you take before getting to the queens room?? I am not sure exactly where everyone is talking about as we had a Ranger in our guild grind to 49 there last night, but he logged before he could tell me how to get to where he was. My next question is to get through Kael Drakkel you must have their faction which is opposite Coldain. I do know that you can turn in coldain heads to someone to get good faction for a agro free trip through the city to WL. If you purchase these heads do you still loose Coldain faction?? I am going to at some point have to get the faction I guess as I am a Ranger and ports to WL are a lil high to grind, 50pp on my server from GD is the minimum I have seen. Any help with these issues would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crystal Caverns for exp in upper 40s? You could do Geonids or Terrors, but most will be Lt Blue by then. Of course, you can kill a lot which will compensate for that, and the spawn rate is fast. <br />
<br />
You can safely cross Kael invis, so either camo up outside and run, get a Tolan's Helm for the superior Camo, or buy Invis potions from the potion vendor in Thurg (10-11pp each). Just don't stray from the direct path or you'll find giants which see invis. If you do the quest to improve your Kael factions it will lower your Coldain, though it might be possible to keep both Kael and Thurg non-KOS by hunting in Skyshrine, buying dwarf heads, and doing the Kobald paws quest (Kael quest, paws drop in VL). <br />
<br />
Good luck! I just use invis myself, and enjoy killing giants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valencia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The respose I got was the back door of Crystal Caverns. Which backdoor is this?? Is it the right you take before getting to the queens room??  I think what they mean by the backdoor is the geonid camp.  The tunnel on the right as you head to the queens room from the city is the geonid tunnel. At the end of that tunnel is a zone-out to EW, just outside the Ry'gorr Fort.  Thats the back door.  You can kill the geonids starting from the top one near zone-out and work your way down and just zone-out if it gets ugly.  Easy to single pull and great loot.  Many will be light blue to you.  You will need Sup Camo to get to the geonid camp also because the only entrance to CC is through the little crystal behind the Ry'Gorr fort -- unless of course  you want to fight your way down past the orcs.  BTW, the geonids are NOT KOS, unlike the spiders/orcs/terrors, until you've killed like a thousand of them....;)...and nothing in the zone sees thru inviz.<br />
<br />
Also, I recommend Sup Camo for a Kael run.  If you don't have a way to re-camo yourself in Kael if your inviz breaks, you are pretty much dead.  However, if your inviz sticks and you stay on the path to WL, you won't run into any see inviz giants. If inviz breaks, just find a spot not too close to any giant and re-apply.<br />
<br />
In either case, if you don't have a Tolan's helm already...get one..the Sup Camo effect is invaluable.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taradoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks all for the responses as I purchased Tolans DW helm last night I will probably head to CC tonight to grind. I left the nexus to head to Stonebrunt, but of course the nexus is still skarood and I ended up in the GD. I want to head back to Stonebrunt to quest the swiftclaw sash (for the 5th time) and hopefully I will not come up with another #@@!&amp;&amp;*$#@! headband. One last question for you all. Do you all recommend me leveling to 49-50 or obtaining my haste item first (or is this Personal preference)? With a Centi LS and a wurmmy I am very anxious to see if my damage output per minute is improved. I feel that I need this item before I go with my guild on a plains raid, but will there after have to buy legs, as I am still wearing runnyeyes finest BA leggings. Most everything else is updated but legs. I would love to loose 8AC for the 16-18% Swiftclaw sash, but it gets more, and more discouraging each time you turn in the bag for a headband.. Any other Haste item that is obtainable for the Ranger solo at 47 please let me know, and not the FBSS as on Rodcet nite I think that there is one guild that has a sewt schedule to camp it 24/7 (and happen to be the RUDEST guild on the server) - Hangmans noose is also an option, but Its hard to get all the guildies in TT without alot of planning and then if the noose drops, there are other melees that would watn it as well.. I guess in other words there is a better chance at solo questing the Sash than spending all the time in TT and then getting a roll, only to loose. Anyway, any suggestions would be appreciated...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lilucia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I basically LIVED in CC for most of my high 30s to mid 40s. Killed so many geonids they all hate me now. Still don't know the orc tunnels like the back of my hand, because I always just dropped down the well, but I spend enough time there farming velium for Thurg potions that I know how to get around that part.<br />
<br />
But yes, the &quot;back door&quot; to CC is the geonid camp because of the one-way zone out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valencia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do you all recommend me leveling to 49-50 or obtaining my haste item first (or is this Personal preference)?  Well, if you can get the geonid camp and do it fairly efficiently for a few nights, you'll make a good chunk of plat because some of the gems off the named geos sell for 150pp+.  In this case, save your money and buy an FBSS while you continue to level.  Don't know how much they cost on your server or if they are sold much, but the haste on it is better than the Stonebrunt sash haste.  Of course, the geos will be harder to solo without haste...kind of a catch-22 there.  If you find them too hard to solo or the geo camp is always taken by someone else, then you might as well try to get the other sash I guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galstein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went there last nite.  Must of the Geos where Lt/blue to me and the spiders where lt/blue to green.  I soloed them just by meleeing them.  I did do some Root, Dot, nuk, and plucking with arrows but not much.  Got the Geo's down to half and go in for the kill.  Spiders I just went in meleeing all the way down to the bridge.  Once there medded up and rebuffed and back down again.  I only got poisoned once, had to stop and wait it out.  The xp was good but only got about 1 bubble left in 46 needing some where else to go, any suggestion in Velious to go??  TIA</div></div><hr />
