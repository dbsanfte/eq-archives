<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rukarrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone. I was hoping I could get some suggestions for some gear for my new shaman. I've started an Iksar Shaman, and he's level 5 right now. Basically I'm looking for some low cost items to give my shaman a decent start. I don't like to super-twink my alts (especially since I can't afford to :)). I've scoured the banks of my main (51 monk) and was able to give him some cheap stuff. So far he's got:<br />
<br />
Lumberjack's Cap<br />
Engraved Skull Amulet (I think that's the name - drops in Kael off some mob from the Manor.)<br />
Cured Tizmak Surcoat<br />
Krode's Shawl<br />
Kunzar Cloak<br />
Spore Covered Gloves<br />
Curscale Sleeves<br />
<br />
Weapons are Beetle Stinger and Centi Warhammer<br />
<br />
I've also just got a Crystalline Belt that I'll be passing along. What could I get to fill the other slots (or perhaps upgrade the current ones) at say, 300 pp per piece, or something that I could farm with my monk. As I said, I'm not looking for anything uber - just some decent low cost items to get started with.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, and keep the great info coming! This site has a ton of great info. :)<br />
