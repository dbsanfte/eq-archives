<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay so for four months I played Horde only.  When FST and OB start, so do all my friends.  We're all over Horde.  Then we discovered the following:<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
We made the mistake of rolling paladins 3 days before the end of OB.  Doh.  I'd been looking for a replacement for my EQ shadowknight and now I've found it. It looks like an all paladin crew will flat out roll.<br />
<br />
Easy Mode<br />
To make the decision easier, the human newbie area and quests are an order of magnitude easier and more rewarding than the Horde equivalents.  It really does feel like you're playing on easy mode- and I'm not putting down Alliance, with my time constraints I'm all over it.<br />
<br />
Polish<br />
The Alliance areas seem to be laid out so much more logically and given so much more polish since they were worked on first.  I had heard this but didn't realize it until I'd played on both sides.  It's not even close.  Compare the experience you have as a human with that of playing an orc or a troll. Oy vey.<br />
<br />
Eye Candy<br />
In addition, I've yet to see the Horde attract the crowd of gawkers that my buddy and I did when we rolled up human females, stripped off their clothes, then danced outside the inn in Goldshire.  It got to the point that other &quot;women&quot; were strolling up, stripping, then joining us.  All the adolescent boys and old lecherous married men appeared to enjoy the show.  If you're going to be staring at a toon for 3+ years, it may as well be at a nice thong. And no, orc, troll and cow thongs don't do it for me.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record: until proven otherwise I believe any female in a MMORPG is really a male.<br />
<br />
I am such a sellout- sorry my Horde brethren. No more Zug Zug, For the Horde, Lok'Tar, etc... now it's &quot;Macarena&quot; time instead.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Good luck doing the Lyceum with a 5 man pally group, you will need it.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Horde are killers, alliance smell flowers and dance in the meadows.<br />
<br />
I love being the underdog anyway.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, best racial trait hands down is NE, shadowmeld is pretty damned awesome, entire squads can stealth and set ambushes.<br />
<br />
Iz I did make a gnome to check it out, the alliance areas are indeed much better, but oh well. Easy life makes for an easy person to kill :)<br />

<br />
I do like the Alliance starting area for dorfs, but dodn't find the quests to be more rewarding (anymore - back in july there was a huge diference though).  <br />
<br />
I remember the WoW boards had a consistent stream of &quot;NERF SHAMANS&quot; threads on it - led mostly by the palladin community.  As a (primarily) shaman in the closed beta, I like to read them!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will be rollign up a Dwarf Paladin as my main with a Tauren Shaman as secondary.<br />
<br />
BTW, at 22 (with Exorcism) I was soloing undead of 24th-25th level with little (25th) to no (24th) downtime.  It's a matter of knowing where to hunt and yoru strengths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1.)  Paladins are pretty good now, with a lot more options then they used to have, thanks to talants and a complete overhaul.  They are much different to play then they were, so it is a change.  Not a completely new class, but not too far.<br />
<br />
2.)  Easy mode?  Maybe.  I haven't played alliance much.  But I dont like things handed to me on a platter.  The game progression is already pretty fast for everyone; i'm not in this to blitz to high levels.  Besides,  easy leveling has one big problem:  Money costs.  As a hunter, I spend a LOT of money.  My skills, my pet's skills, weapons and armor, food, and ammo.  Fast leveling makes it harder to keep skills up to date.<br />
<br />
3.)  Polish is double-edged.  It may be more complete, but that doesn't mean the Horde area isn't either.  The fact is, the Horde lands are supposed to look more... ah..&quot;rugged&quot;.  Humans build roads, elves like fancy structures, dwarves and gnomes... disgust me, but that's not the point.  I like the brutal simplicity the Horde zones have, myself.  It does however make a lot of difference if you are used to one side or the other:  Me, i'm a Horde member.  You are more drawn to Alliance.  A matter of taste, really.<br />
<br />
4.)  Gawking crowds of pre-pubescent children staring at naked female characters is not my idea of a good point for the alliance.  It seems that alliance would draw more then Horde's share of immature people.  On that note, it would be nice if the Horde had &quot;prettier&quot; models, but in a way, that probably wouldn't fit. (at least not with the current races; maybe an expansion will add something that can have a good-looking model)<br />
<br />
It's all a matter of taste, in the end.  When I kill one of you Alliance scum, I dont want you to think you were killed by a flimsy, skinny broad of a human.  Self-righteous, pretenscious weaklings.<br />
<br />
When I kill you, you will KNOW you were killed by a hulking brute of an orc and his brutal but efficient killing machine bear pet. :)<br />
<br />
Horde isn't about pretty.  Horde is about power, and those seeking Glory in combat.<br />
<br />
Not for flower-picking elves,  ale-hugging dwarves,  mechanostrider-hugging gnomes (funny image, though, right?) or humans trying to encase themselves in steel to protect their flabby, weak bodies!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sadly there is nothing new about the Human/Alliance lands and quests being both better for quests, travel, and having more overall polish than the Horde.  In part this is due at least to the fact that in terms of the game development they simply were implemented sooner and received far more development time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I will be rollign up a Dwarf Paladin as my main with a Tauren Shaman as secondary.<br />
<br />
Doing the same characters, but the other way around... Tauren Shaman primary and Dwarf Pally as a secondary.   I hated paladins early in the beta since there was little to do other than hit Holy Strike every 10 seconds.  The new paladin is a lot more fun and requires some forethought and strategy to play well... I was definitely enjoying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Orc hunter. :)  I know, I know.  I loved being a Shaman in EverQuest.  And frankly, Shaman are GREAT in World of Warcraft, too!  No joke.  One of the most powerful classes (I'll argue it, but this isn't the thread for it)<br />
<br />
I like being able to tame my own pet, and being a ranged death dealer is very amiable to me, without the downside of the...you know...squishiness.  :D<br />
<br />
And orcs are great for it.  VERY good pet-class-friendly traits (5% pet damage, axe/2h axe specialty, 25% resistances to stun and knockdown).  In the last stretch of the closed test I played one that focused on pets.  My pet, a level 28 bear (I was 29) almost soloed a level 32 Rogue (Rogue Sapped me, and tried to kill off my pet.  This REALLY seriously suprized him.)<br />
<br />
I hope to group with a lot of Shaman.  They make great partners.  And my pet is a passable tank (Fully talanted up, that is).  My only biggest problem is, I really like the marksmanship talants, and my dream build is only really effective at the top level where I can get all the points. :(  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh - got my pally up to level 24 on the closed beta PvP - found him to be fun, but kind of gimped.<br />
<br />
The new pally gains a 40% haste buff at L6. Yes, L6.  I thought warriors were ridiculously overpowered until I played a paladin.  <br />
<br />
Paradoxically the worst classes in the game are priest/mage, but I will be starting a mage first to level w/o needing gear so that I can earn the coin/gear to properly equip my panzer mage (paladin) from day one.  Leveling a mage will be an exercise in patience and frustration, not my strong suit. We'll see how long I last playing a completely gimped class.<br />
<br />
For those talking about PVP vs. us in Alliance, that will not be my crew. We hate PVP with a passion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I heard they added some Pally - Love during the open beta - now I wish I'd gone back and played my closed beta pally some to see the difference.  That's definitely one of the downsides of WoW - too much to do! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Horde all the way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not really sure how you can say that the good side is easier or whatever.  I went up to 21 with a Tauren shaman.  The quests were well laid out from the beginning.  The quests were relevant to the class in story, as opposed to the quests I got as a human paladin which mostly had the feel of &quot;go kill all the kobolds!&quot;.  The city of Thunder Bluff takes some time getting used to, but once you are used to it, it's laid out in a fairly logical manner.  It has a very nice polished feel to it too.  It's fairly defensive too, with a pair of elevators being the only way in or out of the city from what I saw.  And once you leave Mulgore and head into the Barrens, there's just soooo many quests to do that I spent multiple days and about 7 levels in the area only doing quests, and still only finished about 2/3 of the ones I had available.  Maybe some of the other cities aren't quite as good, but I certainly found Mulgore to be well developed.<br />
<br />
That, and as good as you make the paladin out to be, the shaman gets that same feeling for me.  At level 20 I was taking out level 22 mobs with no difficulty at all, and minimal downtime (like 15 seconds or so).  And I didn't have to selectively hunt only undead like you did as a paladin to be able to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Left the grey bubba.<br />
<br />
Don't knock mages, a mage, well played, is extremely effective and very good at pvp. Alot of people focus on the wrong stats though :). My two box will be rogue/mage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Agree Mill - the mage is still a very effective player . . . especially in PvP.  Long range and rapid damage dealing make 'em real tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Speaking as a future horde player - good riddance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well see it's somethign like this. Horde players earn their levels so they are more l33t than alliance. And aliance lands have to help you level up quicker so there is more of you to kill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Zug Zug! <br />
<br />
If I was going to two-box, i'd box a Shaman and a Warlock.  <br />
<br />
Curse of Weakness + Stoneskin totem = Is this mob doing ANY damage to me at all?<br />
<br />
Add in a pet to tank - or just let the Shaman do it and use an imp/succubus (Either works),  Shaman for heals, Warlock for summoned stuff (Soulstone, healthstone, whatever).  Both can res.  (so you dont have to worry about being left high-and-dry if the shaman kicks the bucket) and both deal out significant damage (Shaman with everything, warlock with DOTs and some SAVAGE AEs)<br />
<br />
Maybe i'll talk my brother into starting a warlock alt, and i'll have a shaman alt, and we can see how well they duo together.  Maybe two-boxing would be complicated (Every class has a lot they do in a fight, but shaman and warlock are both very intensive) but duoing I can already see as being MAJORly brutal.<br />
<br />
With the new paladin talants and abilities, they get a skill that cuts the damage done to just them (Similar to stoneskin, but only for them, I think) an Alliance paladin and warlock would duo very nicely together as well.<br />
<br />
This didn't mean to turn into a class discussion, i'm sure, i'll shut up now. :)<br />
<br />
HORDE RULES!</div></div><hr />
