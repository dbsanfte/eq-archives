<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">does an AA cost more at over L65?<br />
<br />
My friend (L66 mage) does a spawn cycle in droga and at 65 was earning 7.5 blue bubs of AA xp<br />
<br />
Doing the exact same circuit at L66 yields just over 6 AA xp<br />
<br />
What causes this disparity in Xp, and has anyone else noticed it.<br />
<br />
Because he wanted more AAs he has got himself killed and undinged so he can get better xp. !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I know why. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure I can explain it accurately, but it involves relative levels - his and the mobs'. When he was lower level, the mobs were considered more difficult (relatively), and when he was higher level (than he was before), the mobs were considered less difficult (relatively). Even though they were the same mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So there is no fixed amount of xp/ mob?<br />
<br />
instead it scales depending on the levels of the people killing it?<br />
<br />
e.g 1 king dronan at 65 is worth 2500xp<br />
but at 66 is only worth 2000xp?<br />
<br />
or something like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This doesn't seem to make sense given what we know about experience.<br />
<br />
If a mob yields x experience on death and is still a blue con mob, it should make the same dent in the amount of experience it required for 1 aa point.<br />
<br />
Relative power has never come into play before OoW, unless something has changed that they haven't told us about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it has always been this way. Coning means nothing. <br />
<br />
What happens is you get a fixed amount of xp based on your level and the mobs level. So if the mob is say 20 levels less than me I get 0. (hence why greenies give 0 xp).<br />
<br />
If mobs gave xp w/o consideration for levels, a level 46 solo killing a bot mob would get craaazy xp, but since it is crazy red, the person does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What happens is there's a base exp per mob. Thats dependant on the level of the mob and exp mod for the zone and I think thats it. Things then get interesting from there as that base exp gets modified for a number of reasons.<br />
<br />
Group exp bonus adds additional exp before it splits them amongst the group. Sometime mid PoP this was greatly increased to encorage grouping over soloing. At this point going from 5 people to 6 people adds an additional 20% more exp so you always get at least as much exp with the 6th person there.<br />
<br />
Hybrids get an exp bonus to cancle out the exp penalty that they had previously. This was added way back when in kurnark. Rather than changing the exp tables and causing hybrids to change level they instead just added more exp to cancle out the penalty. IE if a regular class needed 100 xp get to level 2 and a hibrid needed 120. Lets say they also got 10 exp per kill and took 10 kills to level up. Old way the hybrid would take 2 extra kills. New way that hybrid gets 20% more exp per kill so gets 12 exp per kill and now need 10 kills also to level up. Obviously this shouldn't effect exp going to aa's just regular leveling.<br />
<br />
Then there's the difficult mob bonus that seems to be applied individually that gives a bonus for difficult mobs. IE same mob gives someone lower level more exp since it's red to them and &quot;difficult&quot; as opposed to blue and &quot;easy&quot;. This was added a while back to encourage killing higher level mobs instead of LOTS of easy mobs. If memory serves it went a bit before PoP came out.<br />
<br />
The amount of exp an aa requires is the same if your lvl 51 or lvl 70 so the differences is how much exp your getting. In this case the mobs are getting &quot;easier&quot; so your getting less, no bonus or maybe even a penalty for them being too easy at 66 compaired to 65. Once again if memory serves when they first added the exp bonus for difficult mobs they nurfed exp for easy mobs. I think they undid that after people complained but it's been a while but exp is still much better killing &quot;difficult mobs&quot;.<br />
<br />
The exp you actually get end up being pretty complicated when you factor in these different bonuses, splitting it between 3 different potential spots (regular, aa and leader) and when the particular bonuses are applied and should be applied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With a 5 level range of your level you get a bonus to xp. <br />
<br />
With the level 66-67 people requesting Dranik's hollow expiditions. at 66 you get okay xp. At 67 it drags like a dog with an itchy bottom. The only reason..<br />
<br />
The monsters are level 61.  66 is in that 5 level range. 67 you aint. <br />
<br />
To be honest it is intresting design if it was planned that way. To get people to move. I need to test the other Instanced zones of OoW and see how much the level spread vrs Requester level is. If it scales like the Instance for hollows does then it could be a very intresting design. Also the Catacombs and Sewers are untapped  in Allkallazims yet. So there might be some intresting stuff there. I need to go check it out. (Grins)<br />
<br />
Woohoo.. Gonna go Die in all sorts of places. I found the second firepit named placeholder last night (level 67 requested instance) so that is losing it's appeal now. The farming can begin for some of it. but Bleh that will be for another time. For now...<br />

<br />
But to me it seems pretty damn obvious if you kill the same mob 1 level higher than you were you would get less exp for it.<br />
AA experience levels up the exact same way as normal exp as if it didnt we'd all be running riot killing level 50 mobs in PoN etc.<br />
Even though an AA point always costs the same amount of raw exp points to fill the higher level you get the less raw exp points you get for the same mobs.<br />
<br />
Example.(totally made up numbers)<br />
1 AA point takes 100 exp points to fill.<br />
<br />
At lvl 65 a Kyv Heartpiercer gives you 20 aa exp points.<br />
At lvl 66 the same mob would only give you 18 aa exp points.<br />
<br />
Or your friend could still be doing the same mobs at level 70 a lot quicker and still getting the same aa return per mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not necessarily, Wulf.  As stated (by Tarradar, I think--too lazy to scroll up and check!), there is a set amount of experience per mob.  It's a base amount.  If you kill a mob within 5 levels of you, you get a bonus amount of experience.  If you are grouped in a group of 6, you get an additional 20% experience added to the mob before the experience is divided among the group.<br />
<br />
If you solo light blues, you are getting exp for a mob that's probably 10-15 levels below you (whatever light blue is now).  The base exp for a level 60 mob isn't very high.  You are also not getting that 20% exp bonus for mobs near your level.  That all adds up quickly.<br />
<br />
You aren't getting a smaller base, you're just not getting a bonus in some cases.<br />
<br />
What isn't necessarily clear is that races with an experience penalty are somewhat hosed if you split AA/regular experience.  I've asked for clarification from SoE, and I've been told that a developer has been looking into it (so who knows if I'll ever get an answer), but let me offer an example.<br />
<br />
Hypothetical:<br />
Assumptions:<br />
Troll bard (you know you always wanted one!)<br />
20% exp penalty.<br />
Solo's a blue-con mob 6 levels lower for a base exp of 100 points.<br />
AA exp set to 90%.<br />
<br />
Scenario one:  (Apply split before penalty)<br />
100 x 90% = 90 exp to AA<br />
100 x 10% = 10 x 20% penalty = 8 exp to regular exp.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: (apply penalty first)<br />
100 x 20% penalty = 80 exp<br />
80 x 90% = 72 exp to AA<br />
80 x 10% = 8 exp to regular exp.<br />
<br />
In scenario 2, you have an 18% exp bleed off of AA compared to scenario 1.  Unfortunately, I'm about 80% sure that scenario 2 (the bad one) is the current operational calculation.  As I said, I'm still waiting for confirmation from SoE.  The situation is further complicated by leadership and raid AAs.  I don't know where the 20% from leadership is taken--you may get additional exp bleed there.<br />
<br />
There is an additional problem with the calculation from what I've heard.  In order to save calculation time, SoE uses a rounding feature that is said to reduce exp on split AA/reg exp.  For instance if a mob does 88,888 exp exp, and the split is 60/40, you should get: 53,333 and 35,555.  SoE might round down after the 1000s and get 53,000 and 35,000 and lose you 888 exp.  (if they rounded normally, they'd get 55,000 and 36,000--which would be an experience gain of 112).  While I can see why they round down, it still nets to an exp loss.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, I'd recommend having 100% to AA or 0%.  Don't split.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you are grouped in a group of 6, you get an additional 20% experience added to the mob before the experience is divided among the group.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify.  Prior to May 2003, an exp bonus was awarded for grouping on the order of:<br />
<br />
2 people in group:  2% bonus<br />
3 people in group:  4% bonus<br />
4 people in group:  8% bonus<br />
5 people in group:  12% bonus<br />
6 people in group:  20% bonus<br />
<br />
So a person duo'ing got 51% of the normal xp for killing the mob.  Each person in a full grp got 20% of the normal xp for killing the mob (120% / 6).  <br />
<br />
The May2003 patch changed it to the following:<br />
<br />
2 people in group:  20% bonus<br />
3 people in group:  40% bonus<br />
4 people in group:  60% bonus<br />
5 people in group:  80% bonus<br />
6 people in group:  80% bonus but only split 5 ways.<br />
<br />
Now a person duo'ing gets 60% of the normal xp, and each person in a 5 or 6 person group gets 36% of the normal xp for killing the mob (180% / 5).<br />
<br />
This is only one part of the big equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get the 68 instance and the aaxp is 2-5% per mob. Example 2% for murks, 3-4% for bats/rats, 4-5% for named. Its all based on the xp modifiers mentioned and as pointed out that is why aaxp/xp sucks in the 67 instance. I moved all my guys to the 68 instance and the aaxp flies now (like one every 45 mins or so and I am slow cause I am boxing them, with live puller I could keep mobs in camp far more often). Was getting 1-3% in 67 instance. Mobs are higher (better base xp) and the bonus is back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Regular XP was going slow while I helped level my brothers mage in HoH, so I changed over to AA, which my alt cleric was already doing. I switched off leadership and my cleric still overtook my shaman and pinged faster (shaman level 69, cleric level 65). Cleric was getting about 2% AA xp per mob, shaman was getting I think 1%, or .8% or something close to there. Had four people in the group, a 66, 65, 69, and 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bottom line, I'd recommend having 100% to AA or 0%.  Don't split.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
I believe I have read a dev comment just recommending that a good while back. At least I know that I have been always going 100% or 0% after some discussion, possibly even here at the crucible.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can t be more precise, but the suggestion is surley a good one. (for races with penalties)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There was a patch back in Kunark or Velius where the relative difference in level between the player and the mob determined xp gained. It was all explained than. It is nothing new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">also just post POP I belive that thay implemented at level 61 that your blue range shrank to 5 levels below you light blue to another 3 to 5 levels below that. THIS brought about a fire storm so bad that was about a week to 2 after luanch thay changed it back to about a 15 lvl blue range and a 5 lvl light blue range. But becouse there origanal intent was to make people move on and not just farm older zones (one AAxp with the right gear could be gotten off chain pulling shrooms in FG and have 3 or so dieing at the same time on you, also the norm for a EXP grind group was not go and find the toughest mobs the group can handle but go and find the place where the group could kill the most blues in a shortest time) and to incurage takeing on more challanging mobs by stronger groups thay gave a bonus to the exp for the 5 lvls below you blue range AND thay increesed the bones to whites/black and higher. so here is somethign to what I think the exp spreads looked like (and this is reguarding the set base exp tag on a mob)<br />
<br />
OLD range<br />
red 120%<br />
yellow 110%<br />
white 105%<br />
blue 100%<br />
light blue 65% to 25% depending on how light<br />
(ps. just a note that light blues was realy the old time EXP greens)<br />
<br />
new spread<br />
red 160%<br />
yellow145%<br />
white 130%<br />
High blue (5lvl) 120% to 115%<br />
blue 100%<br />
low blue (13 to 15lvl below) 80%<br />
light blue 65% to 25%<br />
<br />
notic IF you can solo a yellow con mob you get a substantial incress in both the bones off the base and the base exp it self and normaly the zone exp bones is better as well.<br />
<br />
also notic the 2 break point ranges in the blue levels. for thouse of use that cant find and or solo the yellow reds or whites, if you mob has a level range that falls over one of the break points say 3lvl below to 7lvl below the you will notice some pretty hugh swings in exp gotten off killing the same mob where as if thay lie all in one zone its realy a rather small difrence. also notice the lower break point again a very big swing in mob exp even though it is still blue. then if your trying to get anythign from light blues ..... thats just funny.</div></div><hr />
