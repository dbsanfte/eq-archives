<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ran some tests on Stinging Wort to see if The Powers That Be have nerfed it, after a customer told me 5 doses healed only 250 pts of damage.<br />
<br />
Fully buffed (with a slot open) I got 5 of 5 heals on me.<br />
<br />
However, hunting later, I used it during a nasty little lag spike, and only 4 of the 5 doses landed on me.  All 5 doses were gone, but only 4 effects showed up.  1200hp up, too, instead of 1500.  And yeah, I checked to make sure it was 5 charges remaining 'fore I lugged it around hunting.<br />
<br />
Since it's instant, it can't be interrupted, right?  Means that one of the clickies just vanished into the ether.<br />
<br />
Just FYI for those who may count on this.<br />
<br />
Oh, and regen won't stack on top of it, but it still stack on top of regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Another thing to let people know about this is that it doesnt work when youre stunned (if theyre being extremely cautious and you want them to know everything that could possibly go wrong I guess)<br />
<br />
I carry around a 10 charge most of the time and during my execution trial in PoJ i used 3 charges while in the 4 waves.. but when I landed slow on the Executioner and got summoned, he stunned me and smeared me into the pavement while i was desperately clicking on the potion.  <br />
<br />
This should be common knowledge to everyone but just pointing it out.  And yes, lag sucks with this potion, making it not too valuable on raids with 70-80 people unless youre on a T1 or something.   Although that doesnt matter because no one raids outside PoP anymore I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most likely the lag spike caused for a tick to occur between your clicking the potion, sometimes clicks can phantom activate like that and cause buffs to stutter in my experience.   A click occurred in the lag spike, but your computer didn't register it, so all actions were advanced one click when finally registered.   meaning you would have one of the effects click down on Hp, and so the next potion woudl refresh the buff instead of heal.<br />
<br />
  Completely theory, but makes sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Makes sense.  Moved in early November, and the new digs seem to be in an area of the city that has horrific phone lines.   My connection (DSL) is so bad I can't solo.  My BEST lag time currently is 2 seconds.  You can lag 3 - 4 seconds behind in a group setting (with a good group), but that's a soling death waiting to happen.  I frequently can't click, cast, or hotkey because something thinks I'm already doing something else.</div></div><hr />
