<br />
Your biggest problem will be getting singles.  The two mobs up front are very hard to split, you can't root and zone because root drops straightaway.  <br />
<br />
I think you would have a hell of a time fighting both at once.  They are basically PoP mobs with more hps and resists.  They hit faster too, maybe for a bit less.<br />
<br />
Frankly, you are better off just finding a group that is going there, not like anyone is going to say NO! to a shaman coming along.  Only takes a couple of trips doing the named and PA should drop, and you're all done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The mobs there are really resistant(100% CR, fairly PR), have a ton of HP, almost always come in pairs.  The exp is poor and the loot is near worthless velious quest gems by the stacks off normal mobs.<br />
<br />
Why in the world would you wanna solo there heh?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cause im bored and, uh, I like losing my corpse is crappy spots I guess? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just curious is all since I never got a chance to explore the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On top of what others have mentioned, most mobs are unlullable (only mentioning this because bringing a luller to help split mobs won't help), some are casters so they gate, and most mobs have pretty high MR, so much that Malos + bard tash still yields alot of slow resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The mobs there are really resistant(100% CR, fairly PR<br />
<br />
They're also quite MR and can be hard to slow. I remember often getting several resists even after Tash and Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The exp is poor and the loot is near worthless velious quest gems by the stacks off normal mobs.<br />
<br />
Actually the XP isnt bad.  Last time I was there w/ 8 to 9 people I got about 1.5 aa per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did a 1 group run there for giggles a while ago, the xp per mob was pretty good (over a blue of AA per mob), but mobs took a while to kill and we were hardly lacking in dps (Ranger/wiz/monk/shm/clr/pal).<br />
<br />
Stuff there generally doesnt stun, resists are sky high, and a lot of mobs like to gate, the revamp made gaters a lot worse there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah this isn't a good zone to do solo.  It's possible, sure, but it's also slow and pointless.  Just go on one of the myriad raids that happen there.  A raid is how that zone is meant to be experienced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">still one of the most beautiful zones in all of EQ to this day.<br />
<br />
when we reached the bubble that used to hold the sleeper for the first time, our raid stood awestruck for a minute or so. the zone has something mighty about it.<br />
<br />
if you can, ask around and find a guild that does ST. a full trip will take some time but it's SO worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the bubble where sleeper used to be isn't much fun now that he isn't there anymore on pretty much every server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I doubt anyone can solo here. They come by 2 (you need a spliter) ,have a VERY high rm ,rc ,fairly resistant to poison ,they quad and have huge hp....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">its &quot;possible&quot; in old sleepers, I soloed a golem to 50% before tireing of it, managed to proc tunare snare twig on him and just kited him around.<br />
Tedious and boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It IS possible to solo in Sleepers, I did it when I first got my key.  To split mobs you have to zone in and out a ton though.  It was nice being able to say that I had done the first kill for my guild in Sleeper's, but when I learned Primal is only off of named, I quickly lost interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ya, I expected more of ST...soon learned it is tedious and boring even when you have to fight through as a guild. Then every time I went primal spell never droped, after about 15 visits I ended up getting ferine instead, for months every time I missed a late night ST raid I would hear how it rotted, hehe</div></div><hr />
