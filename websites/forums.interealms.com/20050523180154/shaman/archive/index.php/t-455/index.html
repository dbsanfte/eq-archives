<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>buga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Almost into raid levels and eager to do it. What's ToV and NToV, Kinda new to the game and as a shaman. I read this board often and I keep seeing those words, can anyone enlighten me. Thanks<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ToV = Temple of Veeshan,  located in Western Wastes<br />
<br />
NToV = North (wing of) Temple of Veeshan.  Same zone as ToV but ToV is split in 3 wings.  West Wing, East Wing, and North Wing.<br />
<br />
West Wing is where armor drops for the Kael armor quests.  Mobs are on Claws of Veeshan faction and 3 named dragons give quests to the dragon allied guilds.<br />
<br />
East Wing is known as Halls of Testing or HoT.  Mobs here are KoS to everyone and they drop the armor for the Skyshrine quest armors as well as parts for the West wing quests given by the 3 dragons.<br />
<br />
North Wing is the very difficult high end area.  Mobs are KoS to all and much harder to kill compared to East and West wings.   Very high end armor (some of the best in game) drop from the numerous named dragons there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>buga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info, but i got one more question. There is a key to Veesha. A friend of mine told me her first experience in the test hall area and said she didn't need a key...I'm confused.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No key for Temple of Veeshan.  Just a level 46 limit like the planes.   Oh and one thing, if you are KoS to Claws of Veeshan, there is no way out of Temple of Veeshan other than gating or porting out.  The zone out is on the far side of the zone from the zone in.  If you aren't KoS to dragons you can walk to the west wing and just zone back out though.<br />
<br />
Veeshan's Peak (the zone in Skyfire) is the one needing a long key quest.<br />
<br />
Here is a decent map of the zone.  NPC info isn't entirely correct but the zone lay out is.<br />

<br />
Seriously, it's a tough zone.  NToV has mobs that are kill on sight (KoS) even if you are ally to the Claws of Veeshan (CoV) faction.  The EASIEST mobs in ToV are level 60 and hit in the 300s with the exception of some hatchlings in NToV.  Lots of the mobs have area effect (AE) spells that hit from about 50 to the 300s, depending on the mobs.  Frankly, I don't even know what the toughest mobs hit for.  I seem to recall being hit as hard as 800 by some of the NToV named mobs.<br />
<br />
ToV is for raids with your guild.  There isn't much else to do there!  :)<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya!<br />
