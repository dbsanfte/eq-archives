<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else frustrated with the way this spell works? I really wish they'd just put a confirm box on it, so we could cast it on non group members. It's frustrating trying to shrink a raid with only a couple of shamans and very few cobalt bracers. Then someone dies or goes LD and you have to keep swapping in group members to shrink people.<br />
<br />
Another option that I doubt Verant would do is add a group shrink spell. Not sure if their code allows for group spells to have confirm boxes, but this would at least allow us to cast it on non group members. <br />
<br />
Either way I think something needs to change with Shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, I agree on that, can be a pain in the arse.<br />
<br />
I also think they should add a Group shrink/grow line of spells :)<br />
<br />
Why not eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xeiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or maybe fix all the wonderful bugs that shrink has associted with it, well more all illusion spells but shrink is espically annoying.  If you zone in after someone is shrunk they are normal size to you, so you can't get by ogres etc<br />
<br />
-xeiz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe it's not feasible, I don't really know how many you'd need and it depends on the money the guild has but shrink potionsx5 or x10 passed around ought to make everybody happy and there are some poor Shaman out there who would gladly spend a few hours making them for a few pp+cost each.<br />
<br />
My Warrior is only 49 and I carry Shrink, SoW and Lev+wings in enough quantities to supply a small group for a few hours if need be. Of course my Shaman makes them at cost.<br />
<br />
The Warrior just started carrying purchased Invis but come on VI make them stackable, it's bad enough a 12pp potion is as random as the spell but to only put 10 potions in a 10 slot bag is a crime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I suppose that's feasible, but wizards can now Translocate people that aren't in their group. Why can't shamans shrink people outside group by adding a confirm box? Seems logical to me, but hey this is Verant we're talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That of course is THE issue and not only for shrink. I guess you could annoy someone by spamming him with the confirm box they could have a turn off option just like trades but then we're back to square one.<br />
<br />
How does it work for Trans, can a Wiz spam someone with that? At least no one will turn down a rez but there is an evil side to that like that one guy did with the non-exp revive to that dude in the Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Translocate costs enough mana and takes long enough to cast that spamming someone with it wouldn't really be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An even better solution..... make it castable upon anyone, and it gives an icon.  If someone casts it on you and you don't want it, click it off.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of a group shrink spell, as well.  Shrink the entire raid, except for the gnomes.  Grow them up to barbarian size so that everything is completely out of proportion :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. Wiz trans to zone has no confirmation box, you just go.<br />
<br />
I was messing with a gnome Wizzie in my group to pass the time by casting Grow on her... next thing I know I am at the zone line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1. the rez confirm box tells how much xp is given as of some recent patch.<br />
<br />
2. wiz translocate DOES have a confirm box, some of the other ones dont have one, but trans does, it can also now be cast on people outside the group. (i guess from your experiance that the zone TL has no confirm box, but the ones to wizzy spires do).<br />
<br />
3. hypothetically you could spam someoen with TL boxes, but its a slow cast time so it wouldnt work well, maybe thats a tradeoff we should look for, slight increase in shrink/grow cast time but let it be cast outside group with a confirm box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My only real problem with shrink is the indoor/outdoor requirements.<br />
<br />
If a shaman can make a shrink potion that works anywhere, why can't they just cast the spell anywhere too?<br />
<br />
Seems fairly simple, be consistant.  Either all indoor or all outdoor.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it might eliminate the race size problems, but you can grab a potion for like 20pp and anyone can shrink anywhere.<br />
<br />
It just seems stupid.<br />
<br />
Yeah, group shrink makes sense too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Translocate spells &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; have confirm boxes. Decession (TL to zone) does not, but I believe it's a group cast only spell, so you can't Decession non group members.<br />
<br />
Also Shrink is not indoor/outdoor restricted. It's dungeon restricted.  Unrest and Cazicthule are outdoor dungeons and Shrink works fine there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">An even better solution..... make it castable upon anyone, and it gives an icon. If someone casts it on you and you don't want it, click it off.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want it to take up a buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, I'd rather it didn't leave an icon either. That would also make it dispellable I bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lose group acumen, add group shrink.<br />
<br />
I'd actively search for that one.</div></div><hr />

When the spell shrink was introduced Brad responded to a post of some sort and said something along these lines:<br />
<br />
&quot;The reason we dont let shrink outdoors, I didnt think it looked right to have a small character outdoors, so we made it an indoor only spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone else remember this at all, I know it was on casters realm a few years back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shrink is the most annoying spell in the world.  I have no problems being the only shaman on a raid but having to join 8 different groups is a huge pain, having to join groups to reshrink after people die, shrink not appearing to people that zone in, it drives me up the wall.<br />
<br />
Remove the group restriction, make a confirm box and just ban *******s who spam it.  Better yet, just make something cheap and easy to get for every class that casts shrink via right click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I know in the early days of shrink, they didn't want you to use it outdoors, because people would be able to shrink a charmed hill giant or sand giant. Which would make the zones those mobs are in a lot more dangerous. However, I believe you can no longer shrink charmed pets (maybe not any pets now), so this is no longer an issue. I agree that shrink should work in outdoor zones, but do you really need it in any outdoor non dungeon zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lose group acumen<br />
<br />
lol group acumen only exists in text form as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My one Solace was finding out  that Bear form acts as a Self shrink no matter where you are.  In bear form i can enter an FV hut, or climb the cliff from the beach to the top in CS, etc,...<br />
<br />
If fully supportive of shrink being allowed everywhere, it makes no sense. You can Grow a person in dungeons or outdoors, why not shrink?  Why can we grow everyone's pet but when we try on our own they shrink or stay the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Knowing Verant they will probaly nerf Grow in the next patch where it will only work outside. /shrug the Dumb A$$E$ they are.</div></div><hr />
