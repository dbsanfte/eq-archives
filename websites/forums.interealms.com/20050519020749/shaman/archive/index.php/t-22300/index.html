<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me tell you what I think. <br />
<br />
AA. Once again, so we are clear. Alternate Advancement. AA. <br />
<br />
Here is a post I made from another thread (the &quot;Canni&quot; one). I edited it a bit so it was more understandable, but I SERIOUSLY feel this topic deserves consideration and I cannot undeerstand why people dont see it. <br />
<br />
Again, its my hope that SOE recognizes the uselessness of Canni 4, and makes the &quot;newer&quot; cannis, i.e. the Gates one and the OoW one fairly available to those who are &quot;qualified&quot; to get them, and by that I mean that a lvl 62 shaman with less than &quot;Bazaar Best&quot; gear wouldnt be able to be effective in that area. However, the &quot;average&quot; lvl 65 Shaman with medium Bazaar (i.e. not FULL Ornate and Aged Mystic boots etc, but getting there) with a couple dpzen AAs can gather a solid group and have a chance to score. <br />
<br />
This, in a nutshell, is one of the BIGGEST shortcomings of the current EQ. There are different levels of &quot;what I WANT, not what I NEED&quot; in this game now, and the difference between them is HUGE. Cutting edge shaman need a 2K heal. Pre-EP can certainly get by with 1600. Top-top end Shaman need a fast slow with a -65 modifier (JUST so its &quot;enough&quot; for desireabillity at that level) but your Typical BoT-PoE shaman really doesnt. <br />
<br />
So, once again, I will jump on my &quot;Using AA as a Form of Balance&quot; bandwagon. Lets create a new Canni, a new Heal, a new fast nuke, a better resist debuff tied to slow, new buffs that matter, reduced aggro, etc etc etc (did I forget anything?), but . . .<br />
<br />
. . . BUT lets tie them to AA!! Not to spells that drop in zones only 10% of the EQ population will see in the next 6 months. Not in gear that you cannot obtain unless you are in a &quot;Top 5&quot; raiding guild, but . . .<br />
<br />
. . . BUT Lets tie these abilities to AA. Something ANYONE can get with some dedicated time. Want a better heal? 30 AA please. Better Nuke? Thats a different 30. Canni 5 upgrade? Cool, hows 10-20-30 grab you. You got the HPs now, spend the points, PUT IN THE TIME!<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, I know all the anti-arguements. Heres a couple examples, and my responses, before you start in on me ok?:<br />
<br />
Heres the most common I see from Raiders:<br />
&quot;Raiders dont get as much pure-XP time as non-raiders&quot;<br />
Tough. Raiders have access to MUCH better loot. Raiders can make up HUGE variances in this type of ability with a couple K extra HPs and Mana, not to mention incredible foci that just arent available to the common man. If the Raid level player has the time to dedicate to this type of AA ability list IN ADDITION to his raid responsibilities, then why SHOULDNT he be &quot;that much&quot; better than other members of his class? Lets keep ONE THING in persepective here. Time spent in EQ is what translates into advancement, no matter what level you wish to play. If you do not want to raid, you have to spend time camping pp loot, wearable items, LDoN, etc etc. If you want Raid loot, well most guilds dont just hand that stuff out. You gotta put your hours in raiding. <br />
<br />
Next arguement:<br />
&quot;The rich get richer&quot;<br />
They should. Thats the game. Time spent is one thing, time spent productively is another. I can sit in the Bazaar on my character and make about 1K an hour on average, just selling stuff I tend to loot/win like LDoN drops, research materials, tradeskill materials, etc. However, I am hardly advancing my character that way. Pumping my time into AA is another story though. Heck, combining the 2 is even better. Skipp the greenies for TS and cash loot drops, and focus on areas where you can get reasonabl XP towards UPGRADES and reasopnable loot/pp towards UPGRADES. What is LDoN again? Oh yeah, a DKP system for EVERYONE. <br />
<br />
Remember this as well. The average Non-raider probably has a larger percentage of his online time available for &quot;straight XP&quot; compared to the average &quot;Raider&quot;. Wouldnt this balance things out somewhat?<br />
<br />
What else we got. Oh yeah, heres an oldie but a goodie:<br />
&quot;Advancement should not be tied to AA abilities&quot;<br />
Wake up. It already is. Period. Lets just take it one step further at this point. Lets STOP using GEAR as the ONLY ladder to a &quot;comptitivly advanced&quot; character, and use something that SOE actually WANTS to see, &quot;Time In Game&quot; as a form of advancement. No keys, no flags. Linear progression based on dedicated time spent. <br />
<br />
Let me ask you this. If they said RIGHT NOW you could get Balance of Nihil for 30 aa, would you save the points for it? I bet the answer varies. The variance is between those who will &quot;probably have a shot&quot; based on their current station in the game, and those who &quot;probably would have to wait a WHILE&quot; based on the same thing. Herin lies the problem. If something like this were available to EVERYONE (albeit taking time to achieve) then isnt that better than the common &quot;I cant get that focus, that 200 hp/mana item, that spell&quot; thing we see every  day? And isnt it better for the Raid level guys who alraeady have access to &quot;upper level&quot; stuff to have to establish NEW goals they would BE FORCED to committ time too in order to advance, instead of &quot;show up, bid, loot your Chronoburn Focus, thx&quot;? <br />
<br />
Hammer away. I am firmly committeded to this. I think its the BEST possible solution considering the current state of the game. Is this the direction I would choose if the game was new? Probably not, at least not to this degree. But RIGHT NOW, after 5 years of insane mudflation and a MASSIVE seperation of the player base that is hurting the game overall, I think its the most viable answer.<br />
<br />
Thats it. Flames, comments, ridicule, alternate suggestions, everything is welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Getting a spell per se. No not at all.<br />
<br />
But getting Aa abilities that would enhance the spells you get yes..<br />
<br />
If they added AA for Crit HoT ticks. And Additional Hot crit heals. (Up to triple heal) or greater base healing AA. For Rabid bear refresh reduction. For enchanced buff duration. For double attack for main Hand bonus damage. For Weapon skill ratings. For additional Dodge cap and other skill caps. For FT Cap increases. And regen cap increases. <br />
<br />
Any and all of that would be a wonderful idea. Build the charecter the way you want. With So damn many stages that it would take 2500 AA to max em all. But don't make them high cost. Make all of em 2-3 point incriments. For 1-2% gains. So that even a casual player cna get something new now and again.<br />
<br />
You want better healing. the option is there. you want an innate -45 to your spells cast. the option is there. You want a mutt that duel weilds innately the option is there. With Aa. Every damn thing that we want could be placed in incrimental fashion under aa skills and there would at least be a path to it. Sure the grind would be more. But that is better than No. you are fine. Move along now.<br />
<br />
But one change that would have to happen is that the Raid opened zones must be made to be fair xp with the non raid opened zones. No more gravy zones only for the elite. They get so many more advantages already.<br />
<br />
It is a good idea Blazz. But alot of it was covered over the years. And people always tend to scream no more grinding. But if the game was fun it wouldnt seem like a grind.. (Sigh it aint ever easy)<br />

The problem is, it's common wisdom to not bother with AA until you're done leveling.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AA must be used to make your toon stronger, absolutely not to balance the game or &quot;fix&quot; a bug the cheapest way.<br />
<br />
Anyway, till the stuborn guy who think that slow bring a lot in GoD is still in place, balance and fixes will be made via rare spells and AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the problem with this idea that I have is that Shaman already have to grind out a ton of aa's to be less effective at everything we do compared to the other classes we share those abilities with. druids/clerics get more out of healing aa's, all casters get more out of crit nukes, necros get more out of dot aa's by a long shot thanks to fd, buff aa's for a shaman are only there because of ONE SPELL, buff externsion and quick buff are aa's we wouldnt touch without our big hots, mages/necros/bst/(do sk's get pet aa's?) all get tons more out of pet aa's. <br />
<br />
shaman are in or near last place in everything we do, and as a result we have to pile on the aa's to remain in the race at all but even with those aa's we are still in last place. <br />
<br />
your idea is a good one on a lot of lvls but I for one am just burned out on the class I love being so underpowered in new content, I could care less about being gods of the old world when I add next to nothing to a new content raid/group.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think I am saying that there are already aa's in the game to help balance us that dont work, making shaman earn MORE aa's to finally bring us into balance is like begging soe to make shaman take a 50% exp penalty across the board for class balance when it should be free.<br />
<br />
super sleepy when writing this, I hope it makes sense</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't like your idea at all.<br />
I have a job, a life and I m part of a &quot;raiding guild&quot; on Bertoxx  :D  (/wave Blazz).<br />
I log on almost everyday for raid and that's all.<br />
Clearing Qvic, testing Txevu or clearing Inktu'ta and that's about all I have time to do during the week.<br />
I share the weekend between friends, family, eq and sleep  :D <br />
Even if drop rate of spell is ridiculous (1 ancient cani in my guild so far), I prefer getting spells during raids, like that I have a chance of getting ancient cani one day.<br />
<br />
I don't like the way SoE is using AA to &quot;give&quot; us things we should already have for free (/pet hold, buffing pet etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I could care less were the fix would be coming from, as long as it actually happened! If you think otherwise, you are just making a point for those saying it isn't that bad(which it certainly is).<br />
<br />
If I had to get 500 AAs to get what I have asked for on the Crucible, I would. This wouldn't be any different than getting an ancient spell, which many of the people here won't ever see. <br />
I myself like the idea of ancient spells, but I'd probably think different if I wouldn't be the first Shaman on my server to get it, so I might be biased.<br />
So, let me sum it up:<br />
Do I think that huge AAs and ancient spells should be used in a balance equation?<br />
No.<br />
Do I care anymore where the balance comes from at this point?<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">New expansions and AAs you have to buy shouldn't be required to balance any class.<br />
Then I guess you would be lvl 50 now, since KUNARK was an expansion. OK, guess you got Kunark, so your level 60 then, right? Cause POP was an expansion. This is how the game is set up now, man. <br />
I kinda-sorta agree with Jzak on that. Balance should be inante and not optional. But, unlike say, balancing around items / rare spells, anyone who can kill blue mobs can get AA.<br />

My point isnt whether this method of balance is right or wrong. My point is that after 5 years of the game, and given the current status of it, THERE ISNT ANOTHER LOGICAL WAY! Its already done this way now. <br />
<br />
There is already a MASSIVE difference in power between a 65 with 10                         aa and a 65 with 200 aa. Huge difference. And there SHOULD be is my point. So I am proposing we take that difference a step further. Rather than having keys, flags, raiding, gear, etc required to get certain advanced abilities (like the new canni, like any new spell really, like certain HUGE focus effects) I am saying tie these abilities to something anyone can achieve over time. <br />
AA must be used to make your toon stronger, absolutely not to balance the game or &quot;fix&quot; a bug the cheapest way.<br />
Please clarify this point. Dont spells make your toon stronger? Dont better focus items make your toon stronger? Doesnt AA already make your toon stronger? Gear? I am simply trying to eliminate a couple of the more &quot;difficult&quot; roads to making your toon stronger by replacing parts of it with something ANYONE can get, that is AA experience. I am not saying you should suddenly get some amazing new ability from AA, like Rez, or FD. I am talking about supplementing abilities we already have, in effect, &quot;balancing&quot; them further. <br />
<br />
Hear me out a sec. Does the average BoT shaman need a 2K heal? No. So why would a person at that stage of the games progression work towards it. Would a bigger nuke, or bigger DOTs with less aggro, or a stronger pet help that shaman? Yes, of course it would, so now he has legitimate goals that are not tied to spells or gear that is only dropping where he cannot possibly go. Now does the Vxed/Tipt/KT shaman need a better heal? Yes, he does. Could use the other things too, of course, but a heal would be important, so he could work his character in THAT direction. <br />
the problem with this idea that I have is that Shaman already have to grind out a ton of aa's to be less effective at everything we do compared to the other classes we share those abilities with. druids/clerics get more out of healing aa's, all casters get more out of crit nukes, necros get more out of dot aa's by a long shot thanks to fd, buff aa's for a shaman are only there because of ONE SPELL, buff externsion and quick buff are aa's we wouldnt touch without our big hots, mages/necros/bst/(do sk's get pet aa's?) all get tons more out of pet aa's. <br />
<br />
super sleepy when writing this, I hope it makes sense<br />
Makes perfect sense, in fact, its the single best arguement I have seen against my idea. But lets not look at it from the point of what we SHOULD have or think we DESERVE as a class. Lets look at it from the CURRENT state of the game. Lets face the facts here, as the game is right now, after 5+ years of mudflation, spellflation, raidflation, etc etc, there just isnt an easy solution. The developers, right or wrong, dont give us a bigger heal because it would fuirther de-value Clerics at the mid-range level of the game. Bigger dots would make necros less valuable. Bigger nukes in combo with bigger heals would make druids less powerful. SOE hates doing this kind of thing, just look back at their history. But if we tied some attractive attributes to AA for all classes, like some of the soloability Clerics want, some of the whatever else it is Druids and Necros etc want, and made them freely available to anyone with the time to invest (rather than tieing them to rare dropped spells and insane stats and abilities on gear in zones 90% of the people wont even see until WAY later down the road) we are, in essence, creating a form of &quot;Build Your Toon&quot;. <br />
<br />
Heres an example for myself. I have 2 roads. More nuking power, more healing power. Either way I go its gonna be a good month or more of grinding (dont want to hear about this, either, grinding is, and always has been, and always will be, a big part of EQ and any other successful long term MMORPG) to earn one or the other. I would rather not be a &quot;primary&quot; healer, so I pick nukes. My buddy VeeshenMurtak likes to heal, so he picks healing. 60 or so AA later, I have a 1200 damage fast nuke and he has a 2100 hp fast heal. And neither of us had to get lucky on a drop, or get a particular focus. We didnt add any ability we didnt have. We enhanced the ones we have FURTHER than traditional AA already do. Also, understand, that each of thes paths would require a minimum in the curent AA system. FoM3 for bigger nukes, AHA3 for the heal. They wouldnt be new spells. They would simply be enhancements to current spells, additional stuff right on the top of our current line up. <br />
<br />
Heck, you could even make it so that once you chose a particular &quot;path&quot; the other paths INCREASED in the numbers needed to get them. Like if you get Advanced Fast Healing 3 for 10-20-30, Advanced Fast Nuke goes from 10-20-30 to 15-30-45. And vice versa. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I just dont see any other way. The game is too unbalanced right now. The difference between a Qvic shaman (or any character) and a mid PoP shaman is staggering, yet they are both the same essential level. Heck, even if they both have the current same exact AAs, the difference in power is still disgusingly staggering. I am not saying it shoudlnt be like this, I am a strong supporter of &quot;Raid Level Stuff for Raiders&quot;, but the mid PoP guys have no options for advancement within reasonm and the raid level guys are fighting things that could solo all of BoT, so then need a bit of a nudge as well. Giving people a bigger excuse to play longer is exactly what SOE wants. And overall, I think its what people want, visible, achievable goals, even if they are a ways off, at least they are tangible, and not tied to some flag that only 5% of the people will get until the next 2 expansion and level 75 come along.</div></div><hr />

It's already working like that Blazz.<br />

Does the txevu/inktu'ta/tacvi shaman need it ? Yes.<br />
Problem solved, the rune doesn't drop in BoT..<br />
<br />

Does the txevu/inktu'ta/tacvi shaman need it ? Yes.<br />
Problem solved, the chaos rune doesn't drop in BoT..<br />
<br />
Now, if you put that on an AA, everybody and their mom will get it.<br />
<br />
The issues for shaman are different depending they are raiding or not, above 60 or not etc..<br />
I m not sure what are the issues of the average bot shaman, but I m sure that fixing my issue will unbalance the average BoT shaman, making him more powerful than needed.<br />
<br />
And I think that's the heart of the problem, balancing the shaman class, not only the raiding one or non raiding one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Classes should be balanced against each other with and without AAs.<br />
<br />
If you use AAs to balance super high end shaman, then they will fall even more out of balance since many of us don't xp much.  We raid.  I get about 2 AA per week.  If you propose 30AA abilities to balance us, I'll see shaman balance some time in 2006.  No thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Juujuu, I understand your point with raiding time vs. xp time.  At the same time I find it odd that we can accept balancing done by levels or by gear- but not AA.  Alternate Advancement was brought out with the Luclin expansion, so its not exactly cutting edge now.  Game content and balancing are already centered around AA's.  <br />
<br />
How many players want a 65 tank w/ 0 defensive AA's to come tank in Sol Ro+?<br />
<br />
How many rangers get spammed for groups before AM3 and EQ?<br />
<br />
Would high-end guilds take a rogue w/ o the Escape AA?<br />
<br />
How many high-end raid shamans do not have Canni V?<br />
<br />
We are not done after leveling to 65, no one is- as there are AA's and gear that must be acquired in order to advance further in content.  High-end guilds up their requirements as they progress further.  With OoW on the horizon, are you not going to level to 70?  I know how much raiding sucks up your xp time, but that is part of the reason why we have access to higher xp zones.   <br />
<br />
<br />
New expansions and AAs you have to buy shouldn't be required to balance any class.<br />
<br />
Your very quote signifies that all classes are broken.  A 65 warrior cannot tank High-end PoP/GoD content w/ 0 defensive AA's wearing crafted armor.  New expansions and AA's should balance you for new content.  Shamans broke down in GoD.  I do fine in PoP, LDoN hard, Barindu, and Ferubi.  Heck, I can even solo in zones like PoFire, Barindu, and Kod'taz.  It's kind of hard explaining to other players that we are a broken class when we can bypass a group in high-end zones.  AA's, levels, gear, and spells should balance us for the content it was released in- period.<br />
<br />
I kinda-sorta agree with Jzak on that. Balance should be inante and not optional. But, unlike say, balancing around items / rare spells, anyone who can kill blue mobs can get AA.<br />
<br />
The problem is, it's common wisdom to not bother with AA until you're done leveling. Thus, by implimenting balance as AA, you're essentially saying &quot;stop leveling to become a full Shaman&quot;, or you're saying &quot;stay broken for 70 levels and then grind until you're the class you rolled up&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the common wisdom for our class- others do not have the luxury to grind to 65 and then work on aa's/gear.  I took the road less traveled when leveling.  Before I was 60 I had my Baron title, before I was 65 I was Venerable- there were many AA's that I felt would useful enough to slow down my leveling to get.  Did I stop my character's advancement- no.  Whether its by gear, spells, aa's, or levels- my character was advancing.  AA's become available as early as 51, then 55, then 60, and so on.  The option is there- if we choose to avoid them it is our choice.  In doing so, we also accept the concequences for delaying that area of advancement.  I highly doubt that the majority of classes will be able to advance to level 70 without stopping at some point of the way to get AA's, spells, or gear.  At this stage in the game, AA's are no longer neat things to get when you have nothing else to do- they are part of character advancement.<br />
<br />
Balancing the classes is not a black and white issue.  The low-end shaman does not wake up one morning as an uber.  AA's are part of that balancing act because time and time again we have pointed out that what would balance a high-end shaman out could very well make a low-end shaman overpowered.  With AA's we can get past that roadblock,  to be honest I would rather rely on AA's for healing than wait for a rare spell drop.  I would rather rely on AA's than wait on a lucky roll on a gear drop.  EQ is about the journey, not the final destination- there is no &quot;You have won EQ&quot; message.  People are still on that journey, and that is why the game is still alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gromble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hi all,<br />
I dont post much here, but i do read the forums daily and i was wondering this idea:<br />
<br />
What if the zones such as kt and higher had some sort of zone modifier on them that affects the % of the heals of a certain class. Like a modifier that when in that zone now shaman heals do 150% of normal healing. <br />
<br />
That way no work would need to be done and you wouldnt be super powerful in the lower zones, but you could work in the ones you lack in.<br />
<br />
is this a undesirable request? i dont think i have ever seen this idea before, but if it has been brought up, accept my apologies.<br />

<br />
They did rebalance GoD- mobs hit for less more often and have gained a sizable amount of hitpoints.  If you go into Tipt, Vxed, and Kod'taz with the avg group (not chanter pet of doom) it maintains the abilites we have seen in PoP- under a slightly more stressful environment (new content).  The developers even went as fas as nerfing the chanter's charm ability so it is not feasible.  Clerics still have the solid advantage that they can rez which is necessary in the trials due to mob respawning.  <br />
<br />
What I think is also part of the problem was that, with PoP, we saw the group makeup change.  I played a druid during Luclin, and I rarely had a slower in my group.  For the content that I experienced, slow was not a necessity- it was a bonus.  When PoP opened up, slow became a necessity simple because healers had a hard time keeping tanks up without it.  We were given a new role in these groups- where before we might have functioned as the main healer for a group (with slow &quot;augmentation&quot;, we now functioned as the slower.  Our popularity in groups did not change, but our role did.  <br />
<br />
New content, from a business standpoint, has to be a timesink.  A company needs to know that if they invest time/money into a new product that the consumer will buy the product and use it for a set degree of time.  If that number breaks down to a use time of 6 months- then the expansion's content has to hold out for 6 months.  It's a simple breakdown in game.  Player X has to be at Y progression level to get to content Z, Player X then has to be at Y+50 progression level to get to content Z+1.  If you narrow the margin too much then you risk the chance that Player X will wisen up to it and skip Y content because they can get by in Z content long enough to upgrade.<br />
<br />
So now the question is what did GoD give players?<br />
<br />
- PoK 2.0 (aka Abysmal Sea) : multiple tradeskill vendors with large<br />
   inventories to make tradeskill easier along with less of the PoK junkies.<br />
<br />
- PoV/PoS 2.0 (aka Natimbi) : so-so xp and some semi/good upgrades.<br />
<br />
- BoT 2.0 (aka Qinimi) : better drops, better xp, and some variety of aug<br />
   drops<br />
<br />
- Tactics 2.0 (aka Barindu) : harder than Tactics, but the gear upgrades<br />
   are better.<br />
<br />
- Non-flagged Sol Ro/Elems (aka Ferubi) : xp is on par with Sol Ro/Elems<br />
   as well as the one groupable drops- doesn't require any flags to<br />
   access.<br />
<br />
- One groupable Elemental Raid drop zone (aka Kod'taz) : requires 6<br />
  flags to get, but all are one groupable.  Single group zone drops are on<br />
  par with Elemental/lower Time.<br />
<br />
Now obviously, this could have been packaged better- dreary zones and a diversity of 6-10 npc models dulls gameplay down tremendously, but the intention of the expansion is there.  I didn't list Riwwi, but you could call it the &quot;new&quot; LDoN normal as the drops fall somewhere between the current LDoN normal and LDoN hard.  It answered (if in a distorted manner) the demand that the non-raider had with wanting upper tier gear/xp without the use of a raid.  The difficulty is set to where it is not impossible, but at the same time, difficult enough to not offset the accomplishments that a guild might have made by raiding.</div></div><hr />

Now, if you put that on an AA, everybody and their mom will get it.<br />
I agree to the principle of what you are saying Wuud (/wave back at ya, BTW) but I also think that a big part of the non-raiding portion of this game is a lack of visible goals for those who choose that play style. <br />
<br />
How many AAs do you have Wuud? How many does the average shaman in PR have? I would guess its FAR more than the average BoT shamans, and it should be. Those people wont be getting the abilities I am proposig anytime too soon. They probably havent even started the FoM path, and if they are more than half done with the Healing AAs at 75 I would be suprised. They also do not have access to the MEGA high XP available in some of the more advanced zones. <br />
<br />
Also, I disagree about the Canni (although I agree with the BoN assessment). Cannni 4 is totally obsolete at all levels, even straight mid-level Bazaar geared shaman. There are some upgrades that should just be put on Vendors or made SUPER common because the game has moved WELL past them. Canni 4 is one of those. Keep the ratio, hell lower it, but make it more convienet to use than spammage, especially with the constant-move content SOE seems so prone ot making these days. <br />
<br />
Also, I am not saying BoN should be removed in favor of an AA. I am saying if you WANT it to have the same negative resist modifier as Malos, pay some AA and get it. I want abilities ENHANCED, not given away. If you want an extra 300 on your biggest heal, pay the AA and get it. If you dont need it, dont pay. But allow it to be applied to Tnargs or Daluda or the OoW one.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and we want to have them propagate that behavior even though it's wrong?  NO.  Examples of what they can do to balance classes WITHOUT requiring new expansions or AA.  <br />
<br />
1. They can make new spells/tomes available on vendors for all to buy<br />
<br />
2. They can increase the power of existing spells/abilities<br />
<br />
3. They can make innate bonuses for classes (monks used to have great mitigation, for no logical reason, and they [rightly] removed it) to improve abilities<br />
<br />
4. They can add or alter AAs in the Archetype or Class sections and that might be acceptable but pushing it<br />
<br />
5. Fix bugs (like DoT aggro) to improve the abilities of classes<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't require people to buy ANOTHER expansion and grind out MORE AAs to balance their class.  Like someone said in a response, AAs make your class more powerful, they're not supposed to bring you on par with everyone else.</div></div><hr />

The game you want to play is Diablo 2, where you get everything handed to you on a platter. This is Everquest, and advancement still requires SOME effort. <br />
<br />
If you dont want to go to Gates, then your balanced now, bubba, and don't try to tell me different. Shaman are WAY overpowered for lower end stuff like Tier 2 and 3 PoP XP groups, LDoN Normal, etc. To give that level of Shaman even MORE as a &quot;hand out&quot; WOULD be unbalancing. <br />
<br />
I dunno, maybe  Wuud is right. Maybe the stuff that the &quot;higher end&quot; shaman need should ONLY be available in the areas they need it. <br />
<br />
I do like the &quot;Zone Modifier&quot; idea though, but I am not sure it could be coded effectivly for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">How many players want a 65 tank w/ 0 defensive AA's to come tank in Sol Ro+?<br />
<br />
<br />
And what about a 65 tank with 400 AA and 6k hp unbuffed ? I prefer tanking than inviting one of those (at least I m sure of who will get aggro and keep it)<br />
<br />
My point is that the number of AA means nothing.<br />
I don't think that because I m slacking in AA behind shamans in my guild I m worse than them. That just means they have more time between raids (and didn't take a break during ldon like me  :D ).<br />
<br />
What about AA's that are ONLY available after you have access to a certain zone?  That way not everyone and thier brother would get the spells/abilities just by grinding AA and the people who needed them had access to them at an appropriate time.<br />
<br />
Or what about a spell that drop only in those zone (no drop)  ? Prolly better than an AA no ? No need to use that precious xp hehe<br />
<br />
They did rebalance GoD- mobs hit for less more often and have gained a sizable amount of hitpoints.  If you go into Tipt, Vxed, and Kod'taz with the avg group (not chanter pet of doom) it maintains the abilites we have seen in PoP- under a slightly more stressful environment (new content).  <br />
<br />
Maybe for the average BoT shaman freshly flagged.<br />
But for a group of person that are dayly raiding in qvic and beyond, they still die pretty fast.<br />
My balance of the nihil (1.5 min) never fade in those xp zone and bane barely does all the ticks.. for what lame dps it worth anyway..<br />
And lowering DPS doesn't help us at all. That just mean we are less needed (mob mitigating and doing less dmg = no need of a shaman)<br />
<br />
As for raiding, we clearing Qvic with 30 folks average. Trash mob last 10 sec MAX (I have some logs if you want !).<br />
I can sometimes land a Velium strike (when not resisted..) if I m not busy casting a buff on some late raider.<br />
In Luclin / pop we were proud of slowing mobs, now I prefer nuking than slowing, at least I have the feeling I m helping the raid.<br />
<br />
Only thing that left me are : my cures !!! yup.. I can cure my group with blood of nadox, disinfecting aura and RGC.<br />
well, cleric often cure faster and better, but they have to do the real job.. aka healing.<br />
<br />
When I read that we are not slower from Banditman on the SoE forum, I wonder why they put this effect on our BP then.. Like if I needed a slow that last more than 10 secondes. thanks, drive through.<br />

<br />
Your answers to the problem didn't fix it though.  We are not asking for AA's to balance out ALL content- just later content where it is highly likely that those players who are experiencing it have the AA count already.  Your answers treat the balancing as if it is a blanket fix that is needed where its not.  Shamans can heal just fine for lower end content- its the high-end where things begin to unravel.  While a blanket fix may work for the high-end, it trivializes the lower end.  Lower end content trivials out fast enough, there is no reason to speed up the process.  If the Kod'taz shaman needs a 2k heal- then give the Kod'taz shaman a 2k heal.  If the BoT shaman needs a 1300 heal- don't give him a 2k one- give him the 1300 one.</div></div><hr />

But that isn't what was said.. what was said was :<br />

I think you missed my point completely.  I didn't mean that a higher AA<br />
count determines your playing ability.   I was merely pointing out that as we progress to later content we expect a certain level of aa's/gear/and level.  I am sure your guild has an application requirement/recommendation list right?  When I look to form a group- I am not looking for the 400+ aa uber tank, but if I am forming a trial/Elemental group I expect that a tank will have taken the time to grind out some sort of defensive aa's.  In order for them to progress and survive in later content- they have to.  That looks to me that class balance is already being determined by aa's.  <br />
<br />
As far as the Group/Raid content goes- you are comparing apples to oranges.  What works for group content may not work for raid content, and vice versa.  This goes back to the point I am trying to make that balancing is not a blanket fix- we have shamans spread out over multiple levels of content.  What may fix one could very well overpower the other.  Attaching balancing issues to AA's could work since a player's AA count tends to go up as they progress through later content.</div></div><hr />

I have 230 AA as of today (ding!) 227 used 3 banked. I took a break during LDON expansion (we finished PoP and I needed to rest a bit).<br />
Average shaman in PR is close of 400+AA I think (just looked on eqranking).<br />
And if you look on eqranking, you can find a shaman with 3.1k hp and almost 800 AA. Ok, he is prolly the only one like that hehe. But he is my point !!! :p<br />
The best week I make like 8 AA.. <br />
75 AA would take me 3 months or so.. Or I could get fired at my job and play all the day  :D <br />

<br />
<br />
For cani4, I agree. I rarely mem it. When I have it up, it's after a wipe, when we need to get mana fast to have a shoot at that #@!!~#@ again before he depop.<br />
Mana regen from gear, C5, SD and bard song are usually enough for me during raid (with the cani5 after a mass focus)<br />
But, show me an average bot shaman that doesn't buy a Kei in pok ?<br />

An other AA giving a healing bonus ? then all &quot;healing&quot; class should get it. If so, mob must be balanced with that new healing power again.. And we'll fall again in the &quot;sucking healer&quot; box. I seriously prefer a new spell, that only us get, that gives us a boost other class don't get, like that we can hope beeing more balanced versus content and less versus other priest class *cough* :) <br />
<br />
An AA that adjust spell resist, why not. But not an AA that gives a 1.5 sec cast slow ??<br />
The advantage of BoN is not the resist (at least for me), it's the casting time. I can slow the mob before it dies =)<br />
Sure the resist adjust helps in lower GoD, but you still need a malos in Txevu on most mob hehe. <br />
You can be lucky (or suicidal enough on a bad pull) and cast it and have it land, but you'll get aggro.. and you don't want aggro from those trash mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That all depends on where the Developer's place the &quot;acceptable&quot; mark of healing.  I had brought up the issue in a prior thread of shamans that were complaining about healing ability, but had not bothered to get healing aa's/healing focus.  The retort I got back was:<br />
<br />
- there are better, more beneficial AA's to get first<br />
<br />
- my healing should be efficent &quot;right out of the box&quot;<br />
<br />
- druid's and cleric's healing is fine w/o AA's<br />
<br />
It looks to me that the Devs stick the healing mark below the efficiency of a cleric, and in a lot of the content- below a druid's.  This is &quot;balancing at work&quot;.  If the mark is set to where only a max AA'ed cleric can heal- then obviously the content is broken.  Adding another level of healing aa's may not change the &quot;healing mark&quot; needed if the druid/cleric healing is efficient enough to do the job.  At the same time, with AA's I doubt we would get more cleric rants like &quot; Shamans will take all the BoT groups with the new heal.&quot;  AAxp scales up with the zone difficulty, so while many of us at the top end can grind out tons of AA's it is unlikely that the BoT shaman will grind out all of his healing AA's.  The content he is in does not warrant the time to skill up that area to that level.<br />
<br />
Case in Point:  Grinding to 65 then AA'ing.<br />
<br />
Currently a shaman can grind straight to 65 then AA.  A shaman could trivialize a lot of content around them if they stopped at 60 or 62 to aa grind, but due to the aa's not being a necessity at that point of content-the general populous bypasses it. <br />
<br />
We both agree that AA's due not make someone a stellar player, I am merely looking at them as a way to alleviate issues at the top.  Spells are great, but currently come in 2 flavors: drop and no-drop.  If spells are no-drop you risk the chance that they will not get out to the players that need them.  It gets hard to balance content around them if you are not sure if those players have them.  Droppable spells mean you risk the chance that they will get out to the players who do not need them, and you risk pre-trivialization in this matter.</div></div><hr />

I am simply trying to eliminate a couple of the more &quot;difficult&quot; roads to making your toon stronger by replacing parts of it with something ANYONE can get, that is AA experience. I am not saying you should suddenly get some amazing new ability from AA, like Rez, or FD. I am talking about supplementing abilities we already have, in effect, &quot;balancing&quot; them further.<br />
<br />
Having to pay 20AA so your pet can be affected by group spells/mgb, it's a cheap bug fix. Since Kunark, since the first group spell came live, we (all the pet classes, not only shamans) were crying out loud that it should NOT be like this.<br />
<br />
6 extensions later, SoE finally corrected this bug... via an AA. That's what I call a cheap fix. Claiming it was intended since Kunark came live (when at this time, some devs said it was more a technical issue than something they doesn't want to implement) and this AA is a boon to the pet classes is a joke and a total screwing. Yeah, sure, and in OoW, shamans will have to pay 40AA just to have their pet with innate DW. Personnally, I don't care for myself, I buff my pet only when I solo, but tell this to mages, necros and beastlords.<br />
<br />
About spells, simply &quot;summon compagnion&quot;. This spells was introduced just because pathings in some dungeons was so tremendous that you'll lose your pet running &quot;somewhere&quot;. Well, at least this spell is not rare or expensive, but still, it's a cheap fix.<br />
<br />
If SoE introduce a shaman only AA who will scale our healing at the same level than druids, it would be a joke. Sure, every shaman will have access to the &quot;balance&quot;, but having to grind exp just to benefit a fix on something SoE screwed totally, I disagree.<br />
<br />
Or, they introduce a new AA who will drastically reduce all dots aggro, same thing. It's a bug (whatever they say) and using AA to fix it is not acceptable.<br />
<br />
Grinding Exp for Canni5, SC Subtetly, Fury of Magic, Healing Gift, Healing Adept, etc, etc, etc..., no prob, these are not bug fixes or balance ;).<br />
<br />
I'm not saying SoE will do these things ;), it's just some exemple to explain why spells/aa should never be used to &quot;balance&quot; or &quot;fix&quot; something ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Upgrading your shamans with AA, ok :), it's the way it should work :).<br />
<br />
Balancing and fixing bug ? No. Plain and simple :p<br />
<br />
Go buy a car, the one of your dreams :p<br />
<br />
Now, to have some &quot;goodies&quot; such as special seats, climat, a turbo instead a common motor, etc, etc, etc... you have to pay for this and it's totally normal (I think :p).<br />
<br />
But your brand new dream car has only 3 wheels, you must fix the last one yourself by your own... sorry, I go to the next garage where the cars are sold &quot;complete&quot; :D.<br />
<br />
Except that with the bugs and unbalance in EQ, we have no choice (except to stop playing/paying), we are stuck with SoE :p.<br />
<br />
I never said that a fix or balance will be bad, just that using spells and AA, where you have to exp a lot (or a little less) for something who must be corrected for free is a cheap way and a good manner to screws their customer in some way.<br />
<br />
If SoE decide to go this way, certainly most people will grind the exp needed, myself included ;), no doubt about this.<br />
<br />
But while you are &quot;fixing&quot; yourself the bugs and inbalance that SoE made, you still pay your accounts. You use time to grind this needed exp and so, you pay for your fix and balance. It's like the guy who say you &quot;you have to mount the last wheel yourself, but be happy, we provides you the tools needed :D... for a small fee&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">BTW thanks for the string of anon negative rep bumps, you sad, close minded people. Keep em coming, further proof that the little people with the little heads have little clue. If you disagree, have the sac to sign your name and tell me why.<br />
<br />
I think its dangerous for you to call others &quot;close minded&quot; since you seem like you are so firmly set in your beliefs that you yourself is not really open to discussion about it. I do agree though that people should be man/woman enough to atleast sign any rep-bumps.<br />
<br />
Back to the main issue - I dont agree at all with your suggestion. It also seems like you are confusing balancing and advancement.<br />
<br />
Balancing shouldnt be done with AAs because the ability of getting AAs will vary greatly from one level 65 to another yet they both have access to a lot of the same zones. So unless you also want to propose that access to zones should be dependant on AAs it will cause (and already is causing) problems. And we all know that the zones will be tuned towards players that have most if not all of the &quot;AA-spells&quot; or else they would quickly be massively farmed by the people that gets AAs very fast.<br />
<br />
I think the next expansion is a golden (and probably the last) opportunity for SOE to bring back the fun in the game for everyone. Just think how it would be if fighting somewhere was actually fun and not just required to proceed to the next trail/zone where you get to do the same again. <br />
<br />
I honestly think that all spells should be available relatively easy. Maybe slightly limited by requiring that you have to go to XYZ zone and kill 30 mobs first. Then the game designers would have a much better idea about what spells everyone has and that should theoretically enable them to make encounters much more balanced for everyone.<br />
<br />
AAs should be left for secondary things like runspeed, better metabolism and the like. And they could also make some exclusive ones that maybe enabled you to summon a different looking pet, added a visual effect to some of your armor or maybe even a cloak or something.<br />
<br />
The AAs in the game already have messed it up enough. No reason to make it even worse.<br />
<br />
But EQ has to start being fun again for everyone or the ones that are not enjoying it will leave when other options become available. CoH came close for me but didnt quite make it so I havent cancelled yet. But when WoW comes out I honestly dont expect to have time to play EQ.</div></div><hr />

Fantastic post Spirit, if it lets me bump you, I will. But I think I am being open minded here. I have already conceded a number of points. But actually, what you said later in the post is closer to home. <br />
Back to the main issue - I dont agree at all with your suggestion. It also seems like you are confusing balancing and advancement.<br />
I will absolutely agree. I use the term &quot;balance&quot; because this is stuff that some members of our class feel we DESERVE. However, I, on the other hand, feel that far far less would be adequate in the overall scheme, but creating the ability to advance further in an area of choice would be a nice way to &quot;advance&quot;. I guess this theory of mine works best with Shaman because we are SO versitile, there are just a lot of ways to play a shaman. Personally, I do not wish to be a healer. If they offered me an AA that would add 300 points to my best heal, I would pass for a LONG time. I want a differnt role. <br />
<br />
Anyway, in an effort to be open minded and admit when I am mistaken, I change my thread to &quot;a better way to Advance after 5 years&quot;, hows that. heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">An other AA giving a healing bonus ? then all &quot;healing&quot; class should get it. If so, mob must be balanced with that new healing power again.. And we'll fall again in the &quot;sucking healer&quot; box. I seriously prefer a new spell, that only us get, that gives us a boost other class don't get, like that we can hope beeing more balanced versus content and less versus other priest class *cough* :) <br />
Heres how I see this though. If the Cleric is 100 (full glass) and we are 47 (half a glass) then adding some to the clerics cup is just gonna overflow it (as it is now, many cleric heals over-heal the tanks, mostly because you dont DARE let them get any lower) while bringing ours up to an acceptable (to me) 70% full. I dunno if anyone followed that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">In other words...if we are broken then we should be fixed for free.<br />
Define broken please. <br />
<br />
I will admit there are issues that sholuld absolutely be addressed and fixed for free. I do not agree with every shaman on every one of them. Some think we need more healing. Some think we need more DPS. Some think we need better buffs and debuffs. Are we broken in all these areas, to the point where ALL of them should be fixed to make us viable again? Of course not. The problem is they cannot fix &quot;one&quot; area without pissing off a bunch of people who suffer from terminal &quot;New Rope&quot; symdrome.<br />
<br />
In my last post, I admitted that perhaps &quot;balance&quot; isnt the right word. What I am really trying to do is give each individual a way to balance himself in HIS/HER OWN MIND. Not getting any healing upgrades from what we have won't break my heart, but MANY shamans feel its THE most important issue. Some shamans could care less if they ever get a 1200 damage fast nuke, but *I* think thats important. <br />
<br />
The biggest drawback with this theoretical system overall is implementing it for all classes, especially the &quot;specialty&quot; classes that are basically already &quot;working as intended&quot;. Maybe you give Clerics a chance to get a slow (like 40%) and a chance to get more melee power like double-attack. Maybe Wizards get an option to work toward bigger resist modifiers, or a better way to mitigate aggro. I dunno, would take some serious thinking and input from all classes. <br />
<br />
But a big problem is that in the CURRENT state of the game, they simply cannot start handing out care-package upgrades. The game is trivial enough now. <br />
<br />
So change the word &quot;balance&quot; to &quot;chosen path of advancement&quot; in all cases throughout this thread :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Actually, although there are a minority of folk who exclusively raid, most of the members of high-end raiding guilds ALSO have lots of AA and spend a good bit of time grinding.  Just having access to XP-rich zones like Plane of Fire is a huge benefit - my AA rate per hour more than doubled there relative to pre-elemental zones.  I know others have posted to this thread who JUST raid, but I firmly believe that those people are in a small minority.<br />
<br />
However, I don't agree that all new abilities should be tied to AA.  Any AA ability is pretty much going to go to everyone equally.  People should be forced to spend time in the new zones to get the new abilities.  That does NOT mean they should be forced to RAID to get the new abilities.<br />
<br />
The LDON curse-based DOTs are a good example.  Anyone can earn those, it just takes some time spend in LDON.  Don't want to spend the time in LDON?  Don't expect to get your LDON curse dots...<br />
<br />
POP spells were not done quite as nicely.  The non-raider alternative for POP spells was to buy them in the bazaar.  I did just that, in fact, because my guild was not doing POP at the time and I wanted the spells.  Sure, it takes a while to farm 100-150k plat, but I estimate it didn't take me more than 20-30 hours of gameplay (I did it mostly in Droga, before you ask).  Compare that to how long I'd have to raid to get that many runes and turn them in, and it's actually a pretty favorable ratio, and I could do it all solo and at my own pace.  However, the flaw in the POP scheme is that you're not required to spend any time in POP to buy the spell, you can grind plat anywhere to raise the money.  LDON's approach is superior, IMO.<br />
<br />
From what I understand by reading the Crucible, GoD spells require you to raid, Period.  There is no alternative for casual players because the spells are nodrop.  That's a problem.<br />
<br />
For OOW, I'd like to see the ability to get spell drops from high-end mobs to satisfy the raiders, but also a favor-like system that allows non-raiders to grind in OOW, gather items, and turn them in for favor points usable to purchase spells and other items.  That lets the developers put 1/100, or 1/500, or 1/1000 of a spell on a given mob.</div></div><hr />

I agree here. One reason I am promoting this type of advancement system is so that the &quot;average&quot; player has a path toward a goal that is actually visible, albeit at the end of a LONG road. <br />
<br />
I guess I truly do agree that the term &quot;balance&quot; isnt the right one to use here. Its not actually what I meant. But we also have to remember that what WE think is balance, SOE may not see that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">A Fix is needed.<br />
<br />
The details involved are simple. <br />
<br />
How to fix us without infringing too much upon other classes. <br />
How to give meaningful upgrades to shaman that will not make the game trivial outside of the limited area that requires the upgrades. (Top of PoP, GoD and for some hard LDON)<br />
<br />
The best solution to this honestly is allow what Blazz has proposed. Make a path for these upgrades available. But limit the availability to those that the upgrade is truly important too. You limit this by aa cost and pre requsites. People now adays can get an AA an hour in a good group. Elementals can get it faster but for the average shmoe who is only looking for xp.  A hour an AA is a good high baseline. So lets look at a healing improvement AA Path.<br />
<br />
We get two Paths in EQ as it stands. Healing Gift And Healing Adept.  Other does a base increase One does crits. In raw power. Then in PoP we get an increase in both of those. For crit frequency and More healing increase. Excluding Healing focus items Tnarqs does how much with Max healing AA?  Base is 1300 heal for 450 mana. With healing AA maxed it is  1547 Hps healed for 450 mana (I think it is 19% increase with max AA) With a 16% chance for double value healed on a crit. <br />
<br />
Now if they had a requirement for a new aa line that increased Healing Adept (I think that is the base heal increase) by 2% per 3 AA. and had 10 full ranks of it. You could with Tnarqs heal in effect before healing focus 1807 hps for 450 mana once you maxed those 30 AA. <br />
<br />
<br />
1550 for 490 for daludas mending with normal as it stands now healing aa maxed is  1845 hps healed for 490 mana. If they made the healing AA as proposed by myself it would be 2155 hps healed.  Both those spells for 30 Aa spent. after maxing the Luclin and PoP AA. Add another 10 ranks of it 2% increase per 3 aa for the Crit heal one and you would have a 26% chance of any of those being a crit heal. <br />
<br />
This would put us right in line. But only if you really wanted the ability to heal better. <br />
<br />
What else they need to do is add a Base increase for nukes for us the same way. And one for Dots base per tick the same way. Then the people who want better nukes have a upgrade path. The dotters do too. And the healers can specialise in it as well.  Add an upgrade path for meele. And for rabid bear effects and reuse timer or duration.  For main hand weapon damage and Double attack skills. <br />
<br />
It wouldnt be balance per say between classes. But it would be player balance. If you have many options for useful skills that your chosen class can pick then people would stop bitching so much. Keep them focused along class lines. So that it doesnt become tankmagequest but give each person the ability to head in the path they want with effort. that doesnt require 60 of your closest friends to succeed. <br />

<br />
In a perfect game, we could put all the spells on vendors and players would not get them until they needed them for the content they were in.  Players will figure out a way to get their alts/friends to the particular spots in the zone needed to get the spells/gear.<br />
<br />
Case in Point:<br />
<br />
My monk alt got his Shackle of Tynnium at level 8.<br />
My monk alt got his Ice Burrower Tunic at level 8.<br />
My monk alt got some no-drop belt from DN at lvl 8.<br />
My monk got the Droga Bracer at lvl 20.<br />
<br />
My druid alt got most of his Elysian Gear at lvl 7.<br />
My druid alt got his Droga shoulder at lvl 18.<br />
<br />
I rarely play my alts, but I like to twink them out with items that are well and beyond their reach.  To me it is a challenge to see if I can get a low level alt to X hardcore zone to loot Y piece of gear.<br />
<br />
The point I am getting at is &quot;if there is a will- there is a way&quot;.  New spells are great, and we wouldn't have any issues getting them if people used them in the necessary content.  While lower PoP is trivial to many- its not trivial to all.  There are still new players out there that have not leveled to 65 yet- they require balanced content as much as we do.  What may balance a class out in later content could very well unbalance a class in older content.  The only requirement for gear/spells is a level- they make no distinction between a low-end shaman just witnessing BoT or the high-end shaman experiencing Qvic.  If the drop rate is too good, then stuff begins to rot.  Once this happens, players begin to hang out in the zones to pick up some freebies- we saw it with some of the trials' gear drops on Brell from Sewers/Vxed. <br />
<br />
The game in its current form does not distinguish between someone who just hit 65 and someone who has been 65 for over a year.  Good/Bad player ability aside there is just some content that people are not ready for, and on the same note there are some balancing issues that do not apply to everyone.  Blanket Class fixes do not work.  Keys and Flags do not work.  We need to find something that does work.</div></div><hr />

I think the system would work well, and most of it is already in place.  Devs would have to keep a close eye on all classes AA abilities though.  If we can scale up higher on the healing chart there needs to be advantages to clerics/druids to warrant the action.   The classes that I think would hurt the most would be your &quot;one-trick pony&quot; classes, so there needs to be a sizable upgrade to their abilities.  Things like aa's that would &quot;perma pet&quot; cleric's summoned hammers, increased proc rates, double attack, enhanced mitigation- yada yada.  Same would apply to others like warriors,rogues,wizzies (all very much one trick ponies).  There are definitely lots of ideas out, and we do risk further blending of the classes.  I think in this regard we would see a new view of class dependence.  No longer would guilds require 12 clerics, 8 druids, and 6 shamans- now they just require 26 healers (any variety).  Players would look to rep an ability when someone leaves- not a class.</div></div><hr />

Then If they had the choice to make dots better through AA. Maybe faster acting. Or more damage per tick whatever. <br />
<br />
Druids to be honest really don't need a whole lot that couldnt be covered by AA gains like above. Want to heal better work for it. And so On.<br />
<br />
As for meele and The hybrids. well. Same type of thing. But geared towards meele. More attacks. Higher worn regen and worn attack through AA. (Exceed the caps) Leveraged str ability. Take away the soft caps through AA.  Better percentage to hits. Free up disc timers with AA.  Take away FT cap for hybrids with AA purchases. <br />
<br />
Hell make a System to allow certain spells to be cast stright from Book Or Added to hotkey for AA. (Self only spells maybe.)<br />

EQ has to keep the paths of advancement open for all players. Not just people willing to raid. And Part of that path has to add power to the charecters you play. Not just start a new twink.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I don't know if its been said already, but I don't think its HOW upgrades will be given to shamans, but WILL upgrades be given to shamans. This does look like a viable way of providing the upgrades but I don't think its the essential question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Won't let me bump you Snoww, but I thank you for further clarifying my entire point. The game SHOULD be work. Sorry if you dont have time to AA Wuud. I guess that Joe-BoT might catch up to Marrs Gift+ Daluda Mending, without that spell or focus. <br />
<br />
This is not just a benefit line for the non-raider either. Wuud, you said that shaman in your guild average 400 aa. Is 30 for another 15% on their best heal gonna hurt them? Hell no. You youself said you like to DPS on raids. How about 30 aa to get yourself a 1200 base nuke as fast as SoT? <br />
<br />
I also agree with you on one point Wuud, some new abilities should be included. How about a snare for Shaman at the level of the Inny nexk quest (its really not THAT big, especially at 65). How about a slow AA for Clerics, and a DOT, that builds til its 40% slow and 150 a tic? Unbalancing? Hardly, just goves them what THEY think THEY lack, soloability. <br />
<br />
Snoww gets my point. Pred does too. Balance isnt the right word. Upgrade isnt either. &quot;Alternate Advanced Ability&quot; is, which is basically what AA stands for (Alternate Advancement, whatever, same diff).<br />
<br />
Probably a moot arguement though, I dont see SOE ever implementing something like this. They will &quot;worse case&quot; it and have Bazaar gear shaman soloing Maestro in Hate and say &quot;thats a problem&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I still dont quite agree with you Blazz but you are certainly very capable of making an argument.<br />
<br />
PS. Thanks for the bump :-)<br />
<br />
Having people like Predicus post how early they got equipment that is clearly aimed at 60+ levels does illustrate one thing - EQ is not a perfect game. I too have tried to get items for my twinks earlier than intended so I am guilty too. But in hindsight that is only done because once you went through 1-50 there is not much point in doing it again. But it does kinda ruin the game that things like these are possible.<br />
<br />
Its a common mistake but I dont want EQ made any easier - I just want it made more fun and exciting and plannable (is that a word?).<br />
<br />
Looking forward I would even welcome if there were instanced zones in OoW where none of your AAs worked or all your focus effects were out of order. These should certainly not be raid zones but zones where all these heroes around here could go and test their skills. There could very well be a reward for winning these zones (spells, disciplines or a cute little teddybear to follow you around). The focus should be on fun and sense of accomplishment and not on being dragged through something by 5 others with Time+ equipment.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember that when Velious was about to be released there was talk about weapons and armor from there wouldnt be usable anywhere else. And that actually seemed like a good idea to me - but it was never implemented. I wouldnt mind if they went ahead and actually implemented things like this.<br />
<br />
I also dont buy the argument that it is fair that high-end zones like the elementals should have much better exp than other zones because people there earned it. Making any zones in EQ more or less exp per timeunit was and is a big mistake. Even the zone you raided hundred of hours to get into shouldnt be worth it because of the exp but because of your sense of accomplishment and your opportunities to progress further and your ability to get better loot. I realize this will mean some work for the &quot;poor&quot; programmers at SOE but hey if any of them want to switch with my programming job they are welcome!<br />
<br />
And if you think the game is unbalanced now what makes you think that introducing even more highpriced AAs will improve it? Nothing in EQ was ever balanced towards the lower end of the spectrum so if you insist they implement more AAs I bet you they will automatically tune any new content and maybe some of the old towards people having all the new AAs. Making for an even bigger unbalance between shamans and between different classes too. Which will lead to even more class envy and flames and you name it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The game SHOULD be work.<br />
<br />
There are many different kinds of work but most of them should NOT be part of a gaming experience. If thats the way you feel I would like to hear what job it is you are thinking about ;-)<br />
<br />
Also remember that you are paying both cold hard cash and time to play this game - it wouldnt be easy to hire people for any kind of work if they had to pay for it.<br />
<br />
In my humble opinion a game should first and foremost be entertaining. The entertainment could come from fun, excitement, horror, action, a-sense-of-being-part-of-a-story or something else. Not from work hehe.<br />
<br />
PS. Blazz, gave you a point for your tireless efforts but forgot to sign it DOH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">If the dev reading this (hope there is one) scoffs at the idea of giving us casuals an AA that casts our new heal (thus making it 0 mana), maybe they'll like my idea.<br />
<br />
Make the aa's have a macro, that once clicked, summons the aformentioned GoD or OoW spell scroll, but make it lore, and no drop. That way, you get the spell scroll for the 30 od AA you spent on it, but you cannot sell it, and it will still cost mana, and will still take a spell slot, sense yiou summoned the spell scroll itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">From what I understand by reading the Crucible, GoD spells require you to raid, Period. There is no alternative for casual players because the spells are nodrop. That's a problem.<br />
You can get spells without raiding.<br />
Sewers 1-4, Vxed, and Tipt can be done with a full group wearing Bazaar ornate gear, except for the main tank who is the only one that really needs some decent gear to tank Kyv Boss, and even then I bet an 8k Warrior with cle cle dru shm healing him in a fast heal rotation would still succeed with ench pet dps.<br />
Once you do that, you are flagged for KT which has named mobs there that drop the runes needed for spell turn ins.<br />
You can get Nihil there for sure (the rune for it).  That's where I got mine.<br />
Another group near us got jelki to drop one day as well, so I know it drops there too.<br />
I am 99% sure you can get Daluda as well, though I haven't seen that rune drop.<br />
Runes for Daluda also drop in Vxed and Sewers off the named mobs that pop.<br />
The only spell you can't get from GoD without raiding is Ancient Canni.<br />
And at present, I'd guess about 0.001% of all shaman in EQ have this spell so far, so it's kind of a moot point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Just posting some concerns....<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I look at bankspace like I do spell gems.  I have too much to use and not enough places to put it.  I currently run around with 3 1/2 bags of clickies/tools.  I have one space left open for SoW boots, another bag for food/wierd quest items that I need on me.  That leaves me with about 2 1/2 bags left.  I really don't want to have to fill those up with gear if I am hoping back and forth between 3-4 varieties of content.<br />
<br />
My bank is full with quests in progress, no-drop tradeskill items, LDoN armor waiting on turn-ins, MQ's for alts down-the-line, etc.<br />
<br />
My bazaar mule is overflowing with tradeskill items, and I will probably start moving stuff to another alt to make room.<br />
<br />
I have no room for specialized gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also dont buy the argument that it is fair that high-end zones like the elementals should have much better exp than other zones because people there earned it. Making any zones in EQ more or less exp per timeunit was and is a big mistake.

<br />

You remember learning the scientific method in school?  The idea was that you would make as many variables constant as possible so you could test one variable.  The masses will split between moving to trivial content, (anyone remember the zerg groups lvl 61-62's used to form up in Velks?) or they will move to the best loot zones if all zones are aligned on one rate of xp.  XP is usuable by everyone- almost everyone needs it in one form or another: lvl xp, AA xp, LAA xp.  Gear is a finite aspect of zones.  If its no-drop and I get what I want- there is no reason for me to go back to the zone.  Gear lines run out faster than xp does, so all you have left in the end is either A. sellable loot or B. the most trivial content.  <br />
  <br />
<br />
And if you think the game is unbalanced now what makes you think that introducing even more highpriced AAs will improve it? Nothing in EQ was ever balanced towards the lower end of the spectrum so if you insist they implement more AAs I bet you they will automatically tune any new content and maybe some of the old towards people having all the new AAs. Making for an even bigger unbalance between shamans and between different classes too. Which will lead to even more class envy and flames and you name it.<br />
<br />
It would be unbalanced, but to the player's advantage.  The current system in place for lvl 65 players is similar to an &quot;upside-down pyramid.&quot;  You gain AA's slowly until you can advance to harder zones where the xp rate scales upward.  Lower-end players can &quot;max out&quot; an AA line, but with the rate of xp, they will have to pass on other AA abilities.   A low end shaman may heal better than a druid, but their buffs may not be maxxed out, their dps may suck, and they may not have defensive AA's.  Hence, where the balancing comes in to play.   <br />
<br />
Outside of a classes' primary AA's, we see very little &quot;balancing.&quot;  This is simple due to the rate of AAxp- there are just entirely too many to get for most players.  Devs have to balance content around the middle-of the-line player.  Spells are easy to balance, as the majority of the playerbase will get them at some point in time.  Take a look at some of the higher tier guilds AA requirements.  For shamans (whether they are recruiting or not) are pretty basic.  They want Canni V,our Buff AA's maxxed, Radiant Cure, Pet Zerg, and usually a few others.  Cleric AA requirements will revolve around healing, Tanks around defensive AA's, etc.  SOE can balance content around our class specific AA's because they know those are the ones we will get.<br />
<br />
The point behind the post was that an in-depth augmentation of the AA list would allow players to enhance/gain abilities that they feel they are lacking.  If I find myself healing often, then I can go the healing route.  It could also help some of the equipment issues that casters face.<br />
<br />
How many times have you had a lousy piece of gear that you couldn't upgrade due to a hard-to-find focus?<br />
<br />
AA's could help alleviate that issue.</div></div><hr />
