<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im getting that itch...about being guilded.  I think the reason I stayed around so long the first time was the fact I was part of a guild.<br />
<br />
Is there a &quot;repository&quot; that is more or less up-to-date where I can shop for the kind of guild Im interested in on Bristlebane?<br />
<br />
I was on Seventh Hammer previously...and while I liked my old guild...upon my return I have started new :)<br />
<br />
So, any reccomendations out there?<br />
<br />
Im feeling lonely :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well you can find a list of guilds and links to sites here:<br />
<br />
http://www.bristlebane.com<br />
<br />
Anything in particular you are looking for? Familyguild, euroguild, uberguild, RPguild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A mixture of:<br />
<br />
Primarily adults (Im a family man...27 years old...veteran..low tolerance for BS)..No Dudes<br />
<br />
Fun...yet organized (damn military career)<br />
<br />
Not uber..can be hell, but dont care...but ACTIVE!<br />
<br />
Not TOO big (my old guild was disorganized, recruited at will, and was 100 + members..mostly worthless lol)  I want to know folks<br />
<br />
Im not asking for much, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gosh um lets think. Start by looking out for Companions of the Gate,  Cry of War, Veeshans Fury, Circle of Legends and Succoring Winds.<br />
<br />
Those are the more family/friends based guilds that do stuff in US prime time as far as I can tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As always, the folks of the Crucible are friendly AND helpful. <br />
<br />
Wonder if my Wife could learn something by visiting here?....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm in CotG.  We don't recruit per se.  We guild folks we know, or people get to know us and we decide if they fit or not.  We have 100+ active members, we have very few rules, no obligitory raiding, most of our membership is North American with a few Europeans, we do 2-5 raids a week, are dragonkin (90% of us), and we do not recruit through zone wide shouts.  People are sponsored, if a new guildmember is disciplined so is their sponsor.  We do not mandate that guild members group with each other either and most of our raids are open to all.  We have RL get togethers (people come in from all over), a good number of ex/current militart types (mostly navy), average age is early 30's.  <br />
<br />
I've been in the guild since july 99 and I call it home.  I'm not big on raiding, but a few of my guildmates are.  I enjoy the lack of dudespeak and although the average level of the primary characters is 55+, we are not uber, most don't want to be.  Basically I like the comraderie, only thing that irks me is the PG-13 guildchat restriction, although it really doesn't impact the language I want to use, it does cut back on the bluntness of some of my bad jokes.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to recruit you by any stretch, just inform you and give you a personal perspective.  I recommend looking over our website and if you're interested look us up online and get to know us.  Its a long process to get in, up to you if you think its worth it.<br />
