<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hanging with my guildmates in DL last night when we decided to try Gorenaire.  We had 19 people total for the fight, but we thought why not give it a shot.  Well since the changes to casting mob AI, Gorenaire does not try and heal herself the whole fight.  Instead she sat and nuked the MT most of the fight and only tried CH once.  That was quite a pleasant surprise.  <br />
<br />
Then I logged on my shaman and decided to go on a Vox raid.  Needless to say that fight was about the same.  She only tried to CH one time as well.  And we took her down with 4 full groups.<br />
<br />
The changes to caster AI while bad in some cases like young shardwurms in GD, is a blessing in disguise for some CH mobs like Gore and Vox.  Just thought I would pass this on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're right.  This would be very cool if it holds true for all encounters with them from now on.  Anyone else experienced the same yet?  We were going to bust down Vox one last time after the patch, but the emergency stuff stifled the attempt.<br />
<br />
Nice to see they're slowly starting to make changes that would help Paladins/Bards on their epic with this (if the AI plays out the same nearly always) and the change for Dragonscale cloak.  I still think it's too little though.  IMO, Vox and Gore should drop the books and scales each time...at least one of each.<br />
<br />
The CH'ing is what caused most raids to fail, in my experience, so this would be a very welcome AI result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So Gore and Vox are even more gimped now and you find that a good thing???<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys want to send VI a request to put Vulaks loot table on An Orc Pawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't say that I found it a good thing.  However I have seen many raids on both dragons fail time and time again because of the CH thing.  I don't have a problem with mobs CHing.  I was just pointing out that they are slightly easier atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're going to level-lock a MOB like Vox, yeah it's a good thing.  But let's face it, 4 Wizzies with MB can take down Gore so that encounter is not all it used to be.<br />
<br />
Frankly Bards had a problem, their scale dropped in two and only two locations that I know of.  So once they hit 53 they had to give up a nice item to get loot rights to Vox, OR try and get in on a raid on a (then) difficult MOB.<br />
<br />
And yes, a scale should drop every time off of these two MOBs. How would you like it if the child in Fear DIDN'T drop the tear, or Rak DIDN'T drop the final piece for the epic every single time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild was up Gore yesterday (we are a rotation server with about 1/2 high level mobs on rotation).  <br />
<br />
I got off Malo and about 8 seconds later she was dead.  Helps having 5 Manaburn Wizards :) .  No deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doesn't matter what Gorenaire casts when she's killed every week by 5 to 7 manaburn wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">People on our server take her down with less than that. (As little as 1 group)<br />
Very Wizard heavy (fury crits) and a lot of runnin in circles.</div></div><hr />
