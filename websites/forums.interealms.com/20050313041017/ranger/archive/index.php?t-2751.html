All I want to know is...what is the bazaar? Anyone know exactly what it does? Or what it's supposed to do? :confused:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Bazaar is a zone on the moon where some day you will be able to park your char and have then sell your stuff you don't want when you are offline.<br />
On ECI, it is also a chat channel that people auction in now, although lots of folks still use EC too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what VI has described.<br />
<br />
You would issue commands to say that certain items in your inventory were for sale and at what price.<br />
<br />
Then you would go to bazaar at end of play day, and instead of camping, you would quit and go into bazaar mode.<br />
<br />
You would stand there and people would click on you and could get the things you flagged from you for the price you said.<br />
<br />
They were also gonna do it so that you could search everyone in this mode for items, or even like STR BARB WAR items for neck, etc.<br />
<br />
The problem was they didn't design it with a GUI, and it looked like it was going to make Hitsmode look like Barney, so they are still working on it.<br />
<br />
Just a note, the Bazaar zone has ENC turned off and has a bank. So you can Xfer 200K and move fine, etc.<br />
<br />
My 2 cp, if they REALLY want the Bazaar to take off they MUST put a Nexus port in WC, Roleplaying be damned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no idea whatsoever what this could possibly mean. Do you refer to the fact that on some servers EC is the shopping zone? (It's not on Xegony, Gfay is). If so, I'd have to disagree. If the Bazaar were working, what possible reason would there be for anyone to ever trade in EC again? I can't imagine a more inconvenient place to trade. No bank for at least two zones in any direction, absolutely zero high-level content anywhere remotely nearby, not bindable, and no transclocate spires in zone. Already on Xegony, fewer people go to gfay anymore, we all just use the buysell chat channel, letting us play as normal while trading.<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure why the Bazaar isn't already the new trading zone, it's best one in the game for it. Totally accessible from everywhere, bank right there, no encumberance, great tradeskill component access.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without SoL you'll miss your entire servers trades cause everyone will use the Bazaar feature. Don't miss out.<br />
<br />
5 months later, oh wait everyone bought SoL - hmm what will we promise in PoP?<br />
<br />
I agree the bazaar wil suck as a trade zone until better acess to EC on our server is put in. Why? The BIG traders aren't carrying around 40 slots of stuff on their primary character, or even a guild bank. It's on someones mule on a second account - and lots of these second accounts are on second computers that just flat won't run SoL. Pretty simple actually. Everyone turns on trade channel and you still have to meet thier mule in EC to get the item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What possible reasons follow:<br />
<br />
1) Quick, get to the Bazaar!<br />
<br />
Oh, you can't because, there are no group ports there. Thats a strike against the Bazaar from the start<br />
<br />
2) You must have Luclin,  not everyone does or can make it work, when 100% of the population has SOL, then there is still a what possible reason not to go<br />
<br />
3) the lack of the WC port to Luclin make a very populous despite the (boggle) servers that sell in Gfay (no evil bank, no evil vendors) quadrant of Anotonica have no quick way up.<br />
<br />
Thats enough what possible reasons to get thinking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kestrel Wyndwood</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question, how do you join these &quot;trading chat channels&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the same way you join any other chat channel.... /join *channelname*.   On RZ most people seem to use a channel named 'auction', so you would '/join auction', then you can '/leave auction' when you are done there.  You can also say '/autojoin auction' and it will automatically rejoin that channel every time you log your character on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) I'm not sure I know any melees who are bound anywhere besides the Nexus (fastest loading zone in game by far), so a simple TL drops you right there. For those unable to find a port, there are the Scions. Pretty ideal.<br />
<br />
2) Keep in mind your original argument here. If you don't have Luclin, how is a Nexus port to the Bazaar going to help you?<br />
<br />
3) I still don't understand why commons would be populous, what is there to do there?</div></div><hr />

<br />
a bad bank place(neriak), and a ring really close to it(WC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On RZ, the auction zone is GFay.  It's got a wizard portal right there for most people to port into, and a druid can get there fairly easy from butcher or steamfont.  The sales themselves usually take place right at the bank itself so that you can bank your wad of cash before someone decides to gank you while trying to do a sale.  And evil races are just screwed, most of them are out to gank all the other players anyways.<br />
<br />
However, the Bazaar is turning into an auctioning location now on RZ.  Haveing 2 banks, no encumberance problem, and NO PvP in the zone makes it very safe to carry loads of cash for trades there.</div></div><hr />
