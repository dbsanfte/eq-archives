<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shelgeyr</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's been a lot of talk, off and on, about how EQ isn't what it used to be. The old-timers look fondly back to the days before that silly paladin went and got herself kidnapped and wish things hadn't changed as much as they have.<br />
<br />
EQ2 looks to me like it might be a really good idea for anybody who finds their EQ time a bit tedious. I'm looking forward to giving it a try mainly to get back the excitement of feeling out a new world and actually discovering something other than the footprints of the thousands who've gone before me.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing here, but I expect the serverwide chat feature will exist in EQ2 as well and I'll be looking in the serverwide.rangersglade for anybody else who wants to come along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New adventures. New items. New quests.Making friends all over again. <br />
Of course, we'll probably spend the first few months constantly telling each other who we were in EQ1 and trying to match up with old guilds, etc.<br />
But who cares?<br />
<br />
I used to think being a shaman was cool. Because I  was the shaman and no one else in the group had my capabilities. Nowadays, any group I'm in has someone with an alt shaman that's higher than me and is constantly trying to teach me how to use my class. It will be refreshing to start out at the begining again, if not for any other reason than to add humility back to the game.<br />
<br />
Besides, everyone knows where everything is and how to complete quests. It's no longer a question of &quot;can it be done?&quot;, instead it's &quot;how long will it take?&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, I foresee a TON of beggars. Everyone is soooo used to twinking out their alts that they wont be able to stand hunting without the huge advantage they're used to. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
But it should be fun either way.</div></div><hr />
