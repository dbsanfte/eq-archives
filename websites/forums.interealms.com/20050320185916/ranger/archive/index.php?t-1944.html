<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just saw the following dicussion of how spawns will work in Star Wars Galaxies. Since EQ2 is being built off much of the same technical base, it is entirely possible they might re-use this spawning system. (If so, I hope they do. It sounds very dynamic and very cool.)<br />
<br />
Please note that Verant has NOT said this is how spawns will work. However, this is conjecture based on the technical engine and awareness of the spawn issues in EQ today.<br />
<br />
<br />
There seems to be a little confusion over just what the differences are between these four (distinct) things.<br />
So here they are, in no particular order:<br />
<br />
Spawning is the system determines when and where Lairs, POI’s and random monsters should appear. The Spawning System is the system that looks at you and says:<br />
<br />
Gee, he looks like he could use a little excitement. He’s in the forest on Endor and he seems pretty tough, so I’ll look at this list of *Tough Things, In The Forest, On Endor* and pick one of them. I’ll put it near him (but not too near… don’t want it dropping on his head!). Have fun!<br />
<br />
There are no “fixed spawn points” or anything of the like. The spawning system takes various things into consideration about you (just how tough are you, anyway?), and your location (are you in or near town? In the wilderness? In a “hard” part of the wilderness, or an “easy” part of the wilderness?) and chooses an appropriate encounter (so no Krayt Dragons popping out of the alleyways of Theed).<br />
<br />
Going back to the example above, we know there are tough things, in the Forest, on Endor (forest moon of), and if you’re in the forest, then you’re going to run into something sooner or later.<br />
<br />
The simplest something that you might encounter would be, of course, a creature. The Spawning System makes sure the creature is appropriate to the location, and - rather like a Game Master in a table-top RPG - ensures that it’s something appropriate for you to encounter. Maybe you’re so tough, it’s more appropriate for you to encounter five creatures instead of just one…<br />
<br />
Of course, you still have to be careful: There are regions of the worlds that are more dangerous that other regions of the worlds. Just because you have (say) no combat skills of any sort whatsoever, doesn’t mean that the Spawning System will never create a creature that can kill you (it just means that it won’t create ten of them, since one will do the job).<br />
<br />
Or you might find a Lair.<br />
<br />
If so, then the Lair System takes over. This is the system that creates a Lair Object (a cave, a nest, a Rebel Encampment, whatever). Notice that because Lairs are created by the Spawning System, there aren’t any fixed locations for Lairs to spawns either. The Spawning System puts them near the players, whenever the players are somewhere appropriate for that type of Lair.<br />
<br />
The Lair creates creatures, according to whatever type of Lair it is. A Rebel encampment doesn’t make gnorts, and a gnort-nest doesn’t spawn Rancors.<br />
<br />
The Lair behaves very much like a fixed spawn point, except that it is a temporary thing. Lairs can be destroyed (by you, that is), and they can also just get very old and eventually die-out.<br />
<br />
Instead of a Monster or Lair, you might find a Point of Interest.<br />
<br />
The POI System is what creates all the individual elements of the POI: The Stormtroopers, the Sandcrawler, the Jawa’s, and the horde of Sandpeople that are going to attack shortly after you arrive. POI’s are hand-crafted “scenes” that you can interact with, and many of the components of POI’s are variable from one instance to the next: This exact same POI might consist of Rebel soldiers instead of Stormtroopers, or the Stormtroopers might be attacked by Rebel soldiers and no Sandpeople show up at all.<br />
<br />
And again, as with Monsters and Lairs there aren’t fixed spawn points for POI’s. Like Lairs, they’ll persist for a while - possible more or less depending on how you interact with them - but eventually they go away, and new points of interest spawn wherever players are looking for something fun to do.<br />
<br />
Apart from the Spawning System, Lairs and POI’s can also be created by the Mission System, for certain types of missions: For example, you might take a mission to go destroy a Rebel encampment. That could be a Lair, which is created by the Mission System at the location you were given. It would behave exactly like any other Lair, in that it maintains a population of Rebels (in this case), and “respawns” Rebels as they are killed. The difference is that you have a mission to destroy *this* Rebel encampment.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers more questions than it raises. <br />

Isnt technology amazing? Anyway, if EQ2 uses this spawn engine I will get it the day it comes out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaen</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this arguement on another board already.<br />
<br />
SWG is not based around exp advancement. It's based around adventuring and trade skills and such. You wont be killing stuff for hours to get level 12. This spawn system works well for that type of game because you will rarely be in a group of people out looking to kill stuff for hours straight.<br />
<br />
EQ2 is entirely different. To level you must kill. And kill a lot you will. If you look at this spawn method, the game will be a total free-for-all. When you have one of two groups in the same dungeon and mobs randomly spawn for how many people are around, you will be up sh*t-creek when one of those two groups is capable of not only killing their own spawns, but the spawns your group also popped. People will have no &quot;camps&quot; to claim, so it will be free-for-all. This is the absolute worst way to do this for a game like EQ2. I dont think it will happen. We'll most likely see some varations, but overall, static pops/roamers will still be the primary method, but with better AI. <br />
<br />
Free-for-all is a BAD idea.<br />
<br />
Also magically generated dungeons personalized for groups is also a bad idea. Anyone who has played Anarchy Online can tell you that a personal dungeon takes away all multiplayer aspects of the game .. Inviting a few friends in with you is just as bizarre. Not only does this take away from the &quot;Massive&quot; in MMORPG, but it literally takes you out the equation of the rest of the server. Silly.</div></div><hr />

Well I agree that if verant sees EQ2 to become like EQ they prolly wont use this system, but if they want to center the game on adventure they prolly will. Its basically all up to verant and how they want the game to come out *shrug*. Who knows maybe they'll find a median e.g. dungeons use the spawn engine that eq uses maybe a little tweaked and wilderness areas use this engine,  that seems like a reasonable solution to keep adventurers and xp grinders satisfied.</div></div><hr />
