<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is some discussion happening on a cleric msg board regarding healing.  (Go figure!)  But seriously its kind of in regards to which priest is the best healer.  Thotts graphs were mentioned.    <br />
<br />
I wondered how all of you great shaman think of your healing abilities.  Not including mitigation, simply HEALING.<br />
<br />
<br />
My credentials were questioned because I do not have numbers to crunch and graphs to display, so help me out here please!  This is not a troll, I dont want to stir up flames.  I know at heart I am a cleric, but dont hold that against me please, hehe.  I simply want the shaman communities opinion on healing.  Are you the best? Are you horrible? Is it situational?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NOOoooooooooooooooooo pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee noooooo<br />
<br />
Err hi Cali no offense but this may be bad timing. You may ask with all good itentions but this stuff has a way of taking off. You know dry grass and spark. We already have couple nice rant/flame/debate posts going not sure this good time for another one. Maybe i'm wrong but gonna go political on this one and issue my no comment statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thotts graphs are the most crappy and wrong piece of stats I have seen in a long time.<br />
<br />
Even mentioning them here will not get you anywhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The funny thing is that I think people think we're better healers than we really are...  I was mentioning to a friend that I was thinking about twinking up a cleric, and his response was, 'Why? You have complete heal already.'  Well, I proceeded to land a 'complete heal' on my warrior, where it healed about 25% of her buffed hp, and then he figured out why I might want a cleric for some occasions. ;)<br />
<br />
Overall though, I'm pretty happy with our healing ability.  I'd love for our mini-cheal to heal maybe 1k more hp or cast a bit faster, but I can manage as-is.  I'd love to have Q, since I try not to use torpor on melees during battle, but that's a few levels off for me yet.<br />
<br />
Edit: I should point out that I haven't done anything beyond Tier 1 Planes, and even for some areas in those, I really try not to be the primary healer. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, shaman healing ability at 65 is pretty lame.  We are far behind druids in this role.  Many shamans don't even use our &quot;CH&quot; spell because with focus effects + AA, Tnarg's Mending heals almost as much in a much shorter period of time.  Healing an exp group in Tier 2-3 planes is pretty difficult and not very efficient for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Many shamans, just say no to playing primary healer in most situations.  In my mind, shamans are at best spot/support healers, somewhat better than paladins.<br />
<br />
I think many shamans would argue that shaman healing needs to be fixed, but most simply shrug it off as something that never will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman healing sucks because of the power of slow. This prevents us from being able to fill the role of both a primary healer and a slower, which is probably a good thing. Unfortunately the low amount of hp that we can heal means that we are very hard pressed to be a primary healer in ANY situation. It used to be that you could have any of the three priest classes as a healer, but Shamans have been pushed squarely into a backup role. The lack of a heal over 2k (without AAs) is the biggest limiting factor in a Shaman's healing power, but admittedly we get Stoicism/Torpor/Quiesence which act as nice heals over time, which Druids do not get. With lots of AA we can stretch some alarming mana efficiency from these heals (unlike every other spell in my book). However the high DPS of PoP mobs means that our heal over times (which max at 300 hp/tick) are not viable in keeping up the HP of a tank.<br />
<br />
I personally don't feel that Shamans NEED a bigger heal (if I wanted to cast CH all day I would play a cleric and not a shaman), but it would certainly be nice to have, even at a high mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shamans are clearly the weakest healers of the priest classes.  This is OBVIOUS! <br />
<br />
However, situationally, a shaman may function as sole healer in a group in PoP while utilizing slow on mobs that can be slowed.  If the mobs can not be slowed or slow is heavily mitigated, shamans are not a good choice for healer.  <br />
<br />
That said, with Quiescence, some serious AA, and mobs that can be slowed . . . the cleric could go afk for a couple hours and wouldn't be missed until Virtue started to fade . . .<br />
But that is assuming easy single pulls and mobs that can be slowed.  If two pulls are regular or happen with any frequency, you need two healers in the group if you are to survive.  Otherwise you'll just be looking for a cleric anyway, but for a different reason (rez).  <br />
<br />
It's all situational.  Clerics are clearly the best healers.  Druids are second best, also clearly.  Shamans are third best, with some tricks that (when applicable) can make them be able to be a pretty great healer. <br />
<br />
But normally this is a non issue.  Clerics have more competition from druids for the main healing role in a group than from shamans.  Shamans fill the Slow/haste class role in a group, as well as being responsible for any CC that needs to be done.  We have direct competition from enchanters.  We do not compete for the main healer role in a group, so the whole issue is rather moot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
We are the weakest of the Priest classes in terms of healing power.  No doubt about it in my mind.<br />
<br />
That said, I can and have successfully acted as primary healer in Valor for several hours before on multiple occasions.  I didn't like it, I was miserable, but it worked &amp; the exp was great w/ more high DPS classes in the group.  I typically died once every hour or two though.<br />
<br />
I can and have acted as primary healer in multiple Tier1 zones to good effect, but this was usually with a tight-knit group of friends who all knew their roles.  I hated doing it w/ pick-up groups, as I tended to be the one dying the most if I'm slowing and healing.<br />
<br />
The ONLY reason it worked as well as it did in Valor in my opinion was because we had a 65 Pally and a 65 SK in our group.  The Pally has a better fast direct heal than a Shaman, and it had to get used every so often when slow failed to land during an overpull.  LoH was used by the pally to save me as well.  Between the Pally's group heals &amp; the SK's lifetaps, there wasn't as much healing required as in a normal group.  Since both can readily gain/regain aggro, it also helped a great deal.<br />
<br />
In Storms, where certain mobs mitigate slow, I pretty much refuse to act as primary healer except while we're waiting for a replacement healer to arrive.  Even so, if the mob mitigates slow I'm going to be using ALOT of mana to heal, using either Tnarg's or Kraggs Mending. <br />
<br />
I can't speak to Tier3 greater from personal experience, but I would imagine Tier2 would be the limit of a shaman's primary healing role in nearly all situations.  And we can only do it well in Tier2 situationally with the right classes in our groups for support.<br />
<br />
Shaman will not be keeping clerics from getting groups (even in Tier1 &amp; 2) because of our healing power.  Every time I was primary healer, I was very relieved when another priest class (druid or cleric, though I preferred the cleric) arrived to take over that role.  Clerics with their new and improved melee skills can effectively heal AND fight w/ substantial DPS contributions (more so than most shaman's melee DPS could ever dream to be) to the group.<br />
<br />
I hope my opinion gives you the kind of feedback you are looking for on the cleric boards.  Say hi to Yumanea for me. ;)  PS:  Thott's graphs are generally crap, and shouldn't be used.  For any practical applications, they are erroneous and misleading at best.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The question is not just shamans don't heal as well as druids who in turn does not heal as well as clerics. It is if given the choice, would you WANT to be in the position of druids, who have the dubious honor of being able replace the single most boring class to play in an exp group--the cleric?<br />
<br />
With proper AA (SCM, SCRM, HG+, HA+), spells (Q and Tnargs), and focus items (beneficial haste, beneficial efficiency, beneficial duration) a shaman can still perform as the only healer in any zone up to T3 without too much trouble. Incidentally, I don't have issues healing players--it's the charmed pets that annoy me to no end when it comes to healing. <br />
<br />
It has been said before, I'll say it again. Turgurs is our best healing spell. If you add in mitigation, it's STILL our best healing spell. PoP mobs' high dps just makes it even more efficient.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for most shamans, AA, spells, and focus items are out of reach, which leaves the true question waiting to be answered. Would you WANT to be the only healer of a group even if you have a spell that can allow you to handle it easily?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not adding fuel, but adding information.<br />
<br />
Druids do have a semi-HoT type spell. Maybe a High Yield Regen would be better terms for it. 2 actually, now that I think about it, though one is an AAxp ability.<br />
<br />
Nature's Recovery 30hp per tic for 3min duration. (lvl60)<br />
<br />
The AAxp, I get mixed up, Wrath of the Wild? or Spirit of Wood. One of the 2. Another High Yield Regen. <br />
<br />
Neither on par with even Stoicism let alone Torpor. Not sure if these would qualify as HoT spells though, but they are pretty nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">shaman is very weak main healer class, our heal normally come late when really need it,<br />
<br />
at beginning of fight we ususlly busy try slow mob, if mob slowed in first cast then everything go good and shaman can heal easy<br />
<br />
if slow get resist then will have problem to heal, because it our heal can't cover unslow mob's dps; most shaman ususlly watch tank's hp drop and try slow again; <br />
<br />
if mob slowed on 2nd cast, depend on who tanking, shaman normally get agro if war tank, or require urgently heal on pal/sk tank depend on how ubber tank is<br />
<br />
now, if mob still resist 2nd slow, big problem here; I hope 3nd slow will not resist, and tank close to die or shaman get agro from 2nd slow, all of these pretty much mean CR for most group<br />
<br />
I think Paladin actually better healer than us when there are cleric in group; paladin can heal cleric/caster/other lots easier and faster than us, especial good when in danger situation; our heal normally come late when really need it,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I find it interesting that just about every shaman that has posted a response to this has said that given the right AA's and focus items (and usually a lot of luck), shaman can be &quot;ok healers&quot;  or &quot;fill the gap before a real healer arrives&quot;.<br />
<br />
What bothers me, as a sub 60 shaman is the total LACK of healing ability that I have.  My best heal right now is Stoicism in terms of mana efficency.  Hoever, the times that I have tried to use this spell in any group situation generates more agro from my groupmates than any mob that we go against.  Pure casters dont seem to mind it, but melee classes scream bloody murder when I try and heal them with this, even during downtime (which, in a time of KEI and faster HP regen, is virtually nonexistant anymore).<br />
<br />
So that leaves me with the chioce of Regens, Sup heal, and Chloroblast.  Now regens provide incredible mana efficency, but are strictly for downtime/non fighting healing.  They take as long as 20 minutes before completion.  Sup heal will in the best of circumstances heal 5 to 10% of the HP's of the tanks Im grouped with, and maybe 15%of other melee (rangers, rogues, monks).  Casters can usually get about 40% healed from 1 sup heal.  That is the only time, incidentally, that I actually FEEL like a healer, and thats when  I get to heal a caster and cast 1 spell and see a noticible difference in thier HP's.<br />
<br />
Chloroblast heals less than Sup.  It casts about a second or so faster, for half the mana.  But considering I have to spam cast with it even on tank and melee classes that are 10 levels below me really makes it almost useless unless Im using it on myself.  <br />
<br />
In my mind, shaman are NOT healers.  Shaman are a class that has heal spells.  My view on this might change as I get more levels and see the the (in)complete heals and bigger heal spells.  But right now, with the heals that I have in my aresenal Im not a healer.  I cant sub for a healer for more than about 2 minutes of actual fight time, either because my spam heals will generate too much agro and I die or because I use more mana than I have health and get low health agro and die.  Either way if I  try and heal in a group situation Im a dead shaman.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I suppose I could stop grinding regular exp and put it all into AA untill I can afford some of the nice AA's that help generate better heals.  the benefit of that, at my level, is small though.  I could grind the exp to get to the levels of the bigger heals themselves before I could grind enough AA to get the healing benefits.<br />
<br />
Focus gear?  Get real.  My servers economy is really screwed up, and Improved healing 3 items run about 50K.  Spell haste 3 items?  45K.  Im trying to get myself into gear right now that enables me to stay alive when I get slow agro.  I cant afford to sacrifice HP and AC for an item that has maginal effects on rarely used spells.<br />
<br />
I mem 1 heal.  Mainly out of habit and a desire of self preservation than a need to feel like a &quot;healer&quot;.  You want a healer?  Get a cleric.  Settle for a druid.  I slow, debuff and buff.  I can patch heal.  I have the healing skills of a paladin without the mana efficency or the ability to tank and deal damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Repeat after me... Mitigation is not healing<br />
<br />
If it was chanters would be the king of &quot;healing&quot; between slow and mez<br />
<br />
<br />
This is why everyone seems to think we are such great healers when my best fast heal covers 1 hit from a named in tier two and my 10 second cheal heals a whole red and a half on a warrior in my guild. <br />
<br />
I've been reading that thread over at eqclerics since it started. Its really really sad how many people put credit into that crap thott put up. Wheres that graph that one of the shaman posted a while back when the thott thing first came up? If they want pictures someone should give it to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman are last as far as healers go.<br />
<br />
Our fast heal is 1300 hps for 450 mana -too expensive to use full time.<br />
<br />
Our big heal is 2k hps for 400 mana - too little heal for the amount of time it takes to cast.<br />
<br />
Our heal over time (torpor/Q) is 300 per pulse for 200 mana - still too little heal for the time it takes to heal (in combat, its great between kills if your group wants to wait.)<br />
<br />
That said, I am regualrly the only healer in my exp group.  I do tier 3 PoP, including minis with a single group and myself as the healer.  We have learned how to do it, and we have died learning our limitations.  If the group keeps to single mobs, and the puller doesnt pull unless full health, I can pull it off.  There is no margin for error.  I cannot heal and slow a second mob.  I can land slow on ONE mob, and get a heal off in time to save the tanks life.  I do torpor my tank if i need to keep him alive long enough to land a bigger heal.<br />
<br />
If I join a group and they expect me to heal, I tell them to find a druid/cleric.  With practice, it works.  But there is no margin for error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">While our heals are good enough for me to work hard and become a capible healer situationaly , there is no way we can be considered a good healer , we are just too slow.

- Thott's graphs owned. Infact they owned so much that I am going to find a Dain Frostreaver IV class slowable mob and solo it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Darkpaw,<br />
<br />
Repeat after me... Mitigation is not healing<br />
<br />
<br />
Call it however you want it, as far as damage prevention goes, Turgur is the most effective spell we've got.<br />
<br />
It's rather simple so I hope I don't have to repeat this again. Goal = keep people alive. How many ways are there to keep people alive? Damage prevention, and damage negation (heal).<br />
<br />
If you only want to deal with HPS (healing per second), shaman is last.<br />
<br />
If you want to deal with who's better at keeping someone alive... then you have to take into consideration damage prevention as well as damage negation.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, people don't seem to realize that while on raids, direct healing power is all that matters since if the mob is slowable, *somebody*'s going to slow it. However, in most exp groups, damage prevention is as important as damage negation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The main difference between mitigation and healing as I see it is there are several classes that can mitigate very well (chanter/bard mez slow bl sham slow). <br />
<br />
In comparision no one comes within 5% of the healing power of a cleric and healing can never be resisted, mitigated, immune. <br />
<br />
There is a difference. Problem is most people don't take that into consideration. If a shaman can't slow a mob for whatever reason then only our healing power matters in which case we are in serious trouble if the mob is nasty enough.</div></div><hr />

A Shammy &amp; Tank combo is much better than a Druid/Tank combo.<br />

<br />
<br />
If one is going to use this argument, then it is also valid to say that high DPS is equivalent to a heal because it kills the mob faster. One dead mob = less overall damage to tank. So enchanters are the best healers because of charmed pet DPS (and haste, slow), yet they don't even have a 'heal' spell...<br />
<br />
Why stop there? The fear line is a great heal spell...it makes the mob run away so that it doesn't do any damage... DD's are great heal spells too... you could use this argument for almost any ability<br />
<br />
Bandicoot<br />
<br />
PS. I do not subscribe to this argument... heals are heals, slows are slows etc.<br />
<br />
'Heals' should be restricted to the following...<br />
Once a character has taken damage, what spell types can recover lost hit points? No matter how many slows, hastes, DD's etc one casts, there is only 1 broad spell line that does this (inc. heal over time...eg. regen, torpor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally, I'm happy with the way we heal... it's perfect for spot healing and fine to heal myself after can5 - past that I need nothing, if I wanted to play main healer in a group all the time(or even half to 3/4 the time) I would have rolled cleric.</div></div><hr />

Clerics, Druids, and Paladins are better and much more efficient healers than Shaman are.  With no AA's in any of the healing abilities, and my only focus item that affects my heals being Cog Encrusted Epaulets, we can barely handle Tier 2.  Tier 3+ is not an option until your gear and aa's catch up.<br />
<br />
As stated above, if you want a healer, get a cleric or a druid.  Let me do my job which is debuff, buff, and dot the crap out of the mob.  Depending on a Shaman as main healer for an extended amount of time in the 61+ game is inefficient.  I can not really comment on the 50-60 range since the spells available to you now were not in the game when I was at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">without considering slowing (as the original poster requested), I think that Landragoran summed it up best so far.</div></div><hr />

When was the last time you used fear in any pop zone?<br />

<br />
It's easy to get tied up in the technicalities of &quot;omg, I can't heal, I suck&quot; when in reality things are far from it. Paladins are a good example--they have decent heals for the group, yet when was the last time you had an effective group in any zone worth mentioning with a paladin as the healer?<br />
<br />
Most people, like some who posted here, equate pure healing ability with effectiveness at being a healer. While there's nothing wrong with this assumption if you are dealing with druids and clerics, however, not taking into account damage prevention when looking at a shaman's effectiveness at being a healer is short sighted at best.</div></div><hr />

Slows would be classified more as mitigation rather than direct heals but this is still inaccurate as slows do nothing to mitigate damage from casters. Defining slows as being equivalent to heals at the exclusion of many other things that are useful to a group is exactly the same mistake made by Thott which is why shaman seemed so uber in comparison.<br />
<br />
I am not debating the fantastic utility of the slow line. Of course SOE realise this too which is why our heals are not as good as the other priests'.<br />
<br />
Everybody else here seems to understand this....the answer to Cali's question is shaman are the worst of the 3 priest classes at healing as everyone else has stated.<br />
<br />
Debating the merits of slow is irrelevant to the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Most people, like some who posted here, equate pure healing ability with effectiveness at being a healer. While there's nothing wrong with this assumption if you are dealing with druids and clerics, however, not taking into account damage prevention when looking at a shaman's effectiveness at being a healer is short sighted at best.<br />
 <br />
<br />
       Do you know other class can slow ? that not a duo comparaison post.Yeah we know that in one mob per pull situation ,when mob don't mitigate(and easy to slow) we 're ok ,but such situation are not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">While the Shaman has the worst healing abilities of the priest classes, I have absolutely no problem with this. If there is ONE problem with the Shaman class, however, it is that our stat buffs are completely worthless. This has been said on this board plenty of times but it cannot be repeated enough. We are given a massive array of stat buffs... all worthless, or close to worthless. I believe stats were intended to be our class defining ability, along with slow. Look at the hitpoint buffs. Half of them come with stat modifiers, and there aren't even a quarter as many hp buffs as there are stat buffs. I dont know about you guys but I can't think of anything worse than having 30+ spells in my spellbook that do jack ****.<br />
<br />
Oh wait yeah I can. Warriors asking for those buffs without realizing they do nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In reply to the original poster, its situational.<br />
<br />
When I first got greater heal at 29 I made a great healer. As I levelled up more the mobs dps and MTs hp soon outstripped it, and I became worse than clerics and roughly on a par with druids.<br />
<br />
At level 58 in tier one zones I can one again make a pretty decent healer, especially if the MT is a paladin, and somewhat so if its an SK as they can both heal themselves a little during the crucial seconds that I'm trying to land slow. Freeing up a  group slot for a heavy DPS class can be rewarding but mana regen at 58 can be an issue unless you have kei or a bard.<br />
<br />
At level 62 in Tier 2 zones, with the fast cast heal I can keep a group alive against single, fully slowable mobs. Again, a paladin makes an ideal MT for this and SKs aren't bad. Canni V &amp; horse are essential to eliminate downtime, and KEI/Bard song/PotG are great buffs to have too. Against mitigating mobs I can heal for the odd fight but can't keep it up due to mana regen issues. However, I can't compare to a cleric or druid healing, the cleric's hp buffs are sorely missed, and the odd death is almost inevitable.<br />
<br />
At 60 with torpor, I make a good group healer on raids if I'm in a caster group. Torpor is very efficient and ideal for keeping casters alive from the AE damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Considering slow when comparing healing power like Boinshar does is incredibly stupid. Sure, it might matter in a non-raid enviroment but who gives a sh*t about that?<br />
<br />
It's just as stupid as equating hp buffs on the MT as heals since they make ch's more efficent. Neither the hp buffs on the MT or slow stacks, so once the mob is engaged you cannot keep casting slow on the mob or keep casting the same hp buffs on the MT simply because they don't stack.</div></div><hr />

If you can't jump out of the &quot;healing ability&quot; equals &quot;healing viability&quot; trap, there's nothing I can do to help.<br />
<br />
If you want to look strickly at heals, that's fine--the data's availible in any spell list. The purpose is to go beyond what's listed on paper and find application in game.<br />
<br />
Sit there blinded by your ignorance and inability to think beyond pure healing all you want. You are free to limit the discussion all you want--no one disputed pure healing wise shaman is 3rd of priests. The discussion progressed to healing viability, but of course some are unable, or unwilling to think beyond the question.<br />
<br />
When you refuse to look at the big picture, you'll always be the ones complaining about how much you suck at &quot;healing&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I find it interesting that just about every shaman that has posted a response to this has said that given the right AA's and focus items (and usually a lot of luck), shaman can be &quot;ok healers&quot;  or &quot;fill the gap before a real healer arrives&quot;.<br />
<br />
What bothers me, as a sub 60 shaman is the total LACK of healing ability that I have.  My best heal right now is Stoicism in terms of mana efficency.  Hoever, the times that I have tried to use this spell in any group situation generates more agro from my groupmates than any mob that we go against.  Pure casters dont seem to mind it, but melee classes scream bloody murder when I try and heal them with this, even during downtime (which, in a time of KEI and faster HP regen, is virtually nonexistant anymore).<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup. They scream like this with Torpor too. When I play backup healer I'll have a HoT loaded, and not a fast heal. Why? Cause I use the heal on myself and i need the best ratio and I dont have enough gem spots usually to have 2 heal;s loaded. (Of course if you are a primary healer, this is not the case). The first time they bitch about the snare/slow, I tell them that I'm the backup healer, They got healed caue the primary healer was bsuy, they are lucky i saved thier life and not to bitch. I repeat this warning the second time. The third time I stop healing them.<br />
<br />
Try it. It works. 1 in 10 melees will go bonkers and refuse to group wtih you. You dont want to group with those anyways. The rest will think about what ya said and realize that overall its to the benefit of the group. The shammy having mana is WAY more useful than having a oom shammy on a multipull or having to med after fight. A melee doing 75% less damage for 4 or 5 ticks isnt that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
When I main heal I'll have CH and a HoT loaded. Same thing goes. Rarely will I have a CH. fast heal, and a HoT. The only time when ya need all 3 is when I'm stretched to the max and I need teh fast heal to keep up with the damage. Then I'm spamming fast heals to give me a buffer to get a CH off. When this happens either you or a tank is going to die after a sustained use of this. Just happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You are missing the best thing you have at those levels.<br />
<br />
Regen.<br />
<br />
In the lower levels a shaman does not have the brute force heals like a cleric. But the mobs don't do as much when we are around. If you can swing it in a group with 2-3 tanks. Keep regen on all of them and have them share damage. <br />
<br />
They should never get that top off heal. Let them bleed a little. Let the regen do its work. You will save a tremendous amount of mana and strain if you do this. <br />
<br />
And yes I know What good is a puny 10 hp a tic When mobs are hitting for 90 a swing. <br />
<br />
Thats easy it is 10 hp a tic less you have to heal with a direct heal. And if you can swing an amulet of insight or another buff extender it makes the regen longer and more efficiant.<br />
<br />
Never use regen as a downtime heal. Always keep it on the tank and if you can swing teh mana on anyone who will be bleeding. And don't top off heal. Let the tank bleed a little<br />
<br />
Try it. You might find we don't quite suck as much as you think. (At least in the Pre plains. In storms I can heal. And I hate every second of it. When a mob triples for 675, and procs a 700 point effect on two of the three swings. My stupid Tnarqs Just pisses me off. And that is with 30 AA Put into healing Stuff already.

<br />
Both are true.<br />
<br />
We suck at major encounter healing.  This includes stuff like Rumblecrush, Tier 3+, and some of Tier 2 especially when multiple mobs come at you unslowed.  We suck at healing period if the mob cannot be slowed.<br />
<br />
We are great at healing if it comes at the right pace.  If it comes at the right moderate-to-slow pace, we can outheal druids and clerics simply because we are able to keep casting forever due to our great mana regen as long as people don't mind being torpored.  It's mostly inefficient healing but the mana regen somewhat makes up for it.. if we do it correctly we can get a constant healing thang going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The point about higher DPS would be perfectly valid if you could increase DPS significantly -- making the mob die faster for less heals needed. But the thing with Shaman slow is that it can mitigate mob DPS 4x. You can't increase player DPS anywhere near 4x (unless you count charmed pets) to make up for a lack of slow.<br />
<br />
Just an example to show a point, not actual numbers:<br />
Warrior + Cleric, mob unslowed, cleric casts 7500 HP heal 10 times for 4000 mana.<br />
Warrior + Shaman, mob slowed, shaman casts 2000 HP heal 10 times for 4000 mana.<br />

<br />
Chloroblast and Superior Healing barely heal casters any more. CB healed one bubble hp of my guild enchanter yesterday. Yay.<br />

Shaman healing needs to be looked at, without being jaded by &quot;the power of slow.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">In descending order of healing ability:<br />
<br />
1) Cleric<br />

<br />
3) Paladin/Shaman<br />
<br />
4) Beastlord<br />
<br />
5) Ranger<br />
<br />
Paladin and shaman are tied because paladin heals themselves are better, but shaman can keep it up for longer (more or less indefinitely with Torpor/Cann5/horse).  This also assumes that we're talking level 58+.  Pre-58, shaman suck royally at healing.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the shaman CH bumped to 3k and the druid CH bumped to 4k, but other than that I'm perfectly content with my current healing ability.  I can prime heal tier 1 fine and tier 2 ok, but the only time I'll willingly do this is when I'm two-boxing with my SK.</div></div><hr />

Meet a_wizard_01 and his 4k+ nukes (mages I group with can nuke for this.. its not a stretch for a wizard).  DPS increased.  Is the wizard healing? no.<br />
<br />
Just an example to show a point, not actual numbers:<br />
Warrior + Cleric, mob unslowed, cleric casts 7500 HP heal 10 times for 4000 mana.<br />

<br />
Warrior + Shaman, mob resists slow, shaman spams heals, warrior dies anyway, shaman dies.<br />
<br />
In a group slow != heal, because slow can be resisted, heal is never resisted.<br />
<br />
In a raid, slow != heal, because the mob will be slowed by someone, whether the shaman cast a heal, the druid casts a heal, or the cleric casts a heal.. the mob IS slowed.<br />
<br />
You can not discount slow when balancing healing.. because a slowed mob does do less damage, and gimping content is bad.  But at the same time you cant say that slowing is the same as healing, any more than you can say that nuking is the same as healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The wizard is preventing damage to the tank by killing the mob early. However, you're looking at 10-second windows of XPing there, when you should be looking at sustained XPing.<br />
<br />
I guess if you don't subscribe to the famous quote &quot;A penny saved is a penny earned,&quot; then you probably won't consider damage mitigation as a healing factor.</div></div><hr />

2. We are comparing each priest class on 2 healing spells - their best 3.75 second (Quick) Heal and their best 10 second (&quot;Large&quot;) heal.<br />

DRU - Natures something, Karana's Renewal<br />
SHM - Tnargs, Kraggs<br />
<br />
3.  All Direct heal spells, heal for their full amount.<br />

4.  Graphs are pretty and fun.<br />
<br />
5.  Bigger = Better.<br />

One person told Cali that &quot;I am sorry, but his number crunching holds up a lot more than 'My honey plays a shaman' &quot;<br />
<br />
 It seems no matter how many times Thott is discredited the damage is done. No wonder that new CH was removed from the Shaman line-up. I submit that a new analysis is needed, and this one should show conclusively that Bards are over-powered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Well, shaman healing is a little more subtle than that though is it not?<br />
<br />
A straight across comparison does not take into account Quiescence nor does it take into account how you can massively increase the power of Quiescence using Duration Extension AA and items.<br />
<br />
With the ability to increase the duration of a spell by 70% that means Quiescence heals 1800 - 2100 HP for 200 mana.  Not to mention it is affected by Quick Buff ans Spell Haste if I remember correctly is it not ... I do not have Quick Buff on my shaman yet.<br />
<br />
If you are looking at a controlled situation then Quiescence is a pretty damn good healing spell and because it heals over time it allows additional instant healing as well as the ability to replace mana via Canni and Super Canni.<br />
<br />
Now, I duo box a shaman but I have never felt a shamans healing ability to be substandard to a druid.  In fact Torpor and Quiescence place my shaman squarely in the lead versus a druid using CH in a controlled situation.  I can heal more over time than a druid and I can maintain it longer with super canni and normal canni.<br />
<br />
Now this is assuming I am in a position to anticipate damage and deal with it in a steady fashion which is 90% of what healing is all about.  Even in the event I have to pound out emergency heals, I can generally out heal a druid.<br />
<br />
Quiescence<br />
Tnarg<br />

Now AA affects my ability to do this a fair amount I grant you but shamans are not as hard up as would be indicated by those numbers.<br />

I do not post this here to cause anger, merely to understand.  Although I play a shaman, I am not a shaman ... I am an enchanter that has a shaman on his second box.<br />

<br />
Thus the ignoring aa point above.  Compare with no aa, or with all the aa.. but dont compare with aa to without aa.<br />

A BIG difference is, our ability to convert hps to mana on demand.  This gives shaman an effectively larger mana pool in cases where cannibalize can be used safely. (We all know that you cant always cannibalize)</div></div><hr />

Well I suppose for me it is because I duo a shaman.  Healing is not my responsibility,my responsibility actually is to slow.  I land the tash from my enchanter about 0.5 seconds before the slow hits ... the advantage to playing both classes.<br />
<br />
When it comes to emergancy healing, using a 10 sec complete heal is not all that useful because if that were going to do the trick, the cleric would do it.  I use Quiescence because it is the most mana efficient heal I have and it is affected by spell haste items/spells ... I think mine casts in under 4 secs now. If that will not do the trick then I use Tnarg.<br />
<br />
Generally I do not heal the Tank unless it is an emergancy and in the event of an emergancy 10 sec is not going to cut it.<br />
<br />
I suppose I use HoT because it is the most efficient spell I have, I can always drop a Tnarg on top of it if I have too.  For a predictable heal cycle, if the mob is hitting for more than 300DPS after it is slowed by 75% then I can drop a couple of Tnargs in.  But in an xp group, how often does a mob hit for more than 300DPS against a tank with full defensive AA ... assuming I have to take over tank healing in he first place.  Perhaps it is different on tanks without full defensive AA.<br />
<br />
My roomie abuses my shaman to PL his warrior in CoD all the time and he seems to manage with Quiescence and Tnarg with the shaman as the only healer ... he played a shaman to 57 before he switched to a warrior because he hates buffing :)<br />
<br />
I don't know, I play a class with no healing whatsoever ... Quiescence and Tnarg seem pretty kick ass to me :)  I am just trying to understand it a little more I suppose.<br />

<br />
That's the thing though.  Q and Torpor don't heal 300hp a second they heal for 300hp a tick or every 6 seconds which means any mob with better than 50dps and we are going to fall behind.  I would estimate most tier 2 mobs are around 150-200dps slowed or 900-1200 every 6 seconds so we fall behind 600-900 every 6 seconds which can add up fast.<br />
<br />
Shaman have and always will be a good secondary healer in the higher end game.  Sure with Torpor and Kraggs Mending there for a while we could serve as main healers prepop but prepop exp groups could really do without a slower.  But with the huge upgrade to your everyday mobs dps in pop shaman healing has gone downhill fast.  I don't understand the &quot;debate&quot; at a time when shaman have never been such poor primary healers.  Druid and clerics need a slower and slowers need a druid or cleric.  We all need each other to work the most effeciently and that is how it should be in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Hmm there is that ... bad bad math skills ... normally not this bad sigh.  Normally I can do simple math.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I do not really use my shaman to keep a tank up barring brief emergancies but I see at least where the issue is.  It is not that shaman healing is particularly bad, it is that it is bad in relation to what it used to be and worsening in comparision to clerics.<br />
<br />
I still am not certain it is as bad as outlined in the comparision above with respect to druids, given the complete healing line shaman have I am reasonably certain I out perform a druid ... hmm now I am interested enough to run the numbers.  I wonder how the numbers will change if you include Quiescence and consider the fact it stacks with instant heals.  I wonder how the numbers will change when you add in how massively AA effect it.<br />
<br />
Thanks ... more to ponder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">There really isn't an issue in my opinion.  I wasn't complaining that we can't heal well enough because like most other shaman I'm fine with where our heals are at right now.  Most shaman didn't come to this post to say shaman need better heals but came to argue that we don't stand up to a cleric or druid.  I don't think many shaman won't to take over the role of clerics or druids in healing.<br />
<br />
As far as AA it doesn't greatly effect our healing in pop as it doesn't make our HoT's heal any faster.  The issue is we really can't put out enough healing fast enough to make it a very safe thing.  Factor in a bounced slow and there is a better chance I'll die than I'll live to try another slow when I'm the main healer.<br />
<br />
It comes down to you really need a slower and a healer in each group tier 2+.  Druid or cleric can both take the primary healer spot and shaman, enchanters, and beast lords (with 65 slow) can all take the slower spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">When you can kill things with Mez, we'll talk. Until then, you are just grasping at straws. To paraphrase, comparing mez mitigation to slow mitigation is retarded.<br />
<br />
Mez mitigation works until the point you do damage--you know, the game is based around KILLING mobs, not keeping them around for eternity--it's mitigation effect is gone. A mob doing 400dps and taking 1 min to kill will only do 100dps for 10 ticks while slowed (if slow isn't mitigated), dropping it's damage by 75%. The same mob mezzed will still do 400dps during the 10 ticks it takes for it to die, it's damage potential is unchanged.<br />
<br />
Damage mitigation and direct healing power are two extremes. If you can mitigate damage 100%, you don't need healing. If heals always negate damage by 100%, then you don't need mitigation. <br />
<br />
Somewhere in the middle lays the shaman class--viable at healing as long as something is slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">A mezzed mob doesn't hit you while your killing its friend.  Therefor, you can call it damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
For every aurgument, there is a counter-aurgument.  Even if it does hold water and is spelt correctly.<br />
<br />
Now, go pull 3 mobs for me M'kay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Or just Charm it, then you have OVER 100% mitigation because it's not hurting you AND it's helping kill the other mob faster. Heck, that makes it better then CH!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, pure healing power is replacable once you have enough mitigation, or if you don't want to heal the damage dealt (charmed pets). This doesn't happen much on raids unless you let a charmed pet tank in an emergency, but it happens quite a bit in groups.<br />
<br />
It's simple logic that when you have a lot of mitigation, you need very little healing, and when you have little mitigation, a lot of healing power is required.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why groups prefered a damage dealer over a cleric in most exp areas for every expasion except PoP-that much healing simply isn't needed because of mitigation and low mob DPS.<br />
<br />
What's the point of having a ton of healing power, when only a fraction is needed? This is another reason why just looking at spell stats and not how they are applied in game is not the most brilliant thing to do.<br />
<br />
PoP changed the lobsided balance between damage mitigation and healing power. It made healing more important by upping mob DPS by a sigificant margin compared to Luclin. However, people are already getting around, or simply getting used to the higher DPS, although at a much slower rate compared to previous expasions. Even if we don't count Charm, which is a special case, how long will it take for people to get enough gear/AAs and once again make massive healing power take a back seat in many PoP exp zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Considering its been said that it takes @1800ac to begin to mitigate alot of the dmg that PoP mobs dish out...........I think we can safely say its going to be awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Actually it's not going to happen before the next expansion. <br />
If you think any gear you will get from this expansion is going to reliably upping your mitigation by more than 10-20% you are fooling yourself.<br />
<br />
Most people you group with have(or should have) already maxed their damage mitigating AA's and no gear in PoP will make more difference than these AA's. <br />
Remember we are talking of mitigation. Having a tank with 3 k more HPs will give you an easier time on slow resists, but you will still be having to use the same amount of heals over an extended period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Okay then now that you have seen the clear evidence that shaman are teh suck healers(pretty graphs cannot lie!)... we shall look at the rest of the story, healing over time.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Cleric - Supernal Elixir<br />
Shaman - Quiescence<br />
Paladin - Supernal Cleansing<br />
Druid - Natures Recovery (This is as close as druids come to Healing over Time, outside AA)<br />
<br />
<br />
Again assuming everyone is 65, no aa/focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Total HP healed with best heal over time spell<br />
http://pandemonium.uoregon.edu/graphs/hot-total.gif<br />
<br />
Yay!  Shaman aren't in last place here.  In fact, we are second best!   Temper this by seeing how much closer we are to paladins, than to clerics, in our ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing per second with best heal over time spell<br />
http://pandemonium.uoregon.edu/graphs/hot-bytime.gif<br />
<br />
Woo!  Again, Shaman aren't in last place here (/comfort druids).  In fact, we are again, second best.  But once again we are much closer to paladins than to clerics here, for comparison.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Efficiency - HP healed for 1 mana used.<br />
http://pandemonium.uoregon.edu/graphs/hot-bymana.gif<br />
<br />
And there you have it.  THE ONE AREA WHERE SHAMAN ARE BETTER THAN OTHER HEALERS.  Quiescence is very very efficient healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So in direct healing, as the pretty, non-lying graphs showed yesterday, we are clearly in last place of the priest classes.<br />
And if you are curious...I did not include paladins because they don't have quite the same heals they have a 1 second, 850hp heal and a 5 second 1125 hp heal.  I only included them today for curiosity sake.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Healing Over Time, we are unsurprisingly a better healer than we are in direct healing.  To get these results though, you must be level 65 and have the rune spell Quiescence.  Torpor would look the same on the graphs but cannot be used in the same ways because of its negative effects and it is, in my opinion more rare than Quiescence.<br />
<br />
<br />
The final catagories, Group Healing and Group Healing Over Time... they are even more efficient in many situations, but we lack any ability in that area.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So now we have graphs, lets make a score card!!<br />
I am gonna throw out the Paladins in the scoring here, I just wanted to add them in for comparison.<br />
<br />
Healing Over Time - Points: Best = 3, Second = 2, Last = 1<br />
Large Heals - Points: Best = 3, Second = 2, Last = 1<br />
Fast Heals - Points: Best = 3, Second = 2, Last = 1<br />
<br />
There are 9 Catagories.<br />
Healing Over Time - Mana Efficiency<br />
Healing Over Time - HP/Sec Healed<br />
Healing Over Time - Total Healed.<br />
Large/Long Heal - Mana Efficiency<br />
Large/Long Heal - HP/Sec Healed<br />
Large/Long Heal - Total Healed.<br />
Quick Heal - Mana Efficiency<br />
Quick Heal - HP/Sec Healed<br />
Quick Heal - Total Healed<br />
- Max Score would be 27.<br />
<br />
<br />
Score Card<br />
Clerics = 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2 = 26<br />
Druids = 2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1 = 15<br />
Shamans = 1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3 = 13<br />
<br />
<br />
So, even counting in Healing Over Time - Shamans are still the third best healer(priest), by the numbers.  Though because druids lack a real Heal over time the differences are fairly equalized.<br />
<br />
Again, I would like to point out that in order to become a real viable healer, or at least to see the results that I am talking about, at the high levels, a shaman must have Quiescence (torpor doesn't cut it).  None of the other spells for the other classes in these comparison require a rune turn-in spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Very nice once again Henora....but<br />
The final catagories, Group Healing and Group Healing Over Time <br />
Your forgot our overpowered Group Replenishment.<br />
Technicallly it's a Grp HoT, but if it were ever to save anyone over level 25, I'll be damned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">OMG!  DO NOT QUESTION THE GRAPHS!<br />
<br />
have you learned nothing?  :(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of our grp regen, personally.  My definition for a heal over time spell in this analysis though was that a Heal Over Time spell is defined as a heal spell that stacks with our regen spells (which is why Natures Recovery is even on the list).<br />
