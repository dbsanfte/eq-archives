<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 65 shammy with quiescence and most spells.  I also have a 65 enchanter with all spells/dc etc.  On a thrid account I have a 52 pally that I want to level/aa as fast as possible.  Where do you think I could exp the fastest with that combo??  Any tips on tactics?   Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The plethora of undead MoBs, combined with Instrument of Nife, easily singlepulled at 60+ = faster XP. You kill faster than you can in POI/D, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi Rekcim, i have a 65 shaman and a 53 pally on another account.. currently i either exp in poi or pon.. great exp.<br />
<br />
as far as tactics go i just slow mobs.. keep all buffs on paladins like focus, sta, ferine avatar, haste and replenishment.. have him wack mobs to 49% health or so then root it and send pet to finish mob off.. and send paladin to pull another :)  hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I PL'd my ranger doing PoJ rats/senties.  I did about 5 lvls and 20+ AA there.  Initally pull ZO rats and sentries and fight near there ass you will get adds until he is lvl 56 or 57.  Slow and Root (they will flee) w/ shaman and then send in dog and Dot once rat is 60%.  Try doing AA at 52 and see how much you get per kill.  As you lvl, move in farther and pull downstairs rats.  Its a mindless grind but at least sentries drop diamonds.</div></div><hr />
