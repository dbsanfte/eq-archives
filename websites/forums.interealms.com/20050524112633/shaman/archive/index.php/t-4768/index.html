<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this shouldn't be an end all of spells.. but was thinking the other day about junk buffs and cancel magic that we all love.  (was fighting in SG..stupid enchanters)<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure to get into an uber guild they reqire you to have an insta-buff for raids and such, and Naggy and Vox raid require basiclly 4 or 5 junk buffs before the raid.  Always seems you need to do your insta-click item and then junk buffs and such.<br />
<br />
It occured to me why not just put in a spell &quot;magic protection&quot; (group please) and that all it does is adds magic counters.  Now I don't remember if cancel magic takes random spells off or it trully does start at the top and works it's way down... but maybe they could change the code a bit to make sure that if you do have &quot;magic protection&quot; running it would have to strip though that first... rather than demanding that it be the very first/second buff.<br />
<br />
I didn't work out any details for it, but was just a suggestion.  Maybe have multiple levels of the spell such at 29 get one that adds 6 counters, and at 49 get one that adds 9, and at 55 get one that add 15, and 60 for one that adds 20 counters.<br />
<br />
It would have very limited uses... and thinking about it not sure if it would even be a shaman spell or enchanter spell.  But shaman protecting there tribe... maybe it should be a shaman spell?<br />
<br />
Anyway just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heey, not bad! dispel protection! thats not limited use, everyone hates dispellers. assuming it's doable, in that it wont be gone from a single dispel(well, even then it could have it's uses if it's the first spell regardless of it's position)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not a bad idea!<br />
But I'd still rather have a decent nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice idea!  /rude Glare Lord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">of course, why would mobs dispell then??? I like the idea though, just not sure if it would be mor good then harm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Glare Lords and Tenticle Terrors (and pretty much all the rest of the bastard plane) don't dispell you if you're at max melee range.<br />
<br />
But yeah. Dispell immunity would be very cool. Would make PvP pretty interesting though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi ya,<br />
<br />
Thats a Great idea !!<br />
<br />
While we are at it, I was thinking it would be great to have<br />
an Agility / Stamina / AC combo buff (like Focus &amp; Grp Focus)<br />
that stacked with everything too !!  <br />
<br />
Hehe, while we are on ideas, how about a Point Blank Slow,<br />
better DD (the ones that were planned for Luclin looked fine).<br />
<br />
I also like the idea of ' Curses '.  We are Shaman, we should<br />
have a multitude of curses .....<br />
<br />
Hehe, anything but making me heal on Raids .... <br />
<br />
I have a few more ideas, but might post a few later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Funny.<br />
<br />
Poisons have counters.  When you cure poison it takes away so many counters, so if you a low level cure against a high level poison you have to cast the cure multiple times.<br />
<br />
I am basiclly saying the same thing.  When a mob casts cancel magic we have a buff that has X amount of counters and the cancle magic removes the appropriate number off the spell.  The higher level you get the more counters you can cast.  I know attacking some mobs it is expected that it will strip 3 buffs everytime it casts it's aoe, hopefully this spell would help prevent that from occuring.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as I said just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How about Ancient True North as a group buff?  That'll get you proficient with those strafe keys!  :)</div></div><hr />
