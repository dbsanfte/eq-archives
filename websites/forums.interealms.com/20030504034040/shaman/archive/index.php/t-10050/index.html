<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in a guild that raids pretty often, minimum of 2 or 3 per day, most of the time more.  I am saving up my plat for one of the big 2 spells, Malo and Torpor.  If i can only save up enough for one, which should I go with.  For a while i was leaning toward torpor, for how it helps with can dancing, but now with the new heals, 58 and what ever the other lvl is,  I am thinking Malo, for helping out on raids and such.  What do yas all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catrak Skyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Both spells are good at all... But if u raiding alot u should get Malo due its way more use for raids then Torpor, since Torpor got a slow effect its not really usefull to cast it on tanks during fights !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it seems pretty obvious that Torpor would be great for soloing but less useful in raids, while Malo would be great in raids and slightly less useful solo.<br />
 <br />
If your guild is constantly raiding and you're constantly taking part in these raids then Malo would probably help you contribute better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Malo is good for raids, but torpor is good for EVERYTHING!!! It dramatically increases your mana regen which makes buffing easier, keeping mana up on long fights more managable and can help keep you alive longer if slow gets resisted one time too many. If you can only get one, I'd recommend getting torpor, at least if you're having to purchase it yourself. Try to convince your guild to help you take down the mobs that drop malo. After all, it's in their interests to help you get this spell, whether they realize it or not. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do any of the other shaman in your guild have Malo? If none do, and you raid quite a bit, then Malo would be the better of the 2 to have. Also, it would probably be in your guilds best interest to help you aquire a copy of it. If there are other shaman in the guild with Malo, I would definitly go with torpor first. It is not nearly as situational as Malo, and makes a dramatic increase to your power as a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why is Malo (-45 debuff) going for 70k+ when the lvl 63 Malosinia (-70 debuff) only goes for 3-4k?<br />
Also with Torpor if you can ever find it, you've now got 62 Tnarg's mending and 64 Khura's Mending?<br />
Why are these prices still so high?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kudor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason that Malo is still so high is because the fact that it is unresistable. While malosinia on the other hand has a resist check. The other option is to go and get malos but im not having any luck on runes at all. The reason Torpor is still so overprices is rarity and demand. All shaman want it if they dont have it all ready. Also the simple raw power of torpor is amazing and poeple know it and are willing to make some money off of the spell we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>pokalow998</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">get malo first<br />
malo, you can use it in raid(very useful) and you need it in PoV zone<br />
<br />
torpor. only good for canni<br />
<br />
pick up one, i will get malo first if i start new shm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your guild has a Mage, then Mala will suffice for raiding.  Once you get torpor, your style of play totally changes.<br />
<br />
Also I think it's easier to get Malo than Torpor.  So I would generally lean towards Torpor if you have a Mage in guild w/ Mala.</div></div><hr />
