<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow nice BP. what kinda graphic does it have? I have always been attached to my vindi, that plate look is nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Zone in and move up the stairs on your right. Keep going and turn right at the first tunnel, you will get to a huge room with a few statics and roamers. Tunnel has roamers too. <br />
<br />
The Miseryfiend is the first spawn on the left inside the big room and he's got a PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah, the BP of much rottage, along with the plate BP of much rottage ;)<br />
[Most of the people who hunt in the zone have better]<br />
<br />
An alternative is to just sit in the zone and send a tell to whoever is at the camp (if anyone). Sooner or later one will drop and start rotting as usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also looking for a loc in Mistwalker camp. Can anyone help me with that?<br />
<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get the maps from eqtoolbox, the named are all listed there.<br />
Is there a new map? The one I have only has about 3 nameds listed on it. I will check it myself, but just asking for curoisity purposes, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it has a chain graphic...I'm fond of the Vindi plate graphic as well</div></div><hr />

The Miseryfiend is the first spawn on the left inside the big room and he's got a PH.<br />
It's actually the 2nd right after the stairs. First right services Channeler Pyren, the named Ikaav (R-Something) and the Companion Prefect. 2nd right opens to a big room, Aneuk on your left on the inside is the placeholder.</div></div><hr />
