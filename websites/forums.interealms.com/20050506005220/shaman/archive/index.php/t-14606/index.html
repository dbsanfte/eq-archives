I'd like to know when maxed exactly what they do for what spells. what's the draw backs and the enhancements? <br />

Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jadii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">healing adept adds hps to your heals so you are healing more per cast.<br />
<br />
healing gift is a chance to make those wonderful crit heals.<br />
<br />
ATM, i have healing adept 3, advanced healing adept 1, and healing gift 2... on average i have 2500-3000 (up to 3200) crit heals, but i also have a healing focus item... with normal uncrit heals of 2000-ish<br />
<br />
They don't affect Torpor line of spells... but work on straight heals.. and CHs</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have both of these AA at the maximum.<br />
<br />
These days the only spell I used for fast heals is Tnarg's Mending.<br />
<br />
With Tnargs I would say the average non-crit heal amount is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1600-1700hp, with a max crit heal of 3408. I have a healing focus though.<br />
<br />
Drawbacks? None that I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was trying to figure this out myself...what the max hit you can get in with these AAs.  I know that with Advanced Healing Adept 3, it adds approx 19% to your basic cast of Tnargs...and that combined with an item that gives Healing IV on it...should give you upwards of over 1800 Tnarg heals.  I know that the shaman in my guild that uses it, has his emote that says that it is doing 1800 heals...so I know this to be true.  He has mentioned that gets crits of 3400 too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With all AA's maxed and Marr's gift focus from arms its like the above poster said. 3Kish crits about every 5 or so heals (real random though cause EQ uses black voodoo to generate %'s and such...could be none for 15 heals then 5 in a row..or spread out..ect).<br />
<br />
Normal healing is 1500-1890ish. This is also random, with the heals falling anywhere in this range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When do you start &quot;Crit Healing&quot;?  I haven't seen one yet.  Is this just an AA skill thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When do you start &quot;Crit Healing&quot;?  I haven't seen one yet.  Is this just an AA skill thing?<br />
<br />
Healing Gift allows you to perform exceptional heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have all healing AA's maxed and elemental arms (Marr's Gift on those, up to 25% bonus on heals).<br />
<br />
Here's how I've been told it works. Healing Adept % is a flat bonus and is doubled by crits. So if you have Advanced Healing Adept maxed, you get 19% flat bonus to all your heals. 19% of 1300 is 247. So with this maxed, you get 1547 on all your Tnarg's. Healing bonus focus items are different though. They work like DD bonus focus items, meaning the bonus is variable, up to the max. Improved Healing 4 focus is 20%, while Marr's Gift (Solusek Ro cloak and Elemental arms have this, and probably other items) is 25%. However, healing bonus focus items are not doubled by crits. This is why you can crit for odd numbers instead of evens. <br />
<br />
So with AHA maxed and Marr's gift you get 19% to 44% healing bonus, or 1547 to 1872 on Tnarg's. If you crit it, you get 3094 to 3419. However, I could swear I've seen some crits for over 3.5k, so I think this isn't exactly right. If the healing focus items were doubled, you'd see crits for over 3.7k, and I've never seen that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great Discussion... but what if you dont have Marr's?? Just the AA.... Will you still have a chance at crit? and does it do 1500 instead of 1800? seems to me 200 more hps healed would not be worth it until you have absolutely nothing left to spend points on. <br />
<br />
Does our CH spell see any benefit?  No one has mentioned this yet. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Adept does affect Kragg's, I just did a heal over 2200 with it, Kragg's will not crit though, ever.  The reason no one mentioned it is because once you have a few AAs casting tnarg's is way more efficient.  I'm only at adept4, but with my IH4 hat I can crit for nearly 3200 with Tnarg's, and do 15-1700ish normally.  if Tnarg's crits, which it does fairly often it heals more than Kragg's does, and I can cast tnarg's twice for way more than kraggs can heal in the 10 secs kragg takes to cast.<br />
<br />
also, for the guy above this post, marr's is just a better version of improved healing4.  The way heals work, it takes the basic heal amount, adds whatever adept% it should, if then checks your healing gift level, and sees if it will crit, if it passes this check, it will double the heal up to this point .  If you have improved healing4 (adds up to 20% of base value to a heal) or marr's gift (adds up to 25%), it calculates what percentage it will add and adds it on after the crit is calculted.  Marr's or IH4 do not affect critting or not critting, they just add more on to the back end of the heal.<br />
<br />
IH4 adds 1-20% of the base value randomly, between 13 and 260 for tnarg's. with adept3 (10%) and IH4, you will do 1300+130(HA3)+(random13-260) or 1443-1690.  a crit with adept3 and IH4 would do ((1300+130)*2)+(random13-260) or 2873-3120.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps more than it confuses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Critting is soley determined by points spent in Healing Gift.  <br />
<br />
I haven't memmed our &quot;CH&quot; (I use the term loosely) in months, but I often see clerics critting on their CH, so I assume ours will crit as well.<br />
<br />
Whoops, simulpost with Drinnar.  Truthfully, I'm unsure if Healing Adept or Healing Gift will affect our &quot;CH.&quot;  I haven't bothered to mem that crummy spell since I scribed Tnargs.  However, I thought our &quot;CH&quot; was governed by the same rules as the cleric CH, if they are critting CH, why can't we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just tested it, adept DOES affect kraggs, but kraggs nor the druid version will ever crit.  they let cleric CH crit cause it doesn't really matter<br />
<br />
edit to add that tnarg's is still 10x better anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still dont see the value of healing crits.<br />
<br />
I cant rely on the extra healing so I will still heal at a safe level.. thus wasting the extra healing.  If their life is saved by my getting a crit, I waited too long to heal.<br />
<br />
I see the value of bigger heals.. being able to unmem kraggs and only use tnargs/torpor(still dont have Q) would make me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I thought the same thing, Slurm, until I put 2 points into HG &quot;just for fun.&quot;  I'm really enjoying the crit heals.  If you max out HG, you have nearly a 1 in 5 chance to crit...that's pretty significant!   <br />
<br />
Considering some of the AAs I've purchased where I felt kinda &quot;ho hum&quot; (SCM 3, MC 3, ND 3), HG is a very enjoyable AA.  You can actually SEE results!  Even at HG 2 (1.5 points until HG 3), I am seeing quite a few crits.<br />
<br />
I have completed HA 3 and planning on finishing AHG 3, I feel like a fairly competent healer again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the value lies in the magnitude of the heal.<br />
<br />
It's not like you time every tnargs so that someone is healed exactly to full health at 1300 a pop.  Lots of times you are probaby spamming it.  In that case, a couple of criticals may well have more magnitude than healing 1450 (or whatever) consistently will have.  <br />
<br />
It seems to me the critical heal is more valuable than the slightly bigger heal, and both work well together.  <br />
<br />
That said, I don't have them yet.  I'm thinking of going with critical heals next though.<br />
<br />
Tough call.  I like hearing folks experiences with these.  I don't have SCRM yet, but I would like to see some critical type thing.  A longer torpor would be nice, but 20 AA is a lot of AA.  <br />
<br />
Then again, I probably should do CA next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you have a healing focus item, go for healing gift over healing adept.<br />
<br />
Like the above posters, I did HG for fun (have Hg3, no pop HG yet), and it is a lot of fun, and damn useful if you catch a cleric/ench just in time. with ha1/ih4 mask I'm hitting arounds 2900's crits, most in 2700-2800 range.<br />
<br />
with quickbuff2 and haste of mithanial (45% beneficial haste unbuffed), I can heal a decent amount of hp in a short time frame, ie: patch until chain kicks in, save clerics arse etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the main reason I've been workin on gift is for spothealing, not always useful when you're main healer, but if you catch someone at 20% or less with a crit it's nice to know you just saved their life.  Crits also good for patch heals when your CH chain is kinda shakey.  <br />
<br />
I can also be the only person healing rampage through most of VT just fine by myself now too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This is an awesome discussion gang! Has been very informative. :) <br />
<br />
I just finished SCRM and have Quinsense and am please with that. <br />
<br />
During big raids I can keep our group up while our cleric is in the CH rotation. But yes, I'd love to make our fast heal much more effective.  Especially if the clerics falter on the CH and us back up healers are fast healing the MT... A well timed crit could maybe get the CH rotation back on track =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">203 aa now.<br />
<br />
Crit heals are So nice to have. Because if I am not Q ing somone. then I am in Oh crap mode. Spamming Tnarqs like a Rodent On the food button.<br />
<br />
So would I want a 10% more heal and have to spam another heal in  another 6 seconds. Or a crit for 100% And have time to Q them so they don't keel over.<br />
<br />
Currently At Advanced Healing crits 2 or 4 (Only one left to purchase.) and have only two of the second tab of the other one (the marginal Heal improvement thingy). So 6 more aa to get that filled.<br />
<br />
I am actually getting The 6 pointer tho cause With that one done and The third rank of channeling focus I will be done with all of the tab two AA's (Grins) Only 9 more total.<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing. Crits are a heck of alot of fun. I got a Tears of sarym crit a few days ago. All three rains on a single spell cast Critted... I sent a guild message saying I can retire. I have won EQ... (Laughs)<br />
<br />
So Many AA Left... Hmmm. First aid ... sure why not.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Atm I have advanced healing gift 2, and its really fantastic to crit. What it basically does is you are healing for double randomly, so getting twice the heal for the mana. Nice on raids,  say dr00d_003 has been affected by a dot and is in cheal chain, a tnargs is nice to cast, and even better if it crits. Helping spam the MT also the crits are useful.</div></div><hr />
