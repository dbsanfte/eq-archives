<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>walkerofplains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, this has really been stumping me. I consider myself very technical and have tried many different modifications without any luck.<br />
Here is basically my problem. I had a Geforce 3 256 with 64megs of ram. I upgrade to the Asus Geforce 4 Ti 4200 with 128megs of memory. After installing it I ran Battlefield 1942 and ran 3dmark 2003 and noticed about a 50% performance increase or more it was great. I used the latest drivers from Nvidia, Creative, and Dx9. <br />
<br />
The first time logging into EQ it was great, while in the PoTranquility the tree's weren't slowing down my graphics and I was getting higher FPS then before. However when I started raiding, I noticed that I was getting worse performance and FPS while in a raid with about 40-50 people then I would with my old card.<br />
<br />
I have tried many different things such as, enabling/disabling sideband addressing, fast writes, playing with the AGP apature size, trying asus's nvidia drivers, turning vertical sync on and off, and some other things. I know I could lower my mipmap settings but they were set to quality before and the graphics look exactly the same as before. Right now I downloaded beta nvidia drivers that are higher then the ones out right now at nvidia.com, but I found no change the pervious nvidia drivers.<br />
<br />
Mabey there is something I don't know or haven't thought of yet to try but I'm almost running out of ideas. Can anyone help me with this problem.<br />
<br />
-Thanks<br />
<br />
p.s hehe I normally post on the Glade but us rangers don't have a special technical forum.  Hopefully you guys could help me out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">theres your problem .... you bought the 128 meg card it runs at 444 mhz memory clcok if you would have bought the 64 meg 500 mhz memory clock it woudl have ran alot better  i have a pny card and it says that on the box just case you got more memory on the board dosent mean you get the best performance from it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem is you bought an Asus.  Asus does not follow nvidia standards and their cards have always had issues with EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>walkerofplains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wow, good thing they made email notification, and Gruog how did you find this post?<br />
<br />
I could you be a little more specific about your knowledge about Asus' problems, or is there anything I could do like try to use others drivers, hardware tweaks.  I do know of a site that has BIOS updates which was incredibly hard to find for the Geforce series, but they said if your card aint broke you shouldn't update your BIOS.<br />
<br />
Anyone else know anything about this problem with Asus Geforce and EQ problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use at own risk: (sorry but you gotta say that these days)<br />
<br />
First, get your drivers from: http://www.guru3d.com, they're the biggest &amp; baddest download site out there. Unless you're using the newest stuff you may not see the things listed below. If you have issues with beta drivers grab certified ones instead.<br />
<br />
Second, get Destroyer from there if you're not running XP, and follow the directions. You could possibly be having old resident drivers conflicting.<br />
(I think xp users don't need to use it)<br />
<br />
Third, tweak your settings thus:<br />
<br />
Display Settings &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced<br />
Geforce/NVidia &gt; to the pop up screen on the side<br />
<br />
1. nView Display mode &gt; Device Settings &gt; Color Correction &gt; Digital Vibrance = medium (makes the colors go wow)<br />
2. Performance &amp; Quality &gt; <br />
Image Settings = Performance (tweak as needed for speed)<br />
AntiAliasing = 2X (tweak as needed)<br />
Anisotropic = off<br />
3. Direct 3D settings = Enable fog<br />
Mipmap Detail = High Performance (tweak as needed)<br />
<br />
Now then, all that said...<br />
Unless you're running a 3 gigahertz, with a gig of dual channel factory matched RAM, you ARE going to experience lag in PoK and Bazaar. If you don't have the system behind the video card, it won't do you much good.<br />
<br />
To increase your speed in game:<br />
Turn off Luclin models you don't care about. Leave horses on if you have one.<br />
Turn Clip plane (in display settings) to something other than farthest, and bring it in when in laggy zones.<br />
Turn Opacity down to at least 20%, and off for huge raids.<br />
Turn Particles to medium, and off for huge raids.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>walkerofplains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you for your helpfull advice.  I have come to the finding that the way the EQ engine is right now, even people with top top of the line systems like 3.2ghz and a geforce 5900fx will still not be pushing what I want durring raids, which is 30-40+ FPS.  I have compared my results with others who have simular systems or better systems using fraps and my framerate is beating their, but I guess I'm way to spoiled and think that 15-20fps durring raids is way unacceptable.  It's getting worse throughout the elemental planes like Fire where even without 40-50 others at zone in, I'm getting below 30fps with a 2.2ghz amd athlon processor and 756mb of PC2100 ram.<br />
<br />
I've tried beta drivers, and all the new drivers past 44.03 for me seem to be designed for the geforce FX and don't really do much.<br />
<br />
More then likely I'm going to retire soon anyways, I can't stand raiding anymore while getting 10-15fps.  And if you tell me that you get more, please go download the program called fraps and actually see what kind of framerate you'll get because others in my guild have told me that they get no lag and I make them download fraps and I beat them in framerate.  It's just what I consider unplayable framerate, others deem as acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">one thing I read in several spots is that EQ is not very demanding on the graphic card but on processor/memory.  Of all the improvements I've done, memory to 1 gb, graphic card from gf3-&gt;gf4600-&gt;5800fx and processor -&gt;3GHz, the memory addition did most to my framerate, followed by the pocessor replacement.  The graphic cards are pretty much interchangable without much notice.  And I still can't turn smoothly in the bazaar with clip plane full open and names on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>walkerofplains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wish LDoN would include them redoing the whole graphics engine, I guess they figured out that since they won't be doing a total redesign on their graphics engine, they will just have to do away with large raids and have small group content.</div></div><hr />
