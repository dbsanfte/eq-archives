/say Lair<br />
<br />
How to drive people nuts... do this over a 3 week period.<br />
<br />
Step 1, install a 5 minute timer on all sewer expeditions to keep people from farming him.<br />
<br />
Step 2, make him untrackable.<br />
<br />
Step 3, increase the timer to 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
Step 4, remove him!<br />
<br />
Step 5, laugh as people waste hours looking for him.<br />
<br />
<br />
...So I spent an hour with 3 friends, each in our own expeditions, looking for one.  Neither my group or the 2 other groups looking found one up in all that time.  Did anyone else on any other server have any luck finding one?<br />
<br />
Every expansion has had mobs you can farm for spells.  Juggs, back in Kunark...Velious they were spread out quite a bit off all kinds of mobs...Luclin, remember FG? heh, it RAINED spells there.  Then POP came out and people were at the POJ basement and spiders in PON.  Not GoD, you only get spells off nameds here.  <br />
<br />
I really don't think Sludge-Fly needed nerfing, you have 2x spells for each class with only one spell at a time POSSIBLY (not guaranteed) dropping off each named.  It's not like you could go in, get your spells for everyone and be done in 2 hours or something.  I've farmed a lot of Fly and Vxed and still don't have Nihil, I got my copy of (Plague of) Daluda off a named in Barindu.  I think the spells are HARD ENOUGH to get without removing the only viable way to farm them with less than a perfect group.  Myself and my warrior pal could farm Flies.  Sure, it was slow and sometimes we died when we got multiples or my healing just couldnt keep up.  Sadly, the only other real option now for farming spells is Vxed and I need a strong group for that, with a warrior tank and a cleric for nameds.<br />
<br />
GoD, like Everquest in general, gets less and less appealing by the day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree that they are making the spells too hard to get.  That's a tradition with shamans unfortunately.  Since we're supermen (right?), getting our core spells has always required hitting the lottery, being rich well beyond normal measure, or having them in waiting for you when you start your new character in your big brother's uberguild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
even with a max research chanter I dont have pe, it shares a component with a spell that has real value, kinda sad when the best way to get a spell is to kill a mob for a clicky drop. (EB in AC)<br />

without the chanter I would probably still be missing spells but I play on a low pop server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would have to have been exceptionally bad luck.  Myself and 2 guildmates checked approximately 20 different instances.  There were 10 other people there also checking their own instances, in conversations in say they had been there over an hour and had not found a single named.  So that's something like 60-100 instances, assuming the other people there weren't lying.<br />
<br />
I'd be willing accept it as a bug to my server, if someone else claims to have killed Flies on their own server last night.<br />

This does not only affect shaman.  The sludge eating fly drops a spell for every class.</div></div><hr />

This isnt even the end of the problem. Once a fly spawns, there is only a 1 in 10 or so (report from guildies think this is about right for the times they have seen him) he will even drop ANY spell. After that, its a 1 in 12? (how many classes use spells? I forget) chance he drops YOUR class spell. <br />
<br />
What a cruel joke, honestly. Even Runes werent this rare a couple months into PoP. And the results were at least tradable. As it is, reports of spells rotting is making me want to puke. <br />
<br />
EQ is on the way out, and this is just one more example of it. To be honest, I spent all of an hour trying to spawn flys, then I said &quot;Screw it, I dont even NEED those spells anyway, Quies and Tnargs are plenty for what I am doing, since I am not REALLY a healer&quot;. Does SOE truly think that this is how to get people to stay in the game longer? This completely artificial rareness of something SO SO basic to the game? <br />
<br />
Its a joke, and saddly, we are laughing at THEM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It still spawns Henora, just seems much rarer. This seems to be the case since the patch where they adjusted the drop rate on the BiC quest items. Allmost all of those we have found up have been in the tunnel as well, not the first room, so a little bit of clearing is needed to slow you down still more  :D .<br />
<br />
I agree, its frustrating as hell, especially considering that when you do find one it usually drops that mask or arms, with the spells as uncommon and the aug as a rare  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Big pain and Nihil is the only GoD spell I have.<br />
<br />
With a group of 8 to 15 guildies continuously farming the Lair we were able to get a average of maybe a spell an hour, but it was streaky. <br />
<br />
After not spawning any Flys that were close enough to go after for all day, like 10 hours worth, I spawned one that was two kills away from the zone in.  Called a kill group together, killed him, a spell drops.  Next Lair expedition, another named spawned in the same location. Killed him, cleric heal spell.  As I was holding the instance waiting for a cleric to show up to loot I realized that one of the wanderers was a Sludge Eater.  Recalled the kill group.   Three kills later, another cleric spell.  Two cleric spells in one expedition after only 5 kills.  3 spells total on 2 back to back expeditions within about 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
Relative to flies being untrackable. Use ausidious vision or what ever it is called.  Bind sight to a mob, F9 to move to 3rd person and hop from mob to mob or snag a wanderer to look at the front part of the zone for Sludge Eaters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Okay, quick note!  The fly does still spawn (I've gotten a couple within the last week).  It's more rare now.  I used to see one within 10 or so missions, now it's more like 1 per 20.  Having lots of people or alts check is useful.<br />
<br />
I have seen only ONE fly spawn in the first room.  Most seem to spawn a little ways in, or be the wandering mob.  Track no longer works, but guess what?  Assiduous Vision does.  Get a 'lair' expedition from Gamesh.  Invis and lev, and float over to that stone in the water.  You can bind vision to a wandering mob, and he'll wander quite a ways in.  You can check the whole first tunnel for flies (if you don't have Holgresh Elder Beads).<br />
<br />
They're still not common, but you can have some of those other people farming join you and go for the named.  I'd say spell drops about 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 mobs.  Of course, that's a pretty low chance for the shaman spell in particular, but at least it's a chance.<br />
<br />
This past week I got both Daluda's (Chavoor in Vexd) and Balance of the Nihil (Sludge-Eating Fly)<br />

Good luck, chief.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">These nameds are now untrackable?  Is there anything else in the entire game that's untrackable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Didn't say it affected only shamans.<br />
<br />
As to a particular I did have in mind, though -- I'm thinking on this expansion about our HOT.  HOT's used to be extremely significant for shamans, and torpor was a monster to get.  Took me more than six months of constantly trying to buy it and more than that of hoping to loot it.  Finally bought it for a fungi tunic plus 50k.  Our new HOT is an ancient spell, right?  Yet HOT's are a core spell, if you have any conception in your mind of what torpor was and did for us and our groups when it first came out.  So once again, a core ability is locked far, far away from most of the class.  I have no doubt that just as shamans were considered balanced by virtue of having torpor even though very few had it, this ancient spell will be considered as part of class balance, as it is already considered one of the &quot;significant upgrades[PLURAL]&quot; Brenlo stated we already got.<br />
<br />
Yet clerics get key spell at 39 and don't have to do anything more than take a trip to the vendor. <br />
<br />
I'm very much of the mind that ancient spells should never be spells key to your functionality.  DOTs -- ok.  You can live without them and for most of the game it won't make any difference, but getting one will be a nice reward, if that's what you're into I guess. HOT's, slows, heals -- a big fat NO from me -- never make them ancients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Korucust is untrackable.<br />
<br />
Have you guys got the fly since the patch earlier this week?  To be clear, the patch was Wednesday, 3am... so wed night or thursday night.<br />
<br />
I just find it terribly hard to believe it was that much bad luck.<br />
<br />
And yes, Stalking Probes/Holgresh beads and Bind sight are, or were, your friend when searching for the Fly.  You can't bind sight to 2 different types of ghost mobs though, they just randomly change your target.<br />
<br />
Last time I did fly farming was last week, we got 4 Fly.  All 4 had the spell Rock of Taelosia and the plate arms.  :p<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - I have Daluda and I have Trushar, I am not particularly concerned with not having Nihil.  I am more interested in getting Holy Light for all my clerics, that is why I farm for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Blarg, our new HoT, Breath of Trushar or whatever it is, is not an ancient.  It takes a talosean geomancy stone (off many named mobs) turned in to a guy on the boat in the Abysmal Sea.  That's it.  There is only 1 turn in spell for each class, so you only need 1 geomancy stone.<br />
<br />
Our only ancient spell is the Ancient Chaotic Pain--the cannibalize upgrade.  No one has seen it yet that I know of.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
*edited--Just as an FYI, I had Breath of Trushar LONG before I got Nihil and Daluda.  Breath of Trushar is actually pretty easy to get if you farm a little.  That's because the talosean geomancy stone is usuable by all classes, but everyone only needs one.  A named mob may drop a geomancy stone or not if it's the right kind of mob.  Figure 33-50% geomancy stone drops on the right kind of mobs.  On nihil and daluda dropping mobs, the random number generator has to check for (a) a spell to drop, and (b) for the right class of spell to drop.  That's a much lower chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ah ok thanks for the clarification.<br />
<br />
I mean the same thing either way, of course.  A basic ability should not be an ancient or fantastically difficult to get.  Not only does it make some characters potentially far more powerful and valuable than others(torpor and malo both very much did so), but the designers have the tendency to balance class design and think of how a class functions in game content based on characters with full spell sets of all important spells. In a game where shaman functionality at the top end veers between non-existent and hanging by a thread, balancing the game as if people had all the important spells takes a bad idea and makes it dangerously worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmmm....they are saying over on the rogue boards that the named dont pop right away when you start the instance now, but only after some period of time. One poster claims that one popped in an area that wasn't cleared of PHs, so it might be based on a timer or number of mobs killed. If this is the case it would have to be as of the last patch, since the BiC adjustment patch still had them spawning on startup, allthough the spawn patterns had changed.</div></div><hr />

EB in AC drops a clicky with PE effect on it? I didnt see it on the loot table, what is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It drops off a wurm in acrylia caverns.  Back when Luclin was new, it probably dropped 3 out of 4 kills, along with other stuff like KEI, a nice melee belt, etc.  It's group only, and cannot be MGB'd.  Makes a great junk buff still, to hit all party members at once when everyone is being debuffed, or if you're at the level when casters or others still need stamina, it's got 20 of that for them.  It cannot be cast over avatar, and avatar will overwrite it, so not quite as good for the melees, even though it's 20 to every melee stat(dex/agi/str as well as sta).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I got all three of my GoD spells thankfully already.  Really, so far in 250+ Sludge Eating Fly kills I'm seeing about a 22% +/- spells to kills ratio.  The ratio has went up lately though as I've prob gotten maybe 5 spells in 10 kills.  I got the shaman slow from the 14th kill, and have seen I think three others.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that in 250+ kills, I still have yet to see a cleric heal, or a mage spell.  The only reason that I camped the final 200 of them was to attempt to help the clerics get their heals, but thankfully both got them when I wasn't around.  Hands down, the cleric heal is by far the best spell that you can get from the Fly.<br />
<br />
Honestly, both of the normal spells were very much worth getting.  I'm pleased with the heal, meaning I'm pleased that it's a bit better than Tnargs (although not quite as good as I would have liked it to be).  I'm pleased with the new slow.  I tend to use it now during raids, especially while clearing mobs (where they die pretty fast, but it makes me feel a bit more needed).  BoT is very nice.  It's slow, but it's pretty much ownage while soloing or duoing (to which Riwwi is my current fav. spot.  The mobs don't hit that hard, and although the exp is crap, at least the potential of some great loot from easy named).  Usually can just stick BoT on myself and will keep myself near full hps.</div></div><hr />

(above is definately accurate info straight from a dev - following is conjecture based on the conversation I had with him however may not be 100% correct)<br />

It seems that you need to kill some mobs in the zone before the named will spawn.  Not sure how exactly that would work but try it and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

Also, after the little message, both the Fly and Worm were trackable by our ranger.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">here's what i found out regarding the revamped sewers since the last patch. i spent around 16 hours with my shaman/ranger duo this last weekend trying to figure out what it takes to get the nameds to spawn. i figured out, as mentioned before on this board, that after the 20th kill, a respawn will occur. only a handfull of mobs will spawn and only sometimes does a named spawn.. and if you're lucky, a few nameds will spawn. <br />
<br />
out of maybe 15-18 attempts of clearing 20 mobs and checking tracking, only four times did i get a named up and once i got two nameds. another time, while going after a named that was in very deep, another named popped from respawns.<br />
<br />
i am trying to do this with every expedition because i'm curious to see what all the nameds drop. my group of a SHM, RNG, SK, CLR was fortunate enough to each get our spells except for my bot ranger before the nerf. we've got some +30 augs, and some decent chain gear for me. i'm by no means uber, so 70/70 bracers treat me right.<br />
<br />
&quot;pools&quot; is the easiest if you have a tracker, because you can get in the NW corner of the first room and track pretty much the whole zone. this zone is also the easiest of all expeditions as far as lvl/hp's of mobs and the named do drop spells. &quot;crematory&quot; being second on the list is harder to track nameds to the map being more of a linear style than circling around. &quot;lair&quot; is third, has the Sludge Eating Fly and Blistering Larva, is an easy to track zone and &quot;plant&quot; is the toughest as far as lvl of mobs and zone itself.<br />

hope this helps in obtaining BotN =)</div></div><hr />
