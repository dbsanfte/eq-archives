JB Boots<br />
<br />
Jarcrap Legs will give you 1 ac than the RE but RE just look too cool :)<br />
<br />
Get a rygorr, sentry, jarcrap or totemic bracer to switch in and out for the supplescale armband, if you desperately need ac.  The extended range I have found is helpful in some places but not others.<br />
<br />
Is your defense maxed?  If not start working on it right now, single most effective ac upgrade is maxing this skill.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The boots could use an upgrade.  You can proc the boots from a general inventory slot, so if you're looking for straight up ac, I'd recommend matchless dragonhorn boots.  I got these first-hand soloing Yeldema, and they're ac 19 agi +11 magic + 7, all 3 very nice stats.  The agi adds even more to the AC and the extra mr can always come in handy for raids/groups/duels etc.  <br />
<br />
Imo, you could use a little more wisdom if it's currently at 155 (don't expect everyone to agree with me), so I'd change the belt.  Flayed Turmoilskin Belt from Fear I suppose is the very basics: ac 9 dex 6 wis 5.  You'd lose 40 hps and 1 ac, but you'd gain 5 wisdom.  These belts have been around a while, so I expect you can find them cheap.  Cobalt Drake Belt is also nice (ac 8 sta 5 wis 8 mana 5 cold 4), but it's a little more expensive, and the ac is even lower, but you do get 3 extra wisdom and 5 more sta = more hp.  <br />
But what I would recommend the most if you can afford it is silvery belt of contention: ac 10 sta 4 int/wis 5 and 21% haste.  Sells for around 10k on my server, but you'd have no ac loss, you'd have the extra wisdom, and at least you have the 4 stamina which gives you x hp's (anyone know the formula for sta &gt; hp conversion?).  Oh, and if you're a battle shammy, the haste is nice too :D <br />
<br />
For the face slot, I use mask of war, which would definatly be an upgrade to what you have.  Mask of War is 9 ac str +2 sta +5 wis +9 right click yaulp II.  Higher ac than arctic wyvern, more wis, extra stamina and a free right click buff (takes 1.5 seconds to cast).<br />
<br />
I'd also drop the supple scale armband, unless you need the focus effect at all costs.  You're taking a big dive in ac for that slot, and I don't think it's worthed.  Actually, I have a pretty viable alternative that you can work on.  When I was soloing in ss the other day, a square helm dropped.  It has the same exact focus effect and it's ac 12 agi 3 wis 6.  You'd be losing 6 ac from the helm, but gaining 6 extra wisdom and preserving the extended range III effect.  Plus, that will free your bracer slot up, and what I used to wear was reinforced dragonhide bracer: ac 12 cha +5 wis +9.  So you'd gain 9 ac and 4 wisdom over the SSA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My defense is maxed, but more than specific upgrades id like to know if my current AC is good, bad, average, or whatever. Or if i really need some other upgrades, i like my boots cause they have wis, resists and stuff, and they look cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nektar.. 5 wis isnt really going to do THAT much. 40hp is worth 5wis I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i'd get west wastes shoulders and 2 electrum black sapphire earrings :)  <br />
<br />
<br />
or those cure dis/poi earrings from chardok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you about same as me AC wise, i consider myself pretty much average until i get a Velious BP with some AC on it.  Fungi works for me though :)<br />
I like my rune etched boots over JB just because of the CR and the extra 20hp.  I have both for those times where i just need those two extra points of AC.<br />
I would suggest coldain skin gloves instead of JB.  <br />
Maybe a cloak with some more AC.  I carry both acrylia studded cloak and ancient seahorse cloak and switch out depending on situation.<br />
As for me, i need a  new shoulder piece.  Cant quite decide whether i want to spend money on an IGS or ODS or even continue shawl quest til 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You have a lot of ac related gear as it is (jb helm/gloves/arms) but if you want more you should improve boots, shoulders, bracer2, cloak, and possiably primary).<br />
<br />
Boots you can get jb i guess, there are a few others that are a bit more pricy.  Shoulders get any ww mantle or igs.  Cloak get shissar, ancient seahorse thingie, or heiro.  Bracer get barbed rubicate or bracer of fortitude.  And if you can stand it switch a paw out for the spear.</div></div><hr />
