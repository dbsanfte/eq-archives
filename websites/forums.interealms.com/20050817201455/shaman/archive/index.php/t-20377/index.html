Has anyone done a successful turn in after last weekend's patch?  I am worried that SOE may have nerfed the turn in for those doing the faction method of the quest rather than completing all the steps.<br />
<br />
Im on E'ci.  If you have gotten your epic since the last patch, and used the faction method, pls post your success (and grats !!).</div></div><hr />

Would also like to know about this, just got another tear so I can do my epic again.  Had epic on another server before char xfer, don't want to mess with it, if I have to redo the WHOLE thing.</div></div><hr />

Side track, but I thought you could petition a GM to have your epic returned if it was lost on a character thansfer?</div></div><hr />

Unless they have started doing that again recently - they discontinued returning epics on character transfers about a year ago - I transferred Kel to Brell to play there since it had become my only server - and was told sorry - no more epic re-imurses on server moves.</div></div><hr />

The patch being discussed occurred on the weekend FOLLOWING Thursday 3/11.<br />
<br />
We still have no confirmation of the faction method.</div></div><hr />

Not in a guild so getting the hole raid done wouldn't have been easy. I hope that they did not nerf this, it makes the non guilded shamans epic a bit easier IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Just on a side note, went back and did the Hole a couple of weeks ago.  65 pally, 63 cleric, 65 druid, 61 chanter, 64 monk, 65 shaman, was pretty trivial, even with the large number of mez immune, slow mitigating mobs.<br />
<br />
The halfling rogue of Brell trick does sorta still work if you need to scout, but most ratmen and all the new gargoyles can see hide/sneak now.  I was never able to get to Kirn with the halfling.<br />
<br />
There is a locked door in the way, but we had a key drop on the way down that opened it.  The key is droppable as well, sorry, don't recall what it dropped from.<br />
<br />
If anyone is on the Brell server, I can show them where stuff is down in the Hole, used to love it before the changes.  Send me a tell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That new key drops quite often so a rogue isn't really needed to get around in the Hole. Spent some time there with a friend a few monthes back and we got alot of those keys, think it was off golems.</div></div><hr />

Same here, but date is different by a couple days or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a hard enough time gettinga  gm to respond to me after i petition.  I've been petitioning about every other night for the past 2 weeks and have yet to get a response.<br />
<br />
I doubt they'll return it to me</div></div><hr />

Has anyone successfully completed their epics done via the factioning route recently? (11-Aug-2004) <br />
<br />
Any replies or feedback is greatly appreciated..<br />
<br />
P.S Is there anyway i can check to see if my faction to true spirit is MAX ally?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time everyone</div></div><hr />

I think it tells you when you right click an npc.  Such as so and so looks at you warmly.  Another way would be to kill a mob that raises true spirit faction and watch for the message that your faction couldn't possible get any better.  Maybe the quest mobs in rathe mountain raise it I'm not sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Faction method works just fine, finally got around to finishing mine a couple weeks ago.  To be sure you are max ally, you must see the 'your faction standing with true spirit cannot get any better' messge.  Just go do woe/envy again to check it.  Conning a true spirit mob indicates whether you are ally or not, will not show max ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">To make certain do woe anvy one more time. It will say. Your faction with true spirit cannot get any better.<br />
<br />
that indicates max ally</div></div><hr />
