I personally like the way the castle in the water is looking along with the &quot;city&quot; zones that I saw. Considering that they are looking at a release that 18 months away I would guess that alot of the zones are ready and just waiting to be flushed out...<br />
<br />
If you guys want to see if pixel shaders work on your current video cards you can download 3dmark2001 and run the tests. You will also get a pretty good idea of how your system will hold up as well...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oiy.  Good thing I upgraded to dual procs.  Looks awesome, but it bet it'll bring any current system to its knees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail All,<br />
<br />
Pretty neat stuff, I think EQ2 will start to grow on people in time.</div></div><hr />

Any of the other old timers remember that old Alpha release video at the eq site long long ago?  You know the one with Freeprot and Blackburrow and the wierdly glowing avatar that ended with a bolt spell killing what looked to be naggy...  amazing how much has changed since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If coded well, those graphics could easily be produced by the high-end systems of today (Athlon XP/P4, GeForce4, etc.), which will be average in 18 months.<br />
<br />
The question remains: Is Verant capable of coding them well?<br />
<br />
We already have the answer: Luclin, the land of &quot;don't write better code, just throw more PC horsepower at it!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Given what we saw in luclin, what makes you think they're going to do well coding for dual processors. /hug deadlocks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know the one with Freeprot and Blackburrow <br />
<br />
Can't resist...<br />
<br />
Freeprot is borken!!!!<br />
<br />
I'm still laughing at the original borken post...LOL<br />

I think that the main reason luclin is such a hog is that they didn't start fresh with a new-ish engine but just monkey-wrenched and jury-rigged the same ole cludgy eq engine that has been around from the get-go. With an entirely new engine it's a whole new ballgame and they can code it with better hardware etc in mind. I could be wrong though, I'm no coder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">. . . does it play nice?<br />
<br />
So far, the features for EQ2 have not been too attractive for me personally.<br />
<br />
Also, the system requirements are a good point.  I currently have a nice system that can run anything.  But will EQ2 make me upgrade again?<br />
<br />
/shrug Will have to wait and see I guess.</div></div><hr />
