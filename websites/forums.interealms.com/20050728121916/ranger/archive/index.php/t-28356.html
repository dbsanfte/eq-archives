Looks to be pretty solid armor.  Sure its not going to beat elemental armor but some (if not most) pieces are better than Ornate.  Add into the fact that you can augment 3 slots and this will make this armor excellent for upgrading my current gear.<br />

I was just going to ask someone with a high point total to post any cool gear available.  One complaint...why oh why +9CHA on the BP?</div></div><hr />

Makes for a great combo when you finally start racking up the points.  <br />
<br />
I will probably first go for the vambraces and then to the bracers.  After that the BP might be the way to go with my gear.  This set of armor will keep me busy with augmenting them for some time.<br />

The Vengeance III augment 1150 pts and I think the 2 type2 stat augments that Razorwind listed are aslo 1150 each.  So a fully augmented piece of armor runs just under 5k adventure points at about 50 points per successful level 65 adventure.  Will take a while to fully equip yourself that way, but even moderately avid player could get one piece in a couple months.<br />

Or you could settle for something less uber and get more pieces in the same time.  I do like the choices in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

One thing to note is that the Mire suit has no dex.  The Spec suit has less sta but more than makes up for it in every other area.<br />

<br />
The Mire is much more cost effective, but it is probably something you would want to make up your mind about now rather than later as it will be more costly in the end if you do change your mind later on after collecting a few pieces.<br />
<br />
The Spec suit has two Type 2 slots and one Type 3 Slot compared to Black Mire which has a Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 Slot.  There are a few nice Type 2 augments available, although expensive.  I think I recall one as having 5 sta, 5 dex and 20 hp.<br />
<br />
If we take an example cost for a piece with augmentations.  Lets say Venegance 3 and The Type 2 Aug I mentioned above would be used in both (a second time for the Spec piece).<br />
<br />
Mire<br />
----<br />
Armor - 760<br />
Type 1 Aug - Free (One of the dungeon drops)<br />
Type 2 Aug - 1150<br />
Type 3 Aug - 1150<br />
Total - 3060 adventure points<br />
<br />
Spec<br />
----<br />
Armor - 1492<br />
Type 2 Aug - 1150<br />
Type 2 Aug - 1150<br />
Type 3 Aug - 1150<br />
Total - 4942 adventure points<br />
<br />
Both have their advantages.  the Mire has better value for time invested while the Spec has superior stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only armor pieces I am looking to get are the arms, leggings, bracer and BP.  (Assuming your STA is not maxed.)<br />
<br />
Looking at individual pieces I can see that Black Mire is the way I should go for 2-3 out of 4 of the armor slots (leggings (and maybe BP) being the one I will go with for specter)<br />
<br />
Breastplate: <br />
Incorporeal Chain of the Specter: AC: 61 Str: +13, Dex: +11, Wis: +10, HP +100, Mana +100 Sv Fire: +12, Sv Cold: +12, Sv Poison: +12 Rec. level: 65 type2, type2, type 3 RNG ROG SHM<br />

<br />
Chainmail of Black Mire: CHEST, AC55 Sta10 Cha9 Wis8 Hp75 Mana75 SvCold9 SvMagic9 SvPoison9, WT2.5, RNG/ROG/SHM, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
Both BPs are excellent.  Only reason I would choose Black Mire over this is because of the overall HPs you would get and the cost of the two items.  Given that the Black Mire has 10sta I will gain about 125-130hps vs. the 100 (110-115 visible) hps from the Specter.  All depends on if you are getting points quickly and if you want to spend twice as many points.  Advantage Black Mire (imho)<br />
<br />
Leggings: <br />
Incorporeal Greaves of the Specter: AC: 38 Sta: +10, Cha: +10, Wis: +6, HP +85, Mana +80 Sv Disease: +13, Sv Magic: +13 Rec. level of 65, type2, type2, type3 RNG ROG SHM<br />

<br />
Greaves of Black Mire: LEGS, AC34 Str8 Wis5 Agi8 Hp70 Mana65 SvFire10 SvDisease 10, WT4.5, RNG/ROG/SHM, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
Clearly here the Specter has an advantage since they net me 135hp vs. 70hp.  Armor class is greater.  The resists are better also and have magic instead of fire.  Advantage Specter<br />
<br />
Arms: <br />
Incorporeal Arms of the Specter: AC: 29, DEX: 6, STA: 6, CHA: 6, HP: 80, Mana: 70, Sv Fire: 7, Sv Cold: 7, Sv Magic: 7, Rec. level: 65 type2, type2, type 3 RNG ROG SHM<br />
<br />
vs.<br />
<br />
Vambraces of Black Mire: ARMS, AC26 Sta5 Cha5 Wis5 Hp65 Mana55 SvDisease5 SvMagic5 SvPoison5, WT2.5, RNG/ROG/SHM, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
These arms are very similiar.  The specter will net about 20hp more.  Only reason I would take the Black Mire over them is because it has poison/disease resists and half the points needed.  Drawback 20 less hp and 5-6ac.  Advantage Black Mire (imho)<br />
<br />
Bracers: <br />
Incorporeal Wristband of the Specter: AC: 23, CHA: 4, WIS: 4, AGI: 6, Hp: 70, Mana: 70, Sv Fire: 3, Sv Magic: 3, Sv Cold: 3, Sv Poison: 3, Rec. level: 65 type2, type2, type 3 RNG ROG SHM<br />
<br />
vs.<br />
<br />
Bracer of Black Mire: WRIST, AC21 Str4 Sta3 Agi4 Hp55 Mana55 SvDisease2 SvCold2 SvMagic4 SvPoison2, Wt6.0, RNG/ROG/SHM, type1, type2, type3<br />
<br />
Armor class is virtually the same.  Hps are the same due to getting 5hps per STA.  Specter doesn't have any STA so the HPs are the same.  Advantage Black Mire (imho)<br />
<br />
Overall, I think both sets of armor are very nice.  The boots, gloves and helm I don't need so I won't comment on those.  The advantage to the Specter is that you get 2 type 2 slots vs. one type 1 and one type 2 and some of the pieces are clearly better.<br />
<br />
The arms and the bracer I am going to go with Black Mire since they are so similiar.  I am still up in the air a little about the BP.  It will all depend on how close I get to the STA cap.  <br />
<br />
In the end though its all about time invested vs. reward.  The Black Mire is half the points of the Specter yet some of the items are similar or actually better in my opinion.  The armor sets both have type 3 slots which is the most important slot.  The other slots can be filled up with augments you get on adventures or by spending even more points to fill slot 2s (I haven't see any slot 2s drop on adventures).  Since I want to maximize the amount of points I earn I will probably lean towards the Black Mire and save up for Type 3 slot augments... as well as that nice little weapon in the Guk camp:  <br />
<br />
Curse-Smelted Long Blade: PRIMARY/SECONDARY, 1H Slash, 14/19, AC8 Dex7 Agi7 Hp75 Mana50 SvCold7 SvMagic7 SvPoison7, WT2.0, WAR/RNG/BRD/ROG, Slot1 type 1, Slot2 type4, Slot 3 type 6 <br />
<br />
and then augmenting it with the +3 damage aug from the Miraguls camp.<br />
<br />
I can dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kensei</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One advantage of the spectral over the black mire which you ignore is the spectral consistently has more dex, wis, mana, and saves. Not in the case of the arms, but on every other slot you compare. I'd guess all those are worth more than 10-20hp per piece for most of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My DEX is at a level that I feel it is high enough... when a shaman is in group it is capped.  <br />
<br />
WIS has never been a huge deal for me due to KEI being readily available and/or mana regen for the group usually is excellent.  In most adventures I can have 2-3 nukes up and can maintain decent mana.  Alone I have FT7... and it will only increase with the amount of FT I can add to the Type 3 slots.  <br />
<br />
As far as the resists go on the selected items I discussed I felt the disease/poison were the primary resists I would want due to the fact that my fire/cold unbuffed are 120/170 whereas my dis/poison resists are 70/63.  You can see why I would favor dis/poison.<br />
<br />
I have ignored nothing.  For these items I see the clear benefits to my character.  YOUR character might be completely different.  Someone else might be is deperate need of DEX, WIS and/or cold/fire resists but those aren't areas that I feel my character is lacking.  STA and HPs (then dis/poison resists) are my main focus.  <br />
<br />
The fact that Black Mire is half as expensive as Specter makes some of those choices very clear.  If I was given thousands of points to spend on a vast amount of items I would probably pick some of the Specter over the Black Mire but since I also want to add some nice Type 3 augs to them in the near future I will settle with the Black Mire and be very happy.  I don't want to be grinding away points endlessly for gear that is just a tad bit better in WIS/DEX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laasy</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">with a dex of 165 Mortok you might want a bit more..  and I do know that with a shamy or enchanter that you will have a 255 dex.. <br />
<br />
Some people think that when you dont have buffs dex is still important and with planar power 5 your max is 305 so more dex items are also in big demand with STA and WIS ...  I know that I am looking for STA DEX and STR. I am trying to keep them all over 225 unbuffed for when I do solo..(well a bit more for the STA, but I am not yet maxed.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will agree that DEX is important but it is not what I look for when I go to buy gear (spend points).  When I did solo I would usually get a focus and be well over 200dex.  Since EQ has moved to most people being in groups I usually have excellent dex.  I guess I just don't see that great of rewards comparing 165dex to 200dex.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Overall, I am saying that the Black Mire vs. the Specter have some items that are very very similar.  The arms and the bracers being two of them that I would much rather buy Black Mire due to the overall point cost. <br />
<br />
Between the two sets of armor if you were to mix and match them to consider overall point totals and what you lose and gain from each set I am sure you would come out with a better set then just going completely Specter or completely Black Mire.  <br />
<br />
The leggings are clearly better for Specter.  The BP is a toss up but even if you went with the Black Mire you would still have an excellent BP.  The arms and bracers for the overall points are a better deal to go with Black Mire.  The boots, helm and gloves are of no interest to me so I didn't comment on those.</div></div><hr />

LOL, I was referring to the QUEST  &quot;woodsman&quot; armor set, not the droppables. <br />

Have a look at it and laugh.  Only advantage was that the quest items were tradeable but there was always 1 item never to be seen.  Sigh... and to think I wasted good money on some items back when.  In it's defense, the blah woodsman's axe looks kinda cool.</div></div><hr />

 Yes, the Black Mire helmet has the chain helm graphic.  I want my points back</div></div><hr />
