<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finished the test of patience today, followed the www.eqshaman.com  guide to a t, but when abe spawned, i talked to him, and he never talked about the arrow, he just up and left.  Do you get any faction when he gives you the arrow? is there absolutely any use for it?  I petitioned but they are not allowed to give out details on quests.  Im hoping i dont hafta do that pain in the butt test of patience again, but i guess id have to if the arrow is absolutely necessary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rumor is that with PoP there will be epic 2s.   continuations of our epics to bring them up to speed with gear out there now and make them the best again.    Random chance it is used in that.</div></div><hr />

  I would like to see a sticky topic someday where people can post off zones where they have tried giving the arrow to ALL people in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gem is the most important.  I have the arrow in the bank, taking up space.  I will wait for awhile before I destroy it.  From the test of patience, I went directly to Rathe Mts and killed the 2 dimwits, then headed to WK for the spirit.  Hailed and chased it for about 5 minutes before it stopped.  Gave the gem, got the quest, handed in the items, took the shield and was on my merry way....heading to Mistmoore real soon..<br />
