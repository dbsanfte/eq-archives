<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do you want to become?<br />
<br />
There is now way they will give us better healing better damage better canabalizing better whatever.<br />
<br />
Lets focus on 1 aspect. <br />
<br />
Honestly myself i rather not see anymore healing upgrades. We will never be as good of a healing with the slow mitigation and Buff wise. Since stats have become completely useless except for HP and ATK i rather not see us get anymore buff either.  We can move away from the unstackableness on raids as a buff whore to some realistic DPS.<br />
<br />
I want us to become more Damage. <br />
<br />
There are many ways they can do this.<br />
<br />
If they focus on pets for us, They should give us a new pet that quads auto, does more damage/higher atk, Higher lvl also and is SOWED !!! With these new pet aa it might actually add some dps. <br />
<br />
Now along with the Pet they could raise our melee some and make rabid bear usable kinda like how archery masterie owns for rangers.  Make rabid bear give us realistic DPS.  It would be cool to fight as a bear with a super pet along side. <br />
<br />
Along with that they should honestly upgrade the Bear graphic. <br />
<br />
If they do not want to do a melee path they could fix dots. <br />
<br />
The new crits are interesting but again not useful because our dots take too long to work thier magic.  It could be possible for them to lower the Duration and raise the damage per tick. There is no reason we could not have lets say a 500 damage a tick dot that lasts for 3 ticks. Or even higher damage, 3 ticks 4 ticks, it has to be below 24 seconds honestly.  They would have to fix aggro of course or just give us spell casting subtley? <br />
<br />
Theses are some ways to up damage and make a new name for our class. <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suggest we compile all of the threads that pop up every day and are exactly the same as this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm trying to gather all these ideas in the sticky thread at the top of the forum.<br />
<br />
Israi, be sure to vote for the shaman issues you consider most important in Henora's vote thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To be honest, I'd like for us to take the role we were intended for.  The battle priest.<br />
<br />
To this end we should redesign the cleric, druid and shaman class like so:<br />
<br />
Cleric:  Best healer, so-so nuke(greater vs undead), so-so melee<br />
Druid: so-so healer, best nuker(greater vs animal), low melee<br />
Shaman: so-so healer, low nuker(greater vs summoned), best melee<br />
<br />
For our melee power we could be given a damage modifier or return our berserker line to where it was a regen+ stats for drain of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been reading over the various threads on GoD and trying to figure out in my own mind what the role of a Shaman is in the &quot;close to end game&quot; (I am not yet elemental flagged).  I've been trying to think of &quot;practical&quot; upgrades that might be possible to implement and wouldn't change our place in the game too much.<br />
<br />
Here's my thoughts.<br />
<br />
1.  Shaman buffs are still useful for most of my guild members, especially Focus, STA, and FA.  I will agree, though, that most everyone caps out STR/DEX/STA now even with PP5 once shaman buffs are applied.  I'm not sure I agree that Beastlords &quot;outbuff&quot; us simply because they use up more slots than ours do.  On many of our raids we are told to leave 3-5 slots free to absorb the AE effects and the MGB's of SotW, EE, etc...  <br />
<br />
I think I would like to see an upgrade to FA, possibly one that includes a Endurance regen component.  I think I'd even be willing to trade off some +ATK for +End regen.   With Shawl 8 and SCRM FA today lasts around 11 min which is good enough for me to keep on my whole group and the pets and still do other things.<br />
<br />
I also think that Shaman's should get this &quot;Pet buff&quot; AA automatically, or for a significant &quot;discount&quot; over the hybrids.  20 AA's is absolutely nuts by any standard.  I was thinking maybe it should be 9 like MGB.  <br />
<br />
2.  We are still adequate healers in many environments.  I don't know why, but I haven't seen too many people look at the benefit of using Quie + our other heals in combination when we are thrust into the role of primary healer.  In almost any tier 2 plane I can get away with Quie on pull, then debuff, Tnarg, slow, Quie again till the mob dies.  That's not a TON of mana and is certainly manageable if there is some kind of crowd control in the group.<br />
<br />
I would like to see them improve Kragg's in some way.  Maybe cut the duration down to 6 seconds or allow it to be affected by spell haste or maybe even our Quick buff AA's.   Something to make me want to cast it more than I do now, which is maybe 1-2 times per week.<br />
<br />
3.  I still think we should be the king of slow, no questions asked.  I think there may be an easy way to fix all this concern about who's the better slower:  Give us a disease based slow spell that matchs Tugurs exactly.  Most mobs in the game that are difficult to slow regularly can be slowed by Malicious Decay + Grummus.  The problem is, though, it's only 40% which puts it in line with our level 40'ish spells.  I would be happy to get the &quot;ultimate slow&quot; Tugurs based on disease.  I might even settle for a shorter duration or a longer cast to make up for the fact our disease debuff is so fast casting.  <br />
<br />
4.  We are not a pet class, we are a class with a pet.  Psycho (what I call my pet) has really been nothing more than DPS for me since I dinged 58 or so.  He can't stand up to anything (well except for his 10 second enrage), he doesn't hit for that much, his ATK/AC is really low, etc...  My guild doesn't even allow the Shaman to call our pets in most situations because they are not worth the risk and none of us have &quot;/pet hold&quot; anywhere high on our AA radar.<br />
<br />
If we're going to &quot;beef&quot; our pet up, let's get an improvement to Spirit Quickening.  Perhaps it could be kind of like the original Beastlord spells worked, just temporarily.  Cast it and our pet gains 5 levels, and some extra abilities like quadding, riposting, etc... but for only a short time (maybe 1-2 min base, upgradeable with SCRM line to maybe 5 minutes.)  That would make it possible for the shamans who solo to have a better pet, give the rest of us a reason to call him at all and give us another &quot;DPS booster&quot; but not really change our place in the &quot;pet class hierarcy&quot;.  I think this should be a spell instead of an AA (perhaps even with a long activate/refresh time) to make it cost something more than just mana - a &quot;permanent&quot; spell slot.<br />
<br />
5.  DoT's are nice, but rain's are better since mobs don't last that long.  For me LDoN has pretty much caused me to put away my disease line of DoT's.  Mob's simply don't last enough for all the damage to be done.  I will sometimes use Bane or BoS but in many groups they don't even reach full potential before the mob is dispatched especially after I debuff/slow it.  Sony has changed the rules on us in non-solo situations for us in the near-end game, so I'd like to see our &quot;fast DoT's&quot; or rain spells get some upgrades.  I can almost always get in our 2 top rain spells in before the mob dies AND already have the chance for crits (when I actually get them) without that new CRIT-DoT AA they are planning.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see an AA line that goes like this:  1) rain's do not affect you (i.e. you can cast it while they are in your face)  2) rain's will not hit mob's that are currently being mezzed (block it if a mezz affect spell is on the mob)  3) Rain's gain 1 more wave per cast or possibly a +% to Crit.  I think this would give us an appreciable dps boost in areas where our DoT's won't do appreciable damage.<br />
<br />
6.  We are an active mana regen class and changing us to a passive one would fundamentally change us.  Cann'ing is real big part of how I play.  I throw in Cann's here and there, CannV when appriopriate (sometimes when not like Before I'm healed up from a rezz), etc...  I think it's in the design of our class that we are not &quot;chain casters&quot; but we can can turn it on/off whenever the opportunity arises without losing a spell buff slot.<br />
<br />
I think I'd like to see us get a replacement for CannIV via an AA (but I'd settle for a spell).  Now that most of us PoP Shaman's have easily over 4K hps we can safely afford to &quot;take a bigger chunk&quot; of ourselves.  I think they should design a replacement for CannIV that takes this into consideration.  I would be happy if the overall mana/time ratio stayed the same, it simply worked like stacking 3-4 Cann's on top of each other.  Maybe they could work something where you couldn't CannIV while this was refreshing to prevent &quot;super regen.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd be happy to post this again to whatever the official &quot;Sony please read this!!&quot; thread after everyone tells me how these are all &quot;noob&quot; ideas and I'm obviously a eBay for suggesting these things.<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
<br />
I want our bear form (either spell or rabid) to look like the bears in PoStorms.  I'm SOOO tired of the droopy lip!</div></div><hr />

Actually.. If you were to compare our lvl 49 pet to other lvl 49 pets.. its actually not that much weaker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah,<br />
<br />
I agree.  I was thinking more about how our &quot;final&quot; (highest) pet stacks up to the &quot;final&quot; pets available to mages, necro's and beastlords.  Our pet is better than the druid one, but far from the other pet classes.<br />
<br />
I did have one thing I'd LOVE to add, but it would probably unbalance us:  Snare.   I hate having to root everything I'm tanking in the face because it gets low on hps.</div></div><hr />
