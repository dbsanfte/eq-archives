<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I know there is a thread in the archives somewhere, but you wouldn't believe how many hits &quot;dexterity&quot; gets, and &quot;dex&quot; is rejected for being too short. So...<br />
<br />
Aside from archery, where dexterity is significant, has anyone noted higher level threshholds for weapon procs? I am aware of the apparent effects of getting to 105 and 125, but what about the &gt;150 dex arena?<br />
<br />
My situation is that I seem to do a fair amount of soloing where aggro from procs isn't such an issue. I'm loving the black acrylia rapier for both damage output and the hp friendly proc. My dexterity it at 169 or 178, depending on whether I swap my Tolan's helm for a trusty Executioner's Hood. I get alot of procs, but I'm wondering if I'm in the 'excessive' range or just short of another plateau. I think I notice more procs at 178 vs. 169, but I may just be wanting to see that.<br />
<br />
My question then is, has anyone had experience in the 175-200+ range of dex regarding procs?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback, and as always, the profile is in the sig. And please, I know dps&gt;procs, I'm asking for curiousity as much as anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have personal experience here...<br />
<br />
Without my avatar proc from Prismatic Bow, I am at 191 dex with SoV. I often have to wait for multiple fights to get Avatar up, which is hundreds of shots. However, once avatar is up and I am at 290 dex, avatar procs MANY MANY times per fight.  Basically, once it's up, it never comes off until I stop fighting.<br />
<br />
I see a large difference between 190 and 290...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Utherwayn Leafwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dex values that ive tested with are 180 and 200/210<br />
<br />
At 210 I get a significant amount of procs about 8 per fight (Call of Fire and 2 proccing weapons dualwielded) at 160 its about 3 on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">with my current gear i'm running at 230dex unbuffed and cry of thunder (our 150dd spell proc) goes off a lot in fights, almost to the point of me having to stop attacking to let the tank get aggro back it hits that often. i've had lots of fights where having it proc 5 times in less than 2 mins is normal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
Depending on gear equipped, I range from 170-180 dex. If I'm interpreting the feedback right, it seems like there is benefit to continuing to increase dex as long as it isn't at the cost of AC/HP.<br />
<br />
I think I'll shoot for getting dex with everyday gear into the 180's -- a shammy buff would take me to &gt;210. A glowing black sword for archery would also put unbuffed dex &gt;200. Looks like I'm shopping for some polished tin.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
