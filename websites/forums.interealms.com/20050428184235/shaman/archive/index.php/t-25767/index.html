 <br />
I am curious from others WoW shamans how do you react when you can identify that the player attacking you is a Shadow Priest.<br />
<br />
For example do you use:<br />
<br />
Purge<br />
frost shock and more to defeat them?<br />
<br />
(I had a Tauren Shaman mess me up good when I attacked him.  They are really good shamans.)<br />
<br />
Shamans may not want to give away too many of their secrets on how they react (since this is a shaman board) but its worth a try asking, I figure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also grounding totem to soak the fear, purge on shields, shock on movement, if I see a priest casting and shocks have refreshed I use earthshock to disrupt casting for 2 secs.  When I can snare a priest and I'm in close, I warstomp and combo nova and shocks for burst DPS.  Bottom line, keep em close, keep the grounding totems up, keep hitting with earthshock.  I don't see too many priests these days, last couple I ate for lunch, most chars run from me or ignore me when we pass by.  Alliance only sems to wanna PvP when they outnumber or badly outgun me, or I'm engaged with mobs.</div></div><hr />

ain't that the tooth.<br />

Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">War stomp yeah that abilities is really anonying to battle.  I think he used stun bombs on me too or something.<br />
Plus Tauren have more hp than other shamans I think too.<br />
<br />
Millman, did you see that post where a rogue did like 900 damage then followed with a 1400 Crit, killing the guy.  Rogues are pretty amazing too.<br />
<br />
I picked a priest because I was told they are most powerful (If they are Shadow Priests).  But I am not so certain anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a situational event. He used cold blood + prep and a buggy seal fate, and then got lucky with a crit on a cloth class. Regardless, Mill won't be pulling that off soon due to his talent spec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">none of the priests I've killed lived long enough to let me know what their spec was :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First off, I play a Horde priest on a PvP server, so I've never fought a shaman.  Second, I'm Lvl 48 and nearly all shadow (except for 8 points in Discipline to get the 15 sec refresh on shield) and just got shadowform.<br />
<br />
I have only lost 2 PvP encounters with people within 4 levels - lost to a hunter 2 levels over me, but I had him down to where one more nuke would have killed him, and I lost to a 52 warrior whom I couldn't fear effectively. <br />
<br />
Other than that, I've probably had 15-18 kills.  I killed a 52 pally 1v1 while he was waiting for the boat at Ratchet.  No gank -- both at full health and full mana.  Actually kind of easy.<br />
<br />
Shadowpriests are tougher opponents than I think this thread is giving them credit for.  With shadowform on, and a vampiric embrace on the target, (and a few free action potions if it's a rogue) I think shadowpriests are tough tough cookies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they can be nasty, I would still have 1900 hps left, plus all my tricks though. I almost lost to a rogue for the first time the other night, he did just what you said, cept the evis was 1750, I was shocked, and was hurt, I first time I have ever taken such an opening. I ran. Brave Sir Robin :) I got him multiple times though that night, TM is a friggin amazing slaughterhouse. Always outnumbered, always outgunned, yet still we fight. At one point, no joke, I tapped a warlock that was alone, and got jumped by 4 level 60 rogues hehe, boom.<br />
<br />
Serepi, shadow priests are one of the best, if not the best solo pvp'r, you show great patience in the actual level up process.<br />
<br />
Pvp is fun as hell, numbers or not, just makes me a better player for the experience. I get jumped by rogues alot, I think they might see me easier, perhaps they have mod, I do not. Usually I just wait out the stun then kick their ass all over the place. I like waiting near a friend for a rogue to try and gank them, then unleash, satisfying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Priests are great on paper and are probably the toughest PvP class if played perfectly.  However in the &quot;real&quot; world they have a lot less room for error then say, a paladin, rogue, or shaman.  <br />
<br />
Once I unload my first volley of damage on a priest he's immediately on the defensive.  Grounding totem usually eats the fear, and sometimes several DoTs if the priest isn't paying attention (DoTs dont kill the grounding totem if they don't do initial damage).  I can purge their shield and interupt their healing.  Lastly, I always have restorative elixirs that get rid of ALL negative effects on my, including all their DoTs.</div></div><hr />
