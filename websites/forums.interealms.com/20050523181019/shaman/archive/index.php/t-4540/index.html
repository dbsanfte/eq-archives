A monk in our guild needed help in Lake of Ill Omen for final epic battle (AoW legs and no epic, wth is with that) so I'm speeding through Dreadlands on my selos's horse Fluffy.<br />

Oh, wicked.  A true newbie.  <br />
Someone that a) doesn't care what you're doing, it's your job to buff them, and b) is naive enough to not even recognize what he wants/needs.<br />

<br />
It may take like 2 days of casual playing now with the ease of levels 1-10 to get to 15.  In no way can a new player grasp what each spell does from each class, especially since there is no help at all for what each spell does from Sony.<br />
<br />
I can just say, I've been there, remembering that skin like wood made me tough and its called a &quot;buff&quot;.  So I'd ask for it from every character not realizing which class casted it.  I would have easily fell for something like this...well maybe not if ya told me it was 30min. And that was 2 years ago.<br />

He's likely just some kid who wants to have fun like everybody else. And he talks the way that just about everybody on the Internet does (except old farts like us, who I'd guess disproportionately play Shaman), so I don't see how you can fault him for that. There's someone I regularly group with who calls everyone &quot;man&quot; and &quot;bro&quot;; it doesn't mean he won't run halfway across Norrath to help you drag your corpse, or that he can't be trusted to master loot.<br />

It reminds me of when i was at my friends house (the one who got me addicted to EQ) , and his daughter pulled me to the computer, pointed to Skin like wood, and said 'IM A TREE!!'<br />
I almost died both times laughing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So Kylt took his frustrations out on a noob.  ok.<br />
So now that noob can grow up(probably fast considering PLs) cynical and powerful and be the head dick of a guild of uberdicks and **** you over sometime.  <br />
<br />
Or maybe it was all a harmless prank.  I've lost my moral compass at some point.  It is, after all, just a game.  <br />
<br />
Finally, wouldn't it be funny if Kylt's guildmate/friend had a little brother they were getting into EQ and this prosecutorr was him?  I had that happen to me once.  I was bored and stopped to buff a group of lvl 30ish noobs killing outside the new CT.  I spent some time chatting with their warrior and gave them all haste buffs a few times.  I get a tell 30 minutes later from a girl I've hunted with a lot tellin me thanks for helpin out her little brother.  <br />
Kinda was a warm fuzzy feeling.</div></div><hr />

Well, perhaps he wasn't a &quot;total newb&quot; in the sense that this was his first character, and he'd been playing for only 5 days, but he seemed to me about as green and trusting as they come. He's likely just some kid who wants to have fun like everybody else. And he talks the way that just about everybody on the Internet does (except old farts like us, who I'd guess disproportionately play Shaman), so I don't see how you can fault him for that. There's someone I regularly group with who calls everyone &quot;man&quot; and &quot;bro&quot;; it doesn't mean he won't run halfway across Norrath to help you drag your corpse, or that he can't be trusted to master loot.<br />
<br />
And I guess he just won me over with:<br />

 <br />
<br />
&quot;buffs plz k thx d00d&quot; is not the same as &quot;hey man, could I bother you for a hp buff and maybe a regen?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not saying he can't speak normally - I do the same thing. I use emotes, I say &quot;man, bro, wassup&quot;, etc. But I don't feel the need to say &quot;y0 d00d bUfFs pLz K ThX im a lvl 5 mnk and i wanna be pled by ur ubar shamn y0 PST&quot;<br />

I think what you did was wrong in a very big way.  Yes he was rude, but if he fell for your buff trick then he was obviously still a newbie.  It seems that everyone forgets what it's like to be a newbie.  Dude speak is annoying as hell.  However, almost everytime I go in a newbie zone that's what I get spammed with.  If you are a newbie, are young (so already used to that speak), and see this, you'd think it was the way things were done in EQ too.  When I'm passing through newbie zones, working on trade skills, or sitting in the bazaar, I see people ask a newbie question in ooc but you know who answers them 99% of the time?  D00ds.  Everyone else is too busy doing their own thing to stop and help someone out so these new players make friends with D00ds instead of the more mature playerbase.  After a few hours of this I figure the adults think the game sucks and quit, and the kids just start talking in D00dspeak.  I think that's part of the problem.  Maybe next time someone is rude, or just plain annoying you could take a little time to find out if they are as bad as the first impression.  Try telling them to quit talking like that, and that really only newbs use it.  You'd be surprised how many d00ds I've met and after spending a few mins talking to them, I find out a few mos. later that they are no longe speaking d00dspeak and have actually turned into a decent midlevel player.  Any way maybe I'm just being over sensitive today.  I just think maybe the older players could help perserve the game atmosphere they enjoy rather then just finding enjoyment in ruining other peoples fun.  Oh and about the pl thing, I find it hard to believe he was heading to OT to be pl'ed and didn't even know how to get there.  I'm thinking other people were having fun at his expense too.<br />
<br />
This is a prime example of class:<br />
<br />
At the point I'm pissing my pants. This has gone from &quot;hey this'll be kinda funny to try on this guy&quot; to &quot;hi i'm with retard and don't even know that I'm on the short bus.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I know you've all been tempted.  If not, run through Gfay and have a real conversation with someone in OOC.  Then sow a SINGLE PERSON in a semi-populated place.  THEY SWARM!

Not that it would be difficult to just ignore his behaviour or try to correct it by example. No, make him from a trusting newbie into a cynical *******. Everquest sure needs more of those!<br />

<br />
<br />
I saw this and thought you were approached by somebody into beastiality.<br />
<br />
As far as the notion that Kylt was too hard on a poor innocent newbie goes, about the only way I can justify it is to say that deep within us all is the implacable desire to do fatal harm to cute, innocent furry creatures. Even if we were once cute furry innocent creatures ourselves.<br />
<br />
I remember a Heavy Metal story years ago called Ranxerox. Ranxerox was this mostly cyborg goon who would just pretty much beat up and kill anything that annoyed him. Mostly it showed him getting into bloody fistfights, breaking people's bones, tearing off limbs, etc.<br />
<br />
There was scene where he's sitting at an outdoor cafe, waiting on his date, and this 5-year old girl is going around to each table selling flowers. She comes to his table, asks him if he wants to buy a flower, and the next panel shows him crushing her fingers. The rest of the patrons at the cafe then cheer him for doing it.<br />
<br />
I read an interview with the artist later. He's Italian, and he says that he put that scene in because every full blooded Italian man has always wanted to do that to a flower girl.<br />
<br />
So you see, Kylt saw this cute, furry fuzzy noob, thinking he could get something for nothing, talking the cool d00d speech so he can fit in, and Kylt saw himself, one day played. He remembers that idiot and decides this kid is due for some tough lovin'. At least the kid's fingers are still intact.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of people who don't have such a desire.<br />

<br />
But there are others who should be schooled. I was grouped with some level 60, epic-weilding D00dz that about had my brains leaking out of my ears. They were obviously teenagers and it got so I bailed on them even though I was getting fantastic exp in Velk's. The profanity, insults and D00dspEAk was too much. <br />
<br />
I settled on shaman because I love to help out people. I refuse beggars but actually enjoy giving buffs out. If someone is halfway courteous I accomodate them. I do refuse request to powerlevel people or demands for buffs. But courtesy begets courtesy.<br />
<br />
As for the roleplaying thing, I love roleplaying. All of my toons have a seperate personality. I've sometimes been ragged for it but most of the time people enjoy the change. /ooc'ing &quot;52nd level first class witch doctor and mangy dog looking to make your group stronger and the baddies weaker&quot; is more fun that 52 shaman LFG. It's the interaction that makes this fun. If you want to just kill things and get phat lewt then go play Diablo.<br />

A couple years ago I had a profanity problem in the guild I was running. Profanity you say? ***? (lol) One of my guildies was an 11 yr old little girl, the daughter of another guild member.  <br />
<br />
I met a wizard once. One of my friends had palyed with him before, so we let him join the group. For about 30 minutes he over nuked, ninja looted, pulled (he was of course not the puller), and spoke the infamous d00dspeak. As guild leader it fell to me boot him from the group, and being offended, I was going to tell him exactly why. I am so glad the friend who'd met him stopped me. I was about to unload on a 13 yr old Japaneese boy :-(<br />

Did you see a ****ing question mark in the title of my post?  <br />
<br />
At what point in my story did I invite you to stand on your moralistic soapbox and preach about how I should act in front of my keyboard in this game.  Let me rephrase for you bandwagon /grouphug feeling idiots :)  Your opinions are unwanted, were unsolicited, and to be honest are utteringly meaningless.  <br />
<br />
This is a game, and in this game it's ok to do bad things to people, because nobody actually gets hurt.  That orc you're fighting?  *Not real*.<br />
<br />
Just because you choose to play your game by a certain moral code doesn't mean that everyone should, nor does it mean that they are wrong in choosing a different playstyle.  For the record I also was not present holding a gun to poor Prosecutorr's head when he first chose Tallon Zek on the server selection screen.  <br />
<br />
If your game is to offer newbies guided tours of zones and sit around campfires with them in Surefall Glade singing ****ing kumbaya while teaching them all about the geography of Odus and the inner-workings of your special-secret-handshake-using-guild-for-Shamans-of-the-Morally-Superior-Intelligensia then that's fan-****ing-tastic for you.  But on my server if I see you in the aforementioned glade, and you're in range of me, don't expect to live.  That's my game, and while it may intrude on yours for the 30 minutes that it takes you to beg pathetically for a TLC from the nexus to NK and then run your sorry &quot;But I soloed Yeldema!&quot; ass back to Surefall Glade to get your corpse then well you shouldn't have picked a Zek server.  Ah, I see you didn't :)<br />
<br />
The game box clearly says RPG(Roleplaying Game), maybe you should be strapped into the shortbus &quot;We tard&quot;. <br />
<br />
Go back to Counter-strike jerk <br />
<br />
Hey if you want to roleplay, all the power to you, this is your game too.<br />
<br />
Let's use an analogy (pun).  I appreciate that certain people in the real world have homosexual tendicies, and I support them.  If, however, one of those people were to whip out their schlong and start carressing my leg with it, do you think I would be happy?<br />
<br />
Your mother must be proud<br />
There are enough Dicks in the world. Try being a man. <br />
<br />
Wicked :)  Special props to Snoww of Ethaniel Marr here for being a class-A moronic sort :)<br />
<br />
Pick up your keyboard and hit yourself in the face with it.  If you still believe that we're all shaman in real life and that our actions in the *imaginary* land of Norrath are reflective of our real lives, hit yourself again with your keyboard.<br />

2nd post was even funnier..lmao.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">This board needs some more characters!<br />
<br />
Kylt rocks!  I was on the fence after the first post (seen funnier &quot;I screwed the newb&quot; stories) but that second one?  Priceless.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Y'know, I love coming to these boards.  This one and Monkly-Business in particular.  However it bothers me that after someone shares an experience they had that did something unpleasant to another TOON, many other people respond with &quot;But you're a Shaman (or monk, whatever...) you should be nicer (or be more honorable).  Your job is to teach these new players, thus developing a stronger, richer player base.&quot;  What for?  Why is it our job to teach newbies?  Who taught us?  There is something called Trial By Fire:  Get in there, and try something.  If you **** it up, you'll know better for next time.  This new player will now (hopefully) think a bit before running up to someone and asking for &quot;buffs okz&quot;.  Personally, this isn't something that I would have done, but that's just me.  I'd've probably just told him &quot;Dude (notice I spelled the word out), I just died and am getting my stuff back together.  Gimme a few minutes and I'll buff you.&quot;  If he continued to pester me, I'd've ignored him.  And the Roleplaying argument is useless also.  I've had people come up to me and say, &quot;Greetings, mighty Valrik.  It would seem that I find myself in some trouble, and require your assistance.&quot;  (at this point, I'm intrigued...it's a damn sight better than seeing someone just run up and say 'sow plz'.)  I ask what he needs, and he tells me he needs PP so he can buy his spells.  That simple request totally puts me off from the whole encounter.  &quot;Go out and kill things.  Loot what you kill.  Sell what you loot.  How do you think I got my money?&quot;  Odd, no response after that.  Just because someone asks nicely doesn't mean they're entitled to whatever it is they want.<br />
<br />
As for d00d5P34|&lt;, anyone talking to me like that is absolute last thing on my priority list:  &quot;d00d, ur gone 2 buff me kkplzthx~&quot;  Yeah, let me go get the oil changed in my car, I'll buff you when I get back.  However, I don't consider things like 'Dude', 'bro', 'man', or any of the words we use in everyday language to be part of this problem.  I communicate that way in /g, in /gu, and in /t all the time.  And if I ever do use leetspeak, it's in a derogatory or obviously facetious manner.<br />
<br />
Besides, it happened on a Zek.  Trying to teach a Zekker manners is like putting perfume on a pig:  It wastes your time, and it annoys the pig.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Kylt you stink.  You are lucky you aren't on my server!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I agree with that they are entitled nothing Valrik, but it take only seconds to nicely tell him he is entitled to nothing and wont get it for various reasons. It certainly takes even less time to just ignore him. It takes the most time to go out of the way to harm him.<br />
<br />
Kylt, buddy. You dont seem to understand the meaning of message boards. Or communications between people at all. Here, take this Charisma buff, it will make you immune from melee damage. Now go outside, go into the next  bar and try to talk to people there in the same manner. The buff will shield you from melee harm, trust me.<br />

/em begins to cast a spell...</div></div><hr />

1) Counter-Strike is a good game...stop hitting up pubs if you hate it<br />
<br />
2) You dont like to argue w/ &quot;2 year olds&quot; eh? Your the one speaking in all cap's, yelling ****<br />
<br />
sure Kylt used some less then appropriate language(all edited out by the boards =\) but atleast he didnt type in all caps.<br />
<br />
Then you break out the homosexual remarks...yeah, thats real mature :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

/hijack on<br />
<br />
I have played in well over 500 scrims and matches (CPL, CAL-I, RGL-E if that means anything to you) and I can safely say that counterstrike is a piece of ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Pick up your keyboard and hit yourself in the face with it. If you still believe that we're all shaman in real life and that our actions in the *imaginary* land of Norrath are reflective of our real lives, hit yourself again with your keyboard. <br />
<br />
I assume this would be reflective of your real life persona? <br />
<br />
I'm sure that quote was dripping in sarcasm, but in reading your posts, you really can't expect too many of us to be supportive of your actions. You had fun, great. That's what the game is about. I'm sure you taught newb_001 a great lesson. What that lesson is is beyond me (perhaps you're right, maybe he's on a blue server now actually enjoying the game). <br />
<br />
Too many people have answered the question as to why you've received responses here, but it seems ironic to me you're upset that something negative happened to you here. Maybe you should try a 'blue' board instead...</div></div><hr />

Need to remember to buff Prosecutorr with SoS if I ever run across him though.</div></div><hr />
