Balance of the Nihil dropped off of Kril V'lak in the Sewers expedition tonight.  It dropped in a group that had no shamans and rotted, as it is indeed a no drop spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Had a shadowknight spell drop from the Kaysersomething boss stonemite - I would assume he can drop any spell. As we crashed and will probably have to redo the expedition I will edit this post if we get a different spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I killed him tonight and all he dropped was &quot;stonemite eye&quot; =\  I am thinking maybe these zones aren't properly itemized yet and that was just a placeholder item for real loot, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think this is good, idea, i have a feeling that spell drop will be very bugged. and you`ll need to feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jinheim, too bad none of you knew that the Expedition instances can accommodate your switching out of group members.  You coulda switched out someone for a shaman to go in and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so if the spells are going to be all drops, whats up with the spell vendors people are looking for on the maps?   Or will we be able to buy 1 of our 3(?) new spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spell vendors were there on Beta to make it easier for people to pick up the spells (for testing). Live servers don't/won't have that little luxury. ;)</div></div><hr />

I got a nodrop item and a spell - so looks like you get a random quest item and a chance for a spell so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a way to loot it across servers?  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, someone as weak as me was able to be main healer and slower in a group that worked our way to the 3rd zone last night (forgot the name) although it was tough and I was wishing we had a druid or cleric there to help. We were not efficiant but I didn't die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seemed no different than an LDoN hard to me, probably a bit easier since we had single pulls on nearly everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first expedition is easier than a hard LDoN.  The mobs have a higher max hit, but they don't seem to hit for it as often, and they are almost all fully slowable.  Also, it is very easy to get single pulls in the first expedition.<br />
<br />
Also, I went through this expedition again and we had a spell drop from a mininamed.<br />
<br />
Want to know what it was?  It was.<br />
