<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, considering the hijacking I got on a few posts (gotta love 'em) considering my druidish atire, I thought I'd get a bit of advice. <br />
But I'd like to add a bit of info on me. I have low AC/HP, but when I was still carrying my book and othmir hat, I had A TON of mana, especially with a chanter around for KEI. Really good at Root and Rot tactics, I soloed IG's very effectively, even while getting pounded on. With My own HOS and AC buffs I did just fine. <br />
On the contrary, in dungeon areas (for example last night in the shik'nar pit in FG), I got agro on those warriors and they dropped me to one bub in no time (before slow). <br />
<br />
So my question, I don't want to lose all my mana! I HATE being LOM, and when soloing there usually isn't a chanter around for any mind buffs. However, I NEED more AC. <br />
<br />
I'm very very close to finishing my Sheild of Bane Warding quest, would you toss that out for the SBS? <br />
<br />
What would you change about my gear and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bone braced Buckler.<br />
AC25<br />
+10 Str +10 Wis  +55 HP +55 mana<br />
<br />
No resists. But for the HP and mana it aint bad. And they seem to be pretty damn common.<br />
<br />
Also Go for the shaman earrings from chardok. The Scale of wolf one and the diease cure one are both pretty darn nice and you can get xp while going for them.<br />
<br />
Earring of Twisted leaves<br />
AC 2 <br />
+1 wis +35 hp + 35 mana<br />
Effect: Scale of Wolf<br />
<br />
Or a Black saphire earring (electrum I belive)<br />
<br />
AC 2 + 35 hp + 25 mana. <br />
<br />
An Obulus Death shroud is another awsome choice for shoulders 10% less mana on spells cast is a huge savings.<br />
<br />
When you have 300 more hitpoints you will in effect have 150 more mana. (Cannabalize often) Not to mention you will die less. <br />
<br />
It is a strange way of thinking, but shaman are a strange lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just took a quick look at your profile.  For starters, complete the SBW and keep the SBS for resistance gear.<br />
<br />
Ditch the howler, there are tons of items that give AC and Mana in the range slot, even the frozen orb (AC2 int/wis +3 +40 mana), or a goblin parying spear (ac4 wis 4 some other stat, +5 vs mg) are simple ones to toss in there, but there are better.<br />
<br />
Ditch the shoulder pads and get Chodkai Spaulders (the ones from chardok), more mana, more AC (marginly more ... ok so one point).  Do the prayer shawls, for gods sake do something.<br />
<br />
Ditch the boots.  Put em in a blank inventory spot for the clicky, but get some protection for your feet.  They're only 3 wisdom, you don't loose much by going AC in this slot.  Jaundiced bone boots are a decent improvement.<br />
<br />
Everyone and their grandmothers will tell you to lose the wis ring(s) for AC/HP rings.  Of course this goes against your philosophy, so expect to take a pounding.<br />
<br />
Most of all, screw wisdom.  If you want a mana pool, get a regen item and cannibalise your butt off.  Get regen items, health items, anythign you can convert to mana.  Even a shawl will mana regen for you (past the 5th), but pease don't just sit there and med.  Get a fungi, get anything that will allow you to regen health.  With solid regen, you'll never go OOM and its better than clarity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for all the advice guys. btw Tarthug, for some reason I was under the impression those boots had to be wearable for the effect, but I guess not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Gothlips, glad to see you asking these questions.  Hopefully some gear changes can make your life as a shaman a bit easier and more enjoyable.  :)<br />
<br />
It's no fun to get pummeled to death all the time.<br />
<br />
Okay question 1.<br />
<br />
Is your Defense Skill maxed??<br />
<br />
If it's not that is the first thing to work on, immediately!  Defense skill gives you free AC with no need to change gear out or loose any stats.   To get Defense raises you gotta tank blue stuff.  At your level things are gonna tear you up in this gear.  Your best bet may be to get a pet class friend (mage/bst/necro/ench) to summon a pet and allow it to beat on you in the arena.  Defense caps at 200.<br />
<br />
Okay, on to equipment suggestions.<br />
<br />
You get greater bearform next level so keep in mind it adds 10 wisdom.<br />
<br />
First and easiest is your rings.  Change one to a Shadel Bandit Ring.   Change the other to Velium Fire Wedding or Jaded Velium if you really wanna keep mana.  <br />
<br />
Next is your face item.  Good face items are Mask of War or Crystal Spider Eyes.  Both have good ac, wisdom, and hp/sta.  If you have any druid friends you can help them get elyasian armor in Umbral and possibly pickup an Elyasian Death Mask for yourself.<br />
<br />
Your Supple Scale Armband is next on my list.  Try and get into some crypt groups in Seb and get yourself a JBB (Jaundiced Bone Bracer).   The Winters Roar click effect is much more valuable than extended range 3.  :)<br />
<br />
Give that Lizard mantle to the Salvation army!  Some good shoulder items are Dragon Mantles from West Wastes, Death Watcher Shroud from Umbral, Obulus Death Shroud from Seb, even something like the Chardok SHM only shoulder item or meditative blanket from Traks Teeth would be good.<br />
<br />
Range item - Go camp gorganga in Maidens Eye.  If you can get into a group that does the camp around the tree you can have a shot at a Divine Inspiration.  15ac, 15wis/int.  Very nice range item.  While you are there you can get a Gorganga Idol in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Ditch the Rune Etched Helm.  Switch to Jaundiced Bone Helm if you are going to wear that.  The stats on RE are irrelevant to shaman and the Jaundiced Bone has more AC and uber cha buff click.<br />
<br />
Feet, put those sow booties in your inventory. You can still click them from there.   I would suggest Dragon Boots from WW as a good upgrade in that slot.  Worked, Heavy, any of the versions.  There is quite a bit of dragon armor for sale on our server.  You could also go with the old standby, JB boots.   Barbed dragonscale boots are also outstanding shaman boots.<br />
<br />
Arms, I recommend barbed ringmail sleeves or crystal chitin sleeves.  <br />
<br />
Hands, coldain skin gloves or barbed ringmail or crystal chitin.<br />
<br />
Cloak - looks like you do some stuff in Hate.  Cloak of Scales off Inny is real nice.   There is the cloak of truth quest also, if you like questing.  If you can get in a crypt group then you can get a shot at a heirophants cloak too.  ALso very nice, 75hps and mana and lots of stats.<br />
<br />
Belt Flayed Turmoil skin is okay.  There's better belts out there but it will do.<br />
<br />
Neck item is good.<br />
<br />
Pants are good.<br />
<br />
Earrings are good.<br />
<br />
When I got my Divine Inspiration I put my Howling Harpoon in main hand until I got my epic.<br />
<br />
Chest - a fungi tunic is the best chest item for a shaman until they get level 60 and the spell torpor.   If you ever get a chance to buy one or camp king for one, don't turn it down.  Fungi tunics are still running like 60-70k+ on Terris though so don't think most people could buy one.   In the meantime a Rune Etched BP works.  Consider a iksar ceremonial cp though until you can get a fungi.<br />
<br />
that's all I can think of for now.<br />
<br />
There's lots of nice shaman on Terris, send me a tell if you have any questions.  Also send Uggok tells, he likes tells, lots of tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get both! :D<br />
<br />
Don't throw out that old tired and used Wisdom suite! Why would you drop an idea that's been working for you for the last 50+ levels? You wanna root-rot outdoors... by all means go for it. Some people even enjoy that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
But like you said, when it comes to being INdoors you get mushed into a fine paste. Of course, I find when I'm fighting indoors there's less mobs to kill (thanks over crowding!) and I'm generally not stressing my &quot;pool&quot; as much. Seems like if I run out with 150wis then I would've run out with 200wis anyway. So the extra 50 is a very &quot;meh&quot; issue.<br />
<br />
You have bags though! Stick it in a bag! When you're going to go solo some giants just chuck on your wisdom suite. When you're indoors and don't have the same &quot;room to move&quot; like you do outdoors, put on the AC. Eventually you'll find a happy medium and won't feel that you _need_ all that mana. Don't just drop from 200wis to 130wis though. It's feels like a HUGE difference when in actuality you can work around it with a little practice. Jumping from one to the other will give you culture shock and you'll have no idea what you're doing and that generally isn't fun at all. Work it out slow so you stop panicking when your mana gets a little low and everything will be just peachy keen I'm sure.<br />
<br />
By god buy a regen BP though. The extra 3000hp an hour mightn't look like a lot in numbers but it sure as heck _feels_ like a lot in practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mana regen rate &gt; mana pool size.  You have to beat this into your head, and then the gear choices become easier.  Having KEI up is great, because it increaes your mana regen rate, not because it makes your pool larger.  We get Cannibalise, and using it every possible moment is part of what we do.  If you're FM or OOM, something is wrong.  Coincidentally, if you are not FM or OOM, you total mana pool size is completely meaningless.  That's why wis/mana take a back seat to ac/hp/resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Umm hello, the difference between 150 wis and 200wis is the ability to cast ONE lvl50 spell or two.  (500mana)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Gothlips - I dunno what guild you are in, but if your guild is doing any work on the Earring of Solistice quest try and get in on that too.  It's super nice earring and even has flowing thought 1.  :)</div></div><hr />

Bone braced Buckler.<br />
<br />
And they seem to be pretty damn common.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to buy one of these (/join auction, /1 wtb Bone Braced Buckler) for like 2 weeks now and not even one tell.<br />
<br />
Or did you mean common drop?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I suggest reading Henora's post above....then reading it again...then printing it out and following it :) Excellent post.<br />
<br />
Just a couple things to add to it.  I have no idea what your bankroll is like, but if you can afford it an Orb of the Infinite Void is a real nice secondary item (25-30k on most servers).  The only other thing to add is that from what I can tell, fungi tunic's seem to be higher on Terris-Thule (mine and Hen's server) than any other.  I've seen them as low as 35k on some servers, so you might not need to raise 70k+ depending on where you reside.  And personally I'd consider that your most important upgrade.</div></div><hr />
