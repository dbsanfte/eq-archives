<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">first off i'm not knocking these gloves stats : which are pretty pimp ac 40 dex 20 sta 12 wis 18 agil 20 hp 135 mana 140 svf 25 svp 25 Effect venom of the tainted.<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/PoP_planar_armor_stats.htm#elementalchain<br />
<br />
but i'm knocking the effect... first it sounded cool.. figured it'd be some poison dot extenstion or something like that so i go to lucy and look it up:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3082&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
nope it increases spell damage by 65%... but before you go getting happy it only affects one spell in the game 'shock of the tainted'.<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1427&amp;source=Test<br />
130mana 3.9 second cast 230 damage so it mods it up to 379 damage.<br />
<br />
Why in the world would a level 65 be casting this spell? I gotta be missing something cause this makes no sense to me.<br />

<br />
Has anyone seen stats for the other pieces?  I'm dying to know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You forget our pop spell Spear of Torment - also poison based. Hits for  670 max.<br />
<br />
It's nice and mana efficent - my nuke of choice on raids or grouping. Soloing, I'm all dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm...so thats 380 damage [230dd+65% (149.5dd)=380dd (rounded up)]  for 130 mana. <br />
<br />
Silliness....<br />
<br />
Im guessing the same developer that designed this is in charge of slow mitigation...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">675+65%(438.75) = 1114 (rounded up) for 275 mana if you use spear of torment. Then add in all the nifty spell casting fury aa's, and it actually makes spear of torment a decent nuke.<br />
<br />
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work with spear of torment - shock of the tainted is our first poison based dd spell. It makes sense it would work with the rest of our poison based dd line as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hoeju</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It only works on the one spell.  Shouldn't work on Tormet.  Lame effect indeed.</div></div><hr />

This effect is as ghey as it gets. I am NOT going to mem some dumb ass low level spell that is no where near as effective as Velium Strike. 925 DD for 300 mana is still better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And your point is? <br />
<br />
Wear them for the stats if you don't have something better.<br />
<br />
The focus effect isn't usefull for everyone, sure, but nobody said it was going to be. Am I going to wear mine all the time? No, probably not, but I already have gloves out of VT that are significantly better. Would I wear these if I had previously been wearing coldain skin gauntlets or the like? Absolutely, regardless of the focus effect.<br />
<br />
Do I appreciate the focus effect? At first I had somewhat the same attitude as you, then I realize that these actually might be damn usefull in some situations. Take the following example:<br />
<br />
Manaetic Behemoth spawns with Gas Leak as his AE (this is the one that also has a push component causing interrupts). Poison happens to land quite nicely on our UberFriend00. Shock of the tainted is a 3.9s cast, add in spell haste and its ~3s on average and does .. ~380hp damage per cast w/ those gloves (assuming a static 65%) for a mere 130 mana (minus any saveings).<br />
<br />
This means, that for all intents and purposes I can chain cast this fast DD nearly infintely if I've got good buffs and a horse.<br />
<br />
Velium strike is ~8s cast before haste, even with haste its ~6s, pretty much garunteed to be interrupted every time.<br />
<br />
Some damage &gt; no damage<br />
<br />
some enhanced damage &gt; some damage &gt; no damage<br />
<br />
Would I prefer it affected 'ALL' or 'Most' or 'Some other' poison DDs? Absolutely. Am I calling it trash just because its rather situational in its use? Not at all. I don't wear my fungi all the time, so its situational, I wouldn't go about calling my fungi trash either.<br />
<br />
perspective is everything, one sided viewpoints are meaningless.<br />
<br />
ed note: corrected some horrible spelling errors and general grammatic foulups.</div></div><hr />

My point is this, risk vs reward and this does not add up. As far as stats go, its not bad at all but I feel the effort made to get this far deserves a much more thought out effect. I have not seen the legs but it better not be some gay pet spell like ornate legs. Warrior elemental gloves have +3 tic regen and +30 atk buff. These gloves are rediculous in current form.<br />

Oh... so what you want is to compare Shaman -ELEMENTAL- gloves against other class -ELEMENTAL- gloves. Why didn't you say so, your post is talking about tier1 gloves, and venom of the tainted is the focus effect on those.<br />
<br />
Know how I know? Because I have a pair in a bag.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Go back to VT and get the ring of Immoblization so you arent standing with the mob &quot;in teh face&quot;! and you wont get those interrupts<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While the idea of rooting the Manaetic Behemoth, or me tanking it for that matter, is quite amusing (hey! I did actually tank it once, for 3 rounds, before the 2kk DD put me through the floor). Perhaps you are confusing this beast for something a little less destructive. like, say, Aten Ha Ra? Now there's a boss I can tank for a while, but Behemoth defintely doesn't fall into the 'torpor tank' category.<br />
  <br />
<br />
Hrmmm that is actually really nice effect. If the spell info for the shm gloves is wrong and say we also get the same DD% bonus then yes I would like them. <br />
<br />
Well, when I see someone with the -ELEMENTAL- gloves, or make a pair myself, I'll be sure to let ya know... but until then, I leave you with the following:<br />
<br />
From lucy:<br />
<br />
Spell: Venom of the Black, 1: Increase Spell Damage by 100%, 2: Limit: Spell(Shock of the Tainted<br />
             allowed), Mana: 0, Classes: None, Casting: 0, Recast: 0, Target: Self, Beneficial, Duration: 3.0 mins @L1<br />
             to 3 hour(s) 15.0 mins @L65, Range: 100, Source: Live - 12/19, URL: http://lucy.fnord.net/s/AA5G<br />
<br />
Now if you dig around a little, you'll be REALLY ticked (if you continue upon your current course) to discover there's a whole lot of weirdness when it comes to the various class focus effects. I'm not even going to try and figure it out right now because I'm still tired as hell and probably missing something obvious.<br />
<br />
Point being, compare oranges with oranges, not oranges with lime jello.</div></div><hr />

Umm he did.  All along the argument has been that the shaman ELEMENTAL chain gloves had a ****ty effect, and then the mage ELEMENTAL gloves were given as an example of an effect that doesn't suck. <br />

I did, the link is 'wrong'<br />
<br />
from EQTraders even:<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman: I suspect that the gloves of this set are either misnamed in-game, or were mis-reported with the wrong name ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the gloves are the result of the ornate chain pattern, not elemental. I have a pair in a bag, I'll be happy to link them to you some time if you'd like.<br />

The arguement is fundementally false because you're using incorrect data as its basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea, the link is wrong Atarak. I checked Lucy's and the current listing for elemental chain gloves are old, it does not include the effect.

On the bright side, those are some nice stats, here's hopeing we knock off Rallos tonight so I can go die in new and interesting places. I've been incredibly slack about getting something to replace my old Skyshrine legs because most stuff just wasn't much of an upgrade. <br />
<br />
One thing<br />
<br />
PLEASE tell me the elemental armor isn't the same godawful untinted chain texture? I finally sucked up the ugly on the BP<br />
(see http://users.rcn.com/piraeus/mift.jpg) but the whole 'glow in the dark lizard' thing really is pretty horrible.</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid Mift is quite right, he's wearing the legs and gloves now too, I should update the picture for full effect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">heh, my bad for the ruckus, indeed i got my info initial from eqtraders as i was browing for stats on elemental armor so i know what to upgrade for myself... evidently this isn't the best place to get accurate information, the same focus effect is listed for both ornate and elemental, so i plugged that info into lucy in the original post.  I am glad i posted though, it has relieved me greatly to see the focus effect isn't as lame as i thought hence my original post of I must be missing something :) . As rare as elemental armor drops are, they are loot decisions i dont want to screw up.<br />
<br />
Thanks all,<br />
Wrothgar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ah, its an innocent mistake Wrothgar, no biggy.<br />
We got 2 chain sleeves mods last night both going to shaman. Damn those are sweet arms! I definatly like being in the chain class!<br />
<br />
I LOVE the elemental planes so far. Its hard in places but the challenge is definatly part of the fun. The interesting bit of info is that boss mobs drop specific molds. IE boss mob in say water will drop arms and a boss in earth will drop say gloves ( Just random examples not based on real facts) We only messed around a bit in Earth and Air but we killed a few bosses in water. Some really really nice stuff drops off mobs that can be done with as few as 10 good players. A lot of yard trash mobs hit for 1k though :(<br />
 <br />
If shm elemental gloves are anything like other classes the elemental will have a very different effect than orante.</div></div><hr />
