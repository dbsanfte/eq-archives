<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really need new equipment, most of mine sucks. I am level 40, and I want to get better Wisdom.  I started getting some AC items, but decided it doesn't help me very much at all when I'm in a group, so now I want to get new wisdom stuff, but don't know what I should get.  If you know any items that I could get to make my Wis 180+ for about 5-7k, would you please post on here what is it, where it drops or the average price on it. <br />
<br />
Here is my current Equipment.  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=228300 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Except for the collar I'd say you're doing great. If you're looking for low cost go with the Black Alloy medallion (Runnyeye). If you're looking for something a bit more on the pricey side go with and ivory imbued collar (drops in Chardok).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know on Brell.. Ivory Imbued Collars go for like 1k nowadays.. and have pretty decent wis and resists on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont be sad, at 40 I was wearing mostly Totemic/Banded with a BS tunic and a Screaming Mace.  My Wis was prolly 135 or so.  If I wuda had 5-7K in the bank back then I cud have bought a nice mansion in the swamp and a horde of troll hookers ta satisfy my every whim :p<br />
<br />
Don't worry so much about equip and focus more on playstyle.  &quot;Crappy&quot; gear can teach you things that Ubah Lewt will keep you from learning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gear looks pretty good to me.  Find something to go in your ranged slot with 5 Wis on it or so.  Easy to find stuff for 600pp or so.<br />
<br />
Trade out your Totemic Bracers  for Rune Ecthed Mithril Bracers ( AC4 +5 Wis) - about 400 each.<br />
<br />
thats 15 Wis for about 1.5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Neck: Black Alloy/Imbued Ivory as suggested<br />
Helm: do the totemic quest if you want the wis, 5 Wis for some time and the dufrenite<br />
Wrist: RMBs as suggested<br />
Arms: Ulthork 100pp or less<br />
Hands:  Coldain Skin or Grey Flesh, will run you 2-4K depending on server<br />
Shoulders: Elder Wolf Hide<br />
Chest: BS tunic/Firekeepers Tunic/Froglok Scale 100-2K<br />
Waist: Crystalline Belt-camp it in CC<br />
Boots: Get some friends, do your epic up to Black Dire for his boots<br />
Range: Slime Coated Harpoon-500pp<br />
<br />
This is going to cost you a fair amount of AC,  I would recommend you stop before you drop below 700 self-buffed,  as the 100 marks seem to make a lot of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you all for your comments about my equipment.  I will try to get some of the items that you posted about.    Btw, if any o you have some of these pieces on Morell Thule for sell, I would be happy to purchase them from you.<br />

thank you again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you have more wis than I do WITH my epic :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bleh, wisdom!  Use cannibalize to your advantage, maximize your regen and then you have more mana than any wis can give you.<br />
<br />
for 5-7k you could buy an probably buy a ceremonial iksar chestplate and maybe a sarnak battleshield.  Testament of Vaneer = bad.  Do your epic quest shield (you can do that part solo at your level) if you dont want to spend money on a shield.  Rid yourself of the druid book as soon as possible friend.  :)<br />
<br />
You might also consider saving the money you have and earning some more in the 5 levels you have until you can buy and use the Jaundiced Bone Bracer.  It has a mana free 263dmg spell that is very powerful for a level 45 shaman to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a couple of suggestions...Charred Guardian Shield in Sol a +9 Wis, Slime Coated Harpoon for range +5, Gator Scale Leggings +4 and Chipped Bone Bracelets +5<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tege</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">othmir fur cap is +6 wis - ~450pp<br />

either of the acrylia chests one is +8 other is +6 I -think- - both are in the ~3k range iirc<br />
chrysoberyl talisman +3wis - ??<br />
charred guardian shield +9wis - ~350pp<br />
elder wolf hide(shoulders) +4wis - ~1.5k<br />
<br />
All prices are on the low end of the price spectrum, sorry those are the only prices I know. If you really want to go big wis sift through those and weigh the best bang for your buck and what they'd be replacing, I'd personally leave the JB peices alone myself. Would be a good idea to check out the items' other stats before you go spending money and take my prices with a grain of salt, pc them personally before you start auctioning for any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Hanora<br />
<br />
Da best thing he can get is da Iksar Cestplate.<br />
<br />
He already have too much wisdom.<br />
<br />
Mez wood get some ac in da ranged slot and replace da book with anthing or nothing at all.   Mez never get caught dead with a book in da hand not even for working a trade skills.<br />
<br />
Then I would get rid of both da wis rings and replace wid vel fire rings 6 ac 65 hp.<br />
<br />
That would be a guud start.<br />
<br />
It will not be long before da monsters start to hit a lot harder.  It will be da shamans job to be higher on da hate list den the enchanter and resisted slows gain joo a lot of agro also.  If joo not getting hit den joo not doing joo job right.  If your groups enchanter is getting hit then joo are not doing da job right.  If a cleric has to heal joo all the time then you are not doing the job right.  If a druid is healing joo then just /quite and delete joo shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Primary:  Howling Harpoon<br />
Offhand:  Sarnak Battleshield or Charred Guardian Shield<br />
Bracers:  RMB's<br />
Neck:  Spider Fur or Imbued Ivory <br />
Rings:  Trade one or both out for 6/65 ring(s).<br />
Gloves:  Jaundiced is fine but coldain skin is nice (2k though)<br />
Arms:  Jaundiced<br />
Waist:  Spider fur (10ac, lots of HP) or Flayed Turmoilskin (9ac? 5wis?)<br />
BP:  Ry'gorr is decent, Froglok Scale (24ac 5wis) would be good.<br />
<br />
In all honesty though, I would leave your gear (its not bad at all) as it is and save all my money to have a JBB when I hit 45.  With JBB you will FLY to 54, at which point all the above upgrades become fairly trivial.<br />
<br />
JUST GET RID OF THE DAMN BOOK YOU'RE NOT A DRUID AND IF I PLAYED ON YOUR SERVER I WOULD /BONK YOU REPEATEDLY FOR IT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hehe...just wanted to point this out: He's not asking for general equipment advice, or 'what is good gear for a lvl 40 shaman?', or even <br />
'Hey tell me for the bazillionth time that HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS'.<br />
<br />
He specifically asked for more wisdom, and even mentioned that he tried the AC route and it didn't work for him.  So recommending gear like AC 6 / 65 HP rings isn't very productive, or answering his question.  There are hundreds of threads about what gear to get for the 'battle shaman' (or whatever the current buzzword is), but this is the first one that has asked for Wis.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think its interesting to try and come up with gear selections that I would never use, because my play style is different.  Expands the mind a bit. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is possible to keep your wisdom high and still get decent AC and Hp gear. I havent cracked 1000 AC yet, but I will as soon as I finish my Skyshrine armor, and my wisdom will be close to 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It is possible to keep your wisdom high and still get decent AC and Hp gear. <br />
<br />
/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">While I prefer the HP/AC over Wis route a couple things pop out.<br />
<br />
1) off-hand - Get to work on your epic.  While the shield of Falsehood is a drop of 5 in wis from the ToV, it is AC, so you are getting a semi-balance.<br />
2) boots - get a bunch of your good friends together, and head to Mistmoore (after you have completed the quest to the shield) and do the black dire.  Those boots will give you wisdom, and change your solo life.<br />
3) Helm - For once, this is where I do go Wis over AC... get yourself a totemic helm.  +5 wis, -4 on the ac (the tradeoff for the shield).  There are better, but assuming you are probably on a budget.<br />
4) Legs - the bane of all Shaman... best advice, go camp zone line to KC, buffing for free, etc, and asking for looting rights to Jarsath Scale... better ac and wis than gatorscale, and usually left to rot.<br />
5) Belt - Crystaline Belt... AC 5, wis +3... not great, but cheap. 500pp max in EC<br />
<br />
There are a few other options to work on... here is the link to my magelo profile... nothing that anyone would call uber, or even great, but more than enough to let me solo most successfully at 53.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62502<br />
<br />
As you can see, not too bad a balance of AC and Wis.  I do still have my ToV, and another CBB, in the bank, as well as a couple of other higher wis, lower ac items banked, for tradeskill purposes, but I think the general concensus that AC/HP -&gt; Wis, especially in the high end (and once you get Turgurs, and get summoned the first time, you will understand) is absolutely the truth.</div></div><hr />
