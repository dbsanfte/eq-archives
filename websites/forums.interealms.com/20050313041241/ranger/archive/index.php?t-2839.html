<br />
I have several people in my guild bugging me to go on PoG raids now and help them out.  ASIDE from all the arguments not to go from a roleplay standpoint,  I know that within about 3 kills I would be KoS to Kelethin rangers, but could still bank in Kelethin.<br />
<br />
What other potential faction implications am I facing?  Any future quests that I would be messing with?<br />
<br />
I'm not really wanting to go, but feeling a bit of obligation to those that have spent a significant amount of time helping me.<br />
<br />
Strugglin' with the Dark Side  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

That's a good enough reason that you just gave yourself.<br />
<br />
At ANY time, Verant could implement a new and powerful quest that requires you to have good PoG faction, Kelethin faction, etc.<br />
<br />
It would be extremely foolish for any Ranger to trash their faction. I would even bet money that within a year you will hear plenty of whining on this board from some Rangers saying &quot;Boo hoo Verant made a PoG quest and I ruined my faction by killing in PoG, G.D. Verant you jerks, etc. etc.&quot; However, it's really their own fault. Even if you don't roleplay, EverQuest is based on the basic foundations of RPG's, and this means acting within your character. Rangers do not murder residents of their own God/Goddess' Plane, and not even Karana would permit it - Tunare and Karana are allied and cooperative.<br />
<br />
Listen up well, because Planes of Power is coming out soon and you better believe there will be hundreds if not thousands of new quests, some of which may very well require you to go to the other lands and require good faction in some of the places, and since we're dealing with Planes there's a very good chance it could require Plane of Growth.</div></div><hr />

I hate that tramp, simply because she doesn't recognize my deeds as a Karana worshipping ranger.  But I doubt I could raise a sword against her or her minions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ability to run around a zone unmolested, track large ranges with filters, CR dead pullers, etc is a huge boon to a POG raid, and you can do that without taking any hits.</div></div><hr />

Follow Ladas' advice, I'm betting he's doing the same.</div></div><hr />
