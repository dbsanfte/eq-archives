<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard that eventually they were going to update the Bear Form Model, much like they did with Druid/Ranger Wolf Form Model when Luclin came out. I'm thinking they should use the Bear model from those Bears in Plane of Storms.<br />
<br />

<br />
When I was in a group in Plane of Storms and I was in Form of the Great Bear (Polar Bear) my group mentioned several times that I looked so lame compared to those Storm Gruezoks we were killing. Those bears even get on their back hind legs and stand up. They look very cool and have some cool animation features too.<br />
I'm wondering if anybody heard if Verant is still planning on updating the bear form models, or if anybody knows if they plan on doing it soon, maybe in this next expansion?<br />

Ahh I didn't realize topic was already brought up before. I just recently was flagged for PoS and saw the cool bears there.</div></div><hr />

Just make a sitting animation, for the love of...agnostics.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you how many times I've zoned out in my brain...tried to run off somewhere and freak out &quot;OMG! I can't move!!&quot; /spaz<br />
&quot;oh...I was sitting&quot;<br />

*pout*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Please, no sitting animation, ever!<br />
<br />
The lack of sickening upwards/downwards motions is the main reason I still use Bearform most of the time!<br />
<br />
<br />
Try making a hotkey on the hotkey bar and you will SEE if you are sitting or standing...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL, I noticed that when I was fishing in PoK, I had my &quot;Form of the Bear&quot; up and every time I casted I &quot;GRRRrrrrrr&quot;, then everyone around me started saying I was hungry, :)<br />

Now, back to my coffee<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">An update would be nice, but it's like the necro's asking for warbone or sarnak skeles to be used for their pets.  basically, these forms have to be added to the global file (so that it's readily accessible, as compared to the models that only load when you are in a zone with a mob with that look).  That's why you recently saw the addition of illusion:froglok because they were planning to add froglok as a playable race.  SoE has been slow or resistant to do this for players in the past, and the trend will probably continue.  After all, the bigger the global file, the more resources it uses on the average computer.  (Darn you pentium 2 users! ):D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I prefer no sitting animation also.  Hotkey to tell whether I am sitting or standing works well enough for me.  I like being able to hide the fact that I am sitting :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure you just LOOK like....<br />
<br />
Great idea on the fishing bit. I fish when I'm bored, fishing 184 now.... I should use bearform. It already freaks the bridge jumpers out when they swim to the shore in pov and I'm there, invis, just fishing......</div></div><hr />

And no freaking sitting graphic plz that is the worst thing in the world ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">try wolfform....you'll understand by a sitting animation is bad! :-)<br />
<br />
on a four legged creature, the head goes UP when you sit.  It's very disconerting after having the head go down for many levels!</div></div><hr />

But we have ben asking for this since SoV came out.   Would be nice if we got it but I wouldn't expect it.</div></div><hr />

Agree, nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm....having no sit animation is the reason that I DONT use bearform.  I like the extra wis and regen, but I can't stand not being able to tell the difference between sitting and standing.  <br />
<br />
I have a sit hotkey that I use for my canni dance...but I never think to look down there when I actually have to sit for something (mainly swapping spells, but still)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Imo the only time I sit is to change a spell, so its really not that inportant to me, and the only time I use it is when I know I am not going to have to help with the bashes/interrupts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would love a lvl 65 bear form with upgraded graphics bought from vendors with the same med effects as a horse but would let me be in bear form instead of on a horse.  Sell my horse and buy a bear form item or spell.<br />

To many casters on horses now with PoP mostly outdoors.  Need a few bears, wolves, and other shapes to come back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still a 60 plus new bear form with slightly better stats would be a nice bone to shaman.<br />
<br />
Btw. why have bear forms no slam? It's a racial advantage of big races and just kicked out of the window, because some people are too lazy to program it .... (Can we have a rant section please? :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the PoS Bears look much much better than Kodiaks in Great Divide. Just MO. <br />
<br />
The PoS Bears can stand up on 2 legs as well, which I was very very impressed when I saw them do that.<br />
<br />
Anybody have a screenshot of the PoS bears on their hind legs?<br />
<br />
I may be mistaken, but I think the PoS bears stand up on their hind legs when casting spells. That assumption sound right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If they redo the models they MUST keep the lip!!  That is pretty much the only thing that keeps me using bearform. :p</div></div><hr />
