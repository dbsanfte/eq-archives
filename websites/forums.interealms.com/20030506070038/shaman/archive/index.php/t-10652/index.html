<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started a Vah Shir shaman when Luclin was released.  I played him to level 19 as more or less a warrior.  I’ve wanted to play him again recently, but to be honest I just don’t know how.  I’m used to playing a druid and a ranger.  When I try to play my shaman, or my young necromancer alt for that mater, the spells and strategies are different enough that I feel rather lost.  I’ve done a good deal of reading on this board and others, but I was hoping that some kind souls might take pity on me and map out some basic strategies for both soloing and grouping.<br />
<br />
For soloing, do I root the mob, toss a bunch of DOTs on it and med till root breaks?  And if so, is it difficult to keep the mob rooted without getting gnawed half to death between castings?  I’m spoiled as both my mains have snare. <br />
<br />
I assume that what I do in a group depends on what other classes make it up, but are there some basics I can scribble down until I get used to being a shaman?  <br />
<br />
I’ve tweaked my kitty ever so slightly.  I would love to give him a fungi tunic, but my mains don’t even have that level of equipment.  So my shaman has mostly decent equipment, but nothing exceptional.  And I expect to do a lot of soloing, though I also want to group in order to learn how to handle myself in those situations as well.  Any advice you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basic shaman fighting style mostly consist of slowing the mob so it does a lot less damage adding a dot to it and fighting it face to face (IN TEH FACE).  Once you have a pet you still fight the exact same way.  You posistion the pet so it is biting at the heals of the mob.<br />
<br />
It really is neccessary to fight like this through your 40s till your deffense is maxxed.  And this method is very valid on almost any pre pop mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As Oogrunk stated, you'll need to debuff the mob, i.e., slow the mob and then melee the mob while dotting it and/or nuking it to death. Some mobs may require you to root/rot them. By the way, always have root memmed. It's very necessary at times if you need to step back and heal yourself. As recommended, keep your defense maxxed for each level, if possible. In the lower levels, you have to use all your tools to solo mobs. You have to melee some, dot or nuke some.. if you have the pet, you need to use him too. Sometimes, you and the pet will have to take turns tanking, especially if the mob is really dealing out some damage. The best way to learn, though, is get out and try for yourself. Find out which style of combat suits your personality best.. while maintaining your defense skill.. ;) In groups, you'll be slower, healer, buffer and crowd controller at times. Life as a shaman can be hectic, but rarely boring. Good Luck!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 19 the root-dot method is not ideal because your dots aren't very good yet, root will break a lot and your slow isn't great so that when root does break the mob is going to pound on you pretty fast still. If you are a non-twink I suggest grouping  as much as possible till 24. If you are heavily twinked you can probably tank the mob quite well.<br />
<br />
At 24 life changes a lot with regen, canni1 and envenomed breath. By stacking tainted and envenomed breath mobs will die fairly fast and the best part is that with canni and regen you can regain a lot of your mana while the mob is rooted.<br />
<br />
As you progress in levels and get your pet and your slow gets even more effective and your dots start doing some nasty damage the whole process just gets easier and easier. At that point you pull a mob with slow, sick pet on it, throw on a dot and root mob and do your cannidancing to regain mana. You'll want to join with pet and melee to keep offensive and defensive skills up. When you do this make sure to be on the opposite side of the mob as pet since mob's can't dodge, block or riposte from behind. That makes ol' Vebarn even more effective. If you can't get aggro just root the mob and step in its face so it aggroes you and puppy can hit it from the back.<br />
<br />
At 19 I couldn't solo worth a crap with my newb equipment so I mostly grouped. At 24 I could solo a lot better but it was still pretty slow going. At 49 we really start to shine and at 51 we get the best slow in the game and soloing becomes a breeze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks so much for your advice.  I took Pait out last night to become more familiar with his spells.  I think I’m going to have to reorganize my spell book to keep everything strait.  Thankfully I had a cheat sheet I’d put together from spell lists on the net. *grins*  Anyway, I had a fairly good evening of soloing. I hunted in North and East Karana, killing bug, griffawn, gorge hounds and dark stalkers.  Aside from a few adds, the only problem I had was discovering the hard way not to cast Frenzy in the middle of a battle.  My spell bar stayed dark for so long I was afraid something had gone wrong with the game. By the time I headed off to bed I’d gained two yellow bubbles.<br />
<br />
The real secret of leveling these days is donating for KEI.  I do this with my druid to cut back on down time.  But I hadn’t considered how much more of a difference it would make for a lower level spell caster.  I was able to root, slow, DOT twice and blast with Spirit Strike several times and still be at nearly full manna by the time I found another mob to fight.  In a way I guess this is a form of cheating, as there’s no way I should have access to that much manna at that level.  However, I’m looking at it as more of a convenience.  It’s rather like using the port stones in PoK to get around instead of running or taking the ships as the game originally intended.  The danger, of course, lies in becoming spoiled.  But if KEI can help me get to level 34 quicker, I’m willing to risk it. <br />
<br />
I do have another question. As a ranger I keep all my weapons skills maxed.  As a druid I gave up on that a long time ago.  What should I do as a shaman?  My piercing skill is about 80 right now.  I have a Staff of Living Sand I can use for 2H blunt. It’s the same weapon my druid uses, but I'm sure he'd be willing to share.  It’s a bit slow at 42, but it does decent damage (24) and it has a nice proc (25DD 144hpDOT over 12ticks).  It also starts procing at level 22. It’s not nearly as fast as an abandoned orc shovel, but I could actually kill something with the staff.  I don’t have a 1H blunt weapon, but if nothing else I could buy a centi warhammer. Again it’s rather slow for gaining skill (Dmg 15, Dly 32. +5 Str +5 Sta +2 Wis +6.00 Wt), but they are really cheap on my server.  Or at least they were last time I looked them up in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In my book, spears have the best stats and melee ratio.  Thus, when I got a Slime Coated Harpoon, I never looked back.<br />
<br />
Coupled with the fact that the Epic is a Spear too, if you have time you can practice 1hb and 2hb.  But if you have to choose one, I'd say piercing is the way to go.</div></div><hr />
