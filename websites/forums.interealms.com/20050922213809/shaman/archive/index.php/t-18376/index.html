<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Worlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings Shamans,<br />
<br />
I recently dinged 61, and am still missing a few spells, Primal Avatar/Avatar, Torpor, and various pre-60 spells.  I'm trying to find places that I can solo for either some good cash, or some easy drops which I can sell.  All the places that drop the spells I need I've read that Torpor is a must in them, but I don't have it yet.  I have malo, and all but 1 61 spell, Replenishment, if that helps.<br />
<br />
Basically I just want a place to farm at 61, without Torpor, so that I can make enough money to buy Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since magelo seems to be down, I can't examine your gear/AAs to see what you can or can't solo. I would say, if you've got about 2200 hp or more self buffed, and canni iv, then you could solo the emperor in sebilis(who drops lvl 60 spells) Getting down there would be the trick, if you look at my post in this same forum(60-61 solo challenges) you can see how I get down there solo. Emperor is on a 28 minute spawn, iirc, as are all the mobs in the area. All you typically have to clear is the 2 mobs outside the BoC room, the BoC(or PH), and the emperor. You can spread them out to make soloing them easy, and have time to afk and grab a bite or read a couple pages of a book in between. Torpor is nice for emperor, but won't be necessary. If you have stoic, the better for you. Kragg's mending will be your friend here without those 2 spells.<br />
<br />
You could also try skyfire(boring and SUX exp) for your 56+ spells. Named mobs drop 56-58 spells(rarely) and guardian wurms drop lvl 59/60 spells(but bring along a tank class, as you will probably die without torpor.)<br />
Another good source of 56-58 spells would be juggs in sebillis. They commonly drop those spells, but I would bring along a couple people at 61 to help you.. possibly even a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Get Torpor ASAP if you don't intend to fast grind (grouped) to 65 in the next week or two.  You are extremely limited without it.  Beg or borrow cash from the guild vault or rich friends if you need too.<br />
<br />
I would recommend Valor until you get to 62, and then live in BoT until 65 if you are going for fast grinding if borrowing isn't an option for you.  Then just buy Quiescence (multiple copies for sale in the bazaar recently).  Antithesis is more than capable of taking out mobs that drop Torpor btw, so ask your guild to help you.<br />
Basically I just want a place to farm at 61, without Torpor, so that I can make enough money to buy Torpor. <br />
As silly as it sounds, farm spiderlings, spiders, and lions, cats, and bears for silks and pelts.  That's probably your fastest solo moneymaker, on the order of several kpp per hour if you do it right.<br />
<br />
The EP capable guilds have players powerskilling their tradeskills up in order to finish quests and be included on rolls for specific tradeskill related drops (to make things like Bristlebane Party Platters).  Most of these players can farm cash or items very rapidly.  They don't care how much it costs (well, much :p ) to skill up, and they are paying insane prices for these mundane items that a level 10 player could farm in safety.  <br />
<br />
Summon dogdog, find an empty zone w/ these mobs and commence slaughtering. /pet attack 2 or 3 mobs in a row (he'll automatically go to the next mob you ordered him to when the first one is dead) and then kill some others with Blast of Venom, Shock of Venom, or group a few together and use Gale of Poison.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This isn't what you asked, but in case you didn't know, Replenishment is sold in the library in PoK.  Don't remember what it cost, but under 200pp, I'm pretty sure.  Definitely is worth having, and will make your farming a bit easier.  I believe it was the spell turn-in otter that sold it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gordonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Replenishment cost me 251pp,  with 176cha.<br />
Expensive - but worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">avoid droga like the plague.  i've had the zone all to myself about 50% of the time, and i enjoy it that way.  :)<br />
<br />
that being said, be sure to paste this into your c:\everquest\maps\droga_1.txt file (or wherever might be appropriate for your install).  makes farming much easier.   i have verified all of the spawns, the only one missing is &quot;a fierce drogan spider&quot; - he's somewhat south of the named Rock Sneak, though - just kill all the spider pops until he spawns.<br />
<br />
most of the people farming in there will take/camp 4 or 5 named at once, and just invis from named to named.  people tend to be rather polite and friendly, though actually finding a rez in the zone can be iffy at best. <br />

Wait a minute now, this isn't something thats in his inventory all the time is it? I would guess someone got it in a turn in and just sold it back. Otherwise I'd feel awfully stupid, I just paid some guy 4k for Replenishment in the bazaar.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doh, thRover you been stitched up...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hehe yup...replenishment is vendor bought...dont think its mystic abomin, but it was about 250pp. Expesive for vendor spell, but the extra 10 hp a tick is nice (I believe it's actually less mana than regrowth too). I'd get it ASAP, especially if you plan on soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">AFAIK it's sold from a druid spell vendor in the library</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, it's definitely vendor sold...  Just been a long time since I got it (right when PoP came out), so I don't remember who exactly.  If I get some time at lunch, I'll run around and see if I can find it again.</div></div><hr />
