Yeah 189 a tic is chump change to the 65's with 400 AA's, but that type of spell IS what some people have been clamoring for.<br />

yes bane (420 tick, 5 ticks, u/g to that one level 64) came in with lodn and is a very nice dot, fast high damage , we know this and it was a step in the right direction, however soe seem to have stoped with this type spell only and not move the idea to our other dots.<br />
<br />
mind even 30 sec lasting dots dont always run for full.</div></div><hr />

yes and the 24 sec recast time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Still, i do enjoy Bane.  It's great to stack when soloing without busting your root to heck.  Sure, it has a recast, but I'd rather have it with a recast than not have it at all.<br />
<br />
People on PVP servers have a much grimmer view of Bane though :(<br />
<br />
I like the 18 second duration idea though!  Probably the shortest we can get and still call it a DoT.<br />
<br />
To be honest with you, though, they could put a FANTASTIC 18 sec duration DoT in tomorrow, and a lot of people will still complain that they have no time to use it due to malo/slow.  I, for one, wouldn't, heck I'd be happy as a clown.  But that's the type of reaction I'd expect, which makes sense to some degree, as it carries a bit of truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Itd have to be 700+ a tick or mana would be better spent on longer dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The other kicker isn't the duration, it's the unnecessary agro.<br />
<br />
Compare the agro from a wizard critting a nuke for 4k+ and the first tick of any poison dot we drop.<br />
<br />
Not only are you slapped in the face by Sony, but they also kick you while you're down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Instead of short dots, why don't we ask for more rains.  Single target fire rain, 4 target poison, true AE disease:)<br />
<br />
3 tick dot for hordes of aggro OR 3 wave single target fire rain for like zero aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, according to the Shaman and Necro top 10 lists on EQ Live, dot aggro, dot usage in short duration fights, and rain resists are all being evaluated/discussed.  So, I imagine that we will see some improvements in one of the above to compensate for the problems with all three.  Just my guesstamet based on how SOE has addressed related issues in the past.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The DoT recast time for the LDoN curse DoTs is there to stem shaman solo ability. If the recast time was not there, root rotting would be much easier. Get three or four mobs. Root them. Bane on each. Anathema on each. Canni/heal up. Repeat. Although I haven't done it myself, imagine doomfire tables this way! That is what SOE wants to avoid. Whether that is a good idea or not is another matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly, the recast time is annoying but not a show stopper.  If they would only add a resist modifier and lower dot aggro in general, I'd be perfectly happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">holy cow, i just got a negative rep bump for what i posted 5 posts ago.  no offense to sunmoon, but she really needs to implement something where the person is required to sign their name and put down a reason.  else it's such a weak system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nah, good people will counter rep bump you :P<br />
<br />
Edit: Might as well throw in my two cents: they need to do 3 things to fix DoT spells:<br />
<br />
1) Increase damage. a spell that takes 30 seconds to work shouldn't do less damage than a wizard can blow off in 1 nuke instantly, for only 10% less efficency. Create parity in crit rate for quantity of AA spent. Remove recast time from curse lines.<br />
<br />
2) Remove all counter agro whatsoever, allow SCS to work on the actual tick damage. DoTs should actually have LESS agro than DDs, because they shouldn't be as noticible. a monster is going to notice himself decaying a lot less than he would notice that some robed fool just blasted his arm off.<br />
<br />
3) Resist Rates. Either allow partial resists on a per tick basis, or give DoTs a minimum of a -50 resist adjust. due to the general unusability of disease DoTs, they should be -100. Curses I could live with being -30 because they're higher DPS. Adjust necro DoTs to have an additional -20 of where ours are.. Basically, assuming a fire DoT and a fire nuke both check at the same resist modifier and do equal damage, over a continual parse they should come out even, but a DoT should have an innate mod due to inconvenience of time. Really all I'm looking for is parity between DoTs and nukes. I'm not asking to do wizard damage, but I'd like a necro to be about 80% of a wizard's conceivable DPS, and us to be the magician equivalent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Longer fights would remove the need for one of these three.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree griz<br />
<br />
<br />
If sony implemented that fix, reduced the cast time on our cold nuke to around 6 seconds, fixed ferine avatar, and put real combat effects on our 65+ buffs, I'd sign up for a year long account in a heartbeat.  Wouldn't have much to grumble about after that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thraxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What Grizlor said in SPADES!<br />
<br />
Dots are so out of line with DD's it's not even funny. <br />
<br />
Resists? Come on. If a DD is partially resisted it STILL does damage! The all or nothing approach in dots is gimped.<br />
<br />
And aggro? I had a wizzy dump 2 Ice Comets in PoJ on a mob while I had Envenomed Bolt running, the only thing I had cast so far on the mob, with my necro alt and I pulled aggro. 2400 instant damage vs halfway on EB and I get aggro? <br />
<br />
Damage vs mana vs time for DD's and Dots is seriously out of line, esp if you use a wizzy in the comparason.<br />
<br />
To bad Grizlor couldnt get that post sent right to dev team for implementation as is. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Unforunately, I don't think SOE is going to remove the recast timer from curse DoTs for the reason I mentioned earlier, Griz. I'd love it to be removed as much as the next shaman but I think the recast time is here to stay.<br />
<br />
I 100% agree with you from an agro stand point, too. The problem is that DoTs generate agro from each tick. If a tank has a bad round, we can be pushed to the top of the hate list. A nuke, by comparison, does a single hit of agro. Coupled with the fact that DoTers tend to DoT earlier in the fight to try to get maximum efficiency from their DoTs and shamans have no way of lowering themselves in the hate list, you have the source of the problem. I don't mind DoTs generating hate. If they didn't DoTing would not be a challenge and necros would lose some ability to agro kite. However, I do think our poison DoTs generate too much agro.<br />
<br />
I also have to agree with you on resists. After a Malos, shaman resist rates are still 30 to 40 points lower than comparable DoTs that necros or druids have (ignoring spells like Horror). I think a -20 or -30 to 60+ DoTs would not be out of place. That means, after a debuff, we're in the same ball park. <br />
<br />
If SOE claims that we don't need the increased resist debuffs, I'd put it to them to reduce the resist rates on necro and druid DoTs since the higher resist levels are &quot;not needed&quot;. If SOE's intention is to make shamans waste more mana with resists then I question why necros are not given the same treatment since their mana regen rates are similar to ours. <br />
<br />
The only rationale I can come up with is that, since shaman can slow their target, they have time to recast another DoT if it gets resisted whereas other classes don't. I don't think I need to point out the holes in logic of that statement. Maybe I just don't understand the reasons behind SOE's decision on this. Sudedor, I know that SOE have a policy of not explaining their design decisions but is there any information as to why this is the case? Please note that I want to *understand*, not rant, rave and complain.<br />
<br />
As for nukes outstripping DoTs in damage, I'm actually not too fussed with this as long as we are comparable to necros and better than druids. The class that is pulling ahead with nukes is the wizard. Other classes are no where near as bad. Ignoring crits, AAs and focii, a wizard's best nuke is 3288 damage for 768 mana (Ancient Strike of Chaos), compared to 1860 for 468 mana (Ancient Chaos Vortex) for a Magician and 1860 for 468 (Ancient Chaos Frost) for a Druid. Blood of Saryrn does (7 X 320 =) 2240 damage for 535 mana, still far outstripping the druid and magician ancient nukes in terms of damage and mana ratio.<br />
<br />
Personally, I feel wizards need a leg up in this area. Apart from porting, the only thing a wizard brings to a group is nukes. If another class can nuke almost as well as a wizard, why ever get a wizard when other classes bring more DPS (mages from pets) or healing (druid's heals)? Wizards are specialists, like clerics are at healing. Let them be specialists. If you still aren't convinced, have a look at the wizard class boards and see things from their point of view.</div></div><hr />

THIS Is what ticks me off about these spells. they bounce to damn much. Get sick of having to cast a malo line spell to just try and do some damage. Noone else i group with regular or my 2 or 3 box setup has this much trouble with magic bases spells landing. So frustrating to bounce and than not be able to recast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since we're going to be grammatically correct today, in this, there is a huge difference between &quot;won't&quot; and &quot;can't&quot;.  And in fact, here, neither is accurate.<br />
<br />
Can't implies that the ability does not exist to perform such a task.  As in, unable to do it.  Brenlo and I are both capable of performing the task.  He in fact is doing so and I am attempting to guide him in things that matter to the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
Won't implies a refusal to carry out the task.  In this case, something that is incorrect as neither Brenlo, nor myself, have refused to do this.<br />
<br />
Once again, your frustration seems to stem from a marked lack of information being returned from the Designers.  This is not something that Brenlo, or I, have any control over.  I don't think either of us is happy about it, though Brenlo must put the best face on it that he can, because it's his job . . . his chosen path to make a living.<br />
<br />
Earlier I was simply making the comment that all of the Correspondents would like to see improved communication from the Design side of the EQ Dev team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">yes at the end of the day i never critised brenlo for not getting changes made , though i sometimes think he could do more to get information, but then again the way soe seems to be brenlo just does not have enough power. or appartently his superior.<br />
<br />
but being the &quot;face&quot; we see, i can understand people venting there frustrations at him, even if it is more poeple like ryan and other devs that it really should be aimed at, but we cant do that so brenlo is the target and what he gets paid for apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sumdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I thought we were supposed to have a shaman representative, not another lackey. ::sigh::<br />
I don't have the slightest interest in what is or isn't in Brenlo's power, he was assigned a task, that task involves answering questions. Shaman representative is supposed to ask those questions... not become a fanboy.<br />
SoE definitely hired the right guy for the job, he is slowly diffusing a situation by getting people to &quot;like&quot; him. Well, I'm not diffused, I want concrete answers, it's been months. There are a lot of us that still want these answers. SoE will not get another dime from me until my concerns are addressed. You've as much as said that what you've been told is none of our business, I have to disagree. I wasn't even angry till I read your responses. You trying to get a real job at sony at our expense?</div></div><hr />

If that question has been answered, I'll be happy to locate that information for you.<br />
<br />
If the question has not been answered, all any of us can do is wait until it is.<br />
<br />
Am I happy about the speed with which things are addressed?  No, I'm not.  Can I do anything about that?  No, I can't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Sud, sorry you seem to be getting a crappy bounce here, but I do want to disagree with you on one thing.  Brenlo isn't doing his job, or to sum it up more effectively, he isn't doing the job a community relations manager is suppossed to do.  Granted, his responses might be &quot;restrained&quot; by the structure he's working in, but there are other ways of expressing yourself and communicating progress/lack there of that do work within all structures that are more successful than simply responding &quot;what is a shaman?&quot; or going mute everytime we ask what the hell is going on?  No offense, but the very existance of your volounteer position is proof of his lack of effectiveness.  No customer should be this frustrated with their service provider.  They are behaving like they are running a monopoly.  Hopefully, when WoW is released, many people here will see that and end billing.  I mostly enjoyed my time in Norrath (well ... up till the last 4-6 months before I ended billing anyway).  If SoE continues to use this model of CS and maintains the poor level of communication we see today, they will never see another dime from me.  Screw EQ2 if I can expect more of this (and screw them if they don't start listening to the clients in EQ BEFORE EQ2 goes to BETA).</div></div><hr />

This rampant posting of opinions without having a freakin' clue as to what's really going on is ludicrous and has been going on for years..  You people have no real clue what's going on, and presume to have it all figured out, then post these long, thought-out stupid posts stating &quot;your opinion&quot; (which has no *real* base whatsoever except what you read on a non-factual forum).<br />
<br />
GET A CLUE before you post your stupid theories and point fingers and blame people.  If it's gotten to a point where you feel like you must harbor a bit of hatred toward a freakin' game developer or PR man, you have others issues and need to get your priorities straightened out.  There are bigger and better things to worry 'bout in this world, let alone post stupid, uninformed sililoquies stating your uninformed opinions.<br />
<br />
You could say that 85% of workers in the economy &quot;dont do their jobs&quot;, which most likely includes yourself, so quit bein' hypocrites.  Quit throwin' around &quot;fanboy&quot; when someone doesn't agree with your uninformed, negative opinion.<br />
