<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically i'm always tight on cash and i need to know something about alpha dog please. <br />
<br />
1)Do we need to give him 1 or 2 weapons to activate duel wield? I've heard both and i'm not sure which is true. If one then the only reason to give him 2 is so that he can proc different things on each one, right? <br />
<br />
2)Also if i gave him 2 proc weapons such as gnoll hide lariats will he proc them more often or just the same as if he had 1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) 1 weapon<br />
2) more<br />
<br />
The main reason other than DW (im under the belief that he DW's even wihtout weapons, DWing his teeth) is the delay of the weapon. Damage wont change anything unless its insane. try to get weapons with delay below 20 :) Shiv is a common drop from Gunthak/Dulak &amp; is dly 19</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Irmm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry but the delay on weapons that are given to pets have no baering on how frequently your pet hits.  In the older days delay did matter but they nerfed that long time ago.  The delay is set in code and cannot be modified except for haste buffs.  The damage on weapons does matter though if you give you pet 5 damage it will hit double for that at times. I am not completely certain on Shaman pets but that is how it goes for Necro pets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You need to give them 2 weapons to activate DW. Otherwise he just replaces his biting with the slashing etc. <br />
<br />
And yes, 2 gnoll hide lariats means more proc'ing, but not twice as much.... because he doesnt always dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as I know he needs two weapons to DW.  Urdegish explained the proccing perfectly in the post above.  The damage and the delay of the weapon don't effect anything.  I actually turned on hits the other day and noticed the dog was hitting for 60 when he had 2 velium weapons with a damage of like 6 or 7.  Delay doesn't matter at all either.  He'll attack just as fast with a 100 delay weapon as he would with a 10 delay weapon.<br />
