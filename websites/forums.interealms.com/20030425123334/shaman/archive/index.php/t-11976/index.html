I believe there is a quest in PoS where you kill diaku raiders in the desert for 4 pieces of a talisman. Can't remember who starts it though.<br />
<br />
And it's actually the behemoth and not the dragon that flags you for Tactics<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You only have to kill the Behemoth to get flagged for Pota. The Behemoth is inside the factory. In order to open the factory door, you need to have killed the Mech Dragon. It only takes 1 person to open the factory door though.</div></div><hr />
