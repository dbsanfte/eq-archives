<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday while hang out in PoK getting ready to do MGB Focus at the bank a shaman started to offer buffs for donations, stating the reason that he had just started to do alchemy.  Now this in itself is fine.  Sometimes its nice to get paid for being a nice helpful person and get a little extra for the potion monster.  They were offering STR, DEX, SoW, and haste, so I did a /w all and saw that they were lvl 28.  I sent them  a tell just trying to be nice telling them that they would make more money, level, get to know the class better if they went out and got in a group.  The response I got was less then cordial.  Not only that but he was twinked to the max in gear he couldn't even take full advantage of.  SO he is either a twinked alt, twinked friend fo someone else, or whatever.  No reason to waste his time offering something that no one would pay for minus maybe the SoW.  Its just sad.  Now you ask why should we care...well later that night playing my druid I saw this same shaman shouting in Gfay begging for gear and money since he had his corpse rot.  I told him don't be a scammer, another rude response was what I got.  I headed over to Mistmoore to see this toon complete with all the gear I had seen before.  Well it gets better I hide with my druid in the corner and log on my cleric on my other pc.  Started to head that direction, sent him a direct tell offering him 2k if he still needed help.  he said yes thank you.  I watched him undress right in front of my druid.  I called him on it and he was like &quot;Fine be that way a-hole&quot;.  He ran off and I saw him later in a group in the GY fulley armored.  Some people are just jerks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For The Tribunal server, we have a community web page that includes, among other things, the POMS list.  That's &quot;Piece of Monkey S*** (poop)&quot;.<br />
<br />
All of our server special mentions--ninja looters, major scammers, trainers, and general asshats eventually get up there.  Sounds like this guy would be a prime candidate if he were on our server.  Do you guys have one of those?<br />
<br />
(I'd guess the majority of the people on our list ebay or leave the server eventually--hard to get a guild when people know what kind of ass they really are!)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">People who scam like this are just plain lame. If I have time, I will sit and chat with a person who is begging me for stuff. Its fairly easy to determine if they are scamming, most 14-16 year old snot-nosed l33t hAX0rs cant lie that well under scrutiny (note, this is not a slam on teenage EQ players, I know a ton and most are cool. Its just I think the LARGE majority of this type of behavior falls into the stereotype I mentioned). <br />
<br />
There have been many I gave things too. One guy I ended up PLing at the spiders in EK for half an hour, explaining tactics, and play techniques, and explaining how even a level 1 can make a fortune as they play if they choose their kill spots. To this day, he is grateful and sends me tells all the time, linking cool stuff he got, or telling me what neat mob he killed. He was a young lad, a true n00bie, and I still give him stuff and advice, and enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also I really like that SOE has the named change list available.  What strikes me as odd is that someone, more then likely an adult, would do this in a game.  Kinda explains the problems we have IRL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I actually enjoy true &quot;n00bs&quot; for the same reasons Blazz mentioned.  I see no reason not to help someone learn how to play the game, give them some vendor fodder gear, and get them a few lvls.  Our junk is like a treasure to them.  I once gave a new ogre warrior a full suit of large bronze armor back in the day and he followed me around and linked me things for a long long time.  Makes you feel good to help, then a-hole here makes it harder for those true new playeers to get a bit of help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use paragraphs, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same here.  I love helping true newcomers to the game.  I've ended up spending whole days with newcomers, and gone out to gather up good newbie weapons or ran down to the forge to smith up some banded mail, and have helped put some levels on them or even logged low-level alts to play with them.<br />
<br />
Not only does it make their EQ experience more wonderful, sometimes it can help YOU down the road.  One of those people I helped long ago is now a 65 cleric, who will, if she's not busy, come rez me if I need it, and is always willing to trade buffs with me.  ;)<br />
<br />
I've always seen it as karma.  Help others, and enjoy doing it, and you will be rewarded down the line in some way or another.  I also believe jerks like this guy we're talking about will have karma come back and bite him in the ass later on.  Don't hate him too much, for karma can be very mean.  It's just a matter of time before he gets his.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Pretty impressive since we don't get haste until level 29 =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One day out of the blue a 47 shaman sent me a tell. He was asking if the rumors were true that shaman are useless in the high end game, and we had some nice discussion. He ended up not quitting and is now 65 and in an active raiding guild. I give him things I have in the bank or things I pick up while soloing. Its a good idea to talk to the people that ask you questions, you can make a friend and help someone out. 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pretty impressive since we don't get haste until level 29 =)<br />
My point exactly lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's a great idea, Chutoi.  Every server should have a POMS section on their community board.<br />
<br />
Bludletters -- I think it's hilarious how when people get caught, they get angry at YOU like YOU did something wrong.  LOL.  Dead common with scammers and jerks and other criminal types.<br />
<br />
Can't imagine what it would be like to be in prison, where most everyone around you operated completely according to the level of understanding of a grade-school level punk.  I  think it would be like living in an insane asylum, and it would be saner in a monkey house.  The biggest monkey would still win, but I think a gorilla would be smarter and much less interested in ... certain things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah would never hate someone about any game.  I found it more humerous and annoying then anything else.</div></div><hr />

I think they do on Xevserver.com but its just a /rant section.  It is FULL of posts about this kind of thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Next time someone says they lost their stuff when they died offer to go get their body for them.  If they really lost it they will be grateful for the help.  If they are a scammer they won't have a body to get.<br />
<br />
If they try the &quot;It already rotted&quot; line explain to them about Shadowrest.  If they thank you and go looking for the port NPC they were probably honest.<br />
<br />
I can't believe anyone still tries that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I also cancel trades for donations when I buff people.  I just don't feel right accepting money for buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can actually remember when one of my corpses rotted. It was on my first char, a level 10 warrior (then level 7) back in 2001. I managed to scrounge up enough money to buy a Bronze Helm (23pp I think it was, a BIG sum for a level 7 warrior), I looked like a complete fool with all banded and a big ornage hlem but I didn't care!<br />
<br />
Well later that day a snake that I underestimated managed to kill me as I was running back into EC tunnel and I didn't log in for over 24 hrs. Unfortunately back then you couldn't con corpses to find rot timers, and I didn't find out until it was too late tha corpses below level 10 rotted in 24 hrs :(.<br />
<br />
And about giving thinks to true newbies, I went to Gfay a couple of months ago and I thought I knew my way around (previous main was a lowish level druid) but I didn't. I ooced for someone to show me the bank and a level 2 druid came to assist me, They took me to the bank and left poiltely, without asking for a donation or anything. Well I telled them to com back and kitted them out in some stuff I had in the bank, including a 2hb from PoI I think (Driveshaft or something similar).<br />
<br />
 I asked her a few weeks ago if she still used it and she told me she did and that she and her husband had manged to scrounge enough money to buy another for him. At this point she was about level 50 :). Shows how little things can affect someone hugely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I periodically return to Everfrost to buff and heal n00bies. Rarely a Shaman (Mostly BL's and the occasional Zerker) to be found.  And often they have a Druid / Cleric in tow to expedite the process. Even better their gear is about as good or better than mine.<br />
<br />
Ahh well, there's always the Tribute master.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For those who run around PoK begging for things I have 1 response.<br />
<br />
/ooc Begging is a skill best practiced on NPCs, not PCs.<br />
<br />
If I am running through a low level area EF, Gfay, or where ever and see some one out there actually working on leveling. I will stop and buff them up, and often do it from a distance so they don't notice me. If I have vendor trash on me I will give them things they can use. One of my favorite things to do used to be selling FS weapons while camping IGs. I would sell them for 2pp each. Had one guy who started buying them from me and selling them to vendors, pretty soon he was buying the gold silver and copper I was getting from the giants as well as the FS. It was great having a banker that came to me, and seeing the gear he was getting to upgrade himself with the money he made banking me.</div></div><hr />

I know, don't you just hate it?  I remember ages ago when I used to run back through Halas and hit newbies with Altuna and crazy stat buffage (which was actually effective back then... or at least, nobody had done extensive parsing on their effects yet), along with haste and regen.  <br />
<br />
Nowadays, when I go to Halas, I see one, maybe two barbarian low levels, rarely shaman, and almost always with a 65 druid/cleric/enchanter etc in tow (as ya mentioned).  They've always been way too well equipped too, I never grew up with advantages like that, and I just sigh when I lament the loss of the true newbie who fights wearing the bronze sword and leather armor they looted off monsters they killed with their own hands.</div></div><hr />

I remember when I first started playing.  I was auctioning in the zone to buy a weapon with my 50pp (took me ages to get) and a druid stopped and sold me a weapon that must have been worth 20 times as much as I had.  <br />
<br />
That one gesture helped me out so much.  I had crap for gear but I was able to kill enemies twice as fast with my new pig sticker.<br />
<br />
Now, when I see true non-begging noobs (rare as heck) I hand them items or some spare plat, and tell them all they have to do in return, is one day return the favor to someone else in need.<br />
<br />
It's funny how experiences like that stick to your memory.  I can remember that incident but then I forget my own mother's birthday (yes, I am going to hell =( ).</div></div><hr />

I'm  a Shaman...not an enchanter!  I love that.  I'm going to use that.</div></div><hr />

LOL that's exactly what I tell them...in say....and with the additional &quot;or a druid&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is one of two people I will help out.<br />
<br />
I never turn off ooc, shout, or auc and if I see someone trying to buy weapons armor or stuff like that I will sometimes check them out and see if they are real or not! 9 times out of 10 I usually have better stuff that I throw on my doggie so I give it to them and hope it helps out!<br />
<br />
The other would be some player that is obviously a new player. No equipment, no buffs, not asking for help but getting their butt kicked kind of person! I like to hold onto stuff so once again if I can and am not grumpy I help out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well I'm not half the newbie I used to be, but I remember running around Everfrost in my newbie tunic.  Some kind soul saw me, and gave me a banded, or something, chest piece.  I was so excited!  But newbie me put the armor in my inventory, not on my chest slot.  It stayed for a few levels before I finally figured it out.<br />
And then one time, some guy gave me a cracked staff.  I thanked him kindly, but I was like &quot;***?  I don't want no stinking cracked stick&quot; and when he was out of sight, I dropped the cracked staff on the ground.  Little did I know.  Not that I'm a fountain of knowledge now.</div></div><hr />
