<br />
An old man was laying on his death bed.<br />
He had only hours to live when he suddenly<br />
smelled chocolate chip cookies.<br />
<br />
He loved chocolate chip cookies more than<br />
anything else in the world.<br />
<br />
With his last bit of energy, he pulled himself<br />
out of bed, across the floor, and to the stairs.<br />
Then down the stairs and into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
There his wife was baking chocolate chip cookies.<br />
As he reached for one, he got SMACKED across the<br />
back of his hand by the wooden spoon his wife was<br />
holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave them alone!&quot; she said, &quot;They're for the funeral!&quot;</div></div><hr />
