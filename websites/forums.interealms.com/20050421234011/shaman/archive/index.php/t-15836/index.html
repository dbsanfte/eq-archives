<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, in the last few days since i've returned I have powered from 44-50 in 3 or 4 days.  I now findmyself wondering where to get a group or solo for the best possible experience.  Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I've been having a similar problem, mobs seem to either be too high or too low either but mostly during soloing.  In groups, it gets a bit easier.  When I'm hard pressed to get a guild group, I usually run down to KC and try a pick up group there.  You've got several options in KC. You can camp the zone line, you can camp at the moat, you can camp the 2nd floor, you can camp the back courtyards, or you can get into a VS group.  There are probably even more choices than that.  I've seen 56 shammys here in groups as well as lvl 60+ characters especially Paladins.  <br />
<br />
If you have not gotten your CANNI II spell components yet, then try to get a group and kill the skeletal warrior while your here to get that no drop component.  <br />
<br />
Some will argue that there are better zones to hunt in such as VL, or the crystal caverns.  <br />
<br />
This is just one suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dulak, perfect for the soloing shaman from 50-55. Get in there, try out the mobs in the courtyard to get the hang of their pathing, hitting, etc. <br />
<br />
When comfortable move to Stormwave. You can easily solo that boat at 50. When that lb's or becomes too easy, move to Dirulia, then Dandolak. You should be able to have fun there until the high 50's.</div></div><hr />

I've heard that Dulak's was a very good place to go.  I'm going to have to try getting there again.  last time I tried i didnt make it.  Invis just doesn't seem to last when I cast it.  So I run through the long cave trying to get to Dulak, but appeared at the worst possible time.  Wound up running with a big train till I was forced to gate.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol. If no ones hunting the bad side of Gunthak i purposely don't invis runnig through the caves to Dulak. Hell of a laugh watching a train of 70 or so behind you ). <br />
<br />
FYI keep levi up running through caves, you get through much faster.</div></div><hr />

Went back through with a 54 BM friend.  But this time we went to Nadox.  Great spot.  Killed all the elementals then ran/swam through lava to the bridge.  worked the mobs there for real good exp.  Group of 3 would be better as some mobs (that damn pig) conned red/yellow at 54. If you can get a group of 3 and camp the rocks by the fire your going to get good exp.  Kinda of a pain to get there, but nice exp. Weapons that drop are not worth a whole lot, but some armor drops that's good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cebilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The best place I found when I was 52 was to duo with a melee (pally works best, also SK is handy too) in the 1st area of undead in Veksar - where the phantom/champion spawn is - the corner of the corridoor before the champions room is a safe spot with no roamers - there are 5 mobs in 'cells' in that area that are single pulls. The trick is to get them slowed, send in pet, and chloro/stoicism the tank for heals.<br />
<br />
This area is still blue to me at 59. Be aware that the mobs DO summon, and the crusaders/phantom HT for a fair amount, plus the crusaders fear, so MR buff both of yourselves.</div></div><hr />
