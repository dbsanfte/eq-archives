<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now, I am a HUGE fan of mix and match classes and I think that it is a waste of time to always try to  find the &quot;perfect&quot; group.  So, take this as a purely intellectual discussion.<br />
<br />
I would choose<br />
<br />
1) shaman (lol)<br />
2) Paladin<br />
3) Ranger<br />
4) just about a tie between Necro/Chanter/Bard<br />
<br />
Necro for undead places<br />
Chanter when they can DC or if they have pet control aa<br />
Bard for the rest<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
PS: 1) High aa shaman heal just fine, btw<br />
      2) I think well played necro's are very underrated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have not tested LDoN, but Shaman, Rogue, Rogue Rogue groups are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My regular 4 man group is shaman, SK, monk, rogue.   We are confident we'll do well at most of them, but are thinking to add in a ranger/bard for tracking and some form of backup healing, preferably pally or BL I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My 4man groups consisted of Cleric, Warrior, Ench, Wizard (me) we always finished in at least half the timer still remaining (all beta buff [worse gear than we were used to  :p], minus the warrior).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pally, BL, BL, Druid. <br />

or<br />
<br />
BL, BL, BL, Cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When we made a twinks group the decision was SK, BST, CLR, Chanter (and an occasional bard). It's worked pretty well, considering we've done virtually 100% of our levelling in dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well cat really say as I have not ever played LDoN yet.  Though from my playing I'ld go the route of.<br />
<br />
1) Shaman<br />
2) Shadow Knight/Paliden<br />
3) Mage<br />
4) Necro<br />
<br />
Kinda toss up between the Sk and pally.  Pallies have Rez/Heal/LoH.  Sk have FD/HT/Snare.<br />
<br />
Mage has pet toys that just do nasty things to mobs.  Necros have nasty pets added emergency mana reserve and stack really well with our regen heal spells.  Pets I like to think of as nice disposeable meele when things go bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) Warrior<br />
2) Cleric <br />

4) &gt;accepting applications&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No. I expect LDoN to confirm the fact that paladins and SK's are the preferred tanks (by a massive amount). I must admit I groan every time there's a warrior tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mage x3, shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bah this the shaman board.  Go shaman!<br />
<br />
1. Shaman<br />
2. Shaman<br />
3. SK<br />
4. Bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">(1) Paladin: aggro on demand.<br />
(2) Cleric: Duh!<br />
(3) Bard: CC, Fade pulling, Highsun if needed, okay DPS.<br />
(4) Rogue: Traps, chests, superb DPS, SoS scouting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman, Druid, SK, Mage.</div></div><hr />

pretty decent dps, 2 CC'ers, and a healer. Pretty good dungeon crawlin group imo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LDoN is all going to be about DPS and speed.  How fast you can kill stuff is going to be very important.<br />
<br />
That said, I think the best 4 person group would be<br />
1)SK/Paladin (I think SK has better DPS but pally reduces downtimes with heals)<br />
2)cleric<br />
3)Enchanter<br />
4)Rogue/wizard<br />
<br />
Shaman would be nice for this group, but all we bring is a slightly better slow, some healing, and a few stat buffs.  You could sit outside the zones and buff groups going in and make some money like Enchanters do with KEI.<br />
<br />
Of course, most groups will have 6 members, so Im sure a shaman will get in there somewhere.<br />
<br />
1)SK/Pally<br />
2)cleric<br />
3)Enchanter<br />
4)rogue<br />
5)wizard<br />
6)shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yikes, I just heard that you keep all your buffs when you start an instance.  That changes everything!  My theoretical group of 4 was self reliant w/o outside buffs.<br />
<br />
Well since this is the case I think that lessens the demand for enchanters, clerics and shaman since crack, virtue &amp; (f07,boar) can be had outside a group.  It also lessens the demand for necros since they are so self reliant without crack.  I'm not saying that any of these 4 classes are screwed in LDON, just not as important as they would be if the buffs were stripped.<br />
<br />
It certainly improves mages &amp; wizzys since they are so much better with crack.<br />
<br />
I suppose it all makes sense, but I was looking forward to working within the limitations of the group makeup for a greater challenge.  Oh well, more PP for the crackhead dealers and virtue venders.  Maybe a little something for the shaman also assuming you need the cash and like being a buffer.<br />

<br />
PS: And if speed is key as the above poster indicates - throw out the cleric and insert a high aa Shaman.  I can't believe that a cleric can heal and dps as well as I can.  I would be very surprised if it was even close.  The only x factor being rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Started a group yesterday on beta. 65 group on normal. Tank (Pally) couldn't get onto dungeon because he didn't have files loaded correctly (common problem on beta) so we forged ahead with Ranger tanking. Cleric went ld and never came back withing 10 minutes of starting adventure (another common problem). So we finished with Shaman (me), Chanter, Ranger, Rogue. I did all the slowing and healing. Chanter cc and nuke, Ranger pulled and tanked, and Rogue did what Rogues do.<br />
<br />
Finished with time to spare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1) cleric - chanter - bard - wizard/mage<br />
2) druid - BL (65 with slow) - Rog (SoS enabled) - Paladin<br />
3) cleric (pref battle cleric) - BL - Rog - SK.<br />
<br />
Shaman are almost a handicap in LDoN from what I saw.  Frequently shaman prolonged the wipes (I was still fighting the last couple mobs from a bad overpull in one scenario when the rest of the party returned from the CR.) but we don't kill fast enough.  Off rooting and rotting adds helps group survivability, but a good AE group or solid DPS group will easily make shaman almost a hinderance.<br />
<br />
When I played a BL and we went without a shaman we did very well even though I was just learning the BL class and likely made a few mistakes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm not sure how effective we'll be..but this is the most likely scenario for a typical LDoN group for me.<br />
<br />
1) Me (61 shaman with Cann 5)<br />
2) 65 Necro<br />
3) 62 Druid<br />
4) Whoever else happens to be around<br />
<br />
The necro and I work well together, handling pulls that I've seen full groups wipe on (Coordination is King!) and if you add in the druid for healing and additional DPS we really rock.<br />
<br />
Hopefully our skills with dungeon sprinting will prove useful..since crawling isn't an option with the time limits.</div></div><hr />
