<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.  I'm trying to turn in a few d0rf heads to Captain Bvellos and he is never up.  Apparently some jerks thought he was a good spot for exp.  :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm a little confused.  Does he have a true placeholder that has to be killed, or is he on a timed spawn--ie a watch shift or something.<br />
<br />
One side note . . . 44 d0rf heads take up a LOT of room in the ol' inventory.  :p<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The captain is part of the Bank in Kael camp.  Just let the people camping there know you need to turn in heads and they shoudl be cool about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, luna.  I know where he spawns.  However he is never up.  I was trying to see if anyone had any information on his spawns--mostly, do I have to kill his PH, or do I wait 45 minutes or more for him to respawn as a change of 'watch' or something.<br />
<br />
I was unsure if I have to camp his PH to get him to spawn.  Obviously, I don't want the faction hits from killing the PH if I can swing it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He does have a PH, but killing it is a bad idea. He is a timed spawn. When you kill him, his PH spawns and will stay up for a set time (something like 8 hours or more), and then despawn and Captain Bvellos will spawn. The PH is a kromzek with a generic name like &quot;A Storm Giant Commander&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
This is the same way Dlammaz Stormslayer spawn works. His PH is named &quot;A Storm Giant Warlord&quot;, and I believe the kromrif in the noble house in Kael work the same, too. Verant did this to encourage a one time clearing of camps, instead of camping the same spot for hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, thats damn annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bvellos' PH is &quot;Kael Militia Captain&quot;. You can kill captain and next spawn cycle Bvellos might spawn. Not sure if Bvellos will spawn if KMC is never killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kyyzshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Couple things on the Bvellos PH.  You can kill him to try and get him to spawn if it is the PH.  He will respawn on his own from PH to Bvellos, and it is not timed by when the PH spawned.  I have killed him, went to pull him as he respawned as the PH.  Group got an add from elsewhere so didn't pull him.  Came back right after that giant died and he was Bvellos instead of the PH.<br />
<br />
DLammaz will do this as well as the nobles that drop the blood and the SoM dropping guy in arena.  It is possible that they will despawn respawn as named at a certain time EQ time and then never despawn/respawn as PH until killed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Now that Bvellos can't Dispell slows every second if he has that Black Sword, he's become quite the target for small groups.<br />
<br />
I remember the days of MR based Slows when Bvellos would chew through a &quot;raid&quot; party of level 45 toons :)<br />
<br />
I always wondered what would happen if you handed that Sword to Tormax :)<br />

- Nothing, NPCs only accept quest items now. Giving a non quest item to it, he will return it.</div></div><hr />

Or, worse, Cazic Thule, as has been reported in the past, with that offhand haste sword (forgot name) which comes out of velious as well.<br />
<br />
That was quite the riot :D</div></div><hr />
