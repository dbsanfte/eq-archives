<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did 57-59 in katta at Nathan Illumynous's house.  You only become kos to nathan Illumynous faction(him and his guards I think are it) and you get positive faction with some seru and the katta guards.  Best place by far for me at the time.  I was getting a blue and half to 2 blues per hour there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did Laggedpine, see the other thread for details.<br />
<br />
It's not bad, although a bit camped. So is Katta, too, by the way.<br />
<br />
I will probably switch to doing Neths guards at 59, provided they are still good xp, as I think the xp is still decent in Laggedpine for 58. But getting lots of lb's.</div></div><hr />

any strat advice ?  this sounds like what im lookign for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Katta is fine for dis level.  nice thread on it on this forum, too.<br />
<br />
strategy is pretty straight-forward, as ther should be very few pulls of two, and a pull of three is from carelessnes, most places.<br />
<br />
If faction is an issue (never figured out why it woul be, but Barbs talk about it a lot) do the Nathyn guards, near the zone to TM.  They came single for me at 56, and I killed them behind the house, just to eliminate the possibly of roamers adding.  I did get 2 on a pull whenever I pullled the guards inside - Sentinel Toxulla (?) would come as well - no  a problem, though.  Oh, afte doing the 4 guards outside, when ya go inside, pull the guard to your left - if you slow the guard to the right, you may get 3, rather than 2 (if at good mana and hp, very doable, but doggie will almost cetanly die. this is where epic really shines, when ya got one or two cooking to the side while you pound through the first one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm in a similar boat, almost lvl 57, have all my 57 spells in bank but still no epic.  Was thinking about either Jagged or Katta to get some exp.  I might try Jagged tonight unless the guild drags me along to who-knows-what and I'll post my results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I pulled the two wolf guards, the two guards out front, and the two inside on a normal basis.  The wolf guards take a bit longer to spawn I think, but they are fairly quick.  If you can kill those and still looking for more, then stand next to the fake wall on the right(inside the house) and you should aggro one of the private guards.  These are a bit toughest but still go down.  I pull with slow, sick the dog, bon, then jbb till dead.  I didnt' have my epic at the time either so should be pretty much the same.  I just pulled them strait away from the house(the reg katta guards do not assist).  All will be dark blue until 59 where some guards are lt blue(wolf guards are still dark blue though).  At 60 they are still decent to kill, but I have moved on to other spots.</div></div><hr />
